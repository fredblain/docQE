<seg id="1">On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care</seg>
<seg id="2">Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical care in remote villages in Cameroon</seg>
<seg id="3">Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend to treat hundreds of patients</seg>
<seg id="4">There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one in 5,000 people</seg>
<seg id="5">Vote here or with your mobile device from</seg>
<seg id="6">Dr. Georges Bwelle "is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013."</seg>
<seg id="7">You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the Top 10, in order to elect him to "CNN Hero of the Year".</seg>
<seg id="8">The winner receives $250,000 to continue his exceptional work.</seg>
<seg id="9">For 21 years looked at Georges Bwelle with, as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals, which do not have the means at their disposal to help him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.</seg>
<seg id="11">First he had a broken arm, but then formed an inflammation, which is expanding on his brain and caused a Hämatom there that should affect him for the rest of his life.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There was no neuro-surgeon in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="13">If we had the money, we would have released him from Cameroon.</seg>
<seg id="14">Instead spent Bwelle years in order to accompany his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, in order to get the treatment, which they had to offer.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It is not easy," Bwelle commented.</seg>
<seg id="16">You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and it is not first.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are a great many patients.</seg>
<seg id="18">Indeed, some people die because they have to wait.</seg>
<seg id="19">The situation has changed little since Bwelles's father died in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="20">There is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, the ratio in the United States lies with a doctor for 413 people.</seg>
<seg id="22">But even if there were a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford the visit.</seg>
<seg id="23">Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country are private.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The only problem they have is the poverty," says Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="25">And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father and to see so many of his compatriots are suffering caused in Bwelle mature the decision to do something about it.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dr. Georges Bwelle and his voluntary team have carried out 700 free operations last year.</seg>
<seg id="28">He was himself a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.</seg>
<seg id="29">In addition, he founded a non-profit organization called ASCO Vime who travels on weekends in rural areas and offering free medical care there.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost every Friday force he and up to 30 people in minibuses and drive with the verschnürten medical equipment on the roof on unbefestigtes terrain in the villages that need help.</seg>
<seg id="32">Not always, everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="33">More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.</seg>
<seg id="34">But when they arrive, they will be greeted as heroes: A feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.</seg>
<seg id="35">Free medical care is really a cause for celebration in these villages and Bwelle, with his broad smile and his boundless energy, is to present at the joyful celebration.</seg>
<seg id="36">The next morning the team then begins with the investigation of hundreds of patients.</seg>
<seg id="37">"We treat 500 people per trip," so Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="38">They come from a 60-kilometre radius around the village on foot.</seg>
<seg id="39">Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="41">Other given crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates, a document that is required for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the evening, leads the team from simple operations with local anaesthetic.</seg>
<seg id="43">The operations are usually held in a school, the town hall or a flat; after the procedure, the patient on and go in the recreation area, in order to make room for the next person.</seg>
<seg id="44">The lighting for the op and disinfection equipment is powered by a generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteer work until the early hours on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="45">It is an arduous amount, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"They drum throughout the night, so that we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="47">On Sunday, the team then back in the city, tired but proud of the work he has done.</seg>
<seg id="48">The group - a mixture of Cameroon doctors and medical students abroad - has 700 free operations last year and know that it makes a huge difference for people with their work, which helps them.</seg>
<seg id="49">A man explained that the free operation of a side RAEC Mons, which he received, he will now have to work again.</seg>
<seg id="50">"It changed the future of my family," the man said.</seg>
<seg id="51">In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital works Bwelle even at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.</seg>
<seg id="52">With this second job by 60% of his charitable activity, so Bwelle; the rest come from private donations.</seg>
<seg id="53">"I really do not know when he sleeps," Katie O'Malley says that in the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily in Bwelles group participates.</seg>
<seg id="54">He is always either in the hospital or tried to raise money for the organization, so that he can go to these campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="55">As O'Malley for medical and nursing students who come from the United States and Europe and Bwelle support, this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.</seg>
<seg id="56">"We can be in operations, where we help keep blood abzutupfen or the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley said.</seg>
<seg id="57">That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.</seg>
<seg id="58">The students pay their trip to Cameroon normally itself and bring often donated medical equipment.</seg>
<seg id="59">They are, however, only once in Yaoundé, Bwelle assumes the accommodation, transportation and guide.</seg>
<seg id="60">"He is without a doubt a hero," says O'Malley.</seg>
<seg id="61">He devotes his life of this organisation and his desire to help the people in Cameroon, knows no bounds.</seg>
<seg id="62">The almost constant work is no burden for Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="63">To help others to a more fortunate life and to fulfill a promise that he has given his father, gives him great pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="64">"I am so happy when I make this work," says Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="65">And I am thinking of my father.</seg>
<seg id="66">I hope he sees what I do.</seg>
<seg id="67">I do it, in order to bring people back to the laughter and to relieve the pain.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pope Francis appoints in February first Cardinals</seg>
<seg id="2">Pope Francis will rely on February 22 new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time as the Vatican announced on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Cardinals are the senior clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also to elect a pope, Francis is to appoint the first group of men who will participate in the election of his successor at the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="4">Currently, there are 201 cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a cardinal, who has reached the age of 80 years, can no longer take part in the papal election - that falls to a group of 120 "electorate" cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a statement, in which the news was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman said, there will be a meeting of cardinals, before the ceremony will be held on the appointment of the new cardinals, which is also known as a consistory.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision on the convening of the by last February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of the cardinals from around the world can be planned," Lombardi said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinals eligible voters will probably be dropped until February.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that a pope appointing normally so many Cardinals as necessary, so that the number of voters scared again 120 amount, and so many cardinals over 80, as he would like.</seg>
<seg id="10">The consistory next year is so important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, as Valero.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the moment there is some overhang on the part of Europe, and in particular in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world in order to restore the balance," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Forty percent of Catholics living in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council founded by Francis of the Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the task to find ways to reform the church.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the past the Pope decided everything alone.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now Francis has selected the eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that it was "quite possible" that Francis the Cardinals ask for advice.</seg>
<seg id="18">But so far, we were not in this situation - this is all very new.</seg>
<seg id="19">Valero said that typically the bishops from great places to cardinals appointed would, however, route Francis "full of surprises - we know that is not who he appoints."</seg>

<seg id="1">Europe's elite is ready to do business with the United Kingdom?</seg>
<seg id="2">Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and to define what those who care for prosperity and work in the United Kingdom, to want to change our relationship with the EU.</seg>
<seg id="3">To this end, we have the largest and most comprehensive survey commissioned by British business leaders and asked them what they think about the United Kingdom, the economy and the EU.</seg>
<seg id="4">YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, some of which depict the British company sizes, sectors and regions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The results of the survey will surprise many.</seg>
<seg id="6">We have found that the vast majority of businesses now exported outside Europe and focused on countries to modernise and grow, while the states in the EU are stagnant.</seg>
<seg id="7">They wish that new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil are favoured by government regulators, rather than to deal with the long and exhausting process, the obscure to reform EU institutions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Asked for their view on certain legal issues - from the antitrust law to the product legislation - the majority of business leaders is of the opinion that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was widespread dissatisfaction about the internal market, according to the company, because the cost of Brussels regulations now would outweigh the benefits to be part of Europe's trade zone - even 40 percent of large companies agreed to, which are traditionally the most pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, and this is probably the most, showed a survey of business leaders that a clear majority of Britain wants a course in the direction of the change of the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.</seg>
<seg id="11">This realization that finds itself in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is on a "meaningful change" that brings the driver's seat of the world economy back to Britain.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is about a lot - a change of the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of view in favour of the participation in the EU in a referendum at 16 percent.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Prime Minister should have no doubt: This survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for the renegotiation of the UK conditions for EU membership.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also shows that the companies expect a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain.</seg>
<seg id="15">A better deal for the British economy is possible and necessary to an increasing extent after the eurozone is now moving in the direction of a closer economic and fiscal union.</seg>
<seg id="16">The priority should be jobs and growth in Britain, as the results of our survey shows, which means an increased emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach for rules for companies.</seg>

<seg id="2">"We are in a frightening situation and one must wonder: What is preventing Parliament from tomorrow simply to abolish the judicial independence?," was to read in the newspaper that keeps the bill for not under the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The law is draconian and very punitively and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, including CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said that the new media tribunal "will always be prejudiced, because it is an extension of the government," and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I hope the president is listening to us and we call on him to reject this bill and send it back to the House," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the newspaper The Star note the government effectively through the new law "the media writes in a stranglehold." On the other hand, The Standard, democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had suffered "a severe blow" and titled the draft as "draconian."</seg>
<seg id="7">The adoption of the law is one of a series of measures that national security should be strengthened following the attacks by armed Islamists on the West Gate mall in September.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Kenyan media drew the wrath of the authorities in itself, because it was published photographs of security cameras on which to see, like the units posted at the crime scene, supposedly the luxurious shopping mall ausraubten.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police chief David Kimaiyo responded with the Einbestellung interrogations of two journalists and a leading media representative, even if the subpoena was withdrawn after an outcry in the media.</seg>
<seg id="10">Under the new law, media houses can be subject to a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to a million, as well as the additional risk of losing their professional recognition or be excluded from an official press accreditation.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those affected, if a fine is not paid.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the Daily Nation, "a single penalty push for most radio stations in the bankruptcy."</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, the newspaper is of the view that these measures could have a devastating impact on their description to "lively blogosphere" in Kenya.</seg>
<seg id="14">If they were to silence the media, politicians with impunity could do whatever they want.</seg>
<seg id="15">"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation, of the Kenyan media described as a crucial factor in public life.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Leaves you politicians themselves, they lead the country into bankruptcy and us back to the time of hunters and gatherers," he commented.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gutach: More safety for pedestrians</seg>
<seg id="2">They are not 100 meters apart: On Tuesday has been commissioned the new B 33-pedestrian traffic light at the village car park in Gutach - within sight of the older town hall lights.</seg>
<seg id="3">Two plants so close together: Intention or shield citizens string?</seg>
<seg id="4">This question has clearly answered Gutachs Mayor yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The town hall traffic light has been installed at the time that the school guarantees," explained Eckert yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kluser-traffic lights secure both cyclists as well as been underlined here many times and the Bergle residents.</seg>
<seg id="7">The plant used yesterday officially in operation is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg / church street.</seg>
<seg id="8">We have the museum, two churches, park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank, and the traffic flow from the residential area › grub. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"Had to come up with the high traffic and foot paths to their safety in another traffic lights," Eckert.</seg>
<seg id="10">It also confirms Peter Arnold from the local Health Authority Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="11">"According to current measurements pass on the B 33 daily about 12 000 vehicles the municipality of Gutach, of which about 10 percent are heavy traffic," said Arnold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Safety is just before," says Arnold.</seg>
<seg id="13">As a whole had been carried out four road shows, also a roundabout was considered, but discarded because of the tightness in the intersection area Sulzbachweg / church street.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was, according to Arnold in the siting of the traffic light poles before all tested: "By means of an extra for us with a particularly long wooden trunks loaded we have equipped van te Tet, whether these vehicles can exit from the Sulzbachweg onto B 33, without the traffic light poles umzuknicken."</seg>
<seg id="15">The approximately 15 000 euros expensive traffic light system itself is the "state-of-the-art, which there are currently on the market," explained Arnold.</seg>
<seg id="16">The plant is equipped with coloured LEDs, which shine so strong that the lights of the car drivers, for example, are also good for deep-outsider sun.</seg>
<seg id="17">And economically, it is also light: The older plants consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.</seg>
<seg id="18">There are three light installations in each direction.</seg>
<seg id="19">Arnold said the technique of the new plant: This is equipped with two radar sensors.</seg>
<seg id="20">The pedestrian expresses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.</seg>
<seg id="21">The road is free, immediate green for pedestrians, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrians can be brought to an end.</seg>
<seg id="23">"If a group or handicapped people on the streets, the green phase will be extended, so it is everyone safe on the road," said Arnold.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of course, the car drivers here as a partner must think ahead and watch the road.</seg>
<seg id="25">This was not the case yesterday: Hardly showed the green light for pedestrians, out ahead of an upper-class vehicle - in bright red.</seg>

<seg id="6">In years of talks, which began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tenant were against it and also wanted longer maturities.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2009, the leases were extended at circular Quay, which gave the Obeids $2.5 million per year, without a public tender for the company.</seg>

<seg id="1">NSA revelations strengthen corporate paranoia about government surveillance</seg>
<seg id="2">On a mild day at the end of August a German police helicopter flew low over the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the instructions of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and counter-terrorism (BAT), the German domestic intelligence service, he should shoot the roof of the U.S. outpost, located less than 5 miles from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to German media, the BAT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a verbal exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">James Clapper, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, was again in September to the fact that the United States does not use possibilities of foreign espionage, "in order to steal trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies, so that they could expand their international competitiveness or their profits."</seg>
<seg id="6">But since Edward Snowden, the whistleblower that former employees, with the publication of his fill Horn has begun on U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate chiefs are no longer sure whether they can take the director at his word.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reports that the US National Security Agency, the Brazilian oil company Petrobras spied on and has obtained the data of US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company paranoia about government surveillance to a new record level.</seg>
<seg id="8">The last straw was the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone verwanzt, possibly for the last 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the most powerful person in Europe can get targeted, then certainly business lines are potential targets.</seg>
<seg id="10">Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence agencies and companies in a transparent manner.</seg>
<seg id="11">I believe that it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Germany needs to wake up," said Oliver Green, President of the BITMi representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="13">German companies believe that the United States was now almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft go, as a poll published by the consultant firm EY in July.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the documents leaked by Snowden, there was, however, no evidence so far that the United States has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to own companies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and they should reduce their dependence on the United States.</seg>
<seg id="16">The companies are skeptical about this.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the Bundestag, it was suggested that we should build a German Google.</seg>
<seg id="18">I can close my eyes and open them slowly...</seg>
<seg id="19">"It does not work that way," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software maker SAP.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you had wanted a strong European IT industry, would not let it die out over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="21">All in Germany will be subsidized by the coal on cars to agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="22">Everything, except for the IT industry.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, scope and technical sophistication of the US espionage authorities revealed by the Snowden revelations shocked firms, which had previously seen the greatest risk of espionage in China.</seg>
<seg id="24">The cloud computing will take place a big change, because European business leaders are now aware that data stored in the United States are subject to local jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, rejected after the revelations about the US data mining activities with prism about ten percent of the members are not based in the United States plans to use an American supplier.</seg>
<seg id="26">Jim Snabe, deputy managing director of SAP, says: "We see a new question of customers that there was not yet a year ago - it is: Where will my data stored and you can guarantee that they remain physically in this area?"</seg>
<seg id="27">Many German business leaders believe that the recent reports confirm just what they already knew, which is that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and they must therefore be guarded at any price.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is not surprising that economic espionage is taking place.</seg>
<seg id="29">This has always been the case.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It was an issue for many years and has not fundamentally changed by the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level, just as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.</seg>
<seg id="32">The management does not normally on the counter-measures it has taken, because that gives attackers benefits.</seg>
<seg id="33">In large companies, employees long eingebläut that take away a free USB sticks at a trade fair or the unguarded leave a laptop in the hotel rooms is not advisable, to say the least.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ulrich Hackenberk, a board member at automaker Audi, says that it has been standard practice for years belong to collect the mobile phones before a board meeting, so that they cannot be used as a Abhörgeräte.</seg>
<seg id="35">The German BAT advises executives, simple to use prepaid phones, if they can go on trips abroad, because smartphones may be compromised.</seg>
<seg id="36">Later, the prepaid mobile phones are thrown away.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is the concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Germany, many of these companies are global market leader in the respective niche.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, the staff and the financial resources to protect trade secrets effectively against unauthorized access," warns the BAT in a report.</seg>
<seg id="40">The United States warn their own companies against economic espionage by other countries.</seg>
<seg id="41">According to the Washington Post, France, Russia and Israel behind China in second place of the countries were included in the US National Intelligence Estimate in February, which is used for the procurement of economic data of the Hackings.</seg>

<seg id="4">The inseparable pair, both the same size, have been praised for their appearance, behavior and style in the annual competition, which is organized by the sunny Bank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.</seg>
<seg id="5">During his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had set up his plate cap in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fenton was praised by the judges for its natural skills in dealing with the pony, which would go far beyond his age.</seg>
<seg id="7">And toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fenton had toffee last March as a gift to get his third birthday and practiced every day with the Shetland pony since then.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and toffee are a great team."</seg>
<seg id="10">They had to compete against the entire field of participants and went from the square with the Gold Cup and rosette.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with toffee, and we were all excited when he won.</seg>
<seg id="12">Complete strangers in the arena thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.</seg>
<seg id="13">The little boy from the village Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, the horse reins for more than ten years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Howells said: "The whole audience was as electrifying and all have cheered him and clapping."</seg>
<seg id="15">He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he has done a fantastic job.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fenton is crazy after animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens, to look after himself.</seg>
<seg id="17">As it is launched, it will not take long until he is on the "horse of the year" -Schau - and I am sure that he will do well.</seg>
<seg id="18">A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows what he has to deal with his pony."</seg>
<seg id="19">Together, they are a great team.</seg>
<seg id="20">The jury assessed Fenton and toffee according to how well they had beaten and presented in the Vorführring.</seg>
<seg id="21">They take care of good cooperation between pony and leader - and there were Fenton and with the best in the ring.</seg>
<seg id="22">I am sure that Fentons sweet clothing has played its part, it was really perfect for the occasion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasman health care</seg>
<seg id="2">The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions that are associated with the rescue package on 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health care to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.</seg>
<seg id="3">Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth would take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis that has been caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic disease and system constraints.</seg>
<seg id="4">The funding for a period of four years, was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The government has declared an emergency rescue package, which in our view, the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek today.</seg>
<seg id="6">The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency aid for electoral performance.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedic surgery and treatments for grey star, is intended to eliminate residues.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare for inpatient stays, the specialist training, services in the field of mental health, and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="9">"These investments are in line with the ideas, of which I am concerned clinic employees have said that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.</seg>
<seg id="10">The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.</seg>
<seg id="11">The state must retain the current funding level, in order to receive money from the Commonwealth, and monthly report on where the extra money has been spent.</seg>
<seg id="12">A three-member commission will be set up and is intended to ensure that the state provide health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.</seg>
<seg id="13">As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would benefit little, if they are not accompanied by real reforms that will bring the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable course. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Nevertheless, he praised the government for the fact that they have responded to his request for urgent aid, which he first have expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to take the public health system of the state of the worry list," Wilkie said.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the state government this election services are largely offset by the recent cuts.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the public health spokesman Peter Dutton, the opposition at the federal level, is of the opinion that today's announcement is just a "sticking plaster solution."</seg>
<seg id="18">"We are therefore in the current situation, because the Labor-state government has deducted $430 million from the health care system," he said on ABC TV.</seg>
<seg id="19">It cannot be that a state government pulls nearly half a billion dollars from the system and the Commonwealth 300 million into it, and then act as if the good news.</seg>
<seg id="20">Dutton called Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.</seg>

<seg id="2">The arrangement of a judge on Thursday blocked a federal appeals court in the United States, which had called for changes to the stop-and-Frisk program ("stop and search") of the New York Police Department, and FRELIMO, the judge of the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 2nd U.S. appeals court said that rulings by Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended, pending a decision on an appeal of the city.</seg>
<seg id="4">The judge had ruled in August that the city goes against the Constitution with the way the program will be implemented for the stopping and questioning of people.</seg>
<seg id="5">The city appealed against their assessment and the ordered a corrective measures, including the decision to set up a monitoring office, which should support the police in the amendment of the directive and the corresponding training program.</seg>
<seg id="6">The appeal court heard the arguments to the required suspension on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The appeal report stated that the judge should be relieved of the case, since they have violated the code of conduct for American judges appointed by is that a judge is to avoid the appearance of partiality; this was founded in part with a series of media interviews and public statements, in which they had publicly responded to the criticism of the court.</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they were inappropriately specifically targeting black and Latin American men with the stop-and-Frisk program.</seg>
<seg id="9">They appointed an outside agency to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms to policies, training and service supervision, and ordered a pilot program with the body worn cameras in districts where most checks were carried out.</seg>
<seg id="10">In August, the city of New York is willing to put an end to the practice of storing names and addresses of people who have been released again after a check by the police.</seg>
<seg id="11">An oral hearing on the appeal of the city is scheduled for March 14, 2014.</seg>
<seg id="12">The stop-and-Frisk tactic was criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.</seg>
<seg id="13">Such controls are there for decades in various forms, but increased the number of recorded controls during the term of the non-party Mayor Michael Bloomberg on an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.</seg>

<seg id="15">Advocates of changes to the stop-and-Frisk program of the NYPD say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police and influence the way, use the scheme as other police chiefs.</seg>
<seg id="16">Opponents are of the opinion that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; nor would waste money and not solve the broader problem of a police force, which is under pressure after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="17">The judge pointed out that they do not have the stop-and-Frisk practice that was constitutional, but the way of implementation of controls by the NYPD reformiere.</seg>

<seg id="2">Survivors and relatives of the 202 people were killed in the bombing in Bali in 2002, reacted angrily on the verdict for the past the instigator, who was put on trial because, in their view, Umar Patek should be summarily.</seg>
<seg id="3">Patek, who was on the run for nearly ten years as one of the most wanted persons of South-East Asia, was sentenced to a prison sentence of 20 years for his role in the construction of shells for the bomb attack yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="4">With criminal suspension, he could be released after 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.</seg>
<seg id="6">A guilty verdict was also included in a series of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="7">The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, although they would have the death penalty for the man, who is also called the "demolition Man" because of his reputation as a master bomb maker, can apply.</seg>
<seg id="8">The decision has aroused painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, the 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny has lost in the devastation caused by Patek and his Mitverschwörern nearly ten years ago.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fighting back tears, she said, Patek should have been sentenced to death.</seg>
<seg id="10">I mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.</seg>
<seg id="11">"You should ask him before a firing squad," said Corteen towards AAP.</seg>
<seg id="12">I have to live with every day that I will get no further grandchildren and I will never see my daughters.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Sari Club was razed to the ground, as on 12 October 2002 shortly after 11 p.m., a powerful bomb exploded in a small truck, which was parked in front of the nightclub.</seg>
<seg id="14">Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds before a suicide bombers explode a backpack filled with explosives.</seg>
<seg id="15">He fell into a coma after the attack for a month and "died" three times while he was on a life support system.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hughes said, Patek have earned the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were responsible for the massacre and executed in four years.</seg>
<seg id="17">Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="18">To keep him alive, no, there is no reason to keep him alive.</seg>
<seg id="19">To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds, is not much.</seg>
<seg id="20">Patek is the last of the Bali bomber, who was in court.</seg>
<seg id="21">He took almost a decade of the arrest, but was finally picked up in January 2011 in Abbottabad in Pakistan, where US forces nearly four months later the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden killed.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the trial, said an FBI agent from that intelligence reports had provided the reference to Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim to rebuild the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.</seg>
<seg id="23">"He has not asked," said Corteen.</seg>
<seg id="24">Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much pain he has caused to other people.</seg>
<seg id="25">The ruling came in this year, which will be committed with commemorations in Bali and Australia before the 10th anniversary of the attack.</seg>
<seg id="26">"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.</seg>
<seg id="27">Patek can still appeal against his sentence.</seg>

<seg id="1">Any loss of profit for Bombardier to decline in supply numbers and contracts</seg>
<seg id="2">The Canadian aerospace and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decline of net profit on Thursday, after he was under pressure by declining orders and deliveries in aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail division.</seg>
<seg id="3">Bombardier, based in Montreal, also no flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and gave no new information about whether the plane could go next September in the commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable.</seg>
<seg id="4">On the maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago followed so far only three more starts, which makes it appear doubtful whether the trial period runs as planned.</seg>
<seg id="5">The results were back behind the forecasts and led to a drop of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, Thursday lowered his rating to "sector perform" from "outperform" in view of the fact that the share price has a limited course potential in the next one to two quarters.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Although weaker supply figures in aircraft have been widely expected, but we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector," said Doerksen to write to a customer.</seg>
<seg id="8">We believe that if the test program is progressing on the plane, Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries.</seg>
<seg id="9">If, however, no new orders will be announced in the coming months, we expect that the market is skeptical toward the program.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="11">The first test plane was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.</seg>
<seg id="12">But so far are binding orders for the CSeries with 177 moderate, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flights and would like to see whether the allegations against the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet transport aircraft is correct.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve his goal of 300 binding orders at the start of the commercial use of the jets.</seg>
<seg id="15">The company management also assured on Thursday with analysts and the media, the program lies in the schedule.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The test aircraft is not stayed on the ground longer than expected," said Beaudoin during a telephone conference and added that during the life of the aircraft had been scheduled to ground tests and software updates.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each manufacturer is different.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a review period, which we have done.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is happening during the entire flight programme.</seg>
<seg id="20">The second of five test aircraft will be expected to start in the next few weeks, the rest shortly afterwards, said from the corporate side.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, analysts remain sceptical about whether twelve months after the maiden flight of the first customer can take a CSeries aircraft in operation.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bombardier said it check the planning for the commissioning (EIS), and will update them in the next few months.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The slow progress of the flight test, even if they are obviously Bombardiers internal planning, reinforces our view that the commissioning shifts to the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the third quarter with the end on September 30, Bombardiers net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share of $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="25">The adjusted earnings per share is the same 9 cents.</seg>
<seg id="26">The turnover was slightly after and fell from 4.2% to $4.1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="27">Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4,56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.</seg>
<seg id="28">The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he had delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decline of 57 in the last year.</seg>
<seg id="29">The net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26</seg>
<seg id="30">The order book in the aerospace division was on 30 September 32,9 billion dollars and was unchanged compared with December 31.</seg>
<seg id="31">"In the field of aerospace, the results in the context of our targets, but the low order intake and the conditions of the market as a whole were disappointing," Beaudoin said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sales in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this division has risen by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="34">The order book in the transport division was $32.6 billion at September 30, and was thus increased slightly compared with December 31.</seg>
<seg id="35">The profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by handling problems in some big contracts.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to corporate governance, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.</seg>
<seg id="37">In afternoon trade on Thursday announced the Bombardier shares by 8.5 percent and stood at 4,83 Canadian dollars, after also announced that the Google CFO Patrick Pichette will switch to the Executive Board.</seg>
<seg id="38">Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardiers closest rival, reported a 10% drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="1">The rules on electronic devices on planes remain in Australia for the time being in force</seg>
<seg id="2">Australian airline passengers must continue to disable tablets and smartphones at launch and landing, despite efforts in the United States, to relax the rules for such devices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their rules so that passengers can see or play on their devices during critical flight phases read e-books, videos, if they are located in the "flight mode.</seg>
<seg id="4">While the bulk of the flight's passengers already allowed this, but many people are angry that they cannot read the launch and the landing of their e-books.</seg>
<seg id="5">Australian companies see the decision to implement the US airlines have to do a lot of work, but have no immediate plans to change its rules.</seg>
<seg id="6">The air traffic control authority Casa said also that we will look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia still apply.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Casa currently has no specific rules on use of electronic devices on the plane," was announced.</seg>
<seg id="8">The issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines maintain the security at all times and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by the cabin crew.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virgin has already held talks with the Casa on a widening use of Wi-Fi-entertainment system on flights and said it is open to changes, but these should be initiated by the legislator.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by the Casa because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience, after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," a spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Qantas said that it will remain in the current rules until further notice.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices should not be used during the launch and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that," said the company.</seg>
<seg id="13">The FAA rules apply to American carriers.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are always interested in developments in regulations, from which passengers can benefit, and we will certainly look the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.</seg>
<seg id="15">The decision has an impact on US companies vary depending on the age of the fleet.</seg>
<seg id="16">They must prove that their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, and manuals, training materials, baggage-change programs, as well as customer instruction.</seg>
<seg id="17">"After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers using portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smart phones at every level," announced the FAA.</seg>
<seg id="18">In rare cases in poor visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers, while landing disable the devices.</seg>
<seg id="19">The group also recommended heavier devices in to store launch and landing safely under the seat or in the subjects on the seats.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scientists were able to throw more light on it, is the context in which the tail wag the dog with his mood.</seg>
<seg id="2">Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail stretched more to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while it was the left-hand side with nervous dogs.</seg>
<seg id="3">But now, scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and respond to it.</seg>
<seg id="4">Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, neuroscientists at the University of Trento, said: "When people are well aware that the left and right brain hemisphere respond differently to other sources that produce positive or negative emotions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Here we have tried to look at this in other species.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also noted that the right brain hemisphere in dogs as in humans was responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.</seg>
<seg id="7">To learn more about it, as dogs respond to the lateral tail wag of their own kind, monitored the researchers viewed the animals, while these films from other dogs.</seg>
<seg id="8">They measured the heart rate of the dog and analyzed the behavior.</seg>
<seg id="9">Probably we will soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction, even in the other</seg>
<seg id="10">Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown the dogs films with dogs - either a lifelike version or a Silhouette, in order to eliminate ablenkende other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."</seg>
<seg id="11">If the animals were, like the other expression of a dog's tail has moved to the right (seen from the perspective of the Wedel-dog), they were completely relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="12">But was mainly the tail tilt to the left (again from the perspective of the dog wag), as increased their heart rate and they looked restless.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the opinion of Professor Vallortigara the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience, in which movements they should worry about, and when they are not.</seg>
<seg id="15">He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and a swish with the cock in one direction rather is associated with friendly behavior and the right side rather produces a less friendly behavior, then responded to on the basis of this experience."</seg>
<seg id="16">The researchers say that the findings could provide a better understanding of the emotions of their animal for dog owners, veterinarians and trainers.</seg>
<seg id="17">John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and visiting Fellow at the Faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol has said that this is not the first study, which has been investigated, whether on the left and the right is important for dogs.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn your head to the left, if they see an aggressive dog, and on the right, if we are talking about a happy dog.</seg>
<seg id="19">In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada was the following: "Dogs go on a robot dog when the tail wag" on the left, not the right, rather than to be restless, rather than the other way around in the Italian study. "</seg>
<seg id="20">According to his statement could stir the differences so that the dogs in the various studies of the animals in the movies or the robot dogs are not interpreted as a dog.</seg>
<seg id="21">A study how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that both halves of the brain are used for different purposes, but many of the details still need to be determined - and dogs are no exception," said Brad Shaw.</seg>
<seg id="23">Since their behavior record but simply put, it will probably not last a long time, until we understand why the tail sometimes moved in one direction, sometimes in the other.</seg>

<seg id="4">Although they earn 3,000 Singapore dollars (CA 1.730 euros) every month as a government worker and her husband also work, rich in the monthly family income, they explained.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indeed, demand in parts of South-East Asia - where the debt of households is increasing - is so large that ValueMax, where they made their exchange, this week became the third deposit house, which is listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">The pledge of jewelry is not only a faster way to get money - 1,300 Singapore dollars, as well as in the case of Janani Amir (Inga - nearly as cheap as an unsecured bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="7">Typically require pawnshops in Singapore an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is only just above the 15.4 percent, which requires the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping mall.</seg>
<seg id="8">Pawnshops offer but the advantage, that does not require proof of income or review of the credit rating, and loans faster than banks are possible.</seg>
<seg id="9">For this reason turn millions of people in the region to pawnshops, after families feel the pressure by rising living costs, as well as a growing household and consumer debt.</seg>
<seg id="10">After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to a loose monetary policy in developed economies are looking for families with low and medium incomes pawnshops on, in order to compensate for the difference in stotternder economy.</seg>
<seg id="11">This week, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly by rising mortgage, as a risk factor for the credit worthiness of Asian banks.</seg>
<seg id="12">Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, according to the agency's highest household debt relative to gross domestic product in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Malaysia is still in 2008 with 80 percent of GDP at the top of the list, an increase of 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">Economists also worry because of the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has just emerged from a technical recession.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a weakening of consumer demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"In the end, it means that faced with rising costs of the people in the middle and lower segment (of the income scale) will try to supplement their income, wherever it is possible," said Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.</seg>
<seg id="17">Historic levels in gold prices in the past two years have reinforced the trend for pledging personal items, as the people have the opportunity to turn the family jewelry into cash.</seg>
<seg id="18">In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items are pawn shops of the city-state of gold in the 200.</seg>
<seg id="19">The people say: "The price of gold looks good, let us pledge Grandmother's gold chain and bring back next month."</seg>
<seg id="20">The largest Thai pawn shop operator, easy money, has seen a 20% customer growth in the last few months in its stores.</seg>
<seg id="21">The growth in the mortgage business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 other wants to expand in Singapore, not only in the neighboring Malaysia, where the company operates four houses, but also outside Asia, Lee Ching yeah, Managing Director of ValueMax.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company financed that to 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars that it took this week with the IPO in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="23">While some lenders because of high interest rates were caught in the crossfire, said Yeah that pawnshops not only lower interest rates than other lenders would not directly, but also the debt increased.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Customers a loan items that they already have, and that liquefy personal valuables do not increase the budget training," she explained.</seg>
<seg id="25">The mortgage loan business, society is increasingly accepted as a short-term secured funding.</seg>
<seg id="26">Also, not all people who use pawn shop, are in financial difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="27">Rich people come from Singapore also in the branches of ValueMax to mortgage gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.</seg>
<seg id="28">Customers come to us from every social class.</seg>
<seg id="29">"These include the wealthy, something in the short term for a business or an investment loan, or small businesses, have to bridge the bottlenecks in the cash-flow," says Mitch.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sometimes they need just money very quickly.</seg>

<seg id="1">A study was announced by the British government, which is intended to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="2">In the work of HS2 Ltd proposes, even with the start of Phase 1 of the year 2026 to achieve high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England.</seg>
<seg id="3">Transport minister Baroness Kramer said that the project "will be Britain closer together."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.</seg>
<seg id="6">After the completion of Phase 2, there will be links to Manchester and Leeds.</seg>
<seg id="7">In June, the government revised the estimated cost of £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion for the construction of the high-speed link between London and the north of England.</seg>
<seg id="8">The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, instructed HS2 Ltd to look for other routes capacities and travel time improvements for the north of England and Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="9">These include the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less of Glasgow and Edinburgh to London at the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="10">Baroness Kramer said: "Our aim for HS2 is a truly national network, the United Kingdom and its cities closer together."</seg>
<seg id="11">We go ahead with HS2, because it brings enormous benefits.</seg>
<seg id="12">Without it, we are facing a crisis of capacity in our rail network.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will improve thanks to HS2.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Scottish Secretary Alistair AP commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."</seg>
<seg id="15">On behalf of the Scottish Government called Keith Brown AP to use "unequivocal" for the Scottish involvement in the HS2 network.</seg>
<seg id="16">Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, at the same time, but also the economic strength of Scotland an argument for fast rail links across the UK."</seg>
<seg id="17">We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, which creates benefits for all and the Glasgow-Edinburgh link added that the Scottish Government already plans.</seg>
<seg id="18">I look forward to the investigation report with the British ministers to consider next year and work together to decide on the next steps.</seg>

<seg id="2">Actually lives Waltraud Ries fantastically.</seg>
<seg id="3">Their house is in a residential area of Stuttgart, set in an old trees, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.</seg>
<seg id="4">There are only a few minutes by public transport in the city.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Hopefully, you have no fear of spiders?," asks Waltraud Ries and shows at a fat spider on door frames.</seg>
<seg id="6">I am already looking for a new home for my husband and me for some time.</seg>
<seg id="7">But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.</seg>
<seg id="8">The reason is not a spider phobia, but the concern, however, in the age of the many steps to the house and no longer able to cope in the apartment, she says.</seg>
<seg id="9">Moreover, since a meniscus tears-operation, the Mitt fifty woman has experienced what it means to move with a handicap from floor to floor.</seg>
<seg id="10">Recently, a book published by her on 'happy living in old age - What home form is the best for me?'.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Our home is the best example of what the age is not allowed," she begins to tell.</seg>
<seg id="12">When they moved into the apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.</seg>
<seg id="13">Today, with mid-fifties, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.</seg>
<seg id="14">But they also know that it is one of the few people who actually deal with the issue of 'living in old age'.</seg>
<seg id="15">Most displace it, as long as it is.</seg>
<seg id="16">Old are always the others', she says an enduring formative influence.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only when the suffering is really great, do you have thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Then it may be too late," says Ries.</seg>
<seg id="19">In her book, the interior designer 17 residential models for a self-determined living in old age.</seg>
<seg id="20">'What living form it chooses, is always an individual decision, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="21">D i s solution were it not for the ages.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even those who can afford the age retirement home in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he could also be ill.</seg>
<seg id="23">And: "Without a good knowledge of the language association, it is also in the dolce vita, 'the reference book author exile willing to bear in mind.</seg>
<seg id="24">Their models are classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the oft-quoted pensioner-WG.</seg>
<seg id="25">Everyone has the age he ticks and quirks</seg>
<seg id="26">'For me would be a residential community but nothing, "she says with a wink.</seg>
<seg id="27">Certainly not as in a student-WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In old age is simply his withdrawal rooms, as well as Ries.</seg>
<seg id="29">For a senior-living community can still work, the book writer, however, cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="30">It must then differently than in the classic student-WG.</seg>
<seg id="31">And sometimes one simply even his calm, "she believes.</seg>
<seg id="32">With this view, they at least in the state capital is not alone.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay as long as it is in their own home, 'is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="34">The department advises people around the theme 'grow older. "</seg>
<seg id="35">Why would just older people often inconvenience and restrictions on buying companies, only to be able to remain in their familiar surroundings, this is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.</seg>
<seg id="36">There are many ways to make the house or flat barrier free today.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ries recommends all that deal with the age just reconstruction of their house or apartment to instruct once reliable information and not the only best craftsmen.</seg>
<seg id="38">Today is also available for the age just reconstruction specialists.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even in the rental housing will realize one thing or another, and if it is only increase the toilet seat, clarifies the interior designer.</seg>
<seg id="40">But the existing housing age is not always fair and thus transform barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="41">This experience has had to make Waltraud Ries.</seg>
<seg id="42">While one might install a stair lift inside the apartment, but the same with stairs paved way up on the apartment door would be the far greater obstacle.</seg>
<seg id="43">It will continue to search until it has found the ideal object for themselves and her husband.</seg>
<seg id="44">Before the parade dread it over before the spider on her apartment door.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cocaine addict lawyer, the drug boss warned before police investigation, must go to jail</seg>
<seg id="2">Bash / repairers preferring, 42, was further information at world size Neil Scarborough</seg>
<seg id="3">The lawyer had fear that his secret addiction could come to light</seg>
<seg id="4">He was sentenced to three years in prison from Liverpool Crown Court</seg>
<seg id="5">A well-known criminal defender, before a major police investigation of a drug baron warned, because he was afraid his secret addiction could be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bash / repairers preferring, 42, provided under world size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into its activities in the drug trade, after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction.</seg>
<seg id="7">The lawyer Kriminalisten lauded as "first class" with the nickname "bash" was arrested at his home in 2011, after the police had monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug procedures.</seg>
<seg id="8">Officials observed, such as Scarborough (32) three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, expired, while it was with colleagues in a meal of the Bar Association.</seg>
<seg id="9">The investigation had revealed that preferring regular class A drugs were consumed after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and credit cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain illicit information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.</seg>
<seg id="11">All four suspects were at the time of the police monitored as part of a major investigation procedure for Heroin- and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="12">Along with 32 other people were later arrested after the police in a series of house searches ensured £1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine, as well as 200,000 pounds in cash.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preferring, 42, gave information to the criminals, because he feared that his addiction can be known.</seg>
<seg id="14">Today, preferring, who works for the law firm Forbes solicitors in Blackburn, after a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court found guilty on two counts of obstruction of justice and sentenced.</seg>
<seg id="15">He gave to the cocaine possession in a previous survey.</seg>
<seg id="16">The lawyer was transferred after the police in their investigations against Scarborough found out that in February 2011 in regular telephone contact with preferring had stood.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he came to Dittas house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the dustbin of the lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, was Scarborough on a regular basis, preferring, who was at the dinner in the football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park.</seg>
<seg id="19">The lawyer returned home, won the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.</seg>
<seg id="20">Before the court was aware that preferring a regular consumer of cocaine was, after tests of the class A drugs were discovered in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards.</seg>
<seg id="21">Preferring was later arrested, denied, however, to take cocaine and said that he had spoken with the alleged dealer, because this was his client, and claimed that their discussion under the sun, "lawyer secret."</seg>
<seg id="22">During his arrest, preferring his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were assured and he was taken from a hair sample.</seg>
<seg id="23">When he was police interrogation, he run an office both at his private address and in the workplace and clients would call him at home because of legal affairs.</seg>
<seg id="24">In court, it was announced that he had important actors of the drug trade, some of which he represented before, after significant arrests had called and informed, what the investigators knew about it.</seg>
<seg id="25">State Attorney Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you don't break the law."</seg>
<seg id="26">Preferring is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender, since he has become very engaged with certain clients.</seg>
<seg id="27">The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer, which his lawyer supplied with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="28">Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these people.</seg>
<seg id="29">But that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.</seg>
<seg id="30">He was the police investigation as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr preferring that brought his profession into disrepute.</seg>
<seg id="32">He was too close to certain clients, particularly in Scarborough, and he allowed that its independence was compromised.</seg>
<seg id="33">Preferring denied any wrongdoing and said: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait for 15 hours, but do it immediately."</seg>
<seg id="34">But after the hearing, said superintendent Lee Halstead by the police in Lancashire: "Mr preferring has taken the step of a criminal defender to a criminal in the moment, when he began to buy drugs from organised criminals."</seg>
<seg id="35">His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime that commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and trust and confidence in the public.</seg>
<seg id="37">Preferring has betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.</seg>
<seg id="38">The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire headed the investigation against preferring, which also led to a conviction in three cases because of the obstruction of justice and possession of cocaine, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.</seg>
<seg id="39">This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.</seg>
<seg id="40">We will find you and bring you to justice.</seg>
<seg id="41">Scarborough itself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he was declared guilty of conspiracy to Heroin-, cocaine and cannabis trade.</seg>
<seg id="42">Thirty-five more involved in the drug trade 'people have been sentenced to total penalties of 153 years for drug offences.</seg>
<seg id="43">On his website, preferring a field with questions and answers about yourself, in which he cited, it was his dream job, as a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America that his ultimate guest at the dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality is the motivation for his work.</seg>

<seg id="2">Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" consuming be converted to increase road safety?</seg>
<seg id="3">Yes, have adopted the municipal councils.</seg>
<seg id="4">Schiltach must take for 220 000 euros in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal-railway line in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Particularly should be increased in the security at railway crossings - it is regularly nationwide to collisions of trains with other vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The communities agree to the restructuring measures, they must engage with a third of the cost, the rest will share train and covenant.</seg>
<seg id="8">ALPINA axle city architect Roland Grießhaber explained to the local council of the peculiarities of the Bahübergangs "Am Hirschen."</seg>
<seg id="9">There, the city plans to build a bulge in the amount of the local tunnel mouth west of the railroad tracks.</seg>
<seg id="10">There could also be against traffic in larger vehicles, such as those that carry long wood, without having to block the tracks.</seg>
<seg id="11">Grießhaber suggested, therefore, to construct a necessary supporting wall so that the city could widen the subsequent street at the appropriate time, in order to ensure a smooth traffic flow.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was controversial in the local council, as some councils went into question the need for a road spread: Thomas tilt brought the mood of critics with his statement to the point: "We need to take so much money for so few vehicles in the hand?"</seg>
<seg id="13">Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railway crossing Hirschen will regularly used for long wood transportation.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" will be transported in part on this route, because up to 20 meters long vehicles could not use the route to the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn in the main street.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moreover, serve the route as a diversion for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel, where the main street is locked, argued Haas.</seg>
<seg id="16">As was clear that Kirch mountain and Schlossberg tunnel would have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in highest expectations, the railway crossing "Am Hirschen could also play an important traffic importance for a long period of time.</seg>
<seg id="17">The council agreed to investigate, which costs would cause the expansion of the road.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the reconstruction of the railway crossing the majority agreed with the proviso that the necessary supporting wall will be built so that the city could expand the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstrasse" if necessary for meeting traffic at around 5.5 meters.</seg>

<seg id="12">Both Kroll and slate and other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, focused on racial issues W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.</seg>
<seg id="13">The largest visitor attraction of the festival include an interview: David Steinberg speaks with Larry David.</seg>
<seg id="14">Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.</seg>

<seg id="8">Damascus has yet to begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin gas in the country.</seg>

<seg id="12">However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the Menarche (appearance of the first menstrual period) in the last 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the United States, the average age at 12.5 years, something less than a visual arts in 1970.</seg>
<seg id="14">"If the development of breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to the Menarche yet," said Kaplowitz, author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The essential guide for dealing with this problem that often occurs too."</seg>
<seg id="15">Time is the most accurate test, as puberty progresses.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is controversial, which is actually the onset of puberty, but it is "early ripe," if the breast surgery is accompanied by a growth spurt at the age of eight years.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the majority of cases is slowing down the process or stagnating - something that can closely monitor a pediatrician.</seg>
<seg id="18">Faster progress could be tests indicated by a Endikronologen so serious problems such as tumors and cysts can be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: The premature ageing of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and small stature in adults.</seg>
<seg id="20">The recommendations for a medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.</seg>
<seg id="21">Psycho-social aspects are also important.</seg>
<seg id="22">Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but he admits: "The suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their age to be in custody."</seg>
<seg id="23">The other major problem is understandable: Parents don't want their very young daughters have the period.</seg>
<seg id="24">"They are concerned because of the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side," Kaplowitz said.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter has received their days with ten.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if there were the first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.</seg>
<seg id="27">She was scared and excited home from school, because it was the first in her group of friends.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media were the cause.</seg>
<seg id="30">Young are similar to girls in puberty earlier.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kaplowitz is of the opinion that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity.</seg>
<seg id="32">He supported the implementation of a study on girls in 2001 at the age of six to nine years, producing a connection between body fat and the entry into puberty.</seg>
<seg id="33">Other studies support that conclusion, but there are many other factors played a role.</seg>
<seg id="34">In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to be the puberty rather than their white age in custody.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are various explanations for this.</seg>
<seg id="36">Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions on the climate to the genes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Another mystery: Although the boy's face and pubic hair grows earlier, the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other doctors at the AAP conference underscored the complexity of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="39">The emergence of acne and pubic hair is widespread even among babies and young children.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We have to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric Endokrinologe at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="41">Parents should not hesitate to be advised by her doctor, as they should talk with their child.</seg>
<seg id="42">"This may mean that you have to lead a conversation earlier than expected," advised Kaplowitz.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you remain quiet, the child responds normally good.</seg>
<seg id="44">Girls, the early bloom, need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it is sooner than thought.</seg>

<seg id="4">It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustics, the viewer until shortly before the start of the league game between the German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park offered.</seg>
<seg id="5">To hear were mainly the visiting fans with their voices.</seg>
<seg id="6">The south gallery, on the other hand, where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans are, presented himself at first exceptionally quiet: No chants, no battle cries.</seg>
<seg id="7">The podium of the capo, who coordinates otherwise the collective spirit, remained unfilled.</seg>
<seg id="8">And completely on the front of the grandstand blew lonely a large banner with the inscription "section stadium ban."</seg>
<seg id="9">Just as a goalkeeper Roman pastures jolly as always the first BVB players entered the square, brandete short-lived jubilation on.</seg>
<seg id="10">As his team colleagues followed, there was loud singing and floating scarves - though not everywhere.</seg>

<seg id="11">On the track, the Mail can run on a number of other servers on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Bennie can then call the content with their provider.</seg>
<seg id="13">Traditional e-mails are on their way through the network sniffing?</seg>

<seg id="1">Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two before allegations against YMCA employee Jonathan Lord accused of sex offences</seg>
<seg id="2">Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been accused of sexual offences in connection with children, before 2011 allegations were made against the child carers Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children learned.</seg>
<seg id="3">But at the opening statement before the Commission had declared the YMCA, we have never had anything to do with an incident of sexual child abuse "in the organization."</seg>
<seg id="4">Managing director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employees had been accused of offences with child pornography, and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 had been convicted of abuse him anvertrauter children.</seg>
<seg id="5">Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission Assis animal lawyer that he had known of the first case, but the second was not known.</seg>
<seg id="6">He admitted that the YMCA's opening statement to the Commission has also been inaccurate in the assertion that "there have been external reviews of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognized as a front line in the children's safety."</seg>
<seg id="7">Evidence of the Commission show instead that the YMCA was informed that he was the second-lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) has received in August of this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hare, who has started 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management had "failed to backward" in the recruitment of Lord of me and not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the directives on child safety.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lord, the beginning of the year had been convicted of sex offenses at 12 boys during his two-year career for the YMCA.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hare denied, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem, have prevented the staff, Lords to report offences in relation to the safety of children.</seg>
<seg id="12">The staff said that they had observed violations, among other things, that he was alone with children, they privately supported as a baby sitter, they sit on his lap was to have said that he would like, and children play with his mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Danielle Ockwell, whose boss Lord was and had asked for a training to child protection, because she was concerned for his behavior, said of the children's services director Jacqui Barnat, the supervisors in the YMCA Caringbah the Lords was, "very daunting and most of the time was very remote."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CEO said that he would not accept statements of employees that they could not be trusted to reimburse message to their superiors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Instead, he said, have affected their judgment on their friendship with Lord, why they had not reported it.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hare said that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW his view that the lesson to draw from the "Jonathan Lord incident" that the organization, "not the Report" by employees, according to the study, and the board voted to approve him.</seg>
<seg id="17">Hare said, the decision to push the employees to sign non-disclosure obligations shortly after the emergence of the allegations had been made by the director of the YMCA of children's services, Liam Whitley,.</seg>
<seg id="18">He said that the contamination of the evidence should be prevented, but was "overzealous" and poorly implemented.</seg>
<seg id="19">The YMCA NSW is not safe for children in the time when Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011 there have been organization, said Professor Stephen small bone of Griffith University, an expert on child sex abuse, the Commission.</seg>
<seg id="20">He explained that there had been "serious problems" in the recruitment, screening, training, training and supervision of employees.</seg>

<seg id="4">Some 157 meters stand the two towers in the sky and make it to the second-highest church building in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="5">But only a few visitors who see the filigree two church towers, suspect that there is a lot to discover even under the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rainer Schulze is an expert in the Cologne underworld.</seg>
<seg id="7">Meeting point for his tours, the service center of Cologne-tourism in front of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="8">The tour begins very unspectacular: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-oriented city, and therefore remained from the remains of the ancient city wall only that stand, which was not too large.</seg>
<seg id="10">Most users of the Park House rush past the Roman remains so today, just ask your car.</seg>
<seg id="11">But if you look more closely, discovered in the parking deck D2 a separated by metal mesh rods archaeological site.</seg>
<seg id="12">On display are about five meters high ruins from palms large stones.</seg>
<seg id="13">"There are remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.</seg>
<seg id="14">Before it comes back to the surface, the participants on the upper level was still take a look into a dark, 15 meters deep shaft.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which, unfortunately, is also hardly noticed.</seg>
<seg id="16">Next stop of the tour is the Pretorian, and here the participants get back down into the depths.</seg>
<seg id="17">Here we see the official residence of the once powerful man north of the Alps, the pre-gate of the CCAA.</seg>
<seg id="18">What CCAA means, a visitor would like to know.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The acronym stands for" Colonia Claudia Ara Aggripinensium, "which was" city of Roman law and the Agrippinenser city, in plain English, under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the emperor worship "means."</seg>
<seg id="20">And the Pretorian Palace is the former proconsul, the centre of power of the Roman empire on the Rhine.</seg>
<seg id="21">A tunnel leading from the foyer of the exhibition is getting access to the Roman sewer, which is at around 120 metres.</seg>
<seg id="22">"You can go quietly along a stretch along the so-called Cloaca maxima, if you want," encouraging Schulze guests on.</seg>
<seg id="23">Schulze yet has a surprise.</seg>
<seg id="24">After he has brought the key at the box office, he leads the group to a 16-metre-deep, walk-shaft.</seg>
<seg id="25">"We are now in the mikvah, a ritual Jewish bath," he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Jewish community built their bathroom deep into the ground, in order to get to the groundwater, which was essential for the Songkran.</seg>
<seg id="27">Until today are in the lower end of the mikvah, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels by varying levels of the Rhine legible.</seg>
<seg id="28">The mikvah is part of an archaeological area on the Town Hall Square for which the construction work would begin in the near future.</seg>

<seg id="1">George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the election</seg>
<seg id="2">A new day, a new horror story for independence.</seg>
<seg id="3">This time we will be warned that an independent Scotland is necessary to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.</seg>
<seg id="4">This provides the key word for stories about passport controls in Berwick and along a secured with barbed wire border of Hadrian's Wall.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, in the Strathclyde template pointed to the potential economic benefits that would bring more travel in the rest of Europe, but this - as expected - played no role in the headlines.</seg>
<seg id="6">No one has also mentioned that the EU member states often bent to its strict rules when it is convenient for them.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since Scotland currently does not belong to the Schengen area, the continued disregard for Brussels would be only a small concession in exchange for what it really wants from the Scots.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is not really a story.</seg>
<seg id="9">And one that already has been the case in the years that they already have a fossil resembles: The first time I have heard the "independence means passport controls" -Ente at least 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is an interesting point lost in the constant refrain of this ancient history.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why should we expect of an independent Scotland, that dances to the tune of Europe?</seg>
<seg id="12">Why the London yoke against the trade of Brussels, especially now?</seg>
<seg id="13">These are the real European news: The large, taken after the war plan to the unification of Europe is faltering.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead.</seg>
<seg id="15">Parties win anywhere in the EU are hostile in soil, the EU or want to jettison the euro as a common currency.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even in Germany, the euro-sceptic party Alternative for Germany - founded until this year - nearly five million votes in the federal election in September for themselves get and thus effectively distribute the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="17">There have always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the current economic crisis turns out as a turning point.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because of the strict austerity in connection with the straitjacket imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, in which the national economy is forced by the adherence to the common currency, many people are of the opinion that the European project had gone too far.</seg>
<seg id="20">The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments cause excessive budget deficits - that was only the case in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="21">Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members on exchange rates, which are good for German exporters - and that German politicians would like to leave it that way.</seg>
<seg id="22">Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe is again with a built-in productivity disadvantage against Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">The only way is to cut wages and public spending - spurred by Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Behind the current Etat- and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result of the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels - a code for the subsidy of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - pays the European industry compared with the United States twice for electricity and four times for gas.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have seen already in Grange mouth.</seg>
<seg id="27">The European petrochemical industry does not protect all wage-writing courses in the world before, from cheap US shale gas to be pushed into a corner.</seg>
<seg id="28">As a result, a revolt up, especially in France, the EU's former cheerleader.</seg>
<seg id="29">After the war saw the French political elite could lift the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in check and Paris on an equal footing with Washington.</seg>
<seg id="30">But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to the political legitimacy and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, by which the ailing French economy is struggling.</seg>
<seg id="31">The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU-hostile National Front has just won a decisive choice and referred to the ruling Socialists at number three.</seg>
<seg id="32">The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that they cannot assume a split in the right range would automatically mean benefits for the left.</seg>
<seg id="33">What makes Le Pen, with its newly gained popularity among the white working-class French?</seg>
<seg id="34">They would like to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc in the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="35">If the anti-EU parties in these elections do well - and this is very possible - then could dominate the European Parliament for the first time such a block.</seg>
<seg id="36">This is the point that I am going with this: In the not-too-distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together for the abolition of the euro.</seg>
<seg id="37">The EU will not disappear, but it will be more like something like the "Europe of Nations (sovereign)" which favored General de Gaulle.</seg>
<seg id="38">Germany and a few of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.</seg>
<seg id="39">I expect that Britain distanced itself from this project in the hope that the United States look presidential.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will be in the Atlantic rain alone.</seg>
<seg id="41">Where is Scotland in all of this?</seg>
<seg id="42">We can choose to be a region of (in the last consequence) Little England.</seg>
<seg id="43">Or we can defend our own economic interests - including, Berlin and Brussels to say what they are where hinstecken can.</seg>
<seg id="44">I suspect that Scotland could go very well in a looser European network, if we keep our own currency.</seg>
<seg id="45">The cooperation with other like-minded countries is easier in a federal Europe of the nations.</seg>
<seg id="46">Otherwise, we should consider it replicate Norway and keep our economic independence.</seg>
<seg id="47">The SNP government in Scotland is, remarkably, the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has won a spectacular majority because of the rejection of the proposed (and) cuts carried out in 2011, the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to answer for.</seg>
<seg id="48">It would be ridiculous to decide now for an independence for Scotland, only to be imposed on an austerity from Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

<seg id="1">FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but no mobile phone calls)</seg>
<seg id="2">Passengers can now use their electronic devices for reading, work, games, music and the image of films from the departure to the landing, but not with the mobile phone, according to the new guidelines, which were issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the passengers should not expect that these changes will be implemented immediately.</seg>
<seg id="4">How quickly they would be implemented, drawn by the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta said at a press conference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The airlines, the FAA must prove that aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals for flight crew, as well as the rules for the storage of the devices in accordance with the new rules.</seg>
<seg id="6">The FAA said that they have already received by some airlines plans that would expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Under these airlines were also Delta and JetBlue.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Depending on the state of the plan we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">Currently, passengers must switch smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.</seg>
<seg id="10">They can only restart them when the plane reached an altitude of three kilometers and the captain is the green light.</seg>
<seg id="11">Enter the landing the passengers need to disable them again and cannot run again, before the plane landed.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under the new guidelines could allow airlines, whose planes are secured against electronic malfunctions, their passengers to use the equipment in the launch and landing on the tarmac, the FAA said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most new commercial aircraft and other pilots who were converted into greater heights for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Laura Glading, president of the Professional Association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"If the new regulation is implemented safely, and we are working closely with the airline together in this regard, both sides will benefit from it," Glading said.</seg>
<seg id="16">We are sincerely sorry, we have to feel like watchdogs on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, Internet connections for surfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages or downloading data still banned under three kilometres, explained the authority.</seg>
<seg id="18">Passengers will be asked to make smart phones, tablets and other devices in the flight mode.</seg>
<seg id="19">That is still not "Words With Friends," a scrabble extensive online game, which the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave an American Airlines jet high profile, because he refused to shut down the device, while the plane was parked at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stored, because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mobile phone calls during the flight will also remain banned.</seg>
<seg id="22">The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.</seg>
<seg id="23">FAA lifts may ban for certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing on</seg>
<seg id="24">Last month by the Transportation Security Administration, National Transportation Safety Board, Mark Rosenker said, security expert for national transport issues at CBS News, mobile phones were still seen as a risk.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Mobile is really a problem, not only because they could cause potential problems in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transfer from the air can also disrupt transmission towers," said Rosenker.</seg>
<seg id="26">An advisory committee of the industry, which was launched by the FAA to investigate this issue, last month recommended that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
<seg id="27">In recent years, increased the pressure on the FAA to loosen restrictions on its use.</seg>
<seg id="28">Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire during from Missouri are of the opinion that there is no valid security reasons for the ban.</seg>
<seg id="29">The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.</seg>
<seg id="30">In some studies, mentions that up to a third of the passengers forget or ignore the closure of the device.</seg>
<seg id="31">The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by air passengers, after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices by means of passengers unlocks FM radios were known at the time were the latest technology trends.</seg>
<seg id="32">New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that electronic interference account for nothing.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airline passengers for several years already offer Wi-Fi, if the altitude is reached.</seg>
<seg id="34">The flyer adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.</seg>
<seg id="35">The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Today's electronic devices are generally much less radio radiation than previous generations.</seg>
<seg id="37">E-reader, for example, give only minimal radiation, if one umblättert.</seg>
<seg id="38">But when they download data or send the transfer values are stronger.</seg>
<seg id="39">One of the advocates of an easing of restrictions on use of the devices by passengers Amazon.com.</seg>
<seg id="40">2011 invited firm employees a passenger plane full of kindle e-reader and made a test flight to determine problems, but could not say.</seg>
<seg id="41">Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings, with regard to the risk in the use of devices.</seg>
<seg id="42">Douglas Kidd of the passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said that he is of the view that the disruption of the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="43">Other committee members said that there were only scattered reports of pilots who spoke for a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old.</seg>
<seg id="44">The committee recommended the FAA, however, allow pilots to order the closure of the devices by the passengers in instrument landing under poor visibility conditions.</seg>
<seg id="45">A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described it as a sensible adjustment for travelers who today would comprehensively equipped with technology.</seg>
<seg id="46">"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in contradiction to safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>

<seg id="2">"We want to involve the people at an early stage in the planning," Mayor Jens Häußler opened to the public information event for flood protection Gechingen concept.</seg>
<seg id="3">About 80 participants were in the town hall had to explain the planned measures for you to ask questions to express concerns and ideas.</seg>
<seg id="4">Häußler was clear: "The ultimate decisions by the members of the parish council."</seg>
<seg id="5">The flooding that Gechingen on May 15, 2009, unprepared, had been a crucial event, which raised the question of protective measures for the future, so Häußler.</seg>
<seg id="6">A basin study was commissioned with the neighbouring village S1, which is now the basis for the flood protection Gechingen concept.</seg>
<seg id="7">"As the protection of cultivated land is the goal," so Häußler.</seg>
<seg id="8">The basis is the planning of protection against a flood expected according to the German weather service in every 100 years of statistics.</seg>
<seg id="9">Climate change will be met by a 15-percent surcharge.</seg>
<seg id="10">In expert circles, this with "HQ 100a climate."</seg>
<seg id="11">The mass of water that 2009 had led to considerable damage in Gechingen matched a 1,000-year flood.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is not an absolute protection, but a relative improvement we can achieve," so Häußler.</seg>
<seg id="13">In order to achieve the protection HQ 100a climate, must be invested in Gechingen around four million euros, and the community can expect country to shots to the tune of around 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">Häußler but pointed out that it will only give the promotion if a master plan implemented.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is dependent on the participation of the citizens of the municipality.</seg>
<seg id="16">An elaborate planning and approval procedures should be is completed.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the best case, 2016 could be started with the implementation.</seg>

<seg id="23">Dissatisfaction reigned for operators of Altorts that even in normal thunderstorm rain continues to suffer from an overload of the canal network.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is known in the administration and first measures have already been taken.</seg>
<seg id="25">Häußler pointed out, however, that the guidelines for sewer systems are different, as for the flood protection and this should not be mixed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jumbo manufacturers contend in the face of large orders on seat width</seg>
<seg id="2">It is between leading aircraft manufacturers have come to a dispute about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights, which sets the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">The dispute revolves around the seat width, the passengers on long flights will be offered in the tourist class - not always the ones that airlines are the most, but this proven space is the key to the efficiency claims in the latest aircraft from Boeing Co. and Airbus SAS.</seg>
<seg id="4">Airbus claimed this week an industry standard, which requires a minimum seat width of 46 centimeters (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US Erzrivale Boeing says that the airlines should decide.</seg>
<seg id="5">The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft builder vying to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul flights, and in the event of 17 to 21 November expect record orders.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the rear part of the aircraft is structured - in particular, whether there are rows with nine or ten seats, is crucial to the economic results, which should provide the new "mini-jumbo" design.</seg>
<seg id="7">Boeing claims that its modernized "777X" shall be 406 people in seats in economy class, which are more than 17 inches wide and so allow ten per line.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airbus said, the competing version of the A350 car 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in economy class, and there are nine per line.</seg>
<seg id="9">Aircraft giants share often blows on technical details by means of advertising in the trade press.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now, Airbus before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with more than 100 orders is expected to make the race, appeals directly to the public.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company recently placed an ad, which could be the start of a new ad war and donors showed a picture, in which three people squeezed sitting in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept that?"</seg>
<seg id="12">"Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats, which are narrower than regional turbo-prop aircraft," said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the face of changed eating habits are the people thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.</seg>
<seg id="14">Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the average American male between the ages of 40 and 49 has increased by 10 percent, according to the data of the US health ministry.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Taillenumfang of the male average American in the 21st century, according to US health statistics 100.8 cm.</seg>
<seg id="16">Airbus says that his rival would take a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body was the scope of the newly baptized "Jet Set" narrow.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have, as Airbus, the analysis showed that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat is lowering the quality of sleep by 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Boeing disputes the figures to the headquarters of Airbus moderation and says that it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide the balance between air fares, as airlines and interior design.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also said, according to research from the experience depends on the plane over the seat width.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It is really important, airlines to provide flexibility, so that they can do this, what they have in their view, in order to be successful," explains the flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.</seg>
<seg id="21">They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.</seg>
<seg id="22">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="23">For passengers, it is more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly an issue that can affect sales.</seg>
<seg id="24">Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting effect on the export performance of the US or Europe.</seg>
<seg id="25">As Reuters reported in July for the first time, the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets.</seg>
<seg id="26">Both Airbus and Boeing say 20 percent more efficiency per seat in its latest two-engine long-haul designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.</seg>
<seg id="27">Boeing's statements on the results depend, in part, for the 777X is compared with its ten seats per series with the original design of nine seats in the 777.</seg>
<seg id="28">The increased cost per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per line.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Boeing squeezes therefore more seats in his plane to make it more competitive for our products," says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort in the European Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand, say analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row with existing feature indicated that many passengers opted for the closer arrangement, which could go hand in hand with cheaper air fares.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Eighteen-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer controlled by the threat of the 777," said Mary Kirby, an expert for cabin no direction, founder and editor of runway Girl Network.</seg>
<seg id="32">Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers, from which the airlines can choose.</seg>
<seg id="33">The passenger jet salesman world have even tape measure in itself, in order to give the establishment in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even if they advertise the comfort, but all manufacturers also offer jets with hochverdichteter design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.</seg>
<seg id="35">Airbus offers a ten-seat A350 series, but has not yet sold, according to his own words.</seg>
<seg id="36">Until recently, Airbus has stressed how important is more adaptability of cabins and offered for some jets wide seats in the corridors.</seg>
<seg id="37">Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably fizzle, but could distract from the wave of 777X-sales.</seg>

<seg id="9">"The conviction, but not only because of the food, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather normal leather.</seg>
<seg id="10">He realized that this is also in other everyday concerns without animal products.</seg>
<seg id="11">First and foremost is vegan be an ethics.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I do not want animals have to die for me," says Proctor, the maxim of vegans, which extends to the entire consumer behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="13">Instead of burgers, dated or rubber bear behind to grieve, have increased the vegan quickly discovered in new products, the enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It is a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, vegan be no surrender, no asceticism, but it is an asset." The assumption that it leads with the diet of the selection of dining options externalities, Proctor rather on the power of habit.</seg>
<seg id="15">And this very conditioning also left some well-intentioned attempts fail.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The addiction is a crucial factor that makes many give up quickly, as with smoking," Proctor is a comparison.</seg>
<seg id="17">And if a "certain tastes are not the animal."</seg>
<seg id="18">Often it is the spices or the kind of preparation, which make up the taste.</seg>
<seg id="19">"You can also create the same effect in other ways," shows the vegan.</seg>
<seg id="20">At a Barbecue festival brings Proctor, for example, eggplant, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages with.</seg>
<seg id="21">He is committed to a balanced and varied diet, in which it is supposed to taste even proper.</seg>
<seg id="22">Of course, we would like to have something between the teeth, which is legitimate.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It should taste, but that is not only to reduce animal food," said Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="24">Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread adoption, he had not suffered.</seg>
<seg id="25">For me, the conversion had a positive side.</seg>
<seg id="26">I am not a foreign cholesterol and have an increased share of vitamins.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are high-performance athletes who are exclusively vegan diet.</seg>
<seg id="28">"My blood values are well, I am often check," Proctor reveals.</seg>
<seg id="29">In particular, many Vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="30">"As animals are fed with animal feed, rather than on the pasture to graze, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 share in the flesh, which buys it in the freezer, is high," Proctor will take place.</seg>
<seg id="31">There is also the possibility that nicotine in the form of pills to take him for a vegan.</seg>
<seg id="32">"My B12-values are in order," he says.</seg>
<seg id="33">Long distances to Proctor does not go to the food supply.</seg>
<seg id="34">Basic foodstuffs are finally everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.</seg>
<seg id="35">I think everything that I need on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="36">I only buy something special from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="37">"A lot of people overlook the fact that it is only the finished products are expensive, but it is also known for" ordinary "finished products."</seg>
<seg id="38">In any case, is the preparation veganer courts far cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly believed.</seg>
<seg id="39">"There is a lot to discover in the kitchen of the house, with a few small tips can be good, if not better results in part," Proctor said.</seg>
<seg id="40">Margarine instead of butter, a bit more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake Proctor could also bring his in-laws in wonder.</seg>
<seg id="41">Family firm adds a new spice of the vegan.</seg>
<seg id="42">The dynamic is that if you cook together, it has a new significance.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The situations that can arise in this are as diverse as the people themselves," Proctor said.</seg>
<seg id="44">Of course he was also shown already skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="45">No longer tastes you my food?</seg>
<seg id="46">"Should I now feel bad, because I drink milk?" - on such issues, we must act as a vegan tact.</seg>
<seg id="47">"I do not reject the people, I am part of this society," like Proctor no enclaves being confined.</seg>
<seg id="48">Strikes and looked at the everyday world then not so vegan foreign as suspects - and the vegan not as restricted as commonly believed in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="49">Fast food is also allowed.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fries are everywhere!</seg>
<seg id="51">"Many Döner shops offer falafel at, or just a vegetarian Yufka," Proctor said.</seg>
<seg id="52">He is in a pizzeria on pasta dishes, or order a pizza without cheese, everything is a matter of habit.</seg>
<seg id="53">The restaurants are so slowly to be prepared for it.</seg>
<seg id="54">"When I started 13 years ago to feed my vegan, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealanders can find a development: "Talk to people, they warn."</seg>
<seg id="55">"If sufficient demand, they are perhaps inclined to complement the menu," he hopes.</seg>
<seg id="56">Vegane restaurants develop, such as the galley in Mannheim or café bird-free.</seg>
<seg id="57">Proctor has the desire that other restaurants also have at least one veganes court are on the menu.</seg>
<seg id="58">In fact, vegan dishes are there for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="59">Anyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="60">"Meat dishes are against this exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they are different from," Proctor said.</seg>
<seg id="61">"If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a safe way to make the greatest part from the outset impossible," Proctor said.</seg>
<seg id="62">But the shopping veganer products could be rather difficult at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="63">Especially if you can learn to understand that's also contain animal additives in peanuts as a color donor, seems to leave you with the courage of the ethics compliance with so many hurdles and traps.</seg>
<seg id="64">Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives," explains the many ingredients that are buried food and cleaning products.</seg>
<seg id="65">"Gradually developed a scanner views and white, in which characters and logos to respect you," It is sometimes better small steps to do than stop or stumble, "Proctor knows.</seg>
<seg id="66">The veganism, he is an important moral finger show that proposes on awareness.</seg>
<seg id="67">Perhaps he creates it not quite that one rediscovers his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critical.</seg>

<seg id="1">New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking of the oxygen</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun on smoking.</seg>
<seg id="3">A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine cravings for a lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="4">Further tests are needed before tests on humans, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can even help millions of smokers who tried to quit smoking and have tried all methods available on the market, but had to witness that nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," said Cornell.</seg>
<seg id="6">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">The virus infected selectively the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker is not a nicotine-High.</seg>
<seg id="9">In experiments vaccinated mice, which was administered nicotine, retained their normal level of activity.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, would have taken a "break", said the researchers, a sign that the nicotine have reached their brains.</seg>
<seg id="11">The experiments are described in the journal Science translational Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="12">Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="13">The vaccinations had to be made to maintain the Antikörperpegels so often that they were expensive and impractical.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the costs of the new vaccine are likely to be much lower because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.</seg>
<seg id="15">As Professor Crystal said, could be a future vaccine for people, if he is sure to be administered to children, before they came into temptation to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine addiction.</seg>
<seg id="16">More likely, however, is that smokers would use him to quit.</seg>
<seg id="17">"They know that if they re-start to smoke, they feel no more pleasure in it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to abandon the habit," he explained.</seg>
<seg id="18">British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned at the same time, there is still a need for more research.</seg>

<seg id="1">Egypt sworn first freely elected president</seg>
<seg id="2">Mohammed Morsi sets their oath of office, but his day of Triumph will not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt," when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, and thus took up the succession of Hosni Mubarak, who had been driven from office 16 months earlier.</seg>
<seg id="4">With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi was also the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="5">He put the oath before the 18 judges of the court, which has its seat on the Nile dressed in black robes and is inspired by an ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Morsi, a trained engineer and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group in the United States, the most since its inception 84 years ago as a banned organization had been targeted by the respective government sharply.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building, as Morsi arrived shortly after 11 p.m. local time in a small car convoy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to the new president zuzujubeln, and in contrast to the presidential pomp from the Mubarak era, the traffic was stopped for a short time, so that the auto convoy was able to cross the usually bustling street, which connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="10">As uncharismatisches "spare tire" of the Brotherhood mocked his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to bring the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak to your destination.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state today," said the judges in the wood-panelled chamber of Morsi dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, his oath of office in August.</seg>
<seg id="12">Morsi later went to the University of Cairo, where he should keep his inaugural speech.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was officially welcomed by a military band played the national anthem, which he listened to in Habachtstellung.</seg>
<seg id="14">The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.</seg>
<seg id="15">On his arrival he was greeted with chanting, "The army and the people are one hand" of hundreds of those present in the main auditorium of the university.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Cairo University built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education has become a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="17">Morsi presented on Friday a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the uprising, which led to the end of Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers, which the SCAF had taken over from the hunted leader from office.</seg>
<seg id="18">But with the drop of the official oath before the court and not as usual before Parliament prevents it is the will of the military, which shows that the power struggle will continue.</seg>
<seg id="19">Morsi's speech on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines collects fees for hand luggage</seg>
<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans to ask for up to 100 dollars of passengers who want to store on their flight hand luggage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even if to read in the announcement on Wednesday was that passengers are likely to keep the whole box.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new fee applies to hand luggage in the overhead baggage compartment on the seat, small bags under the seat remain free.</seg>
<seg id="5">Frontier said that you calculate 25 US dollars, if the fee will be paid in advance, and $100 for passengers who paid only at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="6">Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said that the fee of $100 is geared towards that, to move travelers to care in the run-up to the payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We do not want this sum charge," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airlines began to demand that, for the first and second checked baggage fees in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="9">Passengers who have tried to circumvent them so plugged into the hand luggage as much as possible, with the result that the baggage compartments on the seat are often overcrowded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fees are a way to persuade passengers to take less on board.</seg>
<seg id="11">O'Malley said that with the new fee, it was not really trying to make money.</seg>
<seg id="12">They go to the most loyal customers of Frontier, which would have clearly expressed that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the specialist on the seat.</seg>
<seg id="13">Passengers who buy your tickets on the website of the airline, do not have to pay.</seg>
<seg id="14">This means that a passenger at the gate of Frontier, under certain circumstances, can take a piece of luggage for free, but the next person must pay $100 for a similar baggage.</seg>
<seg id="15">O'Malley said, the website of frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed about the fee before they came to the gate.</seg>
<seg id="16">The new hand baggage fee of frontier enters into force only in the summer, an exact date is not yet there.</seg>
<seg id="17">Passengers often grumble about baggage surcharges and other fees, but airlines like to take it back.</seg>
<seg id="18">They argue that the transportation of the baggage cost money and passengers should pay the service if they wanted him.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines have enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Most have so far, however, the finger of charges for hand luggage.</seg>
<seg id="21">Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years before the first charges for hand luggage and later followed all Giant Air, also a low-cost airlines.</seg>
<seg id="22">The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian WIZZ Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, closely followed by the additional fees.</seg>
<seg id="23">He estimated in a report in December 2011 that the hand baggage fee equals Spirit of US $50 million a year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position in Midwest Airlines, has recently flown with Spirit and was curious to know what he would expect at the gate if passengers were faced with the company's unusual hand baggage fee.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The boarding process was one of the most fluid, which I have seen in my career in aviation," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">I expected to see gnashing and vehement discussions at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding ran as lubricated."</seg>
<seg id="28">Frontier spirit will also be asked for $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice.</seg>
<seg id="29">The company said that passengers who bought juice or lemonade are likely to keep the whole can and will be filled with coffee for free.</seg>
<seg id="30">Water is still free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="31">Us Airways had tried for a short time in 2008 to demand money for soft drinks, had made it back seven months later, after passengers complained and was pulled after no other major company.</seg>
<seg id="32">Frontiers step to collect fees for the hand baggage, if passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative, with the customer should be drawn to the website.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz $10 to 25 / sold ticket.</seg>
<seg id="34">That all societies provides an incentive to move passengers to buy directly from them rather than an online travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frontier has gone furthest in this area, however.</seg>
<seg id="36">In September, the company began to book through an online travel agency only half as many frequent flyer miles to forgive.</seg>
<seg id="37">On Wednesday, the miles were reduced to 25 percent of the route again.</seg>
<seg id="38">A flight booked with a third party about 1,000 miles with Frontier brings customers therefore only 250 miles.</seg>
<seg id="39">Passengers can also reserve exclusively at the direct purchase on the website of Frontier places.</seg>
<seg id="40">Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.</seg>
<seg id="41">The proceeds went back to 9 percent and the flight capacity shrank nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, as can be read in the financial report, which was published by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc., on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="42">Republic has tried to get a grip on the finances of frontier as part of the sale of the company.</seg>

<seg id="3">Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US state of Georgia was found in an upright mat on January 11, which was behind the gallery in the school gym.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Lowndes County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but with the family of the 17-year-olds can doubt.</seg>
<seg id="5">"They are convinced that her son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Lincoln Johnson, to FoxNews.com.</seg>

<seg id="1">John Kerry said in an unprecedented acknowledgement that the US spy is "inappropriate gone too far"</seg>
<seg id="2">John Kerry indicated with an unexpected admission of a slackening of the defensive attitude of the United States in terms of their surveillance programs, saying that the espionage has gone too far in certain cases "inappropriate."</seg>
<seg id="3">The foreign minister, in addition to that he bore the responsibility that we have switched on "autopilot" together with Barack Obama, as the explosive revelations of the whistleblowers Edward Snowden were publicly about the NSA's spying activities.</seg>
<seg id="4">The leaked information, the US government is caught in a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a speech transmitted by video link at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said, "without question the president and I and others in the government have experienced by some things that are expired almost on autopilot, simply because there was the ability to do so, even to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, dates from the 11th of September."</seg>
<seg id="6">He then acknowledged as the first high-ranking member of the US government that the US espionage have crossed a line, also stressed that no rights had been abused.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said: "It is inappropriate in some cases have gone too far."</seg>
<seg id="8">The president is determined to create clarity, and therefore leads through a thorough investigation, so no one has to have the feeling here find abuse took place.</seg>
<seg id="9">I assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be affected.</seg>
<seg id="10">Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and through its surveillance operations had been saved many lives.</seg>
<seg id="11">He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to break itself into the air."</seg>
<seg id="12">There is a radical extremism in the world, the crazy point is to kill people, to break into the air and attacking governments.</seg>
<seg id="13">What would be, if you would be able to intercept it and to stop before it happens?</seg>
<seg id="14">We have, in fact, plane crashes, prevent attacks on buildings and the killing of people, because we have experienced in the run-up to such plans.</seg>
<seg id="15">Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe in order to allay the concerns against the alleged American espionage and to convince the Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the United States, in anti-terror efforts, such as the chairman of the Senate Committee on European Affairs said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke this week with representatives of the European Parliament and others and is no longer concerned about their threats because of frustration with the surveillance by the National Security Agency to take part in anti-terror organizations.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans remain on board in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who sits as a Democrat for the first time in the Senate and as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and European affairs, in an interview in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="18">I go to Europe, in order to make it clear that we need to continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger over the NSA programs.</seg>
<seg id="19">Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe, have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the secret service said this week that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the meta data collected by NATO allies and had been exchanged with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">Other revelations quoted from documents provided by Snowden further that the NSA had monitored the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other leaders around the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the spying on allies as necessary and explained that this is common on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="22">In all the uproar, Murphy said, his bureau before the journey of the congress, which will take place this year, and hoped that the delegation will include members from both parties and chambers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The names of the other participating members are to be published in the next few days.</seg>
<seg id="24">He said that the exact itinerary will be worked out.</seg>
<seg id="25">While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip is the improvement of relations, said he also said that there would be some "serious words'.</seg>
<seg id="26">He said that the European governments need to be honest with their people on the kind of espionage programs that use them for years.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Although we can change our surveillance programs and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones that spy," says Murphy.</seg>
<seg id="28">Meanwhile stands for John Kerry over the weekend and a trip to the Middle East to Poland to deal with the resentment over the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities there.</seg>

<seg id="2">The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave, because his daughters become pregnant and therefore could benefit from it.</seg>

<seg id="1">ESA decides on major space missions: Missions for billion</seg>
<seg id="2">Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts of the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.</seg>
<seg id="3">30 proposals were to choose from, five are still in the race.</seg>
<seg id="4">Distant worlds.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than 1000 planet with other stars, astronomers have already found.</seg>
<seg id="6">Whether there is life on some of them at least, nobody knows.</seg>
<seg id="7">The selection is difficult: Are we to look for gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="8">Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?</seg>
<seg id="9">Or search for planets within a billion years and thus perhaps discover alien life?</seg>
<seg id="10">These questions are the leaders of the European Space Agency ESA.</seg>
<seg id="11">For its programme "Cosmic Vision" they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will significantly advance the research.</seg>
<seg id="12">The budget for such "L-missions" each is approximately one billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="13">The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the beginning of September, the elite of the European Space Research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.</seg>
<seg id="15">30 ideas were on the table, five of them are now come in the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">Many bodies examine the proposals, push for the researchers.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the next few days a final decision by the scientific program committee should fall.</seg>
<seg id="18">A total of four major issues, the ESA has selected on the missions of the programme initiated in 2007 "Cosmic Vision" to find answers.</seg>
<seg id="19">What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?</seg>
<seg id="20">The exact transactions in the birth of stars from major gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets orbiting the star - are still in the proverbial dark.</seg>
<seg id="21">A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.</seg>
<seg id="22">And when a star has planets, under what circumstances can result in life?</seg>
<seg id="23">To investigate this matter, is due to start in 2017, the space telescope "last" with the 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity to be examined in detail.</seg>
<seg id="24">The possibilities are limited, his is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.</seg>
<seg id="25">With larger instruments could astronomers first step planet map and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and search for "biomarkers": Gases that apply as an indication of biological activity.</seg>
<seg id="26">How does the solar system?</seg>
<seg id="27">This question, too, is ultimately intended to indicate what conditions there are for the emergence of life.</seg>
<seg id="28">Plays an important role the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field, as well as the particle radiation emitted by him with the planetary system.</seg>
<seg id="29">In our solar system, you can examine these events as an example.</seg>
<seg id="30">With the "Solar Orbiter" the ESA has already approved the budget for a mission of the M-class (there is about half a billion euros) for this issue.</seg>
<seg id="31">The probe is expected to start in 2017 and closely monitor surface and activity of the sun.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also of great interest to the researchers are Jupiter and its moons.</seg>
<seg id="33">They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.</seg>
<seg id="34">For this, the ESA provides for the first of the three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.</seg>
<seg id="35">The probe "juice" (Jupiter icy moons Explorer) begins its journey to 2022.</seg>
<seg id="36">Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is designed to study the atmosphere of the planet, as well as the icy moons Europa, Ganymede and Kallisto.</seg>
<seg id="37">What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?</seg>
<seg id="38">The space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws we know there are still valid.</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps also found discrepancies that physicists could point the way to a new theory, under whose umbrella to unite all known laws.</seg>
<seg id="40">What is the universe created and what is it?</seg>
<seg id="41">13.7 billion years ago our universe created by the Big Bang.</seg>
<seg id="42">In addition to the household matter to us from the stars, planets and life as we are, there are dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy, whose work is accelerating the expansion of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="43">So far the researchers know not what physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy remain.</seg>
<seg id="44">With "Euclid," the ESA has also has already approved a M-mission, whose launch is scheduled for 2020.</seg>
<seg id="45">With a special telescope to study the probe of the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky and allow such conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.</seg>
<seg id="46">Who could make the race</seg>
<seg id="47">Only two of the 30 proposals will be left at the end of the selection process.</seg>
<seg id="48">The best chance for a permit as L-mission, in the opinion of many experts "e-Lisa," an ambitious concept for the detection of gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="49">Including physicists understand changes in the structure of the space-time that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="50">To this day, they do not have been proven.</seg>
<seg id="51">Elisa could do this, the scientists behind the project hope.</seg>
<seg id="52">The mission provides for a detector of two or three probes, which is stationed in space.</seg>
<seg id="53">He could, in contrast to plants on Earth, prove gravitational waves that have emerged from the Big Bang, and provide new insights about the formation of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="54">Four other proposals still compete at the second L mission: A large X-ray telescope called Athena, "which, among other things, is to explore black holes," icy planets, "another mission to the outer planets of the solar system," prism, "a mission to survey the cosmic background radiation, and the" Exoplanet finder, "the first step is to detect and investigate planets.</seg>
<seg id="55">Already eliminated include proposals for sample-return transport from the exploration of the moon, Mars, Venus and asteroids as well as solar physics.</seg>

<seg id="1">U.S. border: "Super-tunnel" for drug smuggling, discovered</seg>
<seg id="2">On the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling and shut down.</seg>
<seg id="3">As the US Customs told, the more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three suspects have been arrested so, eight tons of marijuana, and seized nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine.</seg>
<seg id="5">The tunnel, according to the data has not yet been taken into use.</seg>
<seg id="6">"These cartels are stupid if they think they could by digging under the radar," said the prosecutor-general of the U.S. District of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.</seg>
<seg id="7">Written to the drug gangs assured Duffy: "If you continue to build such tunnels and tried to use it, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."</seg>
<seg id="8">Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long-term fight against the drug cartels.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since 2006, more than 77 000 people in connection with the drug crime were killed in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="10">Designed by experts</seg>
<seg id="11">Because of the expensive equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers, and that the construction took about a year to complete.</seg>
<seg id="12">The railway track was so equipped that could be used in electric-powered cars.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the Mexican side is the access in a building, which is 80 meters away from the border.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters in depth to the actual tunnel entrance.</seg>
<seg id="15">The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimeters in width.</seg>
<seg id="16">He would have been suitable with it in order to encourage illegal immigration to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two of the suspects have been arrested in connection with the cocaine-Fund.</seg>
<seg id="18">The third party, a Mexican, was taken as a result of marijuana confiscated.</seg>
<seg id="19">All three face a maximum sentence of life-long imprisonment, as officials said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Since 2006 were eight such tunnels have been discovered, said at the press conference in San Diego.</seg>
<seg id="21">But it is the first time that cocaine was found in such a slump.</seg>
<seg id="22">Usually, cocaine smuggled in small quantities and not through tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="23">This shows the "desperation" of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes are now cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug investigation in San Diego.</seg>
<seg id="24">They would do everything to get to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="25">No details have been announced to the detainees, at least one is Mexicans, they said.</seg>
<seg id="26">They must reckon with prison sentences of up to 10 years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parents of inter-sexual children can choose "gender vague."</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany is the first European nation, in which a third gender is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitals.</seg>
<seg id="3">Newborn will no longer rigidly assigned to male or female.</seg>
<seg id="4">Under the new law, parents must declare no more sex for such children, but can specify "vague" or "no limit" on the birth certificate.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents, so that they do not have to make hasty decisions in terms of operations for a gender assignment in newborns, and to fight against the discrimination of inter-sexual people.</seg>
<seg id="6">An inter-sexual person said according to the BBC years later: "I am neither man nor woman."</seg>
<seg id="7">I stand by the patchwork, which was created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year is not a boy or a girl to the world.</seg>
<seg id="9">They belong to the inter-sexual, a group that fall under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disturbance" (DSD), an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovary or testis) or unusually developed genitals.</seg>
<seg id="10">Wallis Simpson was possibly Inter sexually.</seg>
<seg id="11">The understanding of the gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts advise to do so in the United States, you should use the best available information on gender assignment, if a provision is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child, before you decide - if at all - for an operation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said that the new German law "it for a good cause."</seg>
<seg id="13">Inter-sexual children represent an ethical dilemma.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require a surgical operation, but for most children are not," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">We can make a gender assignment without surgery, and then to see how to develop the identity.</seg>
<seg id="16">The scientific data about how a child ever developed its gender identity are not very accurate.</seg>
<seg id="17">No one knows why it happens.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is like the mystery of why people are gay.</seg>
<seg id="19">In a report to the European Commission for the year 2011 states that inter-sexual people are different from transsexual and transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but due to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.</seg>
<seg id="20">These properties were in for tier sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones.</seg>
<seg id="21">The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced the inter-sexual, and transgender people in the workplace, as well as on the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not consistent with the image of gender boys now have a special camp.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is now possible on official documents indicate male, female or "third sex" for adults in Australia and Nepal.</seg>
<seg id="24">In June, Australians Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "gender-free" person, after a court had granted the lifetime maintenance of an "unspecified" gender status.</seg>
<seg id="25">German cards have a third allocation in the future as well as M and W, X for Inter sexually, so the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
<seg id="26">In neighboring France are gender issues still controversial, as a news story on France 24.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2011, dozens of French Members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from school books.</seg>
<seg id="28">The US Catholic Online Web site has also spoken out against the German law, on the grounds that "if the world is dragged into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we twist two other pillars of civilization."</seg>
<seg id="29">The mother of a newborn from Maryland told baby zone, they think it would be better if babies at birth will be assigned to a sex.</seg>
<seg id="30">"The parents' life is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if we do not know the sex of their child," she told the parents' website.</seg>
<seg id="31">Children need stability and security.</seg>
<seg id="32">Historically, children who were born with both male and female sex parts, were described as Hermaphroditen, after the Greek god, who had both sexes.</seg>
<seg id="33">A decade ago, the medicine viewed the sex as something that could wipe out one and then rebuild.</seg>
<seg id="34">But in the meantime will be questioned the ethical foundations of an operation that is now known, how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also are wrong, because they do not know how the child feels in upbringing with the gender allocated by them.</seg>
<seg id="35">"In the middle of the 20th century called it a, psychiatric emergency", "Drescher said.</seg>
<seg id="36">If such a child was born, then, is not a psychiatrist, but the surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="37">The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who took the view that the sex was malleable.</seg>
<seg id="38">He coined the term "gender identity" and argued, social and environmental initiatives, as the parents educate a child, interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and characterized as to whether a person see as male or female.</seg>
<seg id="39">But, in a case known as the "John / Joan" from 1966, his theories were controversial.</seg>
<seg id="40">He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision, the child not to immobilised them and also to remove his testicles and then pull him as a big girl.</seg>
<seg id="41">"Money was presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, which he is not," says Drescher.</seg>
<seg id="42">When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.</seg>
<seg id="43">With 38 but he committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="44">According to the Drescher, there are still physicians who would practice this model.</seg>
<seg id="45">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, are survivors of this sex operations stepped to the public that "are not happy with the result."</seg>
<seg id="46">Such as Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY-male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.</seg>
<seg id="47">The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a satisfying life as a man.</seg>
<seg id="48">So were its external body and testicles surgically removed shortly after the birth in 1976 and he was taken as a big girl.</seg>
<seg id="49">At the age of 12 he received female hormones.</seg>
<seg id="50">"I knew that I am not a girl," he said on ABCNews.com</seg>
<seg id="51">I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="52">At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.</seg>
<seg id="53">But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.</seg>
<seg id="54">What he found was shocking.</seg>
<seg id="55">I was sterilized at my birth - and no one has ever said that to me.</seg>
<seg id="56">Bruce was born with a DSD, could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals through his body.</seg>
<seg id="57">After he had told the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and was to remove his breasts.</seg>
<seg id="58">As a result of the operation, he has become infertile.</seg>
<seg id="59">Today he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for sexual people are perceived as normal.</seg>
<seg id="60">But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the rights group based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law "to stamp and stigmatize encourage" could.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and allocate a, not determined" to the child, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="62">We fear that favours intervention.</seg>
<seg id="63">We think that it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.</seg>
<seg id="64">But still, we do not know how the law will impact, so we can only speculate.</seg>
<seg id="65">Tamar-Mattis said her organisation support the Australian law because "it gives adults the recognition as a third sex."</seg>
<seg id="66">"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.</seg>
<seg id="67">It is the German law on the allocation at birth.</seg>
<seg id="68">This is not a fight, and we should force small children at this time.</seg>
<seg id="69">When they grow up, they can decide on their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="70">But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radio login from Pitt Castle, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group supports, says that the German law "authorize" both parents and children.</seg>
<seg id="71">Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete Androgenresistenz.</seg>
<seg id="72">The goal because of faulty receptor cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="73">It has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.</seg>
<seg id="74">Today is Katie 29 and married; she works as an assistant in the child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.</seg>
<seg id="75">While she is infertile, hopes, however, to be able to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.</seg>
<seg id="76">"The law gives parents room, so they do not have to make hasty decisions," Baratz said.</seg>
<seg id="77">It gives them the time to make various tests and to clarify things and gives them time before they write "male" or "female".</seg>
<seg id="78">In this way, everything is fine - one draws the child in size and loves it.</seg>
<seg id="79">It has a wonderful baby and enjoys the parental happiness.</seg>
<seg id="80">And we must not rush to carry out an operation that cannot be undone.</seg>
<seg id="81">"That includes the children in the decision with a and removed the fear that parents concerned about, because they are of the opinion that they would not do the right thing," she explained.</seg>
<seg id="82">Ultimately decides the child on the sex that better suits him - and this is wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="83">That children will be able to make the decision himself.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British businessman has developed the first glow in the dark ice cream - with the help of jellyfish.</seg>

<seg id="4">The idea came to him after he had read a research on jellyfish and Chinese scientists have been able to convince the luminous protein artificially produce.</seg>
<seg id="5">The ice cream responded in the consumption of the tongue, which will raise the pH value in the protein and triggered the lights.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chris said, the ice-cream responsive to the warmth in the mouth and light - the more you so licks, the brighter it.</seg>
<seg id="7">Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "lick Me I'm Delicious," says: "The product is unbelievable, but still in a very early stage of production, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."</seg>
<seg id="8">The protein used in ice cream responded with the tongue in a neutral pH.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the mouth warms the protein, the pH value rises and shines the ice.</seg>
<seg id="10">We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market, because it has this wonderful contrast.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is likely to be the most expensive ice cream, which I have ever made, because the fluorescent jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.</seg>

<seg id="1">A black box in the car?</seg>
<seg id="2">American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box, which is in the dashboard of every car.</seg>
<seg id="3">The devices that record every mileage and report the information to the authorities, are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning office of the federal states to review the outdated system of financing American roads.</seg>
<seg id="4">The normally rather boring area of the road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.</seg>
<seg id="5">Libertarian have allied with environmental groups and are in favour of the government use the small boxes for the recording of the mileage - and possibly, where they were driven - and the information can then be used for the calculation of modest tax.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Tea Party is appalled.</seg>
<seg id="7">The American Civil Rights Association (UCLA) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.</seg>
<seg id="8">But, while people in Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states are no longer waiting.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are currently examining how they can switch to a system over the next ten years, at the driver a risk-mile pay.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thousands of motorists have already tested the tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="11">This really is a must for our country.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There is nothing that we may only be used," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of governments, which plans a recording of the driven miles in all California motorists in the state in 2025.</seg>
<seg id="13">The way we pay these taxes will change.</seg>
<seg id="14">The technology is there.</seg>
<seg id="15">The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded by the taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is broke.</seg>
<seg id="16">But in America is no longer so much fuel tank as before.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cars use less gasoline.</seg>
<seg id="18">The state-owned petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per litre) is not increased for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">Politicians dare not with high fuel prices to increase the tax by even a cent.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert in traffic law at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="21">His state has recently 500 cars with tachographs with which a mileage-based payment system is to be tested.</seg>
<seg id="22">"This is the most sensible alternative," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bureaucrats describe it as a mileage-based user fee.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is no surprise that the idea will appeal to urban liberals, because the tax could, for example, to try to influence the behaviour so that congestion and climate damaging emissions be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Californian planners rely on the system in the formulation of policies with which to achieve the ambitious goals set by the law of the state on climate change.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the Republicans see Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he is the most viable long-term alternative.</seg>
<seg id="27">The free marketer of the Reason Foundation are done from the idea to allow drivers to pay zurückgelegter route.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice-president for directives on reason.</seg>
<seg id="29">People pay directly for what they get.</seg>
<seg id="30">The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers, in a report in 2011, had urged the Congress to move in the direction of mileage-based billing.</seg>
<seg id="31">The US Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project, which includes 10,000 cars last year.</seg>
<seg id="32">But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the thrust and responded to the concerns of MPs from rural areas who represent people in everyday life often have to travel many miles on the way to work or in the city.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several states and cities are nonetheless moving in this direction on their own.</seg>
<seg id="34">Most committed is Oregon, which currently enlists 5,000 drivers for the biggest experiment of the country.</seg>
<seg id="35">These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nevada has already completed a pilot project.</seg>
<seg id="37">New York City is also considering such a thing.</seg>
<seg id="38">Illinois tests it in a limited way with trucks.</seg>
<seg id="39">And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), are currently investigating how one could introduce the change.</seg>
<seg id="40">The concept is not a universal hit.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were fitted with the devices, motorists were skeptical of the idea that the government could pursue its every move.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, head of the strategy and product management in the Transport Ministry of Nevada.</seg>
<seg id="43">The people did not want it.</seg>
<seg id="44">As the trial started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to transform the tachograph in mature monitoring devices."</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably would be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology, with which the state can collect the mileage, but not exactly when and where.</seg>
<seg id="47">With that, Khan, would also be free to the public.</seg>
<seg id="48">The pursuit of this technology has led some authorities on a small startup company called True mileage in California.</seg>
<seg id="49">The company is not originally taken in order to help states in the taxation of car drivers.</seg>
<seg id="50">Rather, it was their goal to gain a foothold in the emerging market for car insurance, in which drivers should pay on the basis of the driven miles.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the devices tested by her are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, which are regularly uploaded via modem.</seg>
<seg id="52">"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, managing director of True mileage.</seg>
<seg id="53">Big mistake has been made in some of these public pilot programmes.</seg>
<seg id="54">There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="55">In Oregon, the planners of this experiment to give drivers a number of choices.</seg>
<seg id="56">You can opt for a device with or without GPS.</seg>
<seg id="57">Or they choose no equipment and pay a flat rate based on the average of all the inhabitants of the federal state driven miles instead.</seg>
<seg id="58">Other authorities hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public, as they provide the equipment with more features than with little more.</seg>
<seg id="59">In New York City traffic officials want to develop a device on taxation, which is also pay parking fees, insurance must be paid only for driving distances and speed data can be collected from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers avoid traffic jams.</seg>
<seg id="60">"Motorists were motivated by the added value of the benefits offered by the system to take part," says a planning document of the city.</seg>
<seg id="61">However, some traffic planners wonder whether all the talk about the pay per mile was not just a huge red herring.</seg>
<seg id="62">At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission on the territory of the San Francisco Bay, officials said that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by simply increasing the fuel tax.</seg>
<seg id="63">An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could be imposed on motorists with hybrid cars or other vehicles that consume less gasoline, so they also pay a fair share.</seg>
<seg id="64">"There is no reason for an operation, even if an aspirin is enough," said Randy Rentschler, the head of the Commission's legislative and public affairs.</seg>
<seg id="65">If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists care about their privacy, and many other things.</seg>

<seg id="15">Six years ago, thoughts on the creation of an artificial turf sport Square came on what was widely regarded as the ultimate solution.</seg>
<seg id="16">Concrete plans were included two years ago, when the FC took over the Chronicle Schabelstube, pledged a cost of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the place and the country approved funding of EUR 104 000.</seg>
<seg id="17">The council decided in October 2012 the acquisition of the remaining EUR 356 million of the total cost of EUR 560 000, summarised Klumpp together.</seg>

<seg id="2">Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the American secret service, has said he is prepared to travel to Berlin and in the German Bundestag to say if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander be no answers on their activities.</seg>
<seg id="3">The German MEP Hans-Christian Stroebele met Snowden in Russia, where it has received asylum on Thursday to discuss with him the statement in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a letter from Snowden, which was presented on Friday by the media in Berlin Stroebele, writes this: "Even if the result of my endeavours was demonstrably positive, treated my government continue to break a dissenting opinion as loyalty and tried to criminalize political expression with criminal threat in defence is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="5">To tell the truth, however, is not a crime.</seg>
<seg id="6">Snowden writes in the letter, he was convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charges against him.</seg>
<seg id="7">The collected by the US Department of Justice indictment includes espionage and theft of state property.</seg>
<seg id="8">The German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said over time online: "If Mr Snowden is prepared to talk with German representatives, we will find ways to allow that."</seg>
<seg id="9">Relations between the United States and Germany are burdened by the allegations that the NSA had bugged the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thomas Oppermann, the MEP, who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret services, said that we should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if that is possible, "without prejudice to him and completely ruining relations with the US."</seg>
<seg id="11">Stroebele, a member of the Greens, posted a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stroebele said that, according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia, if he leave the country.</seg>
<seg id="14">If Snowden said in Germany, then he needs an assurance that he was "sure" that the Member.</seg>
<seg id="15">Snowden said in his letter that he would face a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that have driven him from his home country.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, he is touched by the worldwide response to "my act of political expression."</seg>
<seg id="17">People around the world, as well as senior politicians, including in the United States, have described the revelations about an uncontrolled comprehensive monitoring system as a credit to the general public.</seg>
<seg id="18">In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation, "if the problems have been resolved around the humanitarian situation" of the German authorities.</seg>

<seg id="1">Security concerns in Mozambique grow in light of clashes between influential personalities</seg>
<seg id="2">Thousands of people gathered in the centre Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of the founder and first president of Mozambique, Samora Machel, call for peace in a rare public demonstration crowing.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We want peace, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.</seg>
<seg id="4">Out of fear for the future of the country, it has exchanged their business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription "We want security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd at the Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement for over 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, which was initially supported by the apartheid government of South Africa from white-ruled Rhodesia and later in a bid to destabilise the country's independent government.</seg>
<seg id="7">After the peace treaty of 1992, it has become an opposition party.</seg>
<seg id="8">Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country back into a full-blown conflict trap, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.</seg>
<seg id="9">Much is at stake for the rapidly growing economy, since the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the north-west could investment of more than $50 billion over the next few years by companies such as Rio tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko bring into the country from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="10">The ruling FRELIMO party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo are blaming each other for the tensions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Renamo claims that the government had provoked the latest clashes, with its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold on 17 October Renamos, had attacked.</seg>
<seg id="12">The attacks on the former rebels escalated, when government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, said Renamos spokesman told the Financial Times.</seg>
<seg id="13">The government is Renamo the blame for the clashes and accused the organization to have attacked soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="14">President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability.</seg>
<seg id="15">With AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regard themselves as "losers" who "wants to use all his remaining forces in order to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government."</seg>
<seg id="16">Both FRELIMO and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the concerns have grown since Mazanga was cited with the words, Renamo acknowledge the 1992 peace agreement.</seg>
<seg id="18">With the FT, he said that he had meant that FRELIMO no longer respect the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Our vision is to restart negotiations and seriously," Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolve the tensions that have been fired by a series of clashes this year.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) that the heads collide here," says Joseph'Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique-expert.</seg>
<seg id="22">None of them is good in the negotiation and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Renamo, which pushes on electoral reform, has already declared that it will boycott the municipal elections in November.</seg>
<seg id="24">Presidential and legislative elections are planned for next year.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as the attempt of an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial incentives from the government.</seg>
<seg id="26">Renamos electoral success shrink since 1992, during a recent party founded by a former Renamo member Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), probably will improve in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mazanga claimed that Guebuza, whose resignation comes when his second term ends next year, wanted to destroy the country's democracy.</seg>
<seg id="28">"He wants no multi-party democracy, it wants no transparent elections that he does not want peace, because he does not want to abandon the presidency," said Mazanga.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has made disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south connections.</seg>
<seg id="30">Most fighting took place in the Sofala province, which lies a few hundred miles north of Maputo, Beira but finds itself in, the port, the use of coal mining companies like Rio tinto and Vale for export.</seg>
<seg id="31">In June, Rio for a month is the use of the railways, after Renamo had announced an attack on the track.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat that threat.</seg>
<seg id="33">Renamo "wanted to warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="34">The instability have increased the frustration over the government yet, says Fernando Lima, Head of Media coop, an independent media company, because a lot of people were concerned earlier because of corruption, the slow progress in development and a recent kidnapping wave.</seg>
<seg id="35">"People think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.</seg>
<seg id="36">Omar sultans, a protestor, said that the people simply wanted stability.</seg>
<seg id="37">"No interest Renamo and FRELIMO, they just want to restore peace and usable roads," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">President Barack Obama's closest advisers have secretly considered to replace Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton, the New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">The revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark get and John healthy man on the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book and they reported on Thursday evening that the Presidential Topberater had carried out "extensive group meetings and surveys by the end of 2011" to find out whether it look better for Obama's dwindling hopes of re-election, when he will be Biden.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent of the Times, is the book thoroughly in the history of the efforts from senior officials of the campaign and the White House, notably of former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect they have on the poll numbers, the former Secretary of State Clinton to trade against the vice president.</seg>
<seg id="6">The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only half a dozen of the President's closest advisors, including Daley, Obama's former campaign manager, Jim Messina, and the former White House senior adviser, David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew about the planned changes.</seg>
<seg id="8">In "Double Down" claim, Daley have been at the forefront of efforts, Biden despite their "close personal relationship" exchange, before it is finally decided against such a move, after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy "would" not significantly improve Obama's chances.</seg>
<seg id="9">In an interview with Martin confirmed Daley that the government had actually considered to replace Biden with Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I made a whole series of things that should consider it, and this was one of them," said Daley the magazine.</seg>
<seg id="11">It must be remembered that the president at that time had terrible poll numbers, so we thought: "For God's sake, what do we do?"</seg>
<seg id="12">While Daley described the investigation as "due diligence", said Martin to Anderson Cooper of CNN that had been operated during the campaign for the re-election of considerable effort to find out whether such a move is in relation to the ballot box auszahle.</seg>
<seg id="13">"In campaigns is not spent so much money on surveys and focus groups, if you don't think seriously about something," said Martin on AC360.</seg>
<seg id="14">But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange.</seg>
<seg id="15">Martin said on CNN, he said Daley asked whether his former boss on the potential change would have known about it.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although Daley has said that he does not believe that the President was aware of the possible change ",", the former chief admitted that it was "possible" that Obama was aware of them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Martin added that "Double Down" would not deliver a definitive answer to the question of whether the political soundings reached Obama's desk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Cooper asked Martin whether he had seriously think Obama knew nothing of the investigation on whether one should drop Biden in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Possible," Martin replied.</seg>

<seg id="2">Whenever it comes in council meetings around the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.</seg>
<seg id="3">The herd Gemeindesäckl cheeks-Schönach is well stocked and debt no longer knows the administration since 2005.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this sense, the 2012 financial year can also be booked as an unqualified success.</seg>
<seg id="5">This was evident in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">As Andrea Roth mouth explained, is the administrative budget with approximately 7.6 million euros over a million euros higher than planned.</seg>
<seg id="7">The surplus of the administrative budget also lies with about EUR 1.8 million around a million euros on the approach.</seg>
<seg id="8">The result was the surplus mainly higher corporate tax revenue and the local share of the income tax.</seg>
<seg id="9">The capital budget was again well above the planned values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Instead of the proposed EUR 1.5 million he averaged 2.5 million euros last year.</seg>
<seg id="11">"This is essentially on the higher feed from the administrative budget," says Roth mouth.</seg>
<seg id="12">There have been fewer investments have been made as planned, is also the reserve feeding higher in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="13">Overall, the general reserve could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million now.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Roth mouth and her team for the good work.</seg>
<seg id="15">"As a work shakes you not just from the sleeve," praised renaissance with a view of the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="16">He and the municipal councils were visibly on the good figures.</seg>
<seg id="17">It may sound paradoxical, but these very good figures, the public could soon pay dearly.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through the good financial situation the county in the past could forgo high lifting rates.</seg>
<seg id="19">This, in turn, are but, according to renaissance has often been cut subsidies from the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are conditions for these grants from various compensation poles.</seg>
<seg id="21">Among other things, to apply for the grants, the cities and municipalities must show some lifting rates.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The issue of lifting rates, we need to look at us, as investment in the coming years, for which we would like grants," announced renaissance in this context.</seg>

<seg id="3">He says that Obama has commendable efforts had been thwarted by the Republican blocking tactics</seg>
<seg id="4">The blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks</seg>
<seg id="5">Obama's memoir about the 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible</seg>
<seg id="6">Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at Harvard Medical School.</seg>
<seg id="7">I read a terribly sad book at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is a book, of which I have believed that it would spot me during the sad second year of my medical degree and give me hope again.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is called "The Audacity to Win" (courage to win) and describes the memoirs of Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="10">If I am ready for dinner with my patient transcripts and go to bed, it brings me back to the book at a time when the policy inspired millions and the speeches were able to take your breath away.</seg>
<seg id="11">The election was held to a landslide victory and news spokesman to lead the historical significance of this hour before your eyes.</seg>
<seg id="12">My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers, they could find.</seg>
<seg id="13">A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
<seg id="14">As Obama into office in 2008 at that time, he had approval values of 82%.</seg>
<seg id="15">And then I close the book.</seg>
<seg id="16">Switch back to the present is a rude awakening, as if one is ripped from a dream.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is difficult to recall these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the years since I have given my voice for the first time, something has changed.</seg>
<seg id="19">But there is simply nothing that I could have imagined.</seg>
<seg id="20">I recognise the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of forced) of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="21">I also believe that the partisan blockade tactics have dumped on many efforts, with which our nation should be brought forward: Immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, just to name a few.</seg>
<seg id="22">But after countless times defended the Obama administration against colleagues and friends, I am with my statement attempt at the end.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have reached a point of political desperation.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it allows for the interception of foreign leaders or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.</seg>
<seg id="25">It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans and why whistleblower punished, to disclose government misconduct.</seg>
<seg id="26">It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was killed without trial, nor why the public financing and spending limits be circumvented during the presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id="27">It does not justify the results of a report, which states that the efforts of the White House to restrain the media are the "most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."</seg>
<seg id="28">And jüngstens cannot excuse the inability to create a simple Web site in more than three years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.</seg>
<seg id="29">I don't know if that is what I would have expected.</seg>
<seg id="30">Whether I with 18 should have understood that the government could run counter to its previous political campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="31">Apparently the Abgeordnetenamt is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events like the Newtown massacre shape the public debate.</seg>
<seg id="32">But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.</seg>
<seg id="33">And that bothers me the most.</seg>
<seg id="34">I have re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative, he seemed unable to determine its direction and positions.</seg>
<seg id="36">I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would comply with the hope that we had heard for so long.</seg>
<seg id="37">But with the sinking of the approval ratings for Obama to below 45% this week has become the return in 2008 by this book so much harder.</seg>
<seg id="38">It awakens in me the desire for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.</seg>
<seg id="39">This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama had to plug a heavy loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania.</seg>
<seg id="40">In a meeting with the electoral agents after the decision, he told his staff that they must come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.</seg>
<seg id="41">"I would like us to find the magic," he said.</seg>
<seg id="42">We must remind us who we are.</seg>
<seg id="43">Five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree more.</seg>
