Anger over sentence for Bali bomber
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who came in 2002 in the bombing in Bali killed reacted angry at the verdict for the last of the instigator, who was dropped as Umar Patek should be summarily in their opinion in court.
Patek, who yesterday for his role in the construction of explosive devices for the bombing almost ten years as one of the most wanted persons of Southeast Asia on the run, was sentenced to a prison term of 20 years.
With suspended sentences, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was the mass murder found guilty because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
A guilty verdict was also in a series of terrorism-related charges, which included a wave of bombing on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor asked for a life sentence, also if it for the man, because of his reputation as a Masterful bomb-maker as "demolition man" called, could have requested the death penalty.
The decision has aroused painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who has lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago.
Fighting tears, she said Patek had to be sentenced to death.
I mean, really, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"One should ask him before a firing squad," said Corteen to AAP.
I have to live every day, that I will receive no other grandchildren and I never see my daughters.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground, when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 23: 00 exploded a huge bomb in a small van, which was parked outside the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploding a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell after the attack for a month in a coma, and "died" three times while he was on a life-support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah financial - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the massacre were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.
Life to him - no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
20 years after he has killed 202 people and injured hundreds, not much is to get.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers, who was in court.
He turned away from this almost a decade of the arrest, was captured but eventually in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces earlier al Qaeda chief Osama bin almost four months later killed shop.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had provided the note, that Patek was in Pakistan, bin to make loading with the aim to rebuild the connection between Southeast Asian terror groups and al-Qaeda.
"He has not made himself" Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for it, how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict was issued before the ten-year anniversary of the attack in this year, which is celebrated with commemoration in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can appeal even against his judgment.
