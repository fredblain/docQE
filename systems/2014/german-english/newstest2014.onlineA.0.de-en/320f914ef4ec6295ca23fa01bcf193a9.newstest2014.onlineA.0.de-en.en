Norway: Norwegian place makes light up with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, a Norwegian village residents have brought light dark Valley.
Because of the low Sun incidence degree the Rjukan in the Vestfjord Valley, from autumn until spring usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains.
With three giant reflectors in 45 metres above sea level, a century's dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!", Mayor Steinar raved about hill country at the launch ceremony at the TV station TV2.
Some Valley residents pushed themselves along sun chairs, others as a precaution put on sunglasses.
So far, Sun had to drive in the winter with a cable car to a nearby Summit.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors in the Valley.
This basic idea is there but since 1913 in the village.
After several years of debate, the City Council had adopted finally the 5 million crowns (about 615 000 euro) project.
A similar construction gives the Italian edge Viganella winter sunshine for several years.
