It was located in the middle of the rock face - 15 meters from the top and the bottom.
During their rescue, she moved a muscle - it was stiff as frozen.
But now it's fine.
She ate a few dog biscuits.
It was a pretty unusual usage.
The fact that the dog was discovered, is incredible.
Peter LAU, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a big happiness."

Ruby was taken to the vet's Office to investigate, but found nothing except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall in Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "to watch the rescue was scary."
I couldn't believe that she was really there.
It was wonderful to hold again in the arms.
The vet said if would be the exhaustion has become too large and they collapsed, she would be probably crashed.
The firefighters have done great.
It was really brave, what they have done.
We are just so thankful and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "we were afraid that she would fall off, but it stayed up."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
