Foreign workers on 457 visas could be subject to "Authenticity test"
The Government thinks extended measures over an "authenticity"test for foreign workers with 457 visa.
If the test was introduced, he came over to use a criterion that is intended to prevent that the 457 to fill unskilled jobs or as a back door used for the influx of family and friends after Australia.
Today published a discussion of the Government, after the former MP of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, who had condemned the comments of the Government with regard to foreign workers, because this could be considered by neighboring Australia's insult.
"Loud declarations as foreigners to be back do ' and Australian first set ' are a very unpleasant relapse in times in which trade unions demanded a protected labour market", it said the Australia India Institute today.
Historically this meant that white workers should - be protected and if some in the region vern√§hmen an echo of this historic artifact, that wouldn't surprise me.
The discussion outlines twelve measures, which once were considered by the former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who yesterday was to discuss human trafficking in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, others are still under consideration.
If the "authenticity criterion" is applied, then someone who applied for a visa, could be assessed in terms of whether "the request in the cases is real, is related to where the applicant with the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company or personally connected."
Companies could be required also to give an account of the number of the 457 visa holders, after in the past companies, only a small number of workers wanted to support, hundreds have finally adjusted.
Meanwhile, a 35 sri Lankan asylum seekers died presumably of a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on Christmas Island.
The troubled nine-year old son of the man of who had come to Australia with him, maintained since the death of his father on Wednesday by an adult cousin, who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities brought the man in the Christmas Iceland hospital, where he died.
