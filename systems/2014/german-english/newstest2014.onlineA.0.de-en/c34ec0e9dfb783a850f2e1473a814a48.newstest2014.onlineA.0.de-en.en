Johanna Rahner wants to pursue in the Forum of the question, as today the people who classify "last things" after the death.
Had from people in centuries past it too much how-to and while those images of heaven and hell set, so the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes of completion draw rather a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness "that shape until today our ideas".
"The larger hope is driven out part Christians by the criticism of religion", the speaker says.
She have "us with so many question marks provides, that the exclamation point missing to come seem to us".
Johanna Rahner says: "However, the key challenge remains the annoyance of death".
The question is related to that desire, "who dreams of being that at the end everything may be good".
