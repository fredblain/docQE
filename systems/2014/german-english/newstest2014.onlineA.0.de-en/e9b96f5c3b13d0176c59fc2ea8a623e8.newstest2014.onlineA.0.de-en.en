Post clears barely still on Sundays
"Many citizens are have not noticed yet, the red dots for the Sunday emptying reside on different mail boxes of the main town and the outlying centres, but one reads the fine print on the yellow containers of post, to find out quickly that the flush operation on Sundays and holidays no longer takes place", tells the FDP.
A request of the FDP have confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays will emptied just before the post office building in the Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and the Jakob Müller-Straße 1 in metallurgical field.
Whether even Sunday will be emptied in Hofheim and rose garden will not answered in the response to the request of the FDP.
The social and youth policy spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, want to check here.
The Sunday collection is an important postal service just when date post.
"These entries this company despite the price increase for letters on January 2013 radically and unreasonably".
Thomas Bittner, group and city Association Chairman of the Liberals, supported his party colleagues: "what bothers me is the fact that here quietly the flush times are changed or even deleted".
The post is miles away from citizens.
"At least the mail boxes in the districts of new Castle and rose garden must be emptied again Sunday", so Bittner and Röhrenbeck in unison.
Applies also for the inner city, especially non-mobile citizens can reach also walking a mail box Sunday emptying.
Röhrenbeck wondered whether the city plans talks with the post office about this thing in the city Parliament.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post was not communicating with Lampertheim.
His knowledge there is also a Sunday emptying but in Hofheim.
Her party has expressed for privatisation.
"Then be taken decisions elsewhere", said Maier.
