The Vegetarier Bund Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives on 1 November on the occasion of the Weltvegantags:
Pure vegetable shortening is a good alternative to butter, yogurt let substitute soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oats, almond or rice milk can be used.
Folding plant cream replace traditional whipped cream.
Herbal alternatives to eggs.
A half mashed, ripe bananas for example can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams applesauce or a tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus 3 tablespoons water suitable for it.
Doughs are loose instead of egg for example with a mixture of one teaspoon of baking soda, one tablespoon of cornstarch and 3 tablespoons water.
But also 50 grams of soy yoghurt or silken tofu can serve this purpose.
According to the Vebu around 800 000 people eat currently in Germany vegan, so pure herbal.
