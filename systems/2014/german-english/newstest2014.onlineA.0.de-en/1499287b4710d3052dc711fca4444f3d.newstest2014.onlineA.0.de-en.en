You can for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 vote to him to the ' CNN hero of the year "to choose.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his exceptional work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle saw with, how his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and went to hospitals, which did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident nearby in Yaoundé, capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
First, he had only a broken arm, but then formed an infection that spread to his brain and there caused a hematoma, which should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon", so Georges Bwelle.
We had brought him out of Cameroon, if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years helping his father in crowded clinics and hospitals there to get treatment, which had to offer.
"It's not easy," commented Bwelle.
You can leave the House at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital, to be the first, and is not yet first.
There are very many patients.
Some people even die because they need to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelles died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only a doctor for the 5,000 people, as the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, the most Cameroonians couldn't afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of health expenditure in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen had to see suffer in Bwelle mature decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have carried out 700 free operations in the last year.
He was even a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels on weekends in rural areas and provides free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday squeeze he and up to 30 people in minibuses and drive with the artistic medical equipment on the roof over very rough terrain in the villages that need help.
Not always, everything runs smoothly.
More than once, they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: a banquet, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, the place has to offer.
In these villages, free healthcare is truly a reason to celebrate and Bwelle - is happy with his broad smile and his boundless energy - at the cheerful ceremony.
The next morning, the team then begins with the study of hundreds of patients.
"We treat Pro Ride 500 people", so Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 km to the village - walk.
Each of these Wochenendkliniken offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others are given crutches, donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates - a document that is required for the school, but simply cannot afford many poor families.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The operations usually take place in a school, the town hall or apartment; after surgery, the patients get up and go in the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is powered by the generator of the Group and so Bwelle and its volunteers work in the early hours of the morning on Sunday.
It is a tough stint, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"You drums all night, so that we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team rides back in the city, tired, but proud on the work they have done.
The group - a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - has 700 free operations last year conducted and white, she cause an enormous difference for the people with their work, which helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a bar break, he had received, now enable him to work again.
"That changed the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the Wochenendkliniken and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he will finance 60% of his charitable activity, as Bwelle; the rest came from private donations.
"I don't know really, when he is asleep", says Katie o' Malley, a sophomore at Drexel University in Philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily in Bwelles group works with.
He is always either in the hospital or is trying to raise money for the Organization, so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students, such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would get at home never.
"We at operations it might, where we help blot blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle", O'Malley said.
That would be never possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay their travel to Cameroon and bring frequently donated medical material.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transportation and guide.
"He is a hero without a doubt," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people, knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is no burden.
To help others to a happier life, and to fulfill a promise he gave his father, gives him great pleasure.
"I'm so happy if I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to bring people back to laugh and to relieve the pain.
