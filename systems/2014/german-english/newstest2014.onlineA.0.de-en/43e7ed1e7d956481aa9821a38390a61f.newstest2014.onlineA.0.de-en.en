Proverbs come from the Bible
Well 40 women attended the last woman breakfast of this year in the Evangelical parish of bisingen.
"Sayings from the Bible" were the theme of the day in the parish hall and "Phrases from the middle ages".
Zita KÃ¶hler, the Chairman of the Kirchengemeinde-Board, entered after having breakfast in a lecture on the biblical proverbs.
"Proverbs containing wisdom, rules or alerts", she explained.
She compared several Proverbs with the relevant Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs as: wooden eye was alert, like falling from the eyes, an eye on someone, the Lord in his sleep there is his, wash his hands in innocence.
Several times, the speaker had their audience also advise what proverb was.
The phrases from the middle ages the Church Councillor Christel Dehner took up: all good things are three, make blue, something beat up.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases, which they called "Bridges to the past".
A raffle was raffled off at the end.
The prices were covered on a table and were described humorously, before they were handed over to the winners.
Mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger mingled among the visitors of the breakfast round.
