Is Europe's elite willing to do business with the United Kingdom?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and to define what those who provide wealth and work in the UK, want to change our relationship with the EU.
For this purpose, we have been the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders in order and asked them what they think about the United Kingdom, the economy and the EU.
YouGov questioned over 1,000 leaders from business, roughly forming the British company sizes, sectors and regions.
Many will be surprised by the results of the survey.
We have found that the vast majority of companies now exported outside Europe and focused on countries that modernize and grow, while the States in the EU remain stagnant.
You want that new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil are favored Government, instead of the long and tiring process to reside, to reform the obscure institutions.
Asked according to certain legally regulated topics - by the antitrust to product legislation - is the majority of the business leaders of the view, the control over these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction about the internal market, since according to the company the cost of Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits, being part of Europe's trade zone - voted even 40 percent of large companies, which are traditionally most Europe-friendly.
Finally, and probably say most, resulted in our survey of business leaders, that a clear majority hankers after a course in the direction of change of the agreement of the United Kingdom and a relationship with the EU that is not based on trade policy.
This knowledge, which can be found at companies of all sizes and leading companies, shows that the economy is on a "meaningful change" is pushing, which brings the issue of action back to the UK.
There is a revision of the agreement much - and better conditions for United Kingdom 16 percent would lead to a change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubts: this survey shows that the British economy behind his plan for the renegotiation of the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows the company by a renegotiation back expect a significant shift in the balance of power to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary, after the euro zone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal Union.
Jobs and growth in the UK must be the priority, as shown in the result of our survey, which means a stronger focus on trade and a fundamental change in the approach to regulations for companies.
