Schools are encouraged to greater focus on math, spelling, and grammar
In English literature courses, students must handle in the future at least a piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914.
In the test, "Unseen texts" find entrance to stimulate wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
By 2015, students must drop a separate GCSE exam for language where there are strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of education will publish tomorrow the new curricula for English and mathematics - the first fan who have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative is Ofqual, which disclose supervisory authority for testing, a reorganization of GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less course work.
In a speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there was a "Broad consensus indicates that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence", where he stressed the GCSEs would be "challenging, ambitious and strict".
Studies show that in English schools, less time for mathematics applied 116 hours per year or three hours a week per year - as in most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours annually and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal request to provide more time for mathematics in the curriculum, but it means the comprehensive math test - combined with a stronger weighting of the compartment in rankings from coalition circles - schools probably will encourage to use more hours.
In the curriculum more attention on "Issues of real life", including financial mathematics.
