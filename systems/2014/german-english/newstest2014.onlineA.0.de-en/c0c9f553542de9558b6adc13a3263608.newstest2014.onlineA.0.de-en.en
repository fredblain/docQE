Excellent mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The old man and the sea", Horst Janson is cut on the body.
Janson is himself an old hand in his profession, the art of acting.
None when fishing can do something before the old man Santiago.
So the two complement each other great.
You'd think almost the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of which the Fisher boy Manolo speaks, to be able to see.
When Santiago tired bent by life on the Chair, this is real at Janson.
Next to it is the role of the old Fisher through and through a Charakterrolle which excellent masters Janson.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and eventually wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and also his willpower.
Janson is at long distances as the sole actor on the stage.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience, so that his monologues, no moment are boring.
His efforts finally to pull the fish, the surface of the water are so real that viewers forget that the Sea consists of only blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann can operate the old man in the boat before the fishing village.
During the performance, he sets the active scene in the light: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise favor, who sings with her songs and her beautiful voice of Cuba's attitude to life.
The four musicians playing Cuban rhythms to and are guests of the bar at the same time.
