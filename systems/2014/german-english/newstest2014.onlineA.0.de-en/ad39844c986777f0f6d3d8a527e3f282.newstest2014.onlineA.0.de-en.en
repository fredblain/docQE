Frontier Airlines charge fees for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $ 100 by passengers who want to stow carry-on baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines, intends to charge up to $ 100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though to read the announcement on Wednesday was that passengers should keep the whole box.
The new fee applies to carry-on baggage in the overhead bin above the seat, small bags under the seat remain free.
Frontier said that you calculate when the fee shall paid in advance, $ 25, and $ 100 for travellers who only paid at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate o' Malley said, the fee of $ 100 aimed persuading travelers to take care of in the run-up to the payment.
"We would not calculate this sum", she explained.
2008, airlines began to charge fees for the first and second checked bag.
Passengers who tried to get around them, so as much as possible stuffed in hand luggage, which has resulted in that the overhead bins above the seat are often crowded.
Fees are a way to move to less take on board passengers to do so.
O'Malley said the new fee it a matter of not really making money.
It involves the most loyal customers of frontier, which would have brought clear that there would be harder to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website, don't have to pay.
This means that a passenger at the gate by frontier circumstances may take one piece of baggage free of charge, must pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage the next person but.
O'Malley told the website of frontier and the check-in procedure would changed so that the passengers of the fee be informed before they came to the gate.
The new carry-on fee of frontier enters into force only in the summer, an exact date does not exist yet.
Passengers often ranting about luggage surcharges and other fees, but airlines fall like that.
They argue that the transport of baggage cost money and passengers should pay for this service, if they wanted him.
Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines make enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
So far however, most keep their hands off fees for carry-on.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as the first charges for baggage and followed by Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airlines.
The only other airline with a such fee the Hungarian Wizz Air, the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitored the additional fees said.
He estimated in a report by December 2011, the carry-on fee every year bring a spirit $ 50 million.
Sorensen, who previously held a management position with Midwest Airlines, recently flew with spirit and was curious what would expect him at the boarding gate when passengers would be faced with the unusual baggage fee of the company.
"The boarding process was among the smoothest I've seen in my career in the aviation industry," he said.
I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and tangible discussions at the boarding gate.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding went smoothly."
Frontier follows spirit in the 2 dollars, which are required for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
The company said that passengers, soda, or juice bought, which should keep the whole box and coffee will refill free.
Water is still free.
US Airways 2008 briefly attempted to charge for soft drinks, made this but seven months later reversed after passengers had complained and no other large company was drawn.
Frontiers step, to charge for carry-on baggage, if passengers do not directly with the airline to buy, is the latest initiative, with the customer on the website are to be channelled.
Airlines pay 10 to 25 dollars per ticket sold online travel agencies like Orbitz.
It provides all companies an incentive to move passengers to directly purchase from them rather than through an online travel agency.
Frontier is gone however most widely in this area.
In September, began the company, assign only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were again reduced to 25 per cent of flight.
A flight booked at a third-party with frontier over 1000 miles brings customers to you therefore only have 250 miles.
Passengers can reserve seats only when purchasing direct on the frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business contracting, the company loses money.
The proceeds fell by 9 per cent and the flight capacity shrank nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, how to read the financial report on Wednesday from the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc., is released.
Republic has tried to get the finances of frontier control in the context of the sale of the company.
