Profits at Bombardier after decline in delivered quantities and orders
The Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decline of net profits on Thursday, after he was advised by declining orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter, as well as contract issues in the railway sector under pressure.
Bombardier headquartered in Montreal the CSeries released no flight test data for his brand new aircraft and issued no new information, whether the plane according to the ambitious timetable could go in next September in the commercial use.
So far only three more starts, was followed by the maiden flight of the test aircraft and a half months ago which seems questionable whether the test phase as planned runs.
The results remained behind the forecasts and resulted in a drop of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, Cameron Doerksen, analyst with national bank financial, lowered his rating from "outperform" to "Sector perform" in view of the fact that the stock in the next one to two quarters has a limited upside potential.
"Although weaker aircraft delivery figures were expected as far as possible, but we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector," Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We are of the opinion that Bombardier new orders for the CSeries is obtained if the test program to the aircraft progresses.
If however in the coming months no new orders will be announced, we expect that the market will face more skeptical the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower segment of the market that is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced in March of public and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But so far binding orders for the CSeries, with 177 are moderate, because potential buyers would wait and see the results of flight tests, whether the claims of the company with respect to fuel efficiency and cost savings of the new DÃ¼senverkehrsflugzeugs are true.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
President and CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier its target of 300 binding orders to the beginning of the commercial exploitation of the Jets will reach.
On Thursday compared with analysts and media, corporate governance also assured the program lay in the schedule.
"The test aircraft has remained no longer on the ground than expected," Beaudoin said during a telephone conference, adding that during the lifetime of the aircraft ground tests and software updates have been applied.
Every manufacturer of plans otherwise.
We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a revision period, what we have done.
This is done during the entire flight program.
It was the second of five test aircraft will start probably the rest shortly thereafter, in the next few weeks, by the company.
However, analysts remain skeptical about whether twelve months after its maiden flight of the first customer can take a plane of the CSeries in operation.
Bombardier said, check the planning for entry into service (EIS), and will update this in the next few months.
"The slow progress the flight test - even if they obviously comply with bombardiers of internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning the first quarter 2015 moves", Doerksen said.

Net orders fell by 83 aircraft on 26.
The backlog in the Aeronautics and space Division amounted to 32.9 billion dollars on September 30 and was therefore unchanged compared to December 31.
"In the aeronautical and space were the results in the context of our objectives, but low order intake and the market as a whole were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aviation and Aerospace Division fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that the sales in this Division by almost 11 per cent rose to 2.1 billion dollars.
The backlog in the Transport Division amounted to 32.6 billion dollars on September 30 and was slightly elevated compared to the 31 December.
