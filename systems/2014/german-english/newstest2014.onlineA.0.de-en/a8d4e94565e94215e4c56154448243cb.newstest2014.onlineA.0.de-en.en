With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist President of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of State since the overthrow of the monarchy was about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges of the Court dressed in black robes, which has its headquarters on the River Nile and is modeled after an ancient Egyptian Temple.

"Today the Egyptian people the basis for a new life has created - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability", said the 60 year old Mursi, an engineer trained in the United States and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that sharp had been taken since its inception 84 years ago mostly as a banned organisation by each Government in the visor.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Mursi arrived shortly after 11 P.m. local time in a small car convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered before the Court, to cheer the new President, and in contrast to the presidential pageantry of the Mubarak era the traffic paused only for a short time, so that the auto convoy could cross the usually bustling street that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As uncharismatisches "spare wheel" the brotherhood mocked his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he portrayed himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those, who wanted to bring the aspirations of the uprising in 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak at the destination.
"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern State," said the judges in the wood-paneled Chamber in which he took the oath of Office the Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red tie.

Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of present in the largest Auditorium of the University with chants of "the army and the people are a hand".
In the 1970s the University of Cairo, built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, has become a stronghold of Islamist student groups.
Mursi took a symbolic oath in Tahir square on Friday, to reclaim presidential powers to the birthplace of the rebellion, which last year led to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he vowed, the military Council of the head of State hunted from the Office had taken over.
But with the drop of the official oath before the Court and not as usual in front of the Parliament, he leans on the will of the military, suggesting that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech on the t square was full of dramatic, populist gestures.
