A stubborn ankle injury threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga away game of the FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz bnagt to a usage by Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow, he will try to train with the team.
So far he was only individually.
"We will decide quickly about its use," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have its best with six goals scorers in.
Because the Mainzer must renounce already on the injured performer Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
