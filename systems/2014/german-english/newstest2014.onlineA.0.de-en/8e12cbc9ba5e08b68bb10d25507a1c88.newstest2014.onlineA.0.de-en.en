Tourism: Descent to the Romans
On 120 meters a sewer from the Roman period remains below from Cologne.
Who visited Cologne, not coming to the Cathedral.
Some 157 metres stand the two towers in the sky and make it the second-highest church building in Europe.
However, only a few visitors who marvel at the two filigree spires, suspecting that there is to discover a lot also in the Cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is expert in Cologne underworld.
Meeting point is the service center of Cologne tourism directly at the Cathedral for the guides.
The tour begins quite unspectacular: "We do, in the underground car park" says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore only remained standing by the ruins of the ancient city wall, which was not too large.
Most users of the car park pass rush so today's the Roman remains and parking only.
But look more closely and discovered an archaeological site separated by metal bar on the D2 parking deck.
About five metres high ruins of Palm-sized stones can be seen.
"There are remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century after Christ," Schulze said.
Before going back to the light of day, Schulze allows participants on the upper level of the Park take a look into a dark, 15-meter-deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which is unfortunately not perceived.
Next stop of the tour is the Prätorium, and here the participants descend again into the depths.
Here, we see the headquarters of the once powerful man North of the Alps, the praetor of the CCAA.
What is CCAA, asks a visitor.
"Is an abbreviation for" Colonia Claudia ARA Agrippinensium ", which means on good German as much as"City of Roman law and city of asked, founded under Emperor Claudius in the place of the altar for the Imperial cult"".
And the Prätorium is the former Governor's Palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire at the Rhine.
By the entrance of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewer, which is 120 metres long here to be around.
Schulze guests cheer "You can go along a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want to".
Still, Schulze has a surprise.
After he has obtained the key at the box office, he leads the group to a walk-in, 16-meter-deep shaft.
"We are now in the Mikvah, a ritual Jewish bath", he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to reach the groundwater, which was indispensable for the ritual washing.
Today, different water levels by changing levels of the Rhine are readable in the bottom of the Mikvah, the roots of which go back to the eighth century.
The Mikvah is part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square, for the construction soon to begin.
But still some years to completion.
