The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new Café.
One that invites you to relax and come back.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling, having already experienced or seen a new situation according to the lexicon.
In the case of the visit of the homonymous Cafés on the Opschlag in the District of Kleve within sight to the Hochschule Rhein-Waal, it must not remain vu feeling at the pure Déjà.
Finally the café with the beautiful name has exactly the goal: to make an actual stay not only intellectually, but by hand always recurring experience.
Because it is fun and is just beautiful.
A look into the inner workings of the Opschlag 8 gives a good feeling the viewers right off the bat.
The State of the art, but not cool Café atmosphere looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team offers the guest with various coffee or cocktail variant with the founders of Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top.
There's delicious cake or individual fresh sandwiches.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already before the opening of the pretty Café at the Opschlag as restaurateurs a made name for itself: in Kranenburg, they introduced the "art lounge".
By moving to Kleve on the Opschlag, the sympathetic Café lovers expect more audience.
Not least because of the College.
"While we have no specific target group," stresses Daniel Büttner.
Rather she would like to address just two young students such as seniors and all ages in between.
Speaking of coffee lovers.
The sympathetic owner pair behind the coffee.
Enjoy the fragrant hot BREW in a variety of variations itself.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner tends to be the cappuccino drinker of Expresso fan and Mirjam van the Stelt.
"This includes a baguette - thats my thing", she reveals the NRZ.
There was two events even in the bright Café.
One rather.
Because the harbour Festival took place Yes more outdoors - déjà vu Café not benefited.
But there was also the night of Ringelnatz.
"Beautiful, successful and funny", found the two 33-year-old.
But just not for everyone.
Maybe Daniel Büttner is also no outspoken fan of event evenings: "May's Yes now even not all right to make".
And an event I was talking to only that, who are also interested in the special event.
Therefore, events will be more the exception for us.
"We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible".
Do you mean: Déjà vu also stands for reliability.
As regards the quality of products, which here are, as well as on the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve, Germany.
The road, which are more and more becoming a food mile.
To the delight of many Kamuhanda, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the guest Rome haste and hence the Café Déjà vu for themselves.
