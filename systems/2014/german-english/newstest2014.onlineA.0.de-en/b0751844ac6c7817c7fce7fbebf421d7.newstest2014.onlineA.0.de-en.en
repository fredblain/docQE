Parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died in tragic accident, believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose Leiche was found, in a rolled-up wrestling mat in the gym of his high school are convinced that her son was murdered, the lawyer of the family declared on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta in the U.S. State of Georgia was found on January 11 in a upright made mat, which stood behind the bleachers in the school gym.
The Lowndes County Sheriff's investigators came to the conclusion that Johnson died in a tragic accident, doubting the family of 17-year old however.
"They are convinced that her son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the Attorney by Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, compared to FoxNews.com.
You would have never believed he had died so how the Sheriff have concluded it.
"They are of the view that it lacks any logic, contrary to the laws of physics, as well as against the common sense", to Crump.
Rather, they were confident the truth will cover up to protect the person or persons who are responsible for the death of her son.
"Her son went to learn in the school and came back in a body bag," he commented.
On Thursday, U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said there would be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, since a number of important issues are still unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death a crime due to?
That said Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, in which direction they do.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation", he said.
Said Moore told reporters the initial autopsy indicates that Johnson died from the consequences of a "position-related suffocation".
A second autopsy have however revealed a different cause of death so Moore.
"There are a number of questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will rely on the FBI to conduct the investigations.
A representative of the authority of the County and not immediately upon our request was Sheriff on Thursday to a comment ready.
On Wednesday, a court in the South of Georgia ordered that the authorities must release all surveillance videos that have reviewed the investigator.
The parents of the teenagers said they hoped that the video recordings contained evidence, as he died.
