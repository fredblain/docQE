UN announces new objectives in the fight against poverty
The United Nations starting immediately with the elaboration of a number of new objectives that the Millennium development goals to fight poverty announced twelve years ago should be replaced.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on sustainable development, which began in the evening in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in the push for "sustainable development goals", which are intended to replace the expiring 2015 Millennium development goals.
They were recorded in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by political leaders, including Ms. Gillard, at the Summit.
UN Secretary General explained Ban Ki-moon in the evening on the Summit, the time had come "to think beyond national interests".
"I am, that the Member States that have agreed to adopt a process in attack, with the universal, sustainable development goals are to be agreed", he said.
"These goals build on our progress in the Millennium development goals and form an integral part of the framework for the development after 2015.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given me by the Member States, to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals, building on the success of the Millennium development goals."
