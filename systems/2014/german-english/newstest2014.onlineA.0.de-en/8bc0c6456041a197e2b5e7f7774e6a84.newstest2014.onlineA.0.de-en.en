Germany's largest State Church has an Offensivegestartet to promote the profession of the pastor.
Background is a possible lack of pastors: the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its approximately 1,800 pastors and pastors will be halved after current position by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offer good prospects, Pastor Mathis bardo (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service said.
It's attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routine itself.
Bardo the Lutheran Church has been for the first time a pastor on a full point, to inspire young people to the study of theology.
Currently fewer and fewer young people choose after graduating, to study theology.
Bardo traces this to the process of Entkirchlichung: "God's voice is silent, the world is loud".
It characterized the profession of great freedom and diversity.
I am Lord of my appointment calendar and can put there my focus where it is important to me.
Pastors may be close to the people as a pastor.
You earned as much as teachers and could make a living well.
Certainly get paid in the private sector, but that had theologians a safe employer.
That do meet the young people of today, where it is a matter not only to career, but a sense of fulfilled work.
About 60 pastors retire go according to the Lutheran Church, which includes three quarters of Lower Saxony, currently per year.
At the same time, approximately 40 graduates of theological studies begin their Vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the Emsland and Wendland it could be in the future hard to fill positions.
Bardo wants to organise among other study days for young people and invite also celebrities, have studied theology.
The study of theology offer a broad education.
