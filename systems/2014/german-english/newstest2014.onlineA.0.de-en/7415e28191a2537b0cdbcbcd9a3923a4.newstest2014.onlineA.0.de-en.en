Now it comes for the team by Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to the Derby against TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
The season begins with this game new for us.
"I hope that we finally got the head free," Ehlers are guardedly optimistic about.
While he has finally, with the exception of the time injured Hendrik Bale, his complete squad available.
Daverden also uses as we paced game.
Therefore, we must keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, it is however to increase, which has left least anything other than a secure impression of cover.
Daverdens coach Thomas Panitz is significantly more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
Of course, the game was a house number.
But that's why we're still not the favorite long because everything can happen in the Derby.
However p wants to now set in Morsum, to start a series.
Missing Jan Malte is Iodate.
It celebrates the A-Jugendliche Joost Windßuß, who is active with double play right at the Youth Club HC Bremen, his season debut.
Who is not hot in a game, you want to stay at home.
