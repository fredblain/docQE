George Kerevan: European unbundling is the choice the Scots
A new day, a new horror story to independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the cue for stories about Passport checks in Berwick and secured with barbed wire boundary along the Hadrian.
In fact was in the Strathclyde template on the potential economic benefits pointed out, which would bring more freedom to travel in the rest of Europe with it, but this did not matter - as expected - in the headlines.
Also, no one has mentioned that the EU Member States often bend their strict rules is, if it is convenient for them.
Because Scotland currently does not belong to the Schengen area, the continued disregard for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what you really want out of the Scots.
So actually no story.
And one that has been in the years, that she already looks like a fossil: the first time I have the "Independence means passport controls" duck is at least 40 years ago.
This is an interesting point in the constant repeat of this ancient history lost.
Why should you expect from an independent Scotland, that it is dancing to the European tune?
Why the London pass against the Brussels Exchange, especially now?
This is the real European news: the great, after the war plan to the unification of Europe has been stalled.
With the euro crisis, the European project is officially died.
Everywhere in the EU gain ground parties, which are hostile to the EU, or want to have the euro as their currency on board.
Even in Germany nearly five million votes in the Bundestag election could get the Eurosceptic party alternative for Germany - until this year founded - for himself in September and effectively the free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) expel from the Bundestag.
There has always been local resistance to the plan, to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis turns out however as a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, in conjunction with the straitjacket in which the respective national economy is forced by sticking to the single currency, many people of consider, the European project had gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with that national governments create excessive budget deficits - this was the case only in Greece.
Instead the Eurosystem, has nailed down its members on exchange rates are favorable for German exporters â€“ and German politicians would like to allow this.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, South Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only way is to cut the wages and public spending - spurred by Berlin.
A deeper going European productivity problem lies behind the current budget and currency problems.
As a result of the "green" energy policies prescribed by Brussels - a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - the European industry will pay twice that for electricity and for gas fourfold compared with the United States.
That is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wage codification of the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry to being marginalized by cheap American shale gas in the corner.
As a result, a revolt coming the former cheerleaders of the EU, particularly in France.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which you could keep Germany at Bay and lift Paris on par with Washington.
But Berlin needs Paris no longer as the gateway to the political legitimacy and put up its own economic policy Europe, which the struggling French economy has to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pens EU hostile, right-wing National Front has won just a crucial by-election and so that the ruling Socialists referenced three in place.
The most popular party in France with 24 percent of the popular vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party, the national front that she can not assume now is a split in the right-wing would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What does Le Pen with their newly won popularity among the white working-class French?
She want the EU elections next year use an anti-EU-, to forge anti - Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties in these elections do well - and this is very possible - then such a block could dominate for the first time the European Parliament.
This is the point on which I'm going: in the not-too-distant future the growing resentment of the EU and the common currency is to meet to the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but she will be rather something like "EDN (sovereign)", which was in favor of General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may adhere to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that Great Britain distanced themselves from this project hoping to curry favor with the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain alone in the Atlantic rain will stand.
Where is Scotland in all of this?
We can decide to be small England a region (in last consequence).
Or we can defend our own economic interests - which also belongs to Berlin and Brussels say what they where can put up.
I guess Scotland could go quite well in a looser European grouping, as long as we retain our own currency.
The cooperation with other, like-minded countries is easier in a non-Federated Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should consider to join Norway and keep our economic independence.
The SNP Government in Scotland is - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won the 2011 a spectacular majority due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts, the labour Finance Minister Alistair had to take responsibility for Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous to decide now for an independence for Scotland, only then to get from Berlin and Brussels imposed an austerity.
