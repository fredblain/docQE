Rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian Government insists on the tough conditions that are associated with the rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian public health, to ensure that the Federal Government can not waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis, which was caused by an ageing population of the island State, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system limitations.
The funding for a period of four years was decided after Government consultations with the independent Tasmanian Parliament Andrew Wilkie.
The Government "has put together an emergency rescue package, which is in our opinion the unique challenges of facing federal State", Plibersek said today.
The 325-million-dollar package includes $31 million emergency aid for optional services.
More 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments for cataracts, residues should be eliminated.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better follow-up after inpatient stays, specialist training, services in the field of mental health and the introduction of a system for the electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments correspond to the ideas of which concerned hospital staff have told me, they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system", said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian Government.
The State must maintain the current level of funding, to get money from the Commonwealth, and monthly report on where the additional monies were spent.
A three-member Commission is set up and to make sure that the State as effectively and efficiently as possible is providing health services.
Wilkie said today, the $325 million would are of little help, if "not accompanied by real reforms, bring the Tasmanian public health system on a more sustainable course."
Nonetheless, he praised the Government that she have will respond to his request for urgent help he brought first to the Prime Minister early in May to the expression.
"I am confident that the Federal aid will make a large contribution to take the public health system of the State of the list of worries," said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the Federal State, these optional services will largely make up for the recent cuts.
However, the health spokesman for the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement was only a "band-aid solution".
"We are therefore in the current situation, because the labor State Government has deducted $430 million from the health system", he told ABC TV.
It can not be that a State Government rips almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth put into 300 million and then pretend to be good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of bailout for extra bureaucracy might be given out.
