Gutach: More safety for pedestrians
You are not 100 yards away from each other: on Tuesday the new B 33 - pedestrian traffic lights in the village car park in operation - taken in Gutach in sight of the older Town Hall lights.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or Schildbürger prank?
Gutachs Mayor yesterday clearly answered this question.
"The Town Hall lights has been installed at that time, because it assures the school", Eckert said yesterday.
The Chester traffic secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle inhabitants.
The plant yesterday officially in operation was important for the Sulz Brook road/Church Road junction area.
We have the Museum, two churches, Park, bus stop, a doctor and a Bank of the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"At the high transport and pedestrian traffic a more light needed to their safety", so Eckert.
Also Peter Arnold from the Offenburg District Office confirms this.
"According to current measurements every day some 12 000 vehicles pass through the village of Gutach on the B-33, of which about ten percent are heavy traffic", Arnold stresses.
Therefore, the construction of an additional traffic light was more than necessary: "Safety just happening", so Arnold.
A total four road shows were conducted, also a roundabout has been considered, however due to the tightness in the Sulz Brook road/Church Road junction area again discarded.
According to Arnold at the location of the light masts before everything tested out: "By means of an extra for us with extra long tree trunks of loaded vans we have from tested, whether these vehicles out of the way of Sulz Brook on the B-33 can extend without fold over the traffic light poles".
The approximately 15 000 euro expensive traffic light itself is the "State of the art, what is there currently on the market", said Arnold.
The plant is equipped with colored LEDs that shine so strong, that the lights of the car drivers, for example, even with low standing Sun are well.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 Watts, the new just eight Watts.
Pro Ride direction there are three lighting systems.
Arnold said the technology of the new plant: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
The pedestrian pushes the light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
The road is clear, if not coming directly for the pedestrian green, it takes about 15 seconds.
A further radar sensor checks to see whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.
"Should a group or handicapped people go the street, the green phase is extended, it comes so everyone safe on the road", said Arnold.
Of course, motorists must here thinking as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: hardly showed the traffic lights for pedestrian green, an upper class vehicle swept through - bright red.
