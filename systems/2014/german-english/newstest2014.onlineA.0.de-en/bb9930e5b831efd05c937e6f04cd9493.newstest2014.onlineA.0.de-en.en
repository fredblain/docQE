ESA decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves and black holes - the European Space Agency experts must agree now on two major projects, that want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Distant worlds.
More than 1000 planet while other stars have already been astronomers.
Whether there is life on at least some of them, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: you should search for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for Earth-like planets and discover that perhaps alien life?
These questions just those responsible in the European Space Agency ESA.
For their program "cosmic vision" you are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will significantly advance the research.
The budget for such "L 'missions is roughly one billion euros.
The start will be 2028 2034 expected.
In early September the elite of European space exploration met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were to debate, five of them are now come in the shortlist.
Numerous bodies examine the proposals, check for the researchers.
A final decision by the Scientific Programme Committee should fall in the next few days.
ESA has selected four major issues on which the missions of programme initiated in 2007 "cosmic vision" to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact operations are in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and hence the formation of planets orbiting this star - still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this obscurity.
And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances life can arise there?
To investigate this question, the space telescope "Cheops" is to start in 2017 with the 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity are investigated.
The possibilities are limited but, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments astronomers could represent Earth-like planets and analyze even the composition of their atmospheres and so search for "Biomarkers": gases, considered an indication for biological activity.
How does the solar system?
Also this question to indicate finally, what requirements there are for the emergence of life.
A star's magnetic activity and the interaction of its magnetic field, as well as of his particles emitted with the planetary system plays an important role.
These operations can be an exemplary study in our solar system.
With the "solar Orbiter" ESA approved already an M-class Mission (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe should start 2017 and observe surface and activity of the Sun.
Even Jupiter and its moons are of great interest to researchers.
You want to find out what role played the giant planet in the development of the solar system.
For the ESA sees the first of the three L missions of the "cosmic vision" program before.
The probe of "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) begins their journey expected to 2022.
Eight years later it reached Jupiter and to examine the atmosphere of the planet, as well as the icy moons, Europa, Callisto and Ganymede.
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?
The space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to examine whether the known laws of nature are still valid.
You might find yourself also deviations which could point the way to a new theory of the physicists, under whose umbrella unite all known laws of nature.
How the universe came about and what is it made of?
Our cosmos was created by the big bang 13.7 billion years ago.
In addition to the US common matter of stars, planets and living beings as we consist of, there is dark matter, whose Schwerkraft holding together galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy, through whose work the expansion of the universe accelerating.
So far, the researchers know, what physical laws in the first seconds of the big bang were valid, nor what are dark matter and dark energy.
With "Euclid" ESA approved here already a M mission, whose starting is planned for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe will investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky and allow to draw conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals only two are left at the end of the selection process.
An ambitious concept for the detection of gravitational waves has according to many experts "E-Lisa", the best chances for a permit as a L mission.
Including physicists understand changes in the structure of space and time, which had predicted by Albert Einstein nearly a century ago.
Demonstrated they were not until today.
Elisa could do this, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission provides a detector consisting of two or three probes will be stationed at all.
He could demonstrate also gravitational waves in contrast to plants on the Earth during the big bang, and provide new insights into the origins of the cosmos.
Four other proposals still compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope named "Athena", which, among other black holes to explore, "Icy planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic microwave background, and the "Extrasolar Planet Finder" to uncover the Earth-like planets and examine.
Among other proposals to the samples back from Mars, the Moon, Venus, and asteroids, and solar physics research are already eliminated.
