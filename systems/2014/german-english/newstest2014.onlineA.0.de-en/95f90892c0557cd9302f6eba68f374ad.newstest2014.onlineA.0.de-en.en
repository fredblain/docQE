Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to include early residents in the planning", Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizens information event to the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants arrived in the Community Hall to let explained the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to bring ideas.
Hale made it clear: "The ultimate decisions make the members of the Council".
The flood, which took Gechingen on May 15, 2009, was a dramatic event that raised the question for protective measures for the future, so Hale.
A river basin investigation had been given with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, in order, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"As many cultivated land protection is the goal," Halimah.
The planning is based the protection against a flood to be expected statistically every 100 years according to the German weather service.
Climate change will be taken into account by a 15-percent surcharge.
This is called "HQ 100aKlima" in professional circles.
The water masses that 2009 had resulted in Gechingen considerable damage, corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement", so Hale.
To achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros must be, invested in Gechingen, whereby the community can expect with land grants amounting to about 70 percent.
Hale but pointed out that the promotion is there only if an overall concept will be implemented.
This is the community on the participation of citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval procedures must be completed.
2016 could be started to implement in the best case.
Among other things, the protection concept, which already was presented last week in the Council (as reported) foresees local measures in the tributary of the river IRM Stammheimer Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to voice their concerns.
Among other things has been questioned, why not more dams and reservoirs to protect of the site were planned.
Gregor Kühn, planners of the responsible Engineering Office of forest and Corbe from Hill's home, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interplay of all introduced measures to achieve the desired goal in total.
In addition, it was held to find the most economical solution, so Woods and Corbe Wald of Joachim.
Resentment was among residents of the old town, who repeatedly suffer even at normal rainstorm under an overload of the channel network.
The problem is known to the management and initial measures have already been taken.
Halder pointed out however, that the guidelines for channel systems are others, for flood protection, and this should not be mixed.
The municipality was required to produce the sewer system so that two-to three-year rain events could be coped with.
To dimension the sewers, larger oil could cost millions.
