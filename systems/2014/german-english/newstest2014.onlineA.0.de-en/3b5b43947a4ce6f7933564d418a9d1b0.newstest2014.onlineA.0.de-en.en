As the horse-show experts in droves in Cardiff found themselves up, to Crown the horse of the year, were aware that a tough competition fight was imminent.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The tot, which is not even in kindergarten and only a few months ago has made its first steps, and his Shetland pony trotted toffee loose through the three rounds and won the first prize - where they had 30 adult opponents behind.
The lovebirds pair, both the same size, were due to their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition praised, is organised by the Sunnybank equestrian centre in Rudry, near Cardiff.
During his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had placed his beret at a saucy angle and led the two-year-old toffee by the ring.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which would be far beyond his age.
And toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had his third birthday get toffee last March as a gift and practiced since then every day with the Shetland pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and toffee are a great team."
They had to compete against the entire field and went with Gold Cup and rosette from the square.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Entirely foreign in the arena thought he was so phenomenal, that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, follows South Wales, in the footsteps of his aunt of Sharon Howells, who shows horses for over ten years.
Howells told: "the whole audience was as electric and all have fired him and clapped."
He ran the entire length of the arena on the sand, and although he looked so tiny, he has done a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens, which he takes.
So how it is started, it will not take long, until he is on the "Horse of the year"-Schau - and I'm sure that he will do well.
A spokesman who said the annual Horse Show: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how he should deal with his pony."
Together, they are a great team.
The judges then evaluated Fenton and toffee how well they would have beaten and presented in the demo ring.
Pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and leader - and as Fenton and toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure that Fenton's sweet clothes has played its part in this, it fit perfect for the occasion.
