Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingens Mayor Michael Maier.
The municipality has sold the former kindergarten on Garden Street to an individual.
At its recent meeting, the Council agreed to sell in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner to a "reasonable" price.
"The community is happy," Maier stressed.
100 000 euro were applied in the budget.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The Mayor is right, that the responsibility for the building has passed before winter to someone else Winterlingen and must no longer come for the entertainment of the House, how to heat, to look to the garden and to clear the sidewalk.
"This effort is gone now", Maier is looking forward.
