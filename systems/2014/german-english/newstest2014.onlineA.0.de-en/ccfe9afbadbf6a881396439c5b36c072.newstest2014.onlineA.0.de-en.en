The throwaway society doesn't think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood well, but eventually it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people on the front passenger and back seat hunger is noticeable.
Clearly, the occasional cocktail or champagne may be responsible!
What obvious, as the drive to chilled to the next "drive-in", to treat yourself to a little something?
I admit, I'm happy with when it comes to fast food catching up late at night or early in the morning.
A few French fries, a coke and a burger - and then nothing like home and in bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco goers making their presence felt.
For what must be a missing that throw his fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?
Discarded paper bags are mainly on the weekends along roadsides and in parking lots.
"Why?", I ask myself.
Are the people too stupid to take the bag home or until the next trash can?
It is not only so, that the paper stuff blighted the landscape.
Bags have obscured even transport facilities such as guard rails and thus triggered accidents.
Do we not think said "throwaway" about something but, she probably don't even know what this word actually means.
If you are in the evening more often, especially with several people in the car, you know how a rear bench can look through long nights: clothes, bottles and other trash Tower there.
Because some bags would make up more or less but also nothing â€“ as opposed to the street, where nobody on the food remains of others want to trample.
I see already the day come, at which the clearing away is too stupid the cities and towns - and the fast food chains need to require deposit for their bags.
