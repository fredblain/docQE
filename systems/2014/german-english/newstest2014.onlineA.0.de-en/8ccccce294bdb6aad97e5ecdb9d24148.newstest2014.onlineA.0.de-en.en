Hearing before the Royal Commission: two YMCA staff members on allegations against Jonathan Lord accused of sexual offences
Two YMCA staff from new South Wales (NSW) were accused sexual offences in connection with children, before 2011 accusations against the nursery nurses Jonathan Lord from Sydney were raised, as was the Royal Commission on sexual abuse of children.
But when the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had declared you've "never to do with an incident of child sexual abuse in the Organization had".
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences, and another, a sports teacher of the YMCA Sydney Hall 1991 familiar to him because of abuse children had been sentenced.
Hare Gail Furness, an attorney at assistierenden of the Commission, said that he knew from the first case, but I know the second.
He admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in asserting, "there have been external checks of the YMCA, where the YMCA was considered at forefront of child safety".
Evidence before the Commission shows rather that the YMCA additionally has been informed that he has received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of education and communities (Ministry of education) in August of that year.
Hare started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that management "I'm down" failed in recruiting Lord and not to ensure that staff were themselves via their clear obligations, to report violations to the child safety.
Lord had been sentenced for sexual offenses to twelve young during his two-year tenure for the YMCA at the beginning of the year.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare but denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem, which have held employees thereof, to report Lords violations in relation to the safety of children.
The staff said that they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord alone with children was supervised them privately as a babysitter, let her sit on his lap, one said that he love to have it, and let kids play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose commanding officer was the Lord and who had asked for a training to protect children because she was concerned because of his behavior, said that the children Services Director Jacqui Barnat, who was the Chief of Lords in the YMCA Sydney, "very intimidating and that was very aloof most of the time".
The Managing Director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that these not would have dared to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said their friendship got compromised rather with their judgment Lord why she had not reported it.
Hare said he told his view of the Board of Directors of the YMCA NSW, that the lesson that have to take the organisation from the "Jonathan Lord incident" affects "not reporting" by employees, and the Board voted to him.
O'Hare said the decision, the employees to sign non-disclosure commitments shortly after emergence of the allegations to urge was taken by the Executive Director of children services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said, this should prevent a contamination of the evidence what has been implemented but "overzealous" and bad.
The YMCA NSW was at the time, Jonathan Lord was busy between 2009 and 2011 there, not organization safe for children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on child sexual abuse, the Commission said.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in the setting, validation, training, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
