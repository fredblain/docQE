Up to the present time, the police inspection of Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were called only twice to egg-throwing children, which threw them against House facades.
Because the homeowner realized this in time and right away the remnants of the egg, also no damage may have arisen.
Also probably some new year's Eve firecrackers were lit throughout the city, but again no damage has arisen.
A local resident in the Bishop Fatin way reported that were wrapped his car with toilet paper and its ornamental Hubcaps stolen.
Until the arrival of the police the man has his wheel covers found however all again in close proximity, so the police had to be not working.
