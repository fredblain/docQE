Rules on electronic devices in aircraft remain in Australia for the time being in force
Australian airline passengers must turn off continue tablets and smart phones during takeoff and landing, despite efforts in the United States to loosen the rules for such devices.
The American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change your preferences, so that passengers on their devices read during critical phases of flight E-books, watch videos or can play as long as they are in "Airplane mode".
During most of the flight, this is already allowed to passengers, but many people find it annoying that they may not read their E-books on the takeoff and the landing.
Australian companies observe the decision to implement the U.S. airlines have to do tons of work, track but no immediate plans to change its rules.
The CASA's air traffic control authority, also said, you'll see the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight in Australia still apply.
"CASA has currently no specific provisions regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft", was announced.
The issue is subject to provisions, according to which airlines will at all times maintain security and passengers must follow the safety instructions provided by the cabin crew.
Virgin has already held talks about extending use of Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights with the CASA and says it is open to changes, this would have to be initiated but by the legislature.
"We would welcome a review of the approved of electronic devices through the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience, after we now (Wireless Entertainment) offered during the flight", a spokesman said.
Qantas said it will remain until further notice in the current regulations.
"Our current regulations stipulate that electronic devices should not be used during the launch and the landing, and we have no plans at this time to change that," the company said.
The FAA rules apply to American Airlines.
We are the FAA decision however always to developments in regulations interested passengers can benefit from, and be as well as the reasons behind it certainly look.
The decision affects different U.S. companies depending on the age of the fleet.
You must prove that their aircraft can tolerate the interference by mobile devices, and you can change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and customer training.
"Once an airline has confirmed its fleet the tolerance, she can allow using portable, lighter electronic devices such as Smartphones, tablets and E-book readers at any height passengers", the FAA announced.
In rare cases when visibility is poor, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the devices during the landing.
The Group also recommended to store heavier devices during takeoff and landing safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats.
