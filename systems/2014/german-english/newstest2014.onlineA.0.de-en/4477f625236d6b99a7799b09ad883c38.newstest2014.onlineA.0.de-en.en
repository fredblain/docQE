Court blocks of the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy decision
On Thursday, a federal appeals court in the United States blocked the order of a judge, the changes to the stop-and-frisk program ("stop and search") of the New York Police Department had asked, and gave birth to the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of appeals said the decisions by judge Shira Scheindlin would suspended until after it had decided on an appeal of the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the Constitution with the way, how will implemented the program for stopping and questioning of persons.
The city appealed their assessment and the ordered corrective measures, including the decision to set up a monitoring body, which should support the police in amending its policy and the corresponding training program.
The Court heard the arguments of the requested suspension on Tuesday.
The appellate report stated that the judge had to be relieved from the case, because she violated the code of conduct for us judges by is that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality This was partially justified with a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the criticism of the Court.
The judge had ruled that police violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they were inappropriately targeted black and Latin men with the stop-and-frisk program targeted.
She appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms of policies, training and supervision, and ordered with body a pilot program supported cameras in neighborhoods, where most checks were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons who were released after an inspection by the police.
A hearing on the appeal of the city is scheduled for March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactics was criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Controls of this kind exist in various forms for decades, but increased the number of recorded controls during the tenure of the independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg at an all time high of 684.330 in the year 2011, most of them black and Latin men.
2004 was by four men, who were all minorities, lawsuit filed, which developed into a class-action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the stop-and-frisk program of the NYPD say the changes will stop unfair practices create a more trusted and more effective police and affect the manner, as other police headquarters put the control.
Opponents argue that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; also would waste money and unresolved the broader problem of a police stand after the loss of thousands of bodies in the last decade under pressure.
The judge pointed out that she do not finish the stop-and-frisk practice that is constitutional, but reform just the way of the implementation of the controls by the NYPD.
