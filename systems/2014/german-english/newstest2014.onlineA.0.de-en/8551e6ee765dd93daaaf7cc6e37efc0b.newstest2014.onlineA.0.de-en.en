Early puberty: grow up faster
African American and Hispanic girls reach puberty as their white peers tend, as studies have shown.
Physical changes yet not directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic is a trigger of early puberty
The trend to early puberty is less pronounced in boys

Should a mother be worried when her daughter at the age of seven or eight years to grow breasts and pubic hair?
At the annual Conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics's children Medical Association this week in Orlando, Florida, the Pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time trying to reassure parents - normally this is no evidence that puberty occurs quickly," explained Kaplowitz.
Obvious indicators of development, such as for example growing breasts, pubic and underarm hair and body odor, show earlier in girls.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of menarche (onset of first menstrual period) in the past 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"If the breast development begins, it takes at least two to three years until the menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "early puberty in girls: the essential guide to dealing with this common problem".
Time is the most accurate test as puberty progresses.
It is controversial, what actually represents the beginning of puberty, but applies it "precocious", if breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight.
In most cases, slowing down the process or stagnates - something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
For faster progress, tests carried out by an Endikronologen could be displayed, so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defense of a second string: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus a small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for a drug or hormonal therapy based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is restrained, regarding medication, but he admits: "Suppressing puberty can behavior problems and the feelings of girls temper, to be different from their peers."
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want, that their very young daughters have the period.
"You worry because of the risk of pregnancy, or how they manage the hygienic page", Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose Tochter ten got their days.
Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
It came from the school home scared and excited, because she was the first in your circle of friends.
There are many comprehensive published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there are no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be the cause.
Boys go similar to like girls before puberty.
Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise was the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged from six to nine years, which establishes a link between body fat and the entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, tends to be more African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty as their white peers.
There are different explanations for it.
An early puberty by all kinds of things seems to be affected by economic conditions through the air up to the genes global.
Another puzzle: While boys facial and pubic hair earlier is increasing, the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not so pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors on the AAP Conference underlined the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and young children.
"We have to be careful how we identify the real onset of puberty", said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to consult your pediatrician as they should talk with their child.
"This may mean that you must have a conversation earlier than expected," advised Kaplowitz.
If you stay quiet, the child responds normally good.
Girls, early bloom, need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than expected.
