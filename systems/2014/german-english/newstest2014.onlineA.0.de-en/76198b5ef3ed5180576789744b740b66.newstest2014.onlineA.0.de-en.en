Gazprom Alexei Miller called the beginning of a new era of gas pipeline in Bulgaria
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria constituted the start of one of the largest European energy projects, said the Gazprom Board of Directors.
"The today's event is a milestone: the construction work on the Bulgarian stretch of the South stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, have started", the Chairman of the Board of Gazprom said Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South stream is to provide more diversity of Russian export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in the Ukraine, where the bulk of Russian gas for Europe is stored, make for an increased risk in conventional routes, is to hear from official page.
Miller said the direct connection means to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" off.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South stream at discounted rates, if the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, we begin the construction work in other downstream countries on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
