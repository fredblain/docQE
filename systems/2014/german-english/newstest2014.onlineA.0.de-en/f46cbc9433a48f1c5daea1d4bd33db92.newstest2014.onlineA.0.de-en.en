Council is pleased to be solid household
Whenever it comes to the budget in the meeting of the Community Council, has good laugh Mayor Ralph Gerster.
The Gemeindes√§ckl in herdwangen Saeed is well stocked and debt no longer knows the management since 2005.
Also the financial year 2012 can be recorded in this sense as a complete success.
This was highlighted during the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
Andrea Rothmund explained, the operating budget with approximately 7.6 million euros fell out over a million higher than planned.
Also the surplus of the administrative budget was around a million euros on the approach with approximately 1.8 million euros.
Thanks to the surplus was mainly higher tax revenues and the community share of the income tax.
Also the capital budget was again significantly above planned levels.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros he was 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is essentially at the higher feeder from the administrative budget, so Raj."
Because in the financial year 2012 less investment than planned have been made, higher was also the reserves.
Overall, the general reserve to EUR 2.1 million to a total 4.9 million euros could be increased.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Raj and her team for their good work.
Gallo praised "not easily shaken as a work from the sleeve", with views of the financial statements.
He and the Councillors visibly pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but these good numbers could come soon, very costly for citizens.
By good financial situation, the municipality in the past could dispense with high rates.
This in turn grants were reduced but according to Gallo often from the country.
There are prerequisites for these grants various balancing sticks out.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities, applying for grants, must present specific rates.
"We must look at the issue of rates in the coming years due investment, for which we would like subsidies", Gallo announced in this context.
