FAA: passengers can use now electronic devices aboard aircraft (but no cell phone conversations)
Passengers can now take-off until landing, hear their electronic devices to read, work, games, music and use watching films, but not with the mobile phone as the new guidelines, which issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
But should the passengers do not expect that these changes be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would implement, depended on by the airline, said FAA employee Michael Huerta at a press conference.
The airlines must have the FAA, that aircraft comply with new guidelines and that they have updated the training manual of the flight personnel, as well as the arrangements for the storage of equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it got already plans by some airlines, which would expand the use of portable electronic devices in-flight.
These airlines were also delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the State of the plan we could approve soon the expanded use of electronic devices", was announced by the FAA in a statement.
Currently passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices, if the aircraft doors are closed.
They may start again until, when the plane reaches an altitude of three kilometers and the captain gives the green light.
At the entrance to the landing to the passengers turn it off again and may not restart it, before the plane landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines, whose Flugzeuge be secured against electronic interference could allow its passengers even at launch, landing and on the runway to use the devices, the FAA said.
The most new airliners and other planes, which were converted at higher altitudes, for the use of Wi-Fi, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely - and we cooperate in this regard with the airline - both will benefit from page" Glading said.
We are frankly tired of having to feel on this subject such as supervisor.
However, Internet connections were prohibited, for surfing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data at three kilometers, the Authority said.
Passengers will be prompted to the flight mode smartphones, tablets and other devices.
So still no "words with friends", the Scrabble-like online game, playing the actor Alec Baldwin 2011 on his Smartphone, he public had to leave an American Airlines jet, because he refused to switch off the device, while it was parked at the gate.
And heavier equipment such as laptops must also continue to be stored, since here a danger of injury, if they fly through the cabin.
Cell phone conversations are also prohibited during the flight.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls between the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA revokes ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing may be
Last month Mark Rosenker of the road safety authority National Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national transport issues at CBS News said phones would still considered risk.
"Mobile are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transfer from the air can disrupt also masts", so Rosenker.
An Advisory Committee of industry, which was launched by the FAA to investigate this issue in life, recommended last month that the Government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure has risen to the FAA to loosen restrictions for use.
Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argued that there was no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, that forgets to turn the unit off up to a third of the passengers or ignored is.
The FAA started in 1966, to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers after reports of interference with navigation and communication devices by VHF radios carried by passengers became known, which at that time represented the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA, that electronic interference bother them.
Airlines offer passengers for several years Wi-Fi when the altitude is reached.
The flyer adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger planes should be suitable for the wider use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices give generally much less phone radiation than previous generations.
E reader, for example, give only minimal radiation, if you scroll around.
But the transfer values are stronger during the download or sending data.
Amazon.com is one of the supporters of a loosening of restrictions on device use by passengers.
2011 invited an airliner full of Kindle E-reader company employees and made a test flight, to identify issues, not observed but.
The FAA Advisory Committee members expressed mixed feelings, regarding the risk associated with the use of equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the passenger Association of National Association of airline passengers said, he believes, the interference by the device was real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other Committee members said there were only scattered reports of pilots who militated for a disturbance of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them were very old.
The Committee recommended however the FAA to allow pilots to order switching off the devices by passengers in instrument landing under conditions of poor visibility.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described it as a reasonable accommodation for travelers who are today extensively equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience not contrary to the safety stands," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
