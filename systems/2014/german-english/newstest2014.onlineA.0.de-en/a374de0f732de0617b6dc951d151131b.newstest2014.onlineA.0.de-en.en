New nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure smoking kill
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine, which could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Further attempts is needed before testing on humans, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy once help millions of smokers who can, tried to stop and it tried all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that your nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches", so Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been altered so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus infects the liver cells, which then produce a steady stream of antibodies selectively.
The antibody Hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker learns no nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice, nicotine has been administered, maintained their normal activity level.
Mice without vaccination, however, had taken a "break", said the researchers, a sign that the nicotine had reached her brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science translational medicine.
Former tobacco vaccine failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccines had to be given so often to maintain the level of antibodies, that they were expensive and impractical.
The cost of the new vaccine are likely significantly lower, however, he transformed liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people, if he was sure, could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and prevent to nicotine addiction.
But more likely is that smokers would employ him to quit.
"You know then: if they start to smoke again they feel no pleasure more here because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to drop the habit", he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned it was necessary to further research.
