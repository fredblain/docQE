First he wants to know but clarified his situation.
The former NSA employees not addressed letter, sought by the United States has made it clear that the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Attorney General.

To the competent
I was asked to write to you with regard to your inquiry into the mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and previously contractually or through a direct employment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA) was the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States employs.
In the course of my employment in these facilities, I witnessed systematic violations of law my Government, led me from moral obligation to act.
I saw as a result of the publication of this concerns me I a serious and sustained smear campaign exposed that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum, which allows me to the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the response on my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens all over the world and also high officials - including the United States--have the revelations to a system of all-encompassing surveillance that accountability is no one guilty, judged as a service to the public.
This espionage revelations drew many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the formerly hidden abuse of the public trust.
The benefits to society from this acquired knowledge becomes increasingly clearer; at the same time, the risks in buying were visibly reduced.
Although demonstrably positive was the result of my efforts, my Government remains treated dissent as a betrayal and seeks to criminalize political speech and under indictment.
Still, to speak the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the Government of the United States with the support of the international community will take this prejudicial attitude.
I hope that I, if the difficulties of the humanitarian situation are settled, his will able, in the responsible clarification of the facts with regard to the statements made in the media, in particular in regard to truth and authenticity of reports, to participate appropriately and in accordance with law.
I look forward to talking to you in your country, once the situation is clarified, and thank you for their efforts to uphold international law, that protects us all.
