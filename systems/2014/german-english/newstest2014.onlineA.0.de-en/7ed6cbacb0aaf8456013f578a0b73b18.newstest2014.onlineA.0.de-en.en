Painted the fence on Bechtle land
A group of the citizens initiative "Swiss meadow" has embellished the fence on Bechtle land on the promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
Also cleaned and it broadened the footpath, it says in a press release.
The planned ceiling of the decaying House in the rear part of the land had not been allowed for security reasons, because the area threatens to slide off.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the land, had agreed with his colleague Reinhard Domke of BI the beautifying action.
Before the action of BI had been brought to a banner with the message "We are".
That bothered the approximately 20 members of the citizen's initiative but little in their action.
Her motto on the large poster was called "We're against building ruins".
So she wanted to indicate the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow â€“ should fail the giant project one day.
In conversation with many passers-by before the "construction site" showed that some citizens believe that they will be better many with the realization of the project of the city, although many have the same questions on the dimension of the presented project BI.
But they begin to resign because the city further delaying these answers, it is from BI.
Like to hear was, affect also the public statements of the Mayor.
May had said at the Municipal Council meeting, that he feared for the thermal bath, should be the people with the referendum against plans for a bath and spa complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some appear so downright scared, others perceive it as "crude blackmail attempt" of the population, according to the press release on BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all volunteers.
