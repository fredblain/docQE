In the Interior you will find racing seats and six-point harnesses, as well as a hands-free system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with care by bowler-works mechanics and logistical support up to vehicle storage between events.
Drew bowler, CEO of bowler Motorsport, explains: "The rally customers who come to bowler, have changed."
They are not all experienced racing driver, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure, as well as an accessible way to world class events.
We are happy to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new possibilities to experience the different disciplines of rally in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the rigors and the reality of rally raid.
We really had fun doing it, to develop the Defender challenge truck â€“ this is a fun Championship.
In addition, there is a training and test day in February as well as the option to participate in desert racing in North Africa and the Middle East during the Defender challenge.
