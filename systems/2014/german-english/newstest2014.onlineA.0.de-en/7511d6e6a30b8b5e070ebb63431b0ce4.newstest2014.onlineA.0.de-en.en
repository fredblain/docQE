The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defense lawyer, who warned a large police investigation, because he was afraid, a drug Baron his secret drug addiction could be uncovered, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about the investigation to its activities in the drug trade, after he was been compromised by his own addiction to cocaine.
The lawyer praised by criminologists as "top notch" nicknamed "Bash" was arrested 2011 at his home after the police had monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in previous proceedings of the drug.
Civil servants observed how Scarborough (32) cocaine at the home of lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, delivered three bag, while he was with colleagues at a dinner of the Bar Association.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried illegally to obtain information about the arrest of two men in behalf of Scarborough and one of its partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police during a major investigation to the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after police at a series of house searches, heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and £ 200,000 of cash made sure.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals, because he feared that his drug addiction could be made public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the law firm of Forbes solicitors in Blackburn, was found in two charges obstruction of Justice guilty at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial and sentenced.
He admitted to possession of cocaine in a previous survey.
The lawyer was convicted after police found in their investigations against Scarborough, that it had been in February 2011 in regular telephone contact with Ditta.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went home to Bosbos and there put the drugs with a purity of 60 per cent in a black golf glove under the dustbin of advocate.
Shortly after he drugs had delivered, Scarborough was on the phone regularly with Ditta, who was at the dinner in the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, took the drugs and then nine communications between the two were exchanged.
In court, it was announced that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after drugs of class A in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards were discovered in tests.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied taking cocaine and said he had spoken with the alleged dealer because this was his client, and claimed that the "attorney-client"privilege is subject to their discussion.
Ditta took his wallet during his arrest and was trying to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he stated he run an Office with his home address as well as in the workplace and clients would call home it due to legal matters.
In court it became known that he had telephoned key players of against drug trafficking, which he had represented some previously, after significant arrests and informed, what did the investigators about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should better than everyone else know that you are not breaking the law."
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a lawyer because he has admitted too much with specific clients.
The relationship in question is not a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplied drugs to his lawyer.
Part of his message was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of this people.
But that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He worked against the police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Thus, Mr. Ditta brought his profession into disrepute.
He was close to certain clients, in particular, Scarborough, and he has allowed that his independence was compromised.
Ditta dismissed any wrongdoing by himself and claimed: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, I'm not, and wanted to provide information to Scarborough, then I would wait no 15 hours, but do that right away."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead, of Lancashire police said: "Mr Ditta made the step from a criminal to a criminal at the moment, as he began to purchase drugs by organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to a desperate compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime, who hired him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure the public trust and confidence.
Ditta has betrayed this trust and tries to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The serious and organised crime unit of Lancashire headed the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases of possession of cocaine and obstruction of Justice, what underlines our determination to bring criminals to court.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We find and bring to justice.
Scarborough itself was sentenced to 14 years in prison, after he had declared the plot to the heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade guilty.
Participating ´ another thirty-five people on drug trafficking were sentenced to Gesamtstrafen 153 years for drug offences.
Ditta published a range of questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job is to represent clients on death row in America as a lawyer, his ultimate guest at the dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality was the motivation for his work on his website.
