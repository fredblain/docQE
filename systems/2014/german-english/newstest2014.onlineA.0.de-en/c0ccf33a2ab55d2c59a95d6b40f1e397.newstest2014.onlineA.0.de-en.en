Looking for ice cream, which glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glow-in-the dark ice - using of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis himself took full advantage of the fluorescent properties of sea animals and created from it a luminous delicacy.
The idea came to him, after he had read a research paper about jellyfish and was able to convince Chinese scientists artificially to produce the glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts when eating with the tongue, which raised the pH in the protein and the light thrown.
Chris explains the ice respond to the heat in the mouth and light - the more it licks, is the brighter it.
Charlie, the ice cream company's founders "lick me I'm delicious", says: "the product is incredible, but still in a very early stage of production, and you get two grams for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the protein is heated by the mouth, the pH rises and lights up the ice.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it, because it has this wonderful glow on Halloween.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the jellyfish fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes good.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, which include beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation to be more ambitious.
He says: "I want to develop like an invisible ice cream."
This is in and of itself impossible due to the refraction of light, caused by the ice crystals make up ice cream; but I suppose we will find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, which are artificially produced by Chinese scientists
