The British Government announced a study that will enhance the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd proposes achieving already at the beginning of phase 1 in the year 2026 high speed links between Scotland and the North of England.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring together United Kingdom".
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
On completion of phase 2, there will be links to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of the construction of the high speed road between London and the North of England by 32.7 billion pounds on 42.6 billion pounds.
The British Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 Ltd, to search for more track capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of eventually three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network, bringing together Britain and its cities."
We go ahead with HS2, because it brings enormous advantages.
Without it, we face a capacity crunch in our railway network.
But it's also about the connection between 18 UK cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
Keith Brown Carmichael urged on behalf of the Scottish Government, "unequivocally" the Scottish involvement in the HS2 network to engage in.
Brown said: "the high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits to Scotland, at the same time, but also the economic power of Scotland provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK."
Therefore, we are pleased, as a partner of the British Government to work and exploring the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland which creates benefits for all and complemented the Glasgow-Edinburgh link, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I am looking forward, with the British Ministers next year to review the investigation report and to decide the next steps together.
