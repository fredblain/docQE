Again released via air rescue service of North Sea oil rig rescued birds
A bird flown by air ambulance to the coast, which was found exhausted on a North Sea oil rig, was released into nature.
The water rail was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where she was nursed on Scottish SPCA animal protection organisation in their rescue Center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, Manager of the Center, said: "This water rail was probably a winter migratory birds from Northern Europe, which has been held up by strong winds on the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the oil rig.
He added: "He could no longer fly further, which is why we were contacted with a request for help."
Upon its release, the water rail was fit and healthy.
