Scientists could shed more light on how that relates a dog with its tail wagging.
Previous research had shown that lucky dogs with the tail more waving to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while it was the left nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs may perceive these subtle differences and respond to it.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist who University of Trento, said: "in humans is well known, that the left and right half of the brain react differently to stimuli, which cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried in other species to look at this.
He also remarked that the right half of the brain for the movement of the left was responsible for dogs just like humans and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles with the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react on the lateral tail wagging their kind, the researchers monitored the animals while himself saw these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of dogs and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail times even moving in the, in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "we showed movies with dogs the dogs â€“ either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we could control more movement of the tail to the left or right."
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressionless dog has moved the tail to the right (as viewed from the perspective of the flying dog out) they were totally relaxed.
But the inclination of the tail was mainly left (again from the perspective of the dog which wags), so your heart rate increased and she looked uneasy.
According to Professor Vallortigara dogs not intentionally communicate by these movements.
He believes, instead, that the dogs from experience had learned what movement they should worry and when not.
He said: "When you have various encounters with other dogs and the wagging tail in one direction is rather associated with friendly behavior and the right hand side rather produces a less friendly behavior, then you respond based on this experience."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, expert on dog behavior and visiting fellow at the Faculty of veterinary medicine of the University of Bristol said that this was not the first study investigated whether left and right for dogs is important.
Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn upside left, if they see an aggressive dog, and to the right, if it's a happy dog.
Of other research at the University of Victoria in Canada was the following: "rather go to dogs on a robotic dog, if, cock ' left WAGs and not right, instead restless - exactly the other way around as in the Italian study."
According to his words the differences could derive from the fact that the dogs in the different studies not interpreted by the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study, how dogs respond to real dogs that could help, he said.
"While there is considerable evidence of many different mammals, that the two halves of the brain are used for various purposes, but many of the details must yet be determined - and dogs are no exception," as Bradshaw.
Because her behavior but simply record, it will probably not long until we understand why the tail sometimes sometimes moves in the one in the other direction.
