John Kerry declared in an unprecedented admission of the US espionage was "inappropriate gone too far"
John Kerry has hinted a softening of the defensive attitude of the United States in relation to their monitoring programmes with an unexpected admission by saying that the espionage was gone in certain cases"inappropriately too far".
The Foreign Minister also admitted he bear the responsibility that you turned on "Autopilot", as the explosive revelations of Whistleblowers Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities together with Barack Obama.
The U.S. Government got from its allies in a diplomatic storm of indignation by the leaked information.
In a speech transmitted via video link to the open Government Conference in London said Kerry: "Without question the President and I and others have experienced in the Government of some things that are expired simply because the ability to do so was still on the second world war and the difficult years of the cold war almost on autopilot and of course goes back to 9 / 11."
Then, he of the U.S. Government admitted as a first senior member, that the US espionage have crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: "In some cases that has inappropriate too far."
The President is determined to create clarity, and therefore performs a thorough investigation so nobody must feel, this abuse takes place.
I can assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process are not affected.
Kerry insisted however, that the NSA was a force of for good, and through its monitoring operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We have to do it, people are ready to blow themselves up in the air with a new world."
There is a radical extremism in the world, who is intent on killing people, to blow up in the air and attacking governments.
So, what if you were able to intercept it and stop it before it happens?
We actually have plane crashes, attacks on buildings and prevented the murder of people, because we have experienced in the run-up to such plans.
Meanwhile, American legislators will travel to Europe, to dispel the misgivings of the alleged American espionage and to convince Europeans of the need, in the anti-terrorist efforts to continue with the United States to cooperate, as the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken with representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned because of their threats, due to frustration over the monitoring by the national security agency no longer anti-terrorist organizations to participate in.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism to stay aboard," said Murphy, who sits and is active as Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on foreign relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington for the first time in the Senate as a Democrat.
Also I'm going to Europe, there to make it clear that we still must work together in the fight against terrorism, notwithstanding their anger about the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe, have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the intelligence agency this week said the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies had been collected and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations have quoted from documents provided by Snowden, stating that the NSA have monitored the phone from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of State worldwide.
The Director of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the spying among allies as necessary and stated that this was common on both sides.
In all the turmoil, Murphy said his authority preparing the journey of the Congress, which this year will take place, and hoped the delegation will include members from both parties and Chambers.
The names of the other participating members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary will worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip is the improvement in relations, he said also that there would be some "serious words".
He said European Governments should be to honest about the kind of spyware their population, which they themselves for years.
Although we can change our monitoring programs, and better protect the rights of Europeans, they must come to terms but also with the fact, that we are not the only ones that spy, so Murphy.
Meanwhile a trip in the Middle East and Poland pending for John Kerry at the weekend, meet up there with the resentment over the American strategy in Syria, to deal with Egypt and Iran, as well as the U.S. monitoring activities.
