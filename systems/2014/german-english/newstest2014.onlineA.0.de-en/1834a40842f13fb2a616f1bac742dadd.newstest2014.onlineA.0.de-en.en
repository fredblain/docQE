Pope Franziskus appoints first Cardinals in February
Pope Franziskus will appointed first new cardinals of the Catholic Church on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest ranking cleric in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also choosing a Pope, so that Francis will nominate the first group of men thus, which ultimately will contribute to the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 Cardinals.
But a cardinal who has reached the age of 80, can no longer take part in the election of the Pope â€“ that falls to a group of 120 "voting Cardinals".
In a statement, in which the message was posted, said father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, there will take place a meeting of all Cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of new cardinals will held, who was known as a consistory.
"Pope Franziskus has decided to announce his decision on the convening of the consistory for other meetings, which require the participation of Cardinals from around the world, can be scheduled in advance in February", Lombardi said.
Jack Valero Catholic voices said that the number of voting Cardinals will probably be dropped until February.
He said a Pope nominates as necessary, so that the number of voting Cardinals again amounts to 120, and want as many Cardinals over 80, as he usually so many Cardinals.
The consistory in the next year was so important, because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero.
Currently, there is some overhang on the side of Europe and especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint Cardinals from around the world, to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics living in South America, but they have only a tiny number of Cardinals.
The Cardinals will be also the first to be appointed since the creation of the Council of Cardinals, founded by Francis, a group of eight Cardinals from around the world, which have the mandate to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has selected these eight Cardinals to help him", said Valero.
He said it was "quite possible" that Francis ask the Cardinals for advice.
But so far, we weren't in this situation - this is all very new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large locations would be appointed Cardinals, but put Francis 'full of surprises - so we know not whom he appoints".
