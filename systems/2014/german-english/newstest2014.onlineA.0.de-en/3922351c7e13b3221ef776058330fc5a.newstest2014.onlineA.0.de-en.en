Halloween 2013: In figures
When I was a kid, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late, and dress us up for the neighborhood.
Today, I've rather become the Halloween muffle.
In the last two years have I not agreed me to distribute candy from my apartment and it won't do well this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep, what about Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million, to be exact - celebrate Halloween this year and spending doing total 6.9 billion US dollars for candy, costumes and decorations, the American Association of retailers (NRF).
The trend values are one thing on which I am then pleased every Halloween.
The costumes will be approximately 1.2 billion of 6.9 billion U.S. dollar spent, so the NRF.
Sluttiest inanimate objects are the rage this year.
Women must no longer wrap themselves in sexy clothing, they can embody now also seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
I lots of zombies thanks to the expect walking dead, as far as men, and I bet, the Daft Punk space men will succeed this year in the Instagram feeds.
According to Google, there are the most sought-after costumes Batman, pirates, zombies and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We have dressed our dogs last year and were thus to my amazement not only.
Actually Americans spending this year for your pets costumes $330 million, the NRF.
There are a lot of "Hot Dogs".
As far as candy, we're not squeamish.
Americans will spend this year to $1.9 billion so the Nielsen Company.
These are approximately 270 million pounds of candy bars, lollipops, candies and jelly beans.
So good news for the U.S. Department of Commerce according to 41 million people who draw saying "Trick or treat" by the district.
Actually we will buy about 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - we delude ourselves - eating.
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sweet candy corn; Nevertheless, it sold 15 million pounds to Halloween so the national Confectionery Manufacturers Association.
These are about 9 billion kernels.
It's a mystery that I still could not solve.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween as houses, haunted.
You have great names like "terror behind the walls" (which by the way, stands in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There's actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, achieving $500 million revenue, so America haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos, in which man is pissing in the pants and friends make on Facebook, where you won't get rid of them, and then the type on which you stand, one such as "nice face" will leave a comment.
But we come finally to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made acquainted us with the great pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o'-lantern is something like decorating the Christmas tree - the we made small on have.
Fortunately the "baby into the pumpkin" began trend last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up so, your way to carve the pumpkin, not to sit.
This year about Americans will spend $106 million for pumpkins, so the US Census Bureau.
The Jack-o'-lantern that slowly rots in the front yard, probably originates from Illinois, where this year's 245 million pounds of Pumpkins were harvested.
If you really want to score, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty from its 921-pound pumpkin.
