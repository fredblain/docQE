Obama backed down in health policy
After severe criticism President Obama backed out yesterday on his often-repeated, clear pledge: "If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a termination letter, the Republican President accused in the last few days, he had deceived the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise.
"They can keep the vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the layoffs, Obama urged those Americans who have received such notices, to look on the market for a new insurance.
Most citizens could get for the same price or cheaper than forecast as a better, more comprehensive health insurance.
"You get a better deal," he said.
The Government described it as a little surprising that the five percent of the population, who have taken out insurance, would have to look to a different tariff, because her contract Care Act is not the new standards after the affordable.
"I would like to say that Americans directly: you deserve better", Sebelius said at a hearing before the energy and Commerce Committee of the House of representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the affordable care Act, said that the launch of the online platform was "abysmal" run since October.
"I am just as frustrated and angry as everyone else also", she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This phrase of a disgruntled Sebelius a seated behind her counselor at the yesterday's hearing in the House of representatives was recorded after a dispute with the Republican members Billy Long out of Missouri. It was whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
Long Sebelius harried after more than three hours hearing reviewed the question of why the "architect" of the affordable care Act have not voluntarily waived on a Government-sponsored insurance to complete yourself a tariff at HealthCare.gov the now millions of Americans would sell.
