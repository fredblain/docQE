Before the station Derby against Schalke accompanying BVB pendant with flares had caused ugly scenes in the Veltins-arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced affiliated hard consequences.
Before the Friday match against VfB Stuttgart in the Fußball - Bundesliga, the Ultras responded with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost spooky acoustics, the is the viewer until shortly before the kick-off of the business between the German runners-up Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park offered.
The visiting fans with their chants were heard mostly.
The South stand against it, where are the most faithful of the faithful--and loudest--BVB fans, presented itself first exceptionally quiet: no songs, no battle cries.
The podium of the CAPO, which otherwise coordinates the common spirit, remained vacant.
And at the front on the grandstand blew a big flag with inscription "Section stadium ban" alone.
Just as goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always first BVB player the place entered, momentary jubilation surged up.
When his teammates followed, but long not everywhere there loud singing and waving scarves -.
Nothing stirred in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South stand.
Also that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel again past the positive experience days - Derby victory, victory over arsenal, renewal of coach Jürgen Klopp - listed was not celebratory mood.
Only five minutes before the kickoff of the CAPO climbed his podium - and until then almost with hands tangible tension erupted in a loud cry, when Daniels as usual asked off the mood in the stands at the stadium.
Last was the South grandstand at the series - as always and the loudest place in the stadium was finally here again as usual.
And no later than when the loud call "Derby winner stands up" came with kick-off from the South stands, everything was as usual.
The silence before was probably a response to the events of the past few days.
Just before area Derby FC Schalke 04 some of Borussia Dortmund supporters visitors with had fired flares in the spectator stands and on the Court - and hit almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The match was kicked off late because of the chaotic scenes.
Borussia Dortmund boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tips of the Dortmund ultras in his Office - and believed to be Watzkes words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the ultra movement as a whole", the Borussia Dortmund boss announced Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, the Ultras Watzke forbade a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I have forbidden it," he said.
We can not give up the zero-tolerance policy in terms of pyrotechnics.
Also ways of punishment were shown the Ultras - until Tuesday they now have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, so Watzke, BVB will set a penalty until the end of next week.
"This is dramatic," Watzke is assured.
It may be interesting how the responses to the South stand then take.
