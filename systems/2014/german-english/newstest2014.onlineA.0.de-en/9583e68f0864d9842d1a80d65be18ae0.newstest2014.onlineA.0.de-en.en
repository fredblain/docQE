Freudenstadt: Fast action take by surprise host
With a small squad, the men I TSV had to make Freudenstadt in the Schiller school gymnasium in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb.
The Älbler were indeed with an experienced team on the other side of the net.
But soon showed that they, also age-related, not quite could keep up with the quick actions of Freudenstadt.
With the hard and placed spreads, the Gönninger did hard extremely.
Repeatedly missed it that by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz clean passes zugespielten power Center and attacks and were on the block defense not to the point.
Two high first set gains clearly expressed the superiority of Freudenstadt in all respects.
In the face of this overwhelming and decisive game performance the third set became something feeble and listless 3-0-full time (25:13, 25:14:25: 22) won.
A much more powerful opponent is there on November 2 with the TV Baiersbronn, which clearly prevailed in Nagold, on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dabbous, Felix P.s, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class the second teams of Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
You delivered a hard-fought two hour match.
Nervousness on both sides especially in the reception of the ball caused errors and point gifts; also in the passports, the precision was sometimes scarce and in some critical scenes, the zeal prevented the look for possible point gains.
In this performance very balanced encounter the great physical and a pleasing commitment of both teams agreed the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto but consistently.
