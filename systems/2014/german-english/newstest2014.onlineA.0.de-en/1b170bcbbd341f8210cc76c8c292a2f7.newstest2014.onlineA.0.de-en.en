Learning rather than unemployed: pilot project for unskilled in tourism
Startetheute a pilot project for the tourism industry at the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the federal employment agency 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled in the industry, should be qualified across over three winters to specialists for hotels and restaurants.
"New about it is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert of the employment agency of Neubrandenburg.
The benefit was varied: participants would thus not unemployed, the companies have trained specialists are increasingly missing in hotels and restaurants, and the Agency must finance not unemployment.
In the project are also the Industrie - und Handelskammer in Neubrandenburg Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and the German hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga).
