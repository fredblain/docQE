A black box in the car?
American road planners are looking for a money source, to repair the decaying highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box, which takes place in each car's dashboard.
The devices, which record every kilometres and report the information to the authorities, are core of a controversial attempt by Washington and planning offices of the Federal States to revise the obsolete system for the financing of American roads.
Suddenly, the usually rather boring field of road planning has reignited an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and argue, that the Government the small boxes to record mileage - and may also, where they went - use and can then use the information for the calculation of tax assessments.
The tea party is appalled.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
But while it can be agreed in Congress not on a procedure several States no longer wait.
They are considering, as they can switch to a system over the next ten years to pay the driver per driven mile.
Thousands of motorists have already tested the tachograph, some with GPS monitoring of which are equipped.
This is really a must-have for our country.
"There is nothing that we may or may not use", said Hasan Ikhrata, Director of the Southern California Assn. of Government, is planning a recording of driven miles with all California motorists in the State from 2025.
The manner, as we pay these taxes, will change.
The technology for this is here.
The initiative comes at a time as the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by the taxes Americans pay at the pump is broke.
But in America much less fueled as before.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The State fuel tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per liter) is not increased for 20 years.
Politicians in high fuel prices do not dare to raise the tax even by a penny.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His State has equipped recently 500 cars with tachograph, with which a mileage-based payment system to be tested.
"That represents the long term appropriate alternative", he said.
Bureaucrats describe it as a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the urban Liberals idea appeals, because the tax would, for example, to engage, to influence, that will reduce congestion and greenhouse gases driving.
The California designers put on the system in the development of strategies with which the ambitious statutory objectives of the State on climate change are to be achieved.
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also said that he saw in it the most viable long-term alternative.
Also the free marketers of the reason Foundation are the idea taken by travelled route pay driver.
"This is no tax that disappears into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice President for policy at the reason.
People pay for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American Transport Ministers, who had urged the Congress in a report in 2011, to move toward mile-based billing.
The U.S. Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project that would include 10,000 cars last year.
But the majority in the House of representatives prevented the advance and reacted to represent the concerns of members from rural areas, people who have to travel often many miles on the way to work or into the city everyday.
Several States and cities nonetheless move on your own in this direction.
Oregon, which is currently 5,000 riders for the biggest experiment of the country is the most dedicated.
These drivers will pay soon the mile instead of mineral oil tax to the State.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering one.
Illinois tests it enshrined with trucks.
And the I-95 Coalition, which includes the ministries of transport of 17 States on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how the change could be introduced.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently, 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices, car drivers were skeptical at the thought of the Government could track their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," explains directed Khan, head of the strategy and results management in the Ministry of transport of Nevada.
The people did not want it.
As the test went on, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its Web site: "It would be relatively easy to transform the tachograph in full-blown monitoring devices."
There is no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada belongs to a series of States that now are looking for more affordable technology, with which the State can collect kilometres, but not exactly when and where.
Thus, so Khan, also the public would be reassured.
Hunting for this technology, some authorities has led to a small startup company called true mileage in California.
The company is not lined up originally to assist States in the taxation of motorists.
Rather, it was their goal to gain a foothold, where drivers on the basis of driven miles to pay in an emerging market for insurance.
But the devices tested by her are interesting also for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, regularly be uploaded via a modem.
"People are more willing to participate when their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of true mileage.
Huge mistakes were made in some of these public pilot programs.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the designers experiment to give motorists a number of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or choose no device at all and instead pay a flat fee on the basis of miles driven by all the inhabitants of the State average.
Other authorities hope to be able to sell the concept of a wary public, by equipping the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a device taxation pay can also park fees, insurance only for mileage must be paid with speed data collected by other vehicles in real time, thanks to those drivers can Dodge congestion.
"Motorists would be motivated by the added value of the benefits provided by the system, to participate in", according to a planning document of the city.
However, some transport planners wonder whether all this talk about paying per mile is not only a huge red herring.
With the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area who told officials, the Congress could San Francisco Bay Fund simply by increasing the fuel tax solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust.
An additional one-time fee or an annual tax could be imposed on motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gasoline, so that they pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation, if aspirin is also sufficient," explained Randy Rentschler, the Director of legislative and public affairs of the Commission.
If we do this, hundreds get millions of car drivers worried about their privacy and many other things.
