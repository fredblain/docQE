Council takes trackage in the visor
To the level crossing "the deer" converted elaborately, to increase road safety?
Yes, the Councillors have decided.
Schiltach must take 220 000 euro in the hand for it.
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve in the coming year the Kinzig Valley Railway.
Especially the safety at level crossings should be increased - regularly nationwide occur collisions of trains with other vehicles.
The municipalities agree to the reconstruction, they must take part with one-third of the cost, railway and Federal share the rest.
Schiltachs city architect Roland Grießhaber explained the Municipal Council the peculiarities of Bahübergangs "on the deer".
There, the city is planning to build a bulge in the height of the tunnel mouth West of the railway tracks.
Larger vehicles, for example those that transport timber carrier, could there at oncoming traffic, without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber is therefore proposed to construct the city could widen the subsequent road in due time, to ensure a smooth traffic flow a required retaining wall.
This was in the City Council controversy, since some Councils were the need for a road distribution in doubt: Thomas Kipp brought the mood of critics to the point with his statement: "we need to take as much money in the hand because so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: the level crossing "Deer" become regularly used for timber transportation.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" will partly transported over this route, because up to 20 metres long vehicles could not use the route Habakuk bridge because there not could turn onto the main road.
In addition the route serve those vehicles which may use the tunnel, as Umleitungfür if the main road is closed, Haas argued.
Refrain was that Kirchberg Schlossberg tunnel would need to be rebuilt and refurbished, as currently is the case in Wolfach, could the level crossing "on the"deer"for an extended period of time an important traffic come to.
The Councils agreed to let what the intended widening of the road would cost study.
Regardless was approved mainly the conversion of the level crossing with the proviso that the required retaining wall is built so that the town "station road", where appropriate, could expand the subsequent road for encounter traffic about 5.5 m.
The conversion of the level crossing at tannery could Tan, however, entail a completely different problem, concerning the access to the rapidly increasing "Geroltzhäuser way".
The Administration had examined the conversion plans of the railway from the engineering firm Breinlinger, because she had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser path then easily possible.
The investigation came to the conclusion that cannot be ruled out is that the slope conditions of the road could cause, that long vehicles sit on.
The responsibility for this in turn carry the town a road construction load carrier.
The conversion could therefore entail liability disputes.
Since the removal of wood as well as bend in its current state of development work, you should not agree to the modification of the level crossing, argued Haas.
Also the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle following the transition is significantly lower than on the other level crossings at this point, because beside the breakpoint Center Taormina, insist to the a good sight.
Even trains from the main train station here should be ready yet slowed down at this point, that no collision threatens.
Majority approval was denied the conversion of this level crossing because the town of Schiltach "would have to suffer the problem with vehicles fitting on", so the Councils, because the railway could retire after completion of construction from the responsibility.
The Panel of the tags at the level crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Kuhbach", for which already crossing agreements have been reached with the railway is considered to be not a problem.
