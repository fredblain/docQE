Cry of despair a Obama voter
I voted twice for President Obama in the hope that change is possible
He says Obama has taken commendable efforts had been thwarted by the Republican blocking tactics
The blockade policy excuse not the site problems by Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memoir about the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at Harvard Medical School.
I'm currently reading a terribly sad book.
It is a book from which I thought it would cheer me up during the sombre second year of studying medicine and give me hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" (courage to win) and depicts the memoirs of Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.
When I am finished the evening with my patient records and go to bed, then the book leads me back at a time when politics inspired millions and could take your breath away for a talk.
The election was a landslide victory and newscaster stopped to make the historical significance of this hour before the eyes.
My classmates were weeping with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers that they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on his way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
As at 2008, Obama joined in the Office, he had ratings of 82%.
And then, I close the book.
On the present a rude awakening is to switch back, as if one is torn from a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be, a sad reminder of missed opportunities a vague memory.
Over the years, since I first made my voice, something has changed in fact.
But it's nothing that I could have imagined me easy.
I acknowledge the great and varied things that Obama has achieved, by the passage of the affordable care Act for health insurance until the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Also I believe that the partisan blockade tactics have tipped too many efforts, with whom our nation should be brought forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, just a few to mention.
But I've won numerous times the Obama administration's hostility towards colleagues and acquaintances, I'm arrived with my explanations at the end.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it allows eavesdropping on foreign heads of State, or the killing of innocent children by drones in overseas.
It can not explain why the national security agency to collect information about the private lives of Americans and the State misconduct disclose why punished the whistleblower.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor therefore be bypassed public financing and spending limits during the presidential elections.
It justifies not the results of a report in which it says the efforts of the White House to the immobilization of the media to be the "most aggressive"... Since the Nixon administration.
And j√ºngstens it can excuse not an inability, to design a simple website care act in more than three years since the adoption of the affordable.
I don't know if it is what I would have expected.
I would have to understand with 18, that Government work could contradict the political campaigns preceding it.
Obviously members is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre dominate public discussion.
But when I look at the examples above, they seem largely by the Government to be chosen.
And that bothers me the most.
I got re-elected 2012 Obama, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative, he seemed not to be able to set its direction and positions.
I was under the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope, which we had long heard.
But with the fall in the ratings for Obama below 45% this week the return has become even harder in 2008 through this book.
It awakens the longing in me after many promises, which dissolved in air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama suffered a heavy loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the election officials after the decision, he said his staff they would have to get back on course and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want that we find our magic," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It is five years later, Mr President, and I could not be more agree with you.
