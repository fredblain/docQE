On the subject of traffic, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD cemented their no to a toll for cars required by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flat rate for much driving and thus environmentally counterproductive", said the SPD negotiators for the subject traffic, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
It threatened Dodge traffic on rural roads, which already are accident black spots.
Introducing a toll for all cars would be only a first step from the perspective Pronolds.
"There is a danger, that the compensation for Germans is deleted at a later time," he said.
