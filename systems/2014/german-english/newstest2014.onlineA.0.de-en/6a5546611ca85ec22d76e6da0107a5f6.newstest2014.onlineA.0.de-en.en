Living with prospects for the future
Actually, Waltraud lives fantastically Ries.
Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with greenery, an old stock of trees, nice neighbors, and not too much traffic.
In the city, there are only a few minutes by public transport.
"Don't be afraid I hope before spinning?", asks Waltraud Ries and shows on a fat Spider to the door frame.
I'm looking for a new apartment for some time for my husband and me.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason is however no spiders phobia, but the concern, no longer being able to cope with the many stairs to the House and in the home, at the age she explains.
Also: Since a meniscus operation the Mittfünfzigerin on my own body has need to know what it means to move with handicap from floor to floor.
First recently published a book of hers titled 'happily reside in the age - which perception is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what doesn't at the age', she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband in the duplex apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the Greens.
Today with mid-fifties, Waltraud thinks differently about Ries.
She also knows that she belongs to the few people, dealing with the topic 'Housing for the elderly'.
Most ignore it, as long as it goes.
Only the others are old ', she says with a grin.
Only when the suffering is really great, you do are thoughts.
'Then it may be already too late', so Ries.
In her book, the Interior presents 17 residential models for a self-determined housing for the elderly.
'What living form but select, is always an individual decision', she explains.
D i e solution there is not for the ages.
Even those who could afford the retirement residence in Tuscany or Brittany, should consider getting, he could be sick, too.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the local language is large in the Dolce Vita,' admits the book author willing to deportation.
Among their models are classic models of care, alternative forms of housing or the oft-cited retired WG.
Everyone has so his ticks and quirks in the age
'For me nothing would be so a shared apartment but', she says with a wink.
Nowhere near enough like in a student apartment with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'At the age you need simply his retreat', so Ries.
A senior living community can still work, the author wants to exclude yet.
That should run but otherwise as in the classic student WG.
And sometimes you want to also just his rest ', she believes.
With this opinion it is not alone at least in the city.
' The most ancient people in Stuttgart want to stay as long as it can in its own home', is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life in the age of the city.
Their services advises people around the theme 'get older'.
Therefore would take just older people often also inconveniences and limitations in buying, only to stay in their familiar environment, that is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
There many ways to make the House or the apartment barrier-free.
RIES recommends all dealing with the age-based remodeling of her house or her apartment, to inform themselves thoroughly and to entrust not the first craftsmen.
Today, there are specialists for the age-based conversion.
Even in the apartment, one could be others realize and enlighten if there is only the raised toilet seat, the Interior Designer.
But not always, the existing housing can be age and therefore barrier-free remodeling, even if she is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
While you could install a stair lift inside the home, the way paved with stairs would be the far greater obstacle to the apartment door but.
She will keep searching until she found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, it shades her more than before the spider on her apartment door.
