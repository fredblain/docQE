Parents of intersex children can "Indeterminate gender" select
Germany is the first European nation to a third gender for children is recognized, that were born with ambiguous genitalia.
Newborn is allocated not more rigid male or female.
Under the new law, more for such children must explain no gender parents, but can indicate "indeterminate" or "not set" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the Act is to take the pressure of parents, so that they need make no hasty decisions on operations for a sex assignment in newborns, and to combat the discrimination of intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person said years later: "I am neither male nor female."
I stick the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one comes from 2,000 children every year as a boy or a girl to the world.
They belong to the intersex, a group that fall under the diagnosis of "Sex differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson was possibly intersexed.
Understanding the gender identification is always not very well developed, but most experts in the United States to guess one should gender assignment using the best available information, if a determination is not possible and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before you decide if any - for an operation.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said the new German law "sound like a good thing".
Intersex children do pose an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but that does not apply to most children," he said.
You could make a sex assignment without surgery and then wait as the identity can develop.
The scientific data about how a child ever developed its gender identity, are not very accurate.
No one knows why it is happening.
It's like the secret, which is why people are gay.
In a report to the European Commission in 2011, it is called intersex people are indistinguishable from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gendered, but due to their biological Constitution, which neither exclusively male nor female, but typically at the same time or not clearly one of defined as both.
These properties were in subordinated sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also gives an overview about the discrimination that intersex and transgender persons in the working life faced as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Not the sex image matching boys now have a special camp.
Now it is possible, on official documents, male, female in Australia and Nepal for adults or to specify "third gender".
In June, Australian Norrie may-Welby was recognized (52) as the world's first "genderless" person after a court had granted lifetime maintaining of a "not set" gender status.
German ID cards have a third assignment, X for intersexed, M and W in the future so the Ministry of the Interior.
In the neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, so a news story on France 24.
2011, dozens of French lawmakers of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from school textbooks.
The American Web site Catholic Online has also the German law opposed, stating: "If dragged the world into a new State, where the gender a decision not representing sexual activity but then we turn the two other pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn baby from Maryland told zone baby, it would be better if a gender will assigned to babies at birth.
"The existence of the parents is already stressful enough, without additional restrictions especially if you don't know the gender of the own child", she told the parents website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically were children who both were born with male and female genitals, referred to as hermaphrodites, attractive Greek God, who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, the medicine looked at sex as something that you could wipe out and then rebuild.
But now, the ethical foundations of an operation be doubted, after is now known, how complex is the gender identity, and that doctors can be wrong too, because they don't know how to feel the child is growing up with the gender assigned to them.
"Mid-20th century it was called the a, psychiatric emergency '", Drescher said.
If such a child was born, then called not the psychiatrists but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia is Dr. John money of Johns Hopkins University back to the view represented the gender is malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued, social and environmental initiatives - how parents raise a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped as if a person consider themselves as male or female.
But in one under the title of "John/Joan"-known case in 1966, his theories were controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was been separated during a botched circumcision not to castrate the child remove also his testicles and then to raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, which he was not", so Drescher.
When the boy about was 15, he moved back to the male gender and married a woman.
With 38, but he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would use this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender operations to the public have appeared that are "not happy with the result".
Such as when Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and believed he could do a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and the testicles were 1976 surgically removed shortly after birth and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
"I knew that I'm not a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should get a Vaginoplasty.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilised at birth - and no one has ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD, making his body could produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals.
After he had learned the truth, he moved again to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had to remove his breasts.
The operation is becoming barren.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called the interface project for intersex people as normal to be perceived.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Executive Director of the California-based legal group advocates for informed choice, worries that the German law "could encourage the stamp and Stigmatisieren".
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents, quick to make decisions and the child, not set ' assign ', she explained.
We fear that promotes interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female gender, and then wait.
But still we do not know how to affect the law, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said, her organization supported the Australian law, because "it allows adults the recognition as a third gender".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender", she explained.
The German law involves the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight which should coerce young children at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide themselves about their body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with sexual differentiation disorders and supported hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "authorize" parents as well as children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because of the target cells for testosterone receptor defect, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie is 29 and married; She works as a researcher in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Though she is barren, but hopes to be able to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents room, which they need to make decisions not rushed", Baratz said.
It gives them time to make different tests and to clarify things and gives them such time before they write 'male' or 'female'.
In this way everything is alright - it pulls the child big and loves it.
It has a wonderful baby and enjoys the parents luck.
And you must not hastily make an operation that can do not more undo.
"That includes the children in the decision and eliminated they would do not right the fear that drives parents, because they are of the opinion," said they.
Ultimately the child decides the gender, which are better suited to him - and that's wonderful.
Children be enables in the situation, to make the decision himself.
