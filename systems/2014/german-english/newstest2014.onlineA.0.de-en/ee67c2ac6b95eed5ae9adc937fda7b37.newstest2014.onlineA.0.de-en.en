Even though the SG Achim/Baden is since four days of game without victory, continued good atmosphere for handball Oberliga side.
Because, coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt at all.
All are fully motivated for the thing.
Nevertheless, I hope that we are finally again win.
"Because I yes no longer tasted such a victory," Malmon is a sense of achievement from his team in the VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-League reserve from Fredenbeck has pulled out still no trees, Malmon warning raises the index finger in advance.
I have trained many players themselves still in the youth.
Therefore, they will be sure especially motivated against their ex-coach.
"Also it is to be seen whether still gain from the first one is" shows the SG coach.
To return again on the road to success, Malmon-team compared to the past performances certainly must increase.
First and foremost cover working and playing the switching problems plagued last but enormously.
Also the chances must be definitely better.
Therefore, I hope that my players finally have managed to free the head during the break.
