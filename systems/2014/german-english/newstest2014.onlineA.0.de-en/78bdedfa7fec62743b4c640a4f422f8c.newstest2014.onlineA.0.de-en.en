Vienna Airport abolishes passenger calls
Mr Max Maier, please come to gate 24.
Announcements will no longer be in the future it like this at the airport Wien-Schwechat.
So dropped most of the announcements - the noise level to be reduced significantly.
The goal of this innovation is to create a more relaxed atmosphere.
Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced over radio Vienna, the airport follows Vienna with the setting of announcements relating to individual persons, an international trend.
So, already among the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt and Dubai waive the noisy calls.
By eliminating these announcements - on average, around 200 personal calls by the speaker sound on a day - to think to the future quieter at the airport.
"It has shown also in the experience that these individual announcements were seen relatively little, but also all other information about changed gates or departure times go down a bit here", so KLEEMANN in the interview with the radio station.
