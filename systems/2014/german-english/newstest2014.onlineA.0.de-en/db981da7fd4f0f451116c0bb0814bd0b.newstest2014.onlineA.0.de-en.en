Löffingen: Nidhi g Kapoor still single candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baar town of Löffingen can be described as attractive city with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a pioneering school, children, youth and senior policy, as well as own municipal utilities, yet no second mayoral candidate has stepped forward.
The old banker and Economist Dieter Köpfler of Löffingen is so far as the sole candidate to succeed the age no longer candidate Mayor Norbert Brugger.
The deadline expires on Monday, November 11, at 6: 00.
