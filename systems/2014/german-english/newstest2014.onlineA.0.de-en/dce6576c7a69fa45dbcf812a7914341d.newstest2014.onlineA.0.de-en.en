Perry said she had dinner with the old rocker to evening, and that "he has hit on me, when I was 18".
She added: "that was long ago and it was very nice to me."
A representative of Jaggers, 70, on Thursday, said in a statement that he "categorically denied that he had ever taken advances at Katy Perry".
The representative added: "Maybe it has confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers, which this year had a guest appearance in the rolling stones tour.
