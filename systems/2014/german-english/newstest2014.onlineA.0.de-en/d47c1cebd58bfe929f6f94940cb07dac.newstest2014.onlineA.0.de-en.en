Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on US monitoring
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. secret service, said he was ready to travel to Berlin and to testify before the German Bundestag, if the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander give no answers about their activities.
On Thursday, the German Deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia, where it has received asylum, to discuss the statement in Germany with him.
In a letter from Snowden, who was presented on Friday by Ströbele media in Berlin, he writes: "even if the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my Government still treated a dissenting opinion as a betrayal and attempts to criminalize political speech with subpoena in which no defense is possible."
To tell the truth, but is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes, he was convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American Government to drop the charges against him.
The charges levied by the US Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of Government property.
The German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told time online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk with German representatives then we find ways to make this possible."
Relations between the United States and Germany have been strained by the claims, the NSA heard the phone by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the Parliamentary Committee responsible for the secret service, said that one should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if possible, "without compromising him and to ruin relations with the United States".
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied during his visit to Russia by two German journalists.
Ströbele said that according to the law of the former NSA employee Snowden not could return to Russia, when he was leaving the country.
When Snowden in Germany say he needed an assurance that he was "safe", so the honourable Member.
Snowden explains in his letter that he is exposed would be a "serious and continuous" campaign of persecution, have expelled him from his homeland.
He was however affected by the worldwide reaction to "my Act of political expression".
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians - even in the United States - have revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a merit at the public referred to.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation the German authorities, "If the difficulties related to the humanitarian situation have been resolved".
