Rangnick scolding for refs: mane no Schwalbenkönig
So happy Ralf Rangnick red with the current top form by Bundesliga front-runners Bull is Salzburg, as the Sports Director of the "bulls" of the referees was disappointed.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency that mane and Alan are squeezed into the category of swallow Kings", he took the two Offensivwirbler on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg in protection.
Recent Rangnick criticism was yellow for Mane in a 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which an alleged acting doomed the Senegalese - which of course was not, as the TV pictures showed.
"A blatant mistake", said Rangnick, who described referee Haidery as "completely overwhelmed".
Haidery would also have "its part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the game contributed.
He defended his German compatriot decidedly: "Because I would have behaved right in every single situation like Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself will have no contact after the skirmish with Halladay with his colleagues.
I don't why.
"Because I'm the one who was offended," the age said.
Given the run of success, Rangnick, but agreed a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words: really good", he noted.
There is not much to criticize.
Especially the way in which the team plays, is impressive.
This should go on quietly.
In the winter transfer period, there would hardly be squad changes.
There is no great reason to change something.
"Unless someone comes up with the desire, that he wants to leave the Club", clarified Rangnick.
