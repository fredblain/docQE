<seg id="1"> What should do it Czech? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "confectionery." </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new Councillors for the capital from the ranks of the čssd regional be must overcome obviously some language barriers, to understand their old and new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the City Council at all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The newspaper news. cz has members of the new Council from the čssd regional a bit "kept," as they mastered the notorious slang, which has naturalized in recent years, were where the present coalition partner in Prague at the helm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The encoded vocabulary introduced in the last era of Mayor Pavel Bem by the Prague political elite is borrowed from some of the most famous actors, situations and causae. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Surprisingly showed that the new councils with regard to these new terms in the dark fall. </seg>
<seg id="6"> They claim that at least. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Who is Voldemort?" </seg>
<seg id="8"> "No idea." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am a newbie in the Prague policy rather," Lukáš Kaucký, the new Councillor for culture responded to the test of "godparents"vocabulary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But also the councilman of Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example on the term "Golf hole." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "This is the only expression of which you present me here, I use every now and then." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Otherwise I think not a lot of slang." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> From the vocabulary, the the Tageblatt news. cz in this year's June election Congress of ODS had published before, picked the editors six terms out, above all those that are well connected to the Prague City Hall. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Social Democrats should the terms "Voldemort," "largest Prague Golf hole," "go in the confectionery," define "Stiernacken," "Betrayal of the capital" and "the plates." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Three Prague Councillors agreed to the test, which is fourth - promised Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school - first his joining the conversation, was then but not even the phone down. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The fifth Councillor, Petr Dolínek, from the outset refused the test. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "These things are I don't care and as conversing with each other, the civic Democrats, furthermore I do not judge." </seg>
<seg id="19"> He answered "For me is important, as we understand us under our programmes." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký would have not recognized allegedly in the above headline, that of the influential entrepreneur and friend of ex-Mayor of Bem, Roman Janoušek is the speech. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The term "Wiki" says Kaucký in nothing and the only term that he guessed correctly in the test, was "the largest Prague Golf hole." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, added to the security but still: "But I know more from the newspaper." </seg>
<seg id="23"> And jokingly: "I will have to show probably a language course." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The "Golf hole" is deciphers not only of Matador Karel Březina, but also by the merchant on the environment Lukáš Plachý correctly as tunnel Blanka. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Both Social Democrats but also know for whom the term wiki is and Lukáš Plachý can even guess where this figure is and also, what is it, "to go" in the confectionery. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "I think that is going to any Prague Restaurant operating" Plachý is pretty close off to the puzzle solution, if you know that it is companies to the seat of Janoušeks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> In accordance with Březina he asserted but, more likely to have to drawn on this knowledge, that this vocabulary is peculiar for him from the newspaper. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> To judge the test participants to, there seems to be no similar to General slang actually under the Social Democrats. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I have asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing with us really." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "We call us by name, every now and then we use also abbreviation or nickname," says the Chairman of the Prague Czech Petr Hulínský - casually called "Hulda" of his party comrades. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "At school I was named Bříza (birch), but I do not know whether my colleagues call me so," Karel Březina tells us his nickname. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The newspaper Deník news. cz has the name tried and behold - it works. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Councilman Weinert is the "Grandpa" for the party comrades friendly or less friendly of the "old," the representative Miroslav Poche, who warned before the elections by activities at the party sponsoring to is called "Igráček" (famous Czech LEGO figure) of some colleagues. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Nicknames are thus the only allow the Social Democrats in the party. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Hulínský it supposedly don't like when one calls him "Hulda," but Deník news. cz registered yet a different nickname of Prague Chairman. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="7"> He said half out of tune and half to "But what - have signed I." </seg>

<seg id="9"> But the man waves only. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "A says this, the other the," he makes a sinister face. </seg>

<seg id="19"> Half a second later it is your turn. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Later, an older couple enters the waiting room, to ask for the price, but the rush in the waiting room is apparently not the new rent. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Most people are here repair requests, insurance issues and the like, to solve the common problems-. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> As of mid-November, the envelopes with the new lease flutter most tenants of a total of 44,000 dwellings of portfolios of the RPG in the mailboxes in the region of Ostrava. </seg>

<seg id="25"> "The action is running something over a week, that is to say, this is just the beginning," the ladies behind the counter reply hesitation after a moment, as it turns out to be the "client" as a journalist. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The deregulation and Bakalas former mining houses are an explosive issue. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Taken before the elections the from Ostrava, Vice-President of the parliamentary Lubomír Zaorálek of the čssd regional had this topic up quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> "Twenty years I want a new floor of them." </seg>
<seg id="29"> "Non times ne besch." "They could substitute for WC-Brille," is the earlier mentioned man air. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> So far, especially pensioners on the switch are on the employees according to to ensure whether they receive really the promised guests moderation, which promises them RPG if they sign the special offer in a timely manner. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Enjoy a half reduced February rental also the other tenants are, that sign the new lease agreement until 15 December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> So far, "deregulation" switch in Havířov is anything but, under pressure of demands. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> "Yesterday's 360 clients only approximately 40 to 50 were rent in 2011 because here," the switch workers estimate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> RPG offers individual rental agreements, where it is necessary both to their Web pages, and wall panels. </seg>
<seg id="35"> If the Mietparteien but not on the new hire to agree, it will be set by an independent court. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="36"> "That is to be no threat, but is to be understood as information on the only possible and perfectly legitimate legal approach," explains RPG's Web pages. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="37"> "Here no one goes to court," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client Centre gives her at least partially right. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="42"> The regulated rent ends the majority in the Czech Republic on new year's day 2011 and RPG Byty according to the assign is an economic necessity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> "The existing amount of the rent sufficient not even to the maintenance of the Housing Fund," argues Pavel KLIMEŠ, the Director of the housing portfolio of company RPG Byty and - just the neglect criticized by the angry tenants of Housing Fund is the main reason for the assign according to the homeowner. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> While RPG could invest four billion in the apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the collected rents, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it will be 5.2 billion. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="46"> "The rent increases in the years 2011 to 15%, and less concern 31 200 apartments, that is more than 90% of RPG." </seg>
<seg id="47"> "Always, this means more than 7.50 CZK per square meter per month," is to read on the LCD monitor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> Only on 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG is increased the rent by 38 percent. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "In these cases, it comes to increasing extremely low rates of 19,66 CZK per square meter," argues RPG. </seg>
<seg id="50"> 2600 Apartments, the rent remains in the next year at the same height. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> RPG Byty promises that the deregulation drives rents not leaps and bounds in the height, but gradually takes place within four to eight years. </seg>
<seg id="52"> What's more - the company imposed on itself a further obligation: the company wants to put again all revenue from the assign (see diagram) in the apartments, especially in heat savings - new window and thermal insulation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> But - primarily it will benefit those people who sign the agreements on the assign. </seg>

<seg id="1"> A charnel house fascinated even after 100 years. Take a look at the Interior of Gaudi </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The roof appears to like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs as the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are open Fischmäuler. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This is the Casa Batlló of by Catalan Architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="4"> By the local inhabitants, the House with its organic forms was nicknamed "Bone." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile pieces and mosaic, the facades reminiscent of scales and ubiquitous soft lines, all of these are typical features of the art nouveau style by Antonio Gaudí. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The façade of the House plays with beautiful lines, delicate colors and textures that remind of nature and living beings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Only on closer inspection we noticed that everything from geometry, rhythm and sophisticated order dominated. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In the night, the whole facade of still plastic, dramatic works and the special ilumination reinforced the splendour of colours. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The same energetic lines and meandering forms dominate the Interior of the House. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wave shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, and even loopholes and bars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The House Batlló in the district Eixample to lively shopping street Passeig formed by the conversion of a house built in 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese said de Gracia No. 43. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reconstruction took two years to complete and was completed in 1906. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed to the idea of Gaudí on an unusual and even cheaper tag. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The tenement house Casa Batlló designed not only to Antoni Gaudí. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This, he has collaborated with the architect Josep Maria Jujol. </seg>
<seg id="16"> On the drawing board developed the decorations for the prestigious apartment of the owner of the reality and the use of mosaics on the façade was his idea. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> On the facade, but also many other designers and artists worked with. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudi. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So, Jujol participated also in the construction of Gaudí's House Casa Mila in the Park Güell, in which there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Shortly after its completion was the home of the local inhabitants of his organic forms due to the nickname "Bone." </seg>
<seg id="21"> Others called it the special window mechanism due to the "yawning House." </seg>
<seg id="22"> It is also said at the top on the building the sword of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia is shown. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But also other sculptural elements symbolize hidden religious motives. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Gaudí designed a unique for that time central heating system with vents and typical chimneys for the House. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Somewhat bizarrely, their 45 degrees appears to already. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> In his work, ignored Gaudi consistently all the building and was not swayed by them. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Pre-construction he caught up while the corresponding construction permit from the city, but the details of the planned reconstruction made by him were so vague that the city fathers two years later so shocked by the result were at the completion, that they demanded redress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The Councillors came also from that of construction with its pillars intervened even in the public sidewalk. </seg>
<seg id="29"> To changes it no longer was on the contrary - just fifteen days after the relevant call of the neighborhood Josep Batlló made an application for approval of letting the two highest floors of the House - and it was promptly granted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The owner of the House was a in the lower floors. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The Gallery on the 2nd floor was a room of the society, there were the bedrooms and rooms of the apartment on the third floor. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The ground floor was rented to a jewelry shop. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The entire six-storey building through a staircase up to the roof terrace. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> By the fundamental elements of the conversion, were all right angles and straight lines removed, and replaced by bent and curved walls. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Gaudi worked also with a modern approach to the interconnection of spaces. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The social part can join totally by the opening of the Salon doors and so a larger company could chat easily, without having to give up to a certain intimacy in vertraulicheren talks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The House received tag except a new facade by Gaudí's also a quite unusual roof and two more floors. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Impressively Gaudí also is playing with the light and the blue and white glazed tiles, with which the courtyard is covered and the borderlands. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The game of these two colors brings a high light all floors of the House. </seg>
<seg id="40"> This, he made the principle advantage that white better reflects light as dark colors which absorb the sunlight on the contrary is simply. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> Anyone can visit the House of Casa Batlló, recorded in the UNESCO's World Heritage list in 2005, today. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The most spacious and most beautiful apartment of the public is made on the first floor. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The homeowners decided only in the years to this step and this on the occasion of 150.Geburtstags of the famous creator. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The right mattress and the right bed grate? Women have different needs than men </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> So mattress and rust make up not the nicest bed frame, but the quality of the bed - good bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> They must however harmoniously complement is to meet the needs of specific user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Many things play a role - the weight, the size, health, and not least, the sex of guile in the selection. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Also the Interior in the mattress and rust subordinate have to is just as important. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a weekend House, in which not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not suitable because they longer need much "to be warm." </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition, they are much heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And - they should be changed regularly. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If they have indeed not enough ventilation tubules in the core and still to lie on a fixed disk, moisture which impounds to: it is therefore not excluded that formed under their mold. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> When choosing plays also a role in what you are used. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Who was quite a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with soft layer are common, is can adapt hard to a low mattress with hard surfaces. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "Probably all ice hockey players who returned from the NHL, have complained to me, that they can sleep here properly." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "For their abgeschundenen shoulders, heels, and hips they need a soft layer of Visco foam (memory foam - a shape memory polymer) simply." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I recommend it including diabetic people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the"information"from the skin and the joints badly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, focusing on upholstered furniture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> That is why I have many ice hockey players, years ago this mattress with Visco foam (memory foam) concerned but also other customers. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer among other things the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer of Tropico." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And one must not necessarily be a famous hockey player to learn the benefits of Visco foam. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" works actually quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, he clings downright warm body. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Nowhere it expresses, in the night to roll around to not like after a heavy battle. </seg>
<seg id="22"> You sleep much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The viscoelastic foam provides also protection from pressure ulcers (gangrene). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> When choosing the size of the mattress you should still have the length of the soles of the feet add to the body, about 21 to 34 cm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Man as woman, are 180 cm in length on the need to a 210 to 220 cm long bed. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Each sleeper at least 90 cm bed width available should be together so 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In singles, such as singles, are 120-140 cm. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Of comfort, and also for any visitor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise, the following rule of thumb is the ideal bed width: "If you lying on her back, still enough space for the slightly bent arms should be," advises ing. Helena Prokopova, the Zunftmeisterin of the upholsterer and interior decorator, which is for years devoted to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and submits this issue also at schools. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> With a double bed everyone needs an own rust and his own mattress, but beware when shopping, so that the mattresses are also high. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise, nothing else is necessary to mount as the grates in different height and possible long at each bed frame. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Foam mattresses should be Mattresses Spring House at least 14 cm in height 15 cm, of which at least three inches should is on the shape layer and the fine upholstery. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "With the hand or while sitting down you may feel the springs in no way," Helena Prokopova warns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Each mattress requires a special type of rust. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Full-cushioned beds with mattresses and document such as integrated Siamese twins have no place in the bedroom. </seg>
<seg id="36"> These mattresses can be not to air and it can not wash the reference, which is today Yes already commonplace. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And because you lose in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat, it is clear that the mattress (and clogged strainer) is slow after five to seven years to a huge. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Also, experts reject advertising slogans or even lifetime warranty promising a lifespan of up to 25 years, with mattresses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Every thing has its IFS and buts. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And therefore a practical advice from the merchants: in mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width should you not afraid of the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, however, it is advisable to use a mattress covers, you easily remove the and wash can. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even though today usually mattress covers round to zip are made, so that you to open get (extremely important for the washing process and the size of the washing machine!) half the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially alone run appears to often as the unequal fight between David and Goliath. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> They have a solid record in bed instead of a rust? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Out this! </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or for a maximum of a bed for unwanted guests and for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> So, you should the plate rather with ventilation holes provide (if already not in it are) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket springs and fine upholstery use. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethane mattresses are not on such a surface. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> LaTeX or sandwich mattresses are suitable for not adjustable slatted frames with 14 to 18 spring strips (lamella) (also combinations of latex and coconut), always grates with a larger number of staff, i.e. 28 and more spring bars pay off here, with lumbar support in the lumbar region and the possibility, to adjust the hardness of pale. </seg>
<seg id="48"> On adjustable slat panels, no Mattresses Spring House are because they respond not to the ergonomic adjustment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Special flexible shoulder modules are provided next to the setting of the stiffness of the spring bars. </seg>
<seg id="50"> This is a special fixing of the spring bars, which makes it possible to lower the spring bars or even to reverse angles to enable selective sinking of the shoulder of's Guile. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Especially for men with wide shoulders an important thing. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There are even mattress manufacturers have started to use "Men mattresses" soft zones for the shoulders. </seg>
<seg id="53"> On the women's is - you take them this soft zones in the hips. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For most demanding clients, point-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or grids with point elastic contact pads are designed with so-called multimedia torsion spring suspension. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure is distributed on several points, reducing the tension. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But - if you used a bad pillow (too big and fülliges) to the right mattress and correct rust, the most benefits are lost again. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Again a rule of thumb: the pillow to support the head, his tips should submit only up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Therefore a 50 x 60 cm pillow is ideal, as for example the Scandinavians like it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> On its side, the pillow (along with the shoulder relief zone in the grill or the soft area in the mattress) should make up for the shoulder height. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Have something our modern mattresses have but in common with the former mattresses (filled with hay). </seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern manufacturers use more and more natural materials or at least their impurity. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Also in mattresses, the new magic word of "Organic" means. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of oil raw materials using more and more natural oils - such as Castor and soya-bean oil for the production of polyurethane foams. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soy is probably used by all well-known manufacturers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> Petr Vašíček explains "Bio is mattresses, their core consisting of purely natural origin materials," by the company Tropico plus. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Natural materials are used but also in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was about Aloe Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> You can also micro-capsules treat, spread the forest fresh at the sleeping or lavender scent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Again, it makes a difference between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While the men a "cooling" herbal extract of birch leaves is used so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, have the references for effect "wärmende women." </seg>
<seg id="70"> Extracts from red peppers stimulate the blood circulation that is so toasty warm sleep the weaker sex. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> And the today's Favorites? </seg>
<seg id="72"> Mattress made of cold foam (he has larger pores with damaged cell structure and is therefore breathable than standard polyurethane and also much more flexible). </seg>
<seg id="73"> More zones mattresses, who know exactly where the head, hips and heels are caused by the combination of different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and Visco foam. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> For a high-quality mattress, you have to shell out 7000 kroons, and more. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Health mattresses are with lower VAT, but usually because they are considered medical. </seg>
<seg id="76"> As the first Czech company, this advantage had Gumotex. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> You can see on the mattress and to save the rust is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Every now and then there are special offers from manufacturers and retailers who offer two mattresses for the price of one. </seg>
<seg id="79"> So, the brand of Magniflex offers the Duofreeze mattress with Visco foam verstepptem regarding memory for 11.990 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Free, you get to the second. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the material of Tempur, which initiated the era of the viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace. </seg>
<seg id="82"> No wonder they have been developed for NASA, for the astronauts are exposed to enormous overload at the start. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83"> Tempur is soft at heat, in cool environment it solidifies again. </seg>
<seg id="84"> So it fit perfectly on the human body and distributed the body pressure in an optimum way. </seg>
<seg id="85"> It is therefore not only ideal for the prevention of pressure fire, but generally increases the comfort as you sleep. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86"> Viscoelastic foams are not only mattresses, but also other health products, as used e.g. in special Fußpolstern, that should give relief the legs and the vessels. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Local manufacturers use for example the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products. </seg>

<seg id="1"> More and more parents want people tracking devices to keep the kids under control </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The fear of their children is growing and so more and more parents consider GPS to monitor them. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The system was originally invented for cars with Interpol can namely as well people locate, what would be helpful in such cases, as recently at the no disappearance of nine-year Anička Janatková. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The device is currently about as large as a cigarette packet, but soon it should be no larger than a wrist watch. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The case of the missing Anička has put many people in fear and terror, and so they look better to protect, their children for ways and means. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Also for the price of a compromising of their privacy. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "We seek us all to say that it comes here not to Herumspionieren, but an effective way to reduce the chance that it comes to the tragedy," Petr spearheading Pilín society macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> "I give up, that it may be in individual cases the abuse of such devices, for example, if you put it someone in the Pocket, without that he knows of, but we had there been no such case." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "Most customers buy it really reasons," adds Pilín. </seg>
<seg id="10"> He believed the child should know but always the "box" serves what purpose and how to use them in an emergency. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The more Dana Bočková pointed out however that a child, if it may not bear such a thing, it is his simply discards. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "Very small children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately lose certain things if they want to not be controlled." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Already the phones initially aroused great expectations with the parents, but they can just as easily disable, as this new monitoring devices," says Mrs Bočková. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="14"> Their opinion is also disputed whether such a body in the case of an attack actually helps. </seg>

<seg id="18"> "In these cases the criminals are always one step ahead of police," says the psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="19"> You however admits that similar devices in a sudden attack by a pedophile can be quite helpful. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Roberta Čech by the company RC monitoring according to the location services for automobiles, as well as for persons offering, can help the existence of such a device even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> "It can be so adjusted that it reports the position at certain intervals." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "Even if it immediately would be destroyed, is at least the last position of the affected person available." </seg>
<seg id="23"> "On more expensive devices even a Clinometer is integrated, that is, if it falls and breaks in motionless, it immediately sends a warning stating the position," said Mr Čech. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In his view similar services could do also intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you need to record only a special software. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The problem of the current locators is that this either involves devices in matchbox size, which are similar to followers or to smaller mobile phones. </seg>
<seg id="26"> There is always the risk, that you lose it. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Mr Pilín macro Weil according to testing in the presence devices that look like normal Digital clocks. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The army has so many fuses, that you could wrap you Czech Republic keep but only two years </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Czech Army has 445 km purchased fuses, with explosives are detonated. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the previous year, the Ministry of defence had provided already 224 km fuse at the army camp. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It's been reassuring to know that the armed forces for 225 years have ausgesorgt. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The problem is only the durability of the fuses - two but no more than four years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The army bought the fuses of the joint-stock company STV group, a. s. for paltry 40 million Czech Crowns. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In his explanatory statement for the purchase of this huge quantity of detonating cord, the General staff replied MF DNES, the soldiers would spend each year to the 60 kilometres of detonating cord. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The research of army pyrotechnikern according to the MF DNES to addressed, is clear from this claim that the army every year would have to - training extremely intensive pyrotechnic of all generals and officers of the army command, to the Secretaries and cleaners. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Just as considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres could be reasonably justify ignition cords. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This length is by the way 25,000 detonations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> But so would submit this army stocks for more than ten years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> If still the old rule of experts applies that to the training of each new career soldiers two meters fuse completely sufficient, then through this new shopping - also in the light of the increased needs of engineering and special forces - has created a soothing stock for the already mentioned 225 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> In soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade complained recently in the Defense Minister Vondra, they had almost no cartridges for small arms more, so that the missing target practice are severely limited resources due to. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Not to mention the lack of underwear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "Me not enters also, why they buy such fuses tons of us." </seg>
<seg id="17"> "But that is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need to." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "For us, the army is a good customer, we want to largely satisfy the merchants," says the Manager of the STV group Jan Děcký. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Jan Pejšek, the spokesman for the Defense Ministry justified the purchase of hundreds km of detonating cord, the army had covered so at least for ten years with this "ammunition." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Jan Děcký of the STV group speaks only of a four-year service life of the fuses and police and army Pyrotechniker only by two years. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "When perfect are possible also the four mentioned years," gives a one of them, which wants to remain but uncredited, as a soldier not the criticism of the army accused to be. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the service life of any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and threatens not the life of the soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="23"> These tests are but not free, but cost more money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Another argument of the Defense Ministry is the quantity discount for the fuse 445 km. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "They cost us sixty-five percent of less than last year's supply of 244 kilometres," spokesman Pejšek shares with us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of defence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Just for comparison: the annual consumption of ignition cords of Pyrotechnikern of the police, that liquidate ammunition from the second world war or the Soviet army of brothers, exceeds several years barely 1,500 metres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> And the police only such quantities of this ammunition which can consume before the end of service life. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Already security were the support act for, also keeping the to open the possibility for flexible purchases of more advanced and therefore more reliable fuses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The Ministry of defence has tens of thousands tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty already huge problems on the liquidation, as the two hundred times Czechoslovak people's army was preparing on their campaign to the Rhine. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The Pyrotechnikern, which addressed MF DNES, expected in a few years the same problem with the liquidation of hundreds km old fuses, which today as "cheap" has bought the Czech armed forces. </seg>

<seg id="4"> The story of his success appears to like a film scenario. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Lukáš Pytloun traveled to. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Only from abroad was aware that it is missing in Liberec on good accommodation at reasonable prices. </seg>
<seg id="7"> From the savings of his Ferienarbeiten from abroad and by using a bank loan, he purchased a dilapidated House with five apartments. </seg>

<seg id="1"> I wish my successors a quieter year, when we had it in Farmet </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst behind it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The price for the first rank of competition Vodafone company of the year in the past year took Karel Žďárský, to the owner of Farmet. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The jury paid tribute to the efforts that he stomped a company from the ground from the small tool making in Česká Skalice that makes hundreds of millions of sales at that time. </seg>
<seg id="6"> "I can say that this assessment encourages not only myself, but also all of my employees and has strengthened our confidence in the fight with the competition," says the winner of the previous year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At the beginning of the history of Farmet was the effort to do something useful. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And then the State Žďárský offered a small workshop to the lease his father Karel as compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists, he hesitated for a long, his career in the company where he worked until then, whiz, and founded his own company for the production of plastic tubs with a few comrades of his father. </seg>
<seg id="9"> A short time later they started to focus on vegetable oil presses. </seg>
<seg id="10"> They are within 18 years to become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in all of Central Europe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But only by the success in the mentioned competition and the medialization she occurred also in the awareness of the non-professional public. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "Not only that customers perceive the brand Farmet now much more intensively, began our foreign partners the fact to be able to work in their country with a company's greatest success has won, paying greater attention to the," says Karel Žďárský. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The past year was not only characterised by the euphoria of victory at Farmet. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The assessment came from the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> He added the army will have to get without two-seat fighter aircraft, as the Ministry of Defence signed a 200-million contract for the conversion of four waste L-159 to the two-seated version in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody. </seg>

<seg id="8"> To know that we must not go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But if you would like to know more about ice passes not at the Italian company cream "Gelato University." </seg>
<seg id="10"> The ice cream University established the manufacturer of ice cream makers in 2003 for the ice cream from his machines to anywhere the high Italian ideals meet. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world. </seg>
<seg id="12"> There are also several-day special courses around the chocolate ice cream and internships in the hotel's own ice cream parlor. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Some dreams in the midlife crisis of a new career, others just venture on the smooth ice of their vague aspirations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil on Hungary to Saudi Arabia. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and will in future offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial ice-cream. </seg>

<seg id="18"> A man from Malta and one from Brazil to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes, because their children love Italian ice cream. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari the participants explain the ideal properties of perfect ice cream. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Not only good taste, but also the silky smoothness and good consistency is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Luciano forgets his training but also not the icing of the national and at all Mediterranean superstructure: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then many romance is in the process." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first step to establishing seems easy. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Luciano flips the ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large food that heated to 85 degrees, all with an electronic program and cools down immediately to four degrees. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Then it rotates on a cock on the machine and out comes a pasteurised white base cream, basis for all kinds of Milcheis. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Immediately to overwhelm the lecturer with questions: you can make ice cream with natural substances without stabiliser? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How can you let loose the own experimentation? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Luciano warns to guide the spirit of the times misleading. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If you talk about ice cream "only from natural ingredients," stabilizers used probably still - usually a natural product, such as guar gum from the guar. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, only it must be sold within one day, otherwise it sags together in, and the customer bites on sheer ice grains. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Some variations on the basic dimensions are allowed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It is more exciting with the flavors. </seg>
<seg id="32"> For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients to buy in the fruit Division or the sweets of the supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, are there powders and pastes. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "The supplier will try all you foist dozens flavored additives." </seg>
<seg id="35"> "But you should just experiment." </seg>
<seg id="36"> Either in the fruit sherbets with fresh fruit and sugar. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Or just by the ice cream from the white footprint, which becomes the yellow cream with eggs and cocoa powder to the basis for all possible chocolate temptations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Now, may the students at the ice cream makers. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano can they produce four types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the basic dimensions, with more or less vanilla flavouring or other natural additives. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The types of Fruchteis are subject to the same experiment. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Taste that is not necessarily better more flavouring substances, more fruit puree. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Hazelnut ice cream tastes not necessarily nutty if it contains more hazelnuts. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The most popular Kiwi ice provides her the group that used more fruit, less water and less stabilizer. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Only a balance between properly highlight the taste of gelato, says Luciano. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Ice production is a math question: peach purée is used with much sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe should be reduced. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Lemon ice cream requires an extra dose of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano takes out a device with which it determines the sugar content of fruit varieties (winemakers to measure the Oechsle in the grape must). </seg>
<seg id="48"> Fortunately, tables facilitate the Rechnerei. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> To make ice requires not so much physical use as before. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Not only the device for the automatic production of the footprint helps. </seg>
<seg id="51"> There is also a device where the finished ice cream mixture is beaten at the same time creamy and cooled to minus temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Small glitches remain insufficient all automation despite. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The Brazilian Gustavo covered himself and his course mates from top to bottom with fruit puree, as it turns the oversized hand blender out of control. </seg>
<seg id="54"> "In each course," says Maestro Luciano, "is it happening only a matter of time before something." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The European food safety authority EFSA had been infiltrated by industry experimenting with genetic plant. </seg>

<seg id="6"> It is by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer paid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Kuiper have significantly contributed to the EFSA testing for genetic crops and is thus a clear conflict of interest, then criticized. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The EFSA rules are absatzweise identical with position papers of the Ilsi and so do the handwriting of the industry, which should actually be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It was the second time that Testbiotech bemängle an interest conflict of interest. </seg>
<seg id="10"> So, recently was a senior manager of EFSA without conditions or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural company Syngenta - and thus changed the pages. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also the Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) had revealed from recent personal connections between controlling EU authority and industrial lobby, what hellhörig did the EPA as well as MEPs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> However no conflict of interest can be seen by the EFSA. </seg>
<seg id="13"> You refer back to all serious data, also to those of the industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, it is said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="14"> From the experts who work for EFSA to not demand that they have no links with industry. </seg>
<seg id="15"> You would have to disclose but. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This refers to himself as a neutral forum for experts from academia, industry and policy - among others to the risk assessment of biotechnology without lobbying job. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In the matter, independent experts and then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently allowed without each feeding test in animals and the reaction will not tested by gene plants on environmental influences. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We want to know what makes for example genetically modified maize on the field," says then. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Current practice is there, only isolated proteins, but to test not the whole gene plant, which provides no reliable results. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "If it does not seek the risks, how should you find it then?," then asks accusingly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> This looks so also Angelika Hilbeck. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The scientist is doing research in genetic engineering since 1994 and is now at the University of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The industry try to influence always more, critical scholars in this field as in the United States now also in Europe, or to discredit. </seg>
<seg id="25"> It is therefore hardly researchers which are intertwined with corporations. </seg>

<seg id="20"> The track of the Stuttgart stones leads to a former depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone Kingdom in a forest near Tübingen. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The 44-year old is with old stones. </seg>
<seg id="22"> He bought all that incurred during the demolition in Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "It's a shame, they would to gravel ground or disappear in the landfill," he says in his Office, a wooden Büdchen, which once was a guardhouse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Insulted and threatened to have him, he tells, when in September in the newspapers was that he bought the remains of the North Wing of the demolition contractor. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But he has talked with the S-21 opponents, for days on end. </seg>
<seg id="26"> And he declared them he could do nothing for the demolition but now. </seg>
<seg id="27"> And if it happens once, then it is but the most sensible, if the stones were used. </seg>
<seg id="28"> About 200 S-21 opponents took then with one of the on average 80 kilos heavy box, unit price 6.50-14 euro. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Some as a souvenir, but also in the hope to be able to return him in a reconstruction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> 500 Tonnes had bought Rongen 25 large heavy goods vehicles. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Half the stores in the forest, the rest is long since sold. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Garden owners, landscape gardener, Builder of the House. </seg>
<seg id="33"> From anywhere, they came and would have dragged what could carry luggage and trailer. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The Stuttgart stones of contention have been transformed into "Mäuerle" or in bounds by Herb beds. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen. </seg>
<seg id="36"> "Would be not the political component." </seg>
</p>

<seg id="37"> He rises in his all-terrain vehicle, gives a tour through his 20-hectare Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Jura has studied and canceled later biology, then he has interest for computers and has finally become stone dealer. </seg>
<seg id="39"> And rock lovers. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="40"> He is 40000 tons of stones. </seg>
<seg id="41"> He carts his treasures together from all over Germany. </seg>
<seg id="42"> He says he is the largest ancient stone retailer in the Republic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> He slows down. </seg>
<seg id="44"> There are artistically graven sandstones in the snow. </seg>
<seg id="45"> "You were once among the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, he enthuses. </seg>
<seg id="47"> "My favorite stone." </seg>

<seg id="49"> He points to a bunch: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station. </seg>
<seg id="50"> And on. </seg>
<seg id="51"> "Beautiful travertine." </seg>
<seg id="52"> Once the blocks belonged to the Gallery of Stuttgart Neckar Stadium. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart police, red granite from the Cathedral of St. Blasien, Tuff of the Heilbronn-based hospital. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> What, what troubles, what sweat. </seg>
<seg id="55"> If Rongen remember how the stones previously by hand carved and moves with simple pulleys and ox-cart, he is quite awesome. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="57"> He has not become rich, steinreich even less. </seg>
<seg id="58"> But the stone dealer employs 14 people today, also stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower, and a horticulturalist have settled up in the forest. </seg>
<seg id="59"> "We are working hard, but it is satisfactory," says the remaining holders. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> There is a lively crowds at the buffet. </seg>
<seg id="3"> 16 Students crowd around Lachsbrötchen, tomato soup and sweets. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Technical University of Braunschweig and the carmaker Volkswagen have invited the engineering and design students to a workshop. </seg>
<seg id="5"> They should talk shop - and by the way, meet Volkswagen in a kind of ideas along with VW developers on the car of the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In the competition for the brightest minds go now many companies in the melee and set, such as VW, in cooperation with the universities. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Their mission: the most talented graduates as early as possible in the lecture halls to recruit before they come on the labour market and are courted by others. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And because the universities issue no statements about the performance of their students, to try to see the exceptional talents in practical projects and retain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> On the second day of the workshop at the Technical University Braunschweig advertises the based talents. </seg>
<seg id="10"> A young lady from the human resources Department distributed pens, Gummi Bears and sessions with VW logo. </seg>
<seg id="11"> You told the promising young talents of internship programs and student jobs, and reveals to them through into the group. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Nico Selle Technical University of Braunschweig serves the project with VW. </seg>
<seg id="13"> He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students get in touch with the industry and gain experience." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "VW can at the same time, students get to know interesting candidates closer look at and consider who would be as an employee in question." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Such cooperation, so Selle, are not uncommon. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It is new so aggressively will gebuhlt to the students. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Otherwise the focus "was more on the technical project," says Selle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The battle for the fresh graduate will probably even harder. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In many industries the company can choose no longer their employees from a great multitude of candidates. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But they need to be promoting and booming especially to highly skilled workers. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In particular graduates from the engineering disciplines are doing in an excellent negotiating position. </seg>
<seg id="22"> According to the Association of German engineers VDI, over 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And the so-called engineering gap will become even bigger according to VDI forecasts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Novel Dykta for talent hunting is for the accounting and consulting firm KPMG. </seg>
<seg id="25"> He organizes complex recruiting events such as the KPMG race, a kind of modern paper-chase, in which the participants on the basis of GPS coordinates must find their way. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The company will send eight promising students across in the next year by the United States. </seg>
<seg id="27"> By the way can the participants look at KPMG branches and get to know the company. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Who can with decides in two rounds in advance. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Only the crème de la crème of many candidates flies in the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The picks and sticking to the high potential at the universities, the guns according to Dykta are getting bigger. </seg>
<seg id="31"> "We want to withdraw us with the race from the crowd." </seg>
<seg id="32"> "Only a simple cruise was us too little." </seg>
<seg id="33"> For talent hunters Dykta seems the account open. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "We have contact to this day with all participants of a similar action last year." </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Some are close to completion and soon want to compete with us," he says. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Another way is the contact of the University professors. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg. </seg>
<seg id="46"> "The professors give hints, that you can make internships or write his thesis with us." </seg>
<seg id="47"> Expensive promotions are not in the solar specialist. </seg>
<seg id="48"> For the company trying to advertise with other advantages for themselves: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "A large corporation can not offer often," says HR Director bar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> Money plays the lead role in the job search no longer. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Flexible working hours, child care or good promotion opportunities are more crucial factors. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Solarworld finished a study of the great place to work Institute the 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The Institute creates an annual list of German employers. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Off the coast of the U.S. State of Florida in the, there will be no new drilling in the coming years. </seg>
<seg id="3"> A corresponding prohibition has adopted in the Government in Washington - and thus their earlier plans finally revoked. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Also off the coast, new holes are for the time being prohibited. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This was announced by Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The strict prohibition, which shall be at least for the next five years, was the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Before the accident that cost the lives of eleven workers and resulted in the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama to pressure the opposition and the industry had signaled his willingness, allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The proponents want to reduce the dependence of the United States of oil supplies from abroad. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf, is today not finally been clarified. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In the Centre of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is facing demands for billions. </seg>
<seg id="11"> A Commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama's to present their results in the course of December. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In October, Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the drilling ban imposed after the explosion. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Following several oil companies had immediately made requests for new drilling projects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> With tougher controls and stricter safety regulations, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Currently, the competent control authority, which was fallen into disrepute after numerous allegations of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At the same time, Obama has announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The industry now publicly warns that flow in the Gulf by a stricter regulation would significantly lower than in the past. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "The Government's plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of oil and gas industry," is the result of a current industry survey by the consulting firm BDO - before the drilling ban on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The American Energy Alliance also complained about the uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows what exactly will change with the regulation." </seg>
<seg id="20"> Investments in new projects would be delayed until further notice - at the expense of growth. </seg>

<seg id="3"> The population of theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Celestine Akpobari means well. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The ecological activist "not plague from you," calms the journalists: "You will still enough oil sludge from the lens get." </seg>
<seg id="6"> The 37-year old Nigerian has followed the attempt to scan a watenden up to the chest in the water boy with the Schlieren surrounding him: in the Woods Wasserglanz, the scene is almost cute. </seg>
<seg id="7"> That beneath the surface Brown crude oil steam float, is not to see. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Earlier, she have collected here buckets shrimp, tells Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Meanwhile, the slow flowing body of water is completely dead. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Five years ago, tons of crude oil in the huge wetland gushed down from a cracked pipe. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Fishermen from the near town of nearby Bodo must row now six hours to get into fish-rich waters: the Ogoniland, in the heart of the Niger Delta is one of the world's worst foul regions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The full extent of the devastation is apparent on the trip through the mangroves by rivers. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Instead of bright water, the motor boat perturbs Brown broth, who plunges his hand into the water, pull out to oily finger. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The roots of the Mangrovenbäumchen rise as black Lakritzstangen out of the ground, sad can occasionally seen Palm trees hang their fronds. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Flocks, as otherwise common in wetlands, looking in vain: when the outboard is silent, ghostly calm stretches out smelling like a gas station earlier paradise. </seg>
<seg id="16"> "What here is environmental warfare," says Celestine Akpobari gloomy: "We live in constant danger for the health." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The war comparison is appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The settlement of the Ogoni people, is a battleground fought for decades: here, the first Explorateure from Europe penetrated more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance organized itself in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell Group had to set its production 1993, because it was too dangerous for the oil workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The return is still does not allow the company to Ogoniland: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped from the entire Delta region by triple the size of the Switzerland with over 5000 sources of drilling and 7000 km pipelines, the oil fields in the Ogoniland are broke, the situation is too unstable to the group. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Every few hundred yards rise steel frames such as bizarre sculptures out of the water: "Christbäumchen" are much too tenderly called the heads of the drill holes. </seg>
<seg id="21"> You are up to 50 years old, which corrodes most to the core. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Again and again, such a drill head will break apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream rinne crude oil in the water. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> More than two billion liters are flowed according to expert estimates in 50 years in the ecosystem of the Delta: year after year the amount of oil in the shipwreck of super tanker "Exxon Valdez" prior to 21 years in the sea off Alaska entered - one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of mankind. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Who is to blame for the ongoing eco worst case scenario, is in dispute. </seg>
<seg id="25"> While the Shell Group blames sabotage and the organized theft of oil for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists West drilling heads and leaky pipelines see as major contributor. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Shell put on much lower security standards in Nigeria than otherwise in the world, the US scientists Richard Steiner accused 2008 the Group: alone the rate of defects on the lines is "many times higher than elsewhere." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> In a location that looks remotely like a failed, oil-smeared workshop in the open air, are figures showing up from the mangroves: you are stark naked and up to the neck oil verschmiert. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with tubes, partly randomly scattered on the site can be made out, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The barrel heated crude oil on the fire for several hours, said Michael, the head of the group. </seg>
<seg id="30"> First penetrates gasoline through the tubes in the collecting pot, later dribbles out kerosene and diesel finally at the end of the pipe. </seg>
<seg id="31"> So Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels diesel of à 300 litres: "The US 34,000 naira introduces" - about $22. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The inhabitants of the Delta use the chronic fuel shortages in the Sub-Saharan Africa's largest oil State. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Nigeria has only a single refinery. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The illegal cooker can still beat the with just 40 euro-cent per liter ridiculously low price of diesel: for free, they get their raw material. </seg>
<seg id="35"> He comes from "Bunkerern," which tap the pipeline network transverse through Ogoniland: in this way, every day at least 16 million litres are lost the land according to experts in the entire Niger Delta crude oil. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Only a tiny part of provisionally intermediary raw material is however illegal refined: the lion's share of fill organised criminal networks, to which politicians and high-ranking military should belong in tankers and sell it on the world market. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Whether the disaster is rather due to the activity of the population and the lax mode of production, the activist Akpobari considers academic debate, pure. </seg>
<seg id="38"> "Would be perceived the oil companies not as invaders and had they not as thoroughly destroyed the livelihood of fishermen, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries." </seg>
<seg id="39"> Now the ratio of the Ogoni people was destroyed mainly to shell but so that only a withdrawal of the Group would come into question: "Maybe other nationalities such as the Chinese as better turn out." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Since Michael is nervous. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The muscular oilman says "High time, that it disappears." </seg>
<seg id="42"> "Every minute the soldiers can come." </seg>
<seg id="43"> The illegal caught oil refiner of the special unit of the armed forces, although no arrest, but a painful bribe threatens them. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Also the soldiers originating mainly from the North wishing to benefit from the raw material - such as all Nigerians. </seg>

<seg id="2"> The Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It defends itself but to comment - still, it allows for controls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Around midnight of the fifth on the 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I zetar a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It stands on the Bank of the Euphrates; the nearest large town, 30 km away, is Deir as-Saur. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Her name occurs in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor, Syria has reportedly built with help from North Korea in the box tucked into a Valley, which starting from the current. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing of US foreign secret service CIA by end of April 2008 he would have been common reactor well suited under the name of the nearby village el ilgen, to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons build left. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes, however, is hardly the technology from the 1950s. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA presented a video presentation with fuzzy satellite images. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Per computer animation, she dazzled in where which components of the reactor from destruction should have been, which is a scaled-down copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear Center. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also she presented photos that show the building from nearby or even the Interior. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor was said just before the entry into service, it was said have been fitted, but still not with fuel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more known than it was then, Yes, the puzzles were rather larger with time. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The former US President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA prior to the attack quite sure was, that Syria in el ilgen built a reactor, but saw little evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" the country. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some intelligence people in Europe are still rather more cautious and speak only of a "alleged reactor," even if they keep the CIA presentation for "plausible." </seg>
<seg id="16"> They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Asked, how secure he was to have a reactor before him, a high-ranking UN diplomat replied in the summer only briefly, the IAEA had "enough material, to ask questions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The debris of the alleged "unused military building" made the Syrians while hastily aside and planierten the area thoroughly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Yet found in June 2008 an IAEA team under the previous Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el ilgen traces of uranium, which was made by people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, the IAEA of a Member State received satellite of commercial provider from the period directly after the attack, which might be more meaningful when they presented by the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, these recordings on the market are not to get, because the unknown buyer - perhaps Israel - they exclusively bought. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The IAEA can not independently verify therefore their authenticity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always asserted to have never operated a secret nuclear program or a reactor built. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, Damascus said. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But it rejected the IAEA for analysis of particles as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss - as well as on the satellite images. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In addition, it denied the inspectors a second inspection in el ilgen and the access to the ruins of the bombed-out building. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But also Israel silent iron. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We are commenting that never," recently confirmed the incumbent at the time of the attack Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, the official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> As the investigation of the case dragging down without result since June 2008 and "is increasingly becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority," as a high-ranking Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna allows - finally is a serious violation of the NPT in the region, watching over the the IAEA. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As the key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA is apparently three other facilities, which are - with the alleged reactor and other than this still exist "in functional connection." </seg>
<seg id="32"> While the inspectors have so far revealed, what equipment it is, nor what they have or what they appear suspicious can be. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to information of the Sueddeutsche Zeitung, they are derived internally called Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, though during the IAEA of nearby cities. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent Institute for science and international security in Washington (ISIS) has identified these places and on satellite imagery a building complex in Masyaf find made, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It is located in or immediately next to a military base - exactly on these grounds, Syria of the IAEA denied access to the three places. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In Vienna, it is called the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be sent by the United States to obtain military equipment. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Because the nuclear detectives had become aware through a tip of the US intelligence services on the facilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the box on the Euphrates material back and waste was. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A high-ranking Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants may be "in connection with the production of fuel." </seg>
<seg id="40"> There are "no indications on sensitive activities" but, therefore uranium enrichment or reprocessing; Processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The reactor type is operated while with uranium, which is not enriched. </seg>
<seg id="42"> However, where the uranium would have to come from and where it later, the plutonium for the bomb should be split off, to have any plausible speculated these central issues. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> It is also unclear whether debris that could hold valuable traces, were stored in the three places. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As the hundreds of truckloads of the ground would be gone, no one wants to have information about where the rubble remains. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The salt mine of al-Tibni, 1998 Syria has examined for their suitability as a camp for radioactive waste, only a few kilometres from el ilgen on the other side of the Euphrates, is regarded as unlikely the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The former IAEA Inspector Robert Kelley had transferred recently Jane's intelligence review with the reactor in connection in an analysis of satellite imagery for the renowned magazine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Pictures from orbit show that Syria made earthworks in the three suspicious places and removed large container, after the IAEA had requested access. </seg>
<seg id="48"> This may be coincidence, but hardly has helped dispel the suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Also, is it in diplomatic circles, the IAEA have used quite a few months later, to develop a plan that would allow Syria, to maintain any military secrets-alone the effort shows how great is the interest of the inspectors for inspections there. </seg>
<seg id="50"> However, Damascus ironed out also this proposal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Western diplomats in Vienna appeased had a year ago, the reactor was indeed destroyed, therefore the thing have no high urgency, brings about U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies since a few months known as special inspections in the game, one of the harshest means, which has the Vienna nuclear agency, to enforce controls. </seg>
<seg id="52"> IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections has already talking "an option for which I am open to the future," but even he hesitates. </seg>
<seg id="53"> It is a high risk in this way: on the one hand it needs for a majority in the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and quite a few of there represented 35 countries are far from being set on an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other, as a diplomat to bear in mind is: "What is if they find nothing at the end?" </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> After Angelina Jolie started working on their yet unnamed directorial debut in the summer, there is trouble. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The script has it even written a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serb man. </seg>
<seg id="4"> You don't know much more about but already this is enough for concern. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Stubbornly holds the woman, a Muslim is the rumor, fall during the Yugoslavia war in their Serbian rapists. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Bosnian women immediately protested and some shooting days in Sarajevo planned deployed at short notice to Hungary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In the meantime is shot the film in Hungary and in post production, but it is still protested in Bosnia. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of female war victims wrote of the UN refugee Commission UNHCR on Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is even Ambassador of the UN's refugee fund. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is not diplomatic - it has offered have a meeting in Hungary the women weeks ago, what you but rejected. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The meeting must be held in Bosnia, so Hasecic. </seg>
<seg id="11"> There have been no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude tell her enough about the screenplay to the victims. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Their organization has recommended the UN refugee relief according to dismiss Jolie, as Ambassador, reported the guardian. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> What exactly but wrote Jolie for scenes? </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Bosnian Ministry of culture, which got to read their screenplay, has approved a rotation for Sarajevo after some back and forth - it is not clear why Jolie then still not arrived. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The young author himself asserts she follow no political intentions with her movie, have incorporated with much difficulty in the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties involved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The content, it will remain however vague. </seg>
<seg id="17"> So still a second synopsis to the film in the network, which then but quite unlike sounds courses: the lover knew it even before the outbreak of the war and meet again as she, a Bosnian Muslim, is kidnapped in a Serbian camp where he works as a guard. </seg>
<seg id="18"> What sounds Yes but significantly different than the variant "Rape verknallt in torturer." </seg>
<seg id="19"> That Jolie's begins film actually even before the war - so much is certain. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The pressure on them, so Jolie, was "unfair and based on misinformation." </seg>
<seg id="21"> Now you can get only the hackers of Hollywood peace: by providing the script, like so many before, illegally in the network. </seg>

<seg id="10"> In many countries of the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has greatly increased (see table 1). </seg>
<seg id="11"> In Peru for example, where the economy every year since 2002 is growing by around 6%, the number of the democracy advocates from 40% increased in 2005 to 61% this year. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Also in Mexico, where the economy recovered again since the strong decline in the last year, is such a trend to recognize. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region are convinced Democrats, which reduces the regional average (see chart 2). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Approximately 44% of respondents said that they be satisfied with the democratic practice in their country. As many as in the last year are 25%, but more than in 2001 (chart 3). </seg>
<seg id="15"> About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their Government. Both values are the same as last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined the efforts for more democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> That this lasted also during the great depression, may reason that the countries of Latin America experienced only a short recession and recovered quickly. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, the poor were offset by a stronger social network. </seg>
<seg id="19">  (According to the reports of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week the poverty rate in Latin America rose 2009 only slightly and has again fallen by 32% this year.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But from country to country, there are strong differences in mood (see chart 4). </seg>
<seg id="21"> Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a common progress thinking. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In Mexico and Central America, where more noticeable was the recession and violent crime have increased, this less is the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Only for the second time since the start of the survey many respondents see a bigger problem than in the unemployment in Latin America in the crime in their country (see Chart 5). </seg>
<seg id="24"> About 31% morethan that either yourself or a family member have been victims of crime in the last year. However, compared to 38% in the last year have dropped the values and thus achieve the lowest level since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The increasing economic performance is reflected in the increased support of the private and the market economy: about 71% of respondents also indicated that the private sector for the development is essential, in the year 2007, there were 56% (see chart 6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> About 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% in the last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although its leftist President, Hugo Chavez, many private companies nationalised. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil has the greatest weight in the region, according to 19% of the respondents (18% in the last year) followed by the United States (9%), unchanged since last year and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year). </seg>
<seg id="29"> The respondents in Mexico and the most countries of Central America, however, see where to seize this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela in the United States of the most influential country. </seg>

<seg id="4"> Crowded ballot boxes, multiple total votes, ballots in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problem. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Polling stations opened hours late. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Many Haitians, of which many earthquake had become homeless in January, roamed around looking for a choice. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Some gave up eventually. </seg>
<seg id="8"> A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged leaders, demanded the abolition of the election results because of alleged fraud. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Throughout the country, it came to sometimes violent protests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Nevertheless, called Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN Mission in Haiti, the choice "as well in many respects." </seg>
<seg id="11"> According to a careful statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "to not necessarily invalidate the process these irregularities, so serious they may be,." </seg>
<seg id="12"> In other words, the show goes on. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The election administration, which allegedly is committed to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidates, Celestin, Jew, will announce the provisional results on 7 December. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The expected runoff election is scheduled for January. </seg>

<seg id="16"> The two leading opposition candidate, the rapper Michel Martelly and the former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity proceedings. </seg>
<seg id="17"> If Jew declared Célestin, who finds little or even no support among the voters, by the Wahlberhörde to the winner of the runoff, this could lead to problems. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Secretly in the Middle </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband was Argentina's President, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, which drove their popularity rate by 20 points to more than 50% to the top. This is the highest value since her election in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Whether this but helps in the next year to a re-election, depends on whether the visibly mourning Cristina Fernández is kompromissbereiter as her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Nestor Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The signs are not unique. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Nestor Kirchner, who steered economic policy after the election of his wife, often set budgets, which does not fully take into account the tax revenues, economic growth and inflation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This allowed the President of the pair, spend the extra income to its sole discretion. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On paper, the Fernandez administration lost its majority in Congress last year. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further Zerwürfnissen. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some dissidents from the ranks of the ruling Peronists were behind Cristina Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But after chaotic meetings (where a parliamentarian hit another in the face and others accused the Government of bribery) Congress, failed to adopt the budget for 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I will not discuss," so the President. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The 2010 budget now also applies to the next year, which the President has more opportunity to spend money to its sole discretion. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy is hot: probably it will grow by up to 9% this year. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official inflation rate currently at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of trade unions - drive the value to almost 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner, who took over the Office 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, said growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not the reduction in inflation. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He refused the cooperation with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and cleaned the National Institute of statistics and census INDEC, which then schönte the official inflation statistics. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Can Fernández go a way we now? </seg>
<seg id="18"> She encouraged the private sector and the trade union leaders to talks. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And official statements that wage increases should be limited in the next year to 18%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products gave a strong boost to the economy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But inflation undermined the growth by a large devaluation in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> May, Cristina Fernández therefore would like to finance again connect Argentina to the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Earlier this year, the Government met an agreement with the holders of securities, which had rejected earlier rescheduling of the country in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Now Fernandez seems on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club to which it owes about $6.7 billion. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Kirchner had rejected a review by the IMF as usual elsewhere, always. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But in the last month, the Economics Minister Amado Boudou announced that the funds in the creation of a new national index of consumer prices will provide "technical assistance." It looks as if this were the first step towards the cleansing of INDEC. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not known whether Fernandez will be politically active after their term of Office without the support by her husband. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If so, she needed the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of the Kirchnerism. </seg>
<seg id="29"> When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of the Sympatie, which was placed on it, will be diminished. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If you would like to win another choice, she must decide whether she quietly lifted many political decisions of her husband. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the Mainland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> What does Taiwan from its big brother beyond the Strait? </seg>
<seg id="4"> On 27 November more than 7.5 million voters, made up 70% of all eligible voters, to choose mayors and Councillors in the five boroughs. This is considered Ma Ying-jeou a broad review of the President. </seg>
<seg id="5"> By creating breakthrough business relationships, including a partial free trade agreement, MA is itself a symbol for the relations with the Mainland. His policy effectively changed the relationship with the Chinese mainland for the first time since 1949. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The test has passed ma, but only just. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) provides three of the five Mayor, she received no majority of votes. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates a greater independence of Taiwan was, almost 50% of the vote, the KMT won 45%. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The share of the vote of his party by about 8% has fallen since his election two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Even with the KMT, the DPP was a the Councillors for the first time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> During the election, there was the usual in Taiwan events such as truck convoys with rioters, flags schwenkende mass parades and only scantily clad dancers. </seg>
<seg id="13"> There was even the compulsory, mysterious attempted murder. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Sean lien, who was son of Lien Chan and Honorary Chairman of the KMT on the eve of the election a speech to a KMT candidate,. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When he shot a man from the crowd in the face. Lien was wounded and killed a umstehender viewers. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the gunman wanted to kill lien or settle a dispute with the candidate. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Regardless of the attack according to Tsai has Ing-wen, the leader which has affected the DPP, the choice and put the DPP in a bad light, which gives more votes of the KMT. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> May, China was the biggest winner of the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Remarkably, the relations with the Mainland was not addressed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Instead debated the candidates have plans to social housing and job creation. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat. </seg>
<seg id="22"> For this reason, the KMT is their relations to the Government in Beijing don't like in the foreground. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But this time the DPP also avoided to stir up anti-Chinese feelings too much. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Thus, she responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy without China cannot survive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Ma in turn would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese favour its China policy. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The Government in Beijing will continue to monitor his strategy, Taiwan with economic incentives in the community back to lock. </seg>
<seg id="27"> China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a Summit on investment protection and medical cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Certainly, it wants also a political integration. But the most important thing first. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is thus rather until after the presidential election 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The DPP now newly invented himself. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Two years ago, she was greatly weakened: the former leader of Chen Shui-bian was arrested for corruption in the prison. </seg>
<seg id="32"> During his presidency from 2000 to 2008 he strongly advocated the absolute independence. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But under TAIS reign developed into a new generation of moderate political leaders and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the professionals and youth. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Tsai found broad approval, such as Su Tseng-chang, Chen as presidential candidate of the DPP. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Their party is doing everything to show that she able is to build close relations with Beijing now. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Tsai is a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China. This requires however unprejudiced discussion. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Tsai publicly that her party will offer a "trusted alternative" to MAS of over-rapid approach to China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Chen seems very angry about this change. </seg>
<seg id="39"> From his cell, he said the DPP candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence. </seg>
<seg id="40"> He even urged the pragmatist Su to give up the presidential nomination. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Chen's intervention without the DPP having a hard time, to choose their possible candidates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The KMT will have to undergo an own self-analysis. </seg>
<seg id="43"> MAS values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead its election campaign without him. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The main reasons seem to be unemployment and the more gap between rich and poor for his unpopularity. </seg>
<seg id="45"> According to a KMT spokesman, he will remodel his Cabinet, as well as the local institutions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan limited in favour of a rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="47"> At the same time, the most Taiwanese see as inevitable economic cooperation with China. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> In view of the fact that Spalding 2008 is already a celebrated star since their album "Esperanza" in the jazz scene, the nomination seems a little unusual.

<seg id="5"> Their ambitious album of the year 2010, "Chamber Music Society," is certainly a step forward. And with her lilting voice and a good sense of pop, Funk and Latin music, you can still compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003 whose success 2003 as a jazz performer in this category of the nomination of Spaldings the closest comes in the year. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Arsenic resistant germ could enable new forms of life on earth or elsewhere </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The discovery of a foreign type of bacteria that can live among other things by arsenic, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Although scientists here discovered this unusual bacteria on Earth, it is in their opinion a sign that it is possible to have a life without the elements previously considered vital. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "This organism has two options." </seg>
<seg id="5"> "He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "That makes it something special, even though it's almost a kind of 'foreign' way of life," said c.w. Davies of the Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online issue of the journal Science Paul. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> So far, six main elements considered essential for life - are carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> However, as the scientists found the bacteria in the Californian Mono continues Lake even, replacing phosphorus by arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "Since you ask yourself, what else can," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar by the Arizona State University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, since scientists need to see life and its forms so Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study deals with microbes that have been found on Earth. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The announcement of a press conference in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet, that the report could be the discovery of extraterrestrial life. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "shows, that in other planetary systems, organisms with the help of other elements can set biochemical processes and that the 'standard 'elements that are absolutely vital in our view, are not necessarily fixed," said Charles Cockell, Professor at the planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the UK. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockel was not part of the research team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "This work is a first, as it shows that, in Basic biochemical processes and structures, an element can be replaced by another," added Cockell. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> This discovery was not accidental. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiologischen Institute of NASA, who led the study, chose the Mono Lake due to the high content of arsenic. </seg>

<seg id="21"> "As a result it is difficult the organisms, to distinguish an element from the other." </seg>

<seg id="25"> According to Jamie S. foster, lecturer in Microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, is not new. But so far there is still no functioning example. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to Thursday the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy laws, so that under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass entertainment, nothing in the way is the new home of MGM. Barber and Birnbaum will preside over the slightly trimmed-down Studio as General Manager. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The number of employees will be reduced from about 400 to about 320. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For MGM, Chapter 11 is actually only in force when JPMorgan Chase completes a planned loan of $500 million to finance the new MGM Productions. </seg>
<seg id="7"> At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank which itself brings $75 million, manages the company. The funding is to be until mid-December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The restructuring of the Studio began in May 2009 with the mandate for the Investment Bank Moelis & co, the company's management, who fought with interest payments amounting to $300 million/year, to help solve their financial problems. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In August the CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert who fame due to his experience at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Moelis & Cooper, the efforts to solve the financial concerns of California and pay the more than 140 Gläuber of studios, lasted longer than expected. </seg>
<seg id="11"> After months of discussions, the parties end 2009 decided to offer to buy the company. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But the auction attracted only a few bidders and nobody wanted to pay the $2 demanded by the creditors billion. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In the spring of this year, everything from the front began when the MGM team began with the restructuring plan, which was signed after months-long debates and internal disputes end October at last by the creditors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> If MGM officially survived the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper receive a bonus for her work of millions of dollars. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The share for Moelis & co., who have already received $1.2 million, amounted to $9.5 million </seg>
<seg id="16"> Cooper, where monthly paid $375,000 for the management of the company receive a "success"bonus of $4 million </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the Studio released only a movie and created an annual plan with seven or eight movies, which are early 2012 in the cinemas. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, they plan two films by "The Hobbit" in co-production with Warner of Bros. records. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The Studio needed a separate bond between $265 million to $275 million for its financial interest in these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Investor Carl Icahn, CA has funded 18% of the MGM loan, tried with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest Aktionär he is a fusion of the Studio. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The year's favorite among the gifts is followed IOS, perhaps from a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can tear a significant hole in your gift budget. </seg>
<seg id="3"> An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price of a Kinect game about 10 classic Springseilen or about 48 cans of play-DOH. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> But you can save your gift budget. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Recently I visited looking after three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealer - a Wal-Mart, a toys "R" US and a BJ's Wholesale Club. </seg>
<seg id="6"> I immediately realized that Moore's law was in force. This year the technology toys are more powerful and cost at the same time slightly less than in the last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> And although less new toys appear with your own Web site, is located on the most famous in this way, Webkinz and Club Penguin, a wider range. </seg>
<seg id="8"> There is more and more cell button coin operated toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Here are some recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="10">  (If not otherwise stated, all prices of toys "R" US.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are plush figures, as large as guinea pigs, who sing a note, if you press on their belly. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Press once corresponds to a note, by repeatedly pressing you can play a song. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Note: If you have once started with the press, you can stop no longer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> For one combination on sand and dance the dance star Mickey is (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) the best choice. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Based on the Elmo live technology developed in the last year, the animatronic doll offers interactions such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the new hinge feet with wheel lock, she dominated the moon-walk. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Children who tested the device, use Mickey as a dance instructor. However, their parents complained about the missing volume. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> If you are a child of the 80s, you remember surely Alphie, one of the first computerised learning toys. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Now he is back again (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch, a drive can be used to synchronize question cards to a lesson with a know-it-all with AutoCorrect as a teacher. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> If you do not like to want to entrust your Smartphone your child, are three independent alternatives. </seg>
<seg id="21"> MobiGo of VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is equipped with a qwerty keyboard, the cheapest and most user friendly solution. The games on it are not as instructive as to the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which comes to Leapfrogs of first major revision of the Leapster series with a new, brighter screen. </seg>
<seg id="22"> None of the versions is compatible with older cartridges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> iXL of Fisher-price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) used for the games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD card drive, also family photos that can be viewed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Last but not least, there are still Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no bigger than a matchbox, and have an own LED screen. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The game is about combining the blocks to words before time runs out. It is great for an improvised spelling competition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> More and more toys have a kind of online connection. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If you go alone as offered in the toy shops, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important. </seg>
<seg id="28"> To give your child an online animal in Club Penguin, you can for example a Disney Club Penguin 2 "mix 'n match figure Pack purchase ($5 for children from 6 to 12) that contains a coin with a secret code. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If you enter the code online, your child in the Club Penguin store will receive enough credits for two more parts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Roller skates or a Puffle Teddy bear can be. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The latest head cells-powered micro robot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for kids from 5) is not greater than the head of your toothbrush. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Prosecutor will not prosecute Senator Ensign </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Department of Justice prosecutors have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the accusations which have been applied after his affair with a former Wahlhelferin and his attempt to make a lobbying her husband against him, announced on Wednesday the lawyers of the Senator. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This decision ends the most serious legal charge against Senator Ensign, Republican of Nevada. Up to the scandal, which caused nationwide headlines and put a setback of his career, he was considered as a possible presidential candidate of the Republican for 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As Senator ensigns announced Office, he was "delighted" by the ruling after the one-year investigation. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Ethics Committee of the Senate could impose a Disziplarstrafe yet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to ensigns lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice in that the investigations against Senator Ensign were dropped and that there are no more charges in this matter. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Ministry of Justice did not comment on the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The ruling came as a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of justice. In their opinion there was sufficient evidence that Ensign has violated the prohibition of lobbying. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Interviews, emails and other documents, which were disclosed for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times, gave rise to the presumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of its election workers, helped to lucrative jobs to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Cynthia Hampton worked during an election campaign of ensigns as Treasurer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Ensign resumed contact with some political friends to give work to Hampton. According to the documents and interrogations he took Hampton's lobbying for them according to the setting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Hampton was recently still in ensigns election team, it was he was allowed to take over for a year no lobbying work for his former employer or the entire Senate. </seg>
<seg id="13"> According to the statement of Ethics experts was the unusual agreement between ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the case against the so-called prohibition of revolving door Lobbykratie. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> In accordance with the published evidence "is everything pointing to an agreement and to the violation of the statutes of the revolving door," so Stanley brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defence of clients, which are the target of the Government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> While the Department of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the case of the Ensign, said Mr. brand and other ethics lawyers, the Ministry seem very careful to contain political charges after a variety of disasters that were followed with great interest by the media, including the decision last year to drop the case against the former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct on the part of the public prosecutor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Prosecutors "are obviously frightened," said Melanie Sloan, the Chairman of the Association "Citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington" (an organization, the aim of which is the fight against corruption in parliamentary and Government circles of the United States), a group of lawyers that has brought several charges against Mr. Ensign in court. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "This basically means that high government officials can be now assumed that the laws do not apply for them," she added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Paul Coggins, the main defender of Mr. said Ensign, in an interview, he had received a phone call of a public prosecutor on Monday and another the next day, in which it was informed that the Ministry would have no complaint against his clients. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Mr.. ensigns Defender had working with the prosecutors, to convince them that the Senator, "had acted again repeated, such as his Office in a statement on Wednesday in accordance with the law." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr.. Coggins it refused to explain the legal arguments he had put forward to the prosecutors, more accurate. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "Is me not comfortable, to go into the details of talks between the Ministry of Justice and me." "Only so much by saying: we believe that you have made the right decision," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Last month the Federal Election Commission has decided to terminate the investigation for a separate lawsuit by the Group on ethics, according to which a payment of $96,000 of Mr. ensigns had infringed parents at the Hampton's the Federal Wahlgesetz. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The Electoral Commission said there had been insufficient evidence that the money had been anything other than a gift. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="1"> Cheshire calling attention on Twitter </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Half a dozen of them typed away in the riots in the courtroom. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the minute they mailed their reports of gruesome testimony on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the end, so the defence, there was more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process to rape and beds multiple children in a House that became part of in flames. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Thursday, the process closely pursued by Steven j. Hayes, who was charged with having killed three members, a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end if the judgment of the death sentence, that the jury has spoken. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But Mr.. Hayes lawyers have submitted applications to the Court, set out reasons for an appeal, which will deal with the courts for years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> One of the provozierendsten reasons is that it had come through the intensive coverage of the process - also by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporter - to a "circus atmosphere" and a sufficiently common and immediate penetration of firebrand details so that the jury illegally had been influenced by the public indignation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This objection could cause the Appelationsgerichte to deal with, whether the new technologies new rules in the courtroom be necessary can be the issue. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "As I have experienced it during this process, I believe that it really is a threat if the introduction of new technology in the courtroom affected the right of every citizen to a fair trial," Thomas j. said Ullman, Mr.. Hayes main defenders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue by the Supreme Kammergericht, dismissed last week the applications by decision shortly and flush back, when he said that the new media "carefully controlled" would, and that there is no evidence, that the jury had been driven by passions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But that was certainly not the last word in this matter still. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For decades, court objections noted that reporting on notorious cases doubts about the fairness of the process can be. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States lifted the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopaths from Cleveland to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some people believe that the TV series and the feature film "on the run" is based on this crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some lawyers say Court objections which Mr.. Hayes a half a century later consider condemnation, could the argument followed, that new rules have become necessary to the communication channels from the courtroom, which were still unthinkable Dr. Sheppard at the time of the case, to regulate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "There is a good reason, about the impact of new media in processes, tracked by a wide public, to be concerned," said John j. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, which has investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is imposed arbitrarily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor Donohue said some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the limitation of immediate communication in the courtroom out could make the process fair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Twitter issue is just one of many which set out the lawyers by Mr. Hayes to discuss on years and thus delay a conviction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> For example, the defenders say that Mr. Hayes could have been already vorverurteilt, when judge blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors, you showed them gruesome crime scene photos during the jury selection. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some of the jurors said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, they had met with disgust. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defenders say, they would make the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution into question, and argue that the judge had incorrectly replaced a juror, who had been a critic of the public prosecutor's Office, and that he prohibited way would put pressure on the ruling, as he had made the unusual decision to make the jury over the weekend free. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The judges were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But the biggest interest is perhaps their arguments on the influence of the detailed reporting on the process. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In a sentencing appeal, which they have submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut, and was discussed during the election campaign for the Office of the Governor and the American Senate candidates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They argued that the new media continuously have reignited the flames of the emotions of the case. </seg>
<seg id="26"> , The lawyers, wrote "seen previously in New Haven, and perhaps even throughout the country still not"A such daily crowds of Media General, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom."" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Their focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In interviews, some journalists said that the assertion of these direct messages are rabble-rousing as reports that will be returned more slowly, is a technology xenophobic views, verarme reporting on future processes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> But some lawyers said Appelationsgerichte would often faced with the argument, social and technical changes need the adaptation by the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr.. Hayers lawyers reinforce this claim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In their appeal, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice from 1966, in which the conviction was overturned by Dr. Sheppard due to the reporting and made it clear that the new media require new rules. </seg>
<seg id="32"> "This case," so wrote it "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Can courtesy connect what divides us? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> After a campaign of words and negativity, this week in Washington is broken out little courtesy. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Is it the omen of a genuine two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the battle of the parties in the capital? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and tips of the Congress was no breakthrough in the big issues, which during the so-called "lame session duck," the meeting at the end of a period of Government, where no decisions are met, had to deal with. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After all what you hear, it was not a polite discussion between two different pages or a compliance with their shared responsibility to govern, but rather a episode of a partisan point collecting empty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meeting of the deficit Commission of President on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that still exist between the members. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems to be that close interaction over a period of months a mutual respect gives rise, which obscures the ideological gap that still separates the members, clear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> That is hardly enough, come to claim it is a new era of cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Both sides are now in a period of testing - in which has claimed one of the other characters of the cooperation and willingness to compromise, while even trying, after a renewed party warfare weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants on a minimum of claims or allegations were limited. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep, as that one might expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years. </seg>
<seg id="12"> No matter whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or rights that both sides are miles apart. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Last but not least the November election has mild voted Washington at least for a short time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, who now works for the "ethics and public policy Center." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "That is inevitable after elections." </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elections are partisan passions, which die off again. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "And that is a good thing." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "In some issues, especially those on the agenda of the"lame duck session"are, Republicans and Democrats have little choice to find a solution." </seg>
<seg id="19"> Bush's tax cuts end end of the year, and no one in favour of that. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way, a few or even to get all, it is now temporarily or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="21"> As a compromise with regard to the increased unemployment benefit is expected, even if only, because the Republicans can afford, that it is believed that favored tax cuts for the rich, while they refuse to support unemployed workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting at the White House on Tuesday, the optimism has increased, that one on these issues while some "lame duck session" and contract can ratify the new START at the same time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> "But William Glaston of Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session" not necessarily a permanent cooperation of the parties cause must, if the new 112. is convened Congress in January. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead, he says, a phase of non übereinstimmens is more likely, perhaps even essential. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - leads courtesy to true cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "I see much of what happens between now and 2012 as a preliminary, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons for this have to do much with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters that were beneficial to their education. </seg>
<seg id="29"> As concerned the Republican leaders also may be that they play poker too high, they know that they must try, its promises to reduce government spending and to override the health care reform, to comply with. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> This party are already evident in the first reactions to the recommendations of the deficit Commission, which include a tax reform and raising some taxes and raising the retirement age and reducing government spending. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have adopted one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, in accordance with their own assessment, so much crowded, the deficit issue on the public agenda, that they can no longer be ignored. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need within the Commission of 14 of the 18 votes to make the official recommendation their plan and they fight very to come only in the vicinity of this number. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The largest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the Panel, as in financial issues, at least today little scope, or is little sympathy for compromises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Galston predicts two stages in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The first fight will be held next year in the form of party clashes if the Republican challenge in terms of the State budget and the control of the health system, later followed by a phase of greater two parteilicher cooperation Obama. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Leading to this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> The public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It is proved that, despite the bias of the current election, the majority of Americans still wishes that the two parties work together. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If confrontation in a dead end as it has happened in 1995, both parties need to carefully look for the public reaction. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Who is sentenced to the loss, is to change the course and find the compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> This may in fact be an optimistic view. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Partisanship and polarization are today greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At the same time the activists of both parties see 2010 as pure prelude to one of consequence far greater choice 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Seen in this way, the courtesy that this week is carried to the show, like will be welcomed by many Americans. </seg>
<seg id="45"> But it will require much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions that still separate the two. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and it passes a part of the bribes and of protection money, which they collect to the Kremlin. So, the American Embassy in Russia in a memo reported in February. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Both high protection money blackmail police as also the State security service, so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, as it is. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Earn money not only from legitimate businesses, but also by organised criminal gangs. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has referred to as "Vertical of authority" - takes his share of the money that moves the head to above. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his site. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The memo is based on sources, names that have been edited. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It was written while still Moscow's Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, and it accused him of corruption. </seg>
<seg id="9"> He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly a proof that would be been scavenged in the meantime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, which has a well-known construction company, have rejected over and over again allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won numerous libel against such accusations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In September he explained a Russian television station, when he was asked after a documentation suggests, he was corrupt: "it's crazy, it is dirty, it's dirty." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. Surveys have shown that. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But it is unusual that, as happened in the report of Ambassador, individual persons are called, and it is unheard, that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "The direct connection of the Government of Moscow with the crime has meant that some refer to them as"disturbed"and come to the conclusion that the Government is rather like a Kleptokrat as a Government," so the memo. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "Criminals enjoy elements one"kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the mafia, which literally"roof"or protection), which extends from the police, State security (FSB), the service Authority (MVD) and the Office of public prosecutor as well as by the entire Moscow Government bureaucracy." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Experts have discovered a three-layered structure within the criminal world of Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Luzhkov is at the top." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "FSB, MVD, and the militia are in the second stage." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "Last ordinary criminals and criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level." </seg>
<seg id="20"> "This is an incompetent system where criminal a gap close groups in some areas because the city offers no help." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The report continues, that the FSB received money from the biggest companies and the small businessmen arrested the police. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Is a source, so is, "explained, that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best, the protection of the MVD and FSB to not get it (and not by organised crime), as just as the criminals have more weapons, resources and power"," but also because they are protected by the law." </seg>
<seg id="23"> "For this reason the protection by criminal of gangs is not more as demand like earlier." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The memo noted that, while the collection of funds is comprehensive, the protection of even very modest be no; Sometimes, even those who pay, be arrested. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Those who do not pay, have very quickly closed their business - on the basis of one or other Vorwands. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Medvedev has talked several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The memo of the message contains descriptions of men go with suitcases which were probably filled with money, in the Kremlin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> "In his fight against corruption Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, Director of by, a Moscow Expert Commission, in a recent interview. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "But it is part of this bureaucracy." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "It is not a part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, so he says, corruption is inevitable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Nationwide, as estimated by, the corruption of Russia costs more than $300 billion a year. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The country ranks to place 154 of a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization transparence International (countries are of "least corrupt" to "most corrupt" list). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> The revelations of memos of the American Embassy, which happened after Moscow time late in the evening, will trigger disapproval within the Russian Government with security, although, since Luzhkov can be blamed for the errors of Moscow, you might also be a way for the Kremlin to claim, that you solve the problems. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a dimly lit, concrete-lined classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the Director of the Veng of Anlong County high school reminds the man who has built it on the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> "Everyone here loves Ta Mok." </seg>
<seg id="4"> "He was a good leader and he has looked after his people," said Sreng KOR Ma, 42 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher," the Commander in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold remains popular in northwestern of Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the Government, longtime followers in Anlong County Veng are challenged. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In April a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the public confrontation the victims with the people who once supported the regime. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In June the Government distributed a textbook, which for the first time children of former soldiers tells the story of the Khmer Rouge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And in July a Community Court of the United Nations and Cambodia condemned a former member of the Khmer first Rouge, as it torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known, convicted the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng as Duch to 35 years in prison. </seg>
<seg id="10"> With each of these developments grew the fear under the Khmer Rouge veterans of Alnlong Vengs, impeded their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration in the society of Cambodia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "There is still a rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation center of Cambodia, an independent organization that explores the regime. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "For them the life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "It divides itself families." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> During the Khmer Rouge reign in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or they died from diseases, revision or hunger. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-IED toppled Government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military on the border of Cambodia fled to Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Here they spread until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered, unrest. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the West of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved up to the next generation in Anlong County Veng. </seg>
<seg id="18"> But mid-1990s, when a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations, 1993 to the first democratic elections in the country's large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, began defect to the Government, leading to the capitulations 1998 led by Ieng Sary in 1996 and NUAN Chea and Khieu Samphan. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and 1999, Ta Mok, who had not given, was arrested by Government forces in the Dângrêk mountains. </seg>
<seg id="20"> He died in 2006 in the prison in Phnom Penh, where he waited for his process. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> As their patrons no longer protected her, the most former Khmer fled Rouge fighters in the grueling poverty of rural Cambodia and many retained the movement in nostalgic memories. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Even if some Rouge their local government posts retained a few elite official Khmer, because they laid down their weapons, were simple soldiers poor, uneducated farmers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> "These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said of the Center for Justice and reconciliation, which holds in all over Cambodia, also in Anlong County Veng, public forums Sok Leang </seg>
<seg id="24"> "They are anchored in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime." </seg>
<seg id="25"> "You grew up without any professional knowledge." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Sor Lim, fought in the jungle to 55 years to 1974 had Rouge joined as a teenager in the Rhmer, Anlang Veng, before he settled in 1998, to lead a life as a poor rice farmer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> "Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said. </seg>
<seg id="28"> "Ta Mok has given to eat something each." </seg>
<seg id="29"> "But now, life is hard, because we must take care to our own." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Called awake the current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has again concerns universal. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Early next year, the Court will try to make Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife Ieng Thirith, an other former Khmer Rouge Minister in court. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The order of the Court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further actions on these four cases. </seg>
<seg id="33"> That contributed little to mitigate the fears in Anlong County Veng. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Current media speculation have to 64 years in the Chaem, concentrated, which was during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's District Manager in Manteay Meanchey province. </seg>
<seg id="35"> 2007 it had representative of the documentation center about Cambodia, she have led the construction of Trapeang Thma of dam, a project in which thousands of forced labourers died probably. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> On a hot night Veng came back in the Chaem from working on the fields to their wooden house on a dirty road outside of Anlong County. </seg>
<seg id="37"> As the Sun threw long shadows on the withered grass it turned down in the Chaem to discuss Rouge about their past in Khmer. </seg>
<seg id="38"> They should summon the Court, she would refuse to go, she said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> "Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said. </seg>
<seg id="40"> "There would be no more persecutions would war here." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has fled in 1878 by the Khmer Rouge, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, would accuse the Court more suspects although experts and historians discuss it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> "Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia must do to to go forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation centre. </seg>
<seg id="44"> "Reconciliation with the Khmer times means gathering the broken pieces," he said. </seg>
<seg id="45"> "It is our duty to put these broken parts together, so that how all can understand." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> The center created the first textbook approved by the Government of the Khmer Rouge, the 75seitige "history of democratic Cambodia." </seg>
<seg id="47"> It distributed the book as an annex to the history book for the high school of the Ministry of education, that less than four contains pages about the Khmer Rouge in Anlong County Veng in June. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> How many times in Cambodia only little about the Khmer Rouge despite the connections of the town to the regime know the young people in Anlong County Veng. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Veng Anlong County high school, said that the new textbook helps students to understand an important part of their history. </seg>
<seg id="50"> But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home, to read it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> "My family is from many parts of the book and the Court," he said. </seg>
<seg id="52"> "You are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people are convicted by the Court." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Belarus agrees accumulate not weapons-grade uranium </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide has the Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will collect not more longer highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of Security Summit. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Government had for years tried to convince Belarus to collect not more highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> However, official of the US Government told the Washington Post that two secret with Belarus have been taken in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian Research Institute. </seg>
<seg id="6"> That was the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The agreement seems to be "Nuclear security summit of the 47 Nations" of April had excluded Belarus one of the most important results of Obama's. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next Summit in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I was really excited by the fact that they want a seat in the nuclear security Summit (by 2012)." </seg>
<seg id="10"> "That shows me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the global security partnership, a group for the promotion of nuclear safety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Clinton called the agreement "a very significant and important step" of Belarus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since then, the Government has helped six countries to get rid of their highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Belarus will be the seventh. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A dozen countries have done it under the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At the time of Obama's nuclear security Summit, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that the nation will never give up its uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "How keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos which is fundamentally waffenfähig and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "This is our raw material..." "We will make no dirty bombs from it and we will sell it to anyone." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Belarus closer to be still the United States a few months ago, it announced interest in the meeting of an agreement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The first attempt to remove uranium of Belarus in October was particularly complicated, because the material was easily contaminated, official say. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It was loaded in a special train, the more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for official say. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The second attempt was adopted on Monday and was carried out according to the officials by plane. </seg>
<seg id="24"> For this effort, the U.S. Government pays $14 million, with flows much of the money in the Belarusian research with low enriched uranium, which can be used for nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "This was very carefully co-ordinated and adapted, to build confidence," which led to the agreement which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of energy, which works to reduce global danger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The James Martin Center for non-wide location end studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of waffenfähhigen uranium this year as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Belarus wants to resolve his camp by 2012 according to the common agreement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The relations between Belarus and the United States were strained for years, mainly because Lukashenkos harsh violation of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But the statement Wednesday suggests a possible approach. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> "The progress of this global security issues, heißend welcome to the United States of America and Belarus announce that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in the bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains. </seg>

<seg id="4"> The head of elderly nursing, Joan Sala, appeared in in the company of his lawyer, front court Joan Canada and announced "La Caritat wants to prosecute those responsible (for the deaths) ," but "the right and our liability are forcing us to the process and the civil liability" to accept. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The institution must accept not only a social reputation because she had not found the criminal acts of the keeper, but pay now also a high amount of compensation is calculated by the attorneys for the families of the victims. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime goes back to August 2009 and that he had since then further murdered. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The judge ordered to the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of elderly nursing - because he suspected that no doctor examined the deceased personally, but the formalities on the basis of their age and diseases were handled by phone. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> In la Caritat, it gives the statements of the keeper no faith, not even as regards the number of the related murders, which could well be more.

<seg id="16"> The State asset management output only 500 million to 5,28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Nevertheless fell Portugal interest rates by 30 basis points in the entire curve and thus reflected a change in the perception of the markets according to Trichet's. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The figures of debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published in Ireland. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The sum is estimated to be approximately 10 000 million in the short term and possible further 15 000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks be nationalized. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Although Ireland has completely lost his credibility after it had not recognized the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures in the part of the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce the uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, the Government must get the parliamentary approval of his new budget next Tuesday. Because she always does not have the sufficient support, Ireland is also still a source of uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Angela Merkel made moderate their discourse relating to the Summit of the heads of State and Government on 14 December. There, political unit is required to show that we share same score play. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the Ninth Symphony of Beethoven's. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The President of the Spanish Government yesterday presented the action plan, to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions, such as in the financial institutions, reducing the State deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job-making measures. Measures that four seasons sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldi's. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why has increased the Spanish Stock Exchange 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Compared to February, the response of the Government and the Spanish Central Bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Today, there is a major auction of three-year government bond, which will benefit from the effect of Trichet. Therefore, we rely on a strong demand, which will remove all doubts about our ability to debt restructuring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> For Spain, applying for an assistance plan would be a sacrifice. </seg>
<seg id="30"> We would get liquidity, we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are very expensive and the access to the markets would close without notice. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Nevertheless our strategy should be the motto Caesar's wife: "Now is not only being, but also the appearance." </seg>
<seg id="32"> Only courage, we do that! </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The cars are improved with a software in real time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Since Red Bull 2004 penetrated into the world of F1, is their history in this exquisite universe of the speed of surprises and successes. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Initially, no one gave the novice attention and despite his steeply ascending career during the last seasons, all on the victory of Ferrari's Fernando Alonso put in the final sprint last November. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Without wanting to reduce the capabilities of German pilots and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the engine by Renault, the "secret weapon," is the multi Siemens Red Bull to put hands, and so created a winning team, become the legend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In reality is a powerful software for the simulation of processes that brought the German company for purposes that have to do with race, 2007 on the market. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This computer programme called PLM was used for the development of Assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is before it is actually built to avoid such mistake and unnecessary costs. </seg>
<seg id="9"> PLM has facilitated the development of the Canon cameras, the aircraft from Sukhoi and the most famous commercial vehicles from Nissan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Industry Department of Siemens, explains that with the use of this software in the formula 1 - factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements that are found on the race and test, can design and execute. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Russwurm executes that in 1992 in the teams on average ten technicians worked, which could introduce improvements at most three or four in one season. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In Red Bulls team today 180 highly qualified young people are employed. With powerful computer equipment they carry out analyses and all possible changes to the car. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The Siemens Manager stated that the PLM software was all components of the cars in the location, by Red Bull to analyse and improve, with the exception of the engine for the only Renault declared responsible. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the security elements are changed. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Changes can be propagated thanks to advanced production facilities and tech autoclave less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of the Simulator to reality. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The $40 million that should output a formula 1 - team for his race in a season are the only limit that is set to this crazy technical perfectionism. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Red bull has built up 50 kilometres from London his high-tech factory for the development and production of his car in a remote location. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is two buildings where visits - especially of journalists - are strongly limited. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Everything that happens, there is top secret. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The staff includes 580 persons, including the two pilots, the world champions of Vettel and Mark Webber. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But Red Bulls real formula 1 - hero is without a doubt the most recent world champion Sebastian Vetell. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Hides the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer in the services is participating on the race tracks, is the other protagonists, which support is invaluable and their popularity equal to zero. </seg>

<seg id="23"> The Technologichef of the work, Steve Nevey, stressed that one could still say five years ago, that the progress in the field of R & D for racing cars with 50 percent contributed to the victory and the pilot for the rest were responsible. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Today, the unit values have changed. The technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Managing Director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 a tough year for the banks will be, first but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war of debt. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Nevertheless, he is forecasting a collapse of the spreads the banks compensate for trying with increases in the fees and the prices for loans. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Sabadell expected to capture one million private customers in three years - a partition to existing. </seg>

<seg id="6"> The Bank will introduce a new Dreijahresleitplan 2011. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The goal is not only to survive, without taking the public aid from the FROB in order, but also the market share to one million private customers - 700 000, if you withdraw the customers that the Bank will lose - to increase. This is the great challenge facing this Bank, because until now she paid their business more attention than their private customers. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This year it has get 250 000 individuals and 50 000 companies. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Their market share in retail is 3.5 percent, while the business account for more than 10 percent. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="11"> Only a few banks dare in these difficult times, set goals and to publish, since the financial crisis all plans of the banks have got messed up. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Sabadell Optima will complete their master plan laid down four years ago this year. It was designed initially for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended to a fiscal year. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main objective of the Bank. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Guardiola said at a breakfast organized by the APIE, 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with long range." </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Manager assumes Spain would be "slow" out of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Also, it is "very difficult" in two or three years ' work to create"- fundamental for the survival of banks. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Although he believes that the war to liabilities - which punished the interest margins - will abate, the risk premiums, the banks and savings banks for their emissions to the receiving of liquidity will have to pay, to compensate for dwindling margins already to the price for credits passed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "The issues of liquidity and financing are structural type and they will put pressure on the loans." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We have not finished the tap, but the interest rate differential are very high," Guardiola admitted to. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Sabadells master plan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate transactions. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Not for nothing, he assured that in Spain "larger companies are necessary." </seg>
<seg id="24"> "In the coming year everything will change," he assures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> He stressed that the need for capital currently "greatly increase" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions in red numbers will drop. </seg>
<seg id="26"> He believes the FROB could replace the money market at Kaptitalaufstockungen. </seg>
<seg id="27"> After he affirms that Sabadell could survive a temporary closure of the markets, he ruled out the argument of some bankers who already predict a new liquidity crisis. </seg>
<seg id="28"> He stressed it could bring nothing in circulation, but in contrast to the events in June, you can achieve short-term funding through repo transactions and thus catch the crisis. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility that there could be a wave of savings banks and emphasized the speed with which the industry will be restructured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> When the concentration process of Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks insisted on the first phase not to take part. It retained for the second round. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish savings banks Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured this second round would not take place. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "I think that most of the merger is complete." "The inclusion of Memphis in the Group of Banca Cívica can be considered not second round, it was rather adjustments." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "The largest part is completed." It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of siebzehen, but all important processes are already completed. "You were controlled by Banco de España, which has strongly supports all operations." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In a breakfast organised by the Association of the Managing Director and Manager of Aragon (ADEA) Olavarrieta carried out, that the concentration process "as soon as possible was completed and that we need to be satisfied with the timely development, not now, is set in the past, in the framework of the business plans with Banco de España," he stressed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> "The transition from 45 savings banks with an average 28 000 million assets to 17 with the 75 500 million is an historically unparalleled process." "The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 per cent and they are now much larger, which we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he stressed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Olavarrieta said, "there would be some unabgebrachter opinions about the slowness of the process, the untrustworthiness and folly" revealed, because "Banco de España admonishes us conclude within the time limit before the end of the year." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Zapatero and the red line of Germany </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin has for the maintenance of the euro decided, but at the same time set up conditions for the entire European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tensions in the markets have caused a duplicate response of the Government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adaptation, from tax reductions for small and micro-enterprise, the regulation of temporary work agencies or the abolition of the 426 euro support for unemployed people, assume no unemployment benefits, and up to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of the airport of Barajas and El Prat and 30 percent of the State Lottery. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, the Deputy Head of the Government supported, Elena Salgado, have with the help of former President Felipe Gonzalez criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible that the current crisis out beschwört. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How are these processes to understand? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is anticipated that Merkel's position is no fault of their public relations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the new definition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This Germany occupies a fundamentally new perspective to the design of our future, which is in conflict with the maintenance of the old traditions of the majority of its partners. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In view of the resistance in Europe to start three possible ways out of the crisis in Germany to spekuliern. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South would have to leave the euro area. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The second: The reintroduction of the German mark - although that currently more to science fiction sounds-, supported by a majority of public opinion, about 50% of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The third: A transformation of the euro in accordance with the German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict financial management; Punishment of countries that violate the requirements; möglichereweise the suspension of payments in some countries, as well as the extension of the costs of potential adaptation measures on the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is unique and stands out for some time. Therefore, there are now no excuses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission incentives made for deficits and the German Government is moved a constitutional reform from the sleeves to prevent this from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This was the first sign of the divergence between what was Germany necessary (strict control plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second character was the Central European country as Merkel painful went the decision to save Greece. </seg>
<seg id="18"> At the time that was strongly criticized. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the public opinion absolutely against a rescue of Greece were. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally, Merkel comes out in the last days of October with a distinct location. You calls for a reform of the European Union agreements to allow the rescue of a country and to commit the private lenders at the same time, to take a share of the cost. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position has been designed as anti-European because she drove the Ireland crisis and all following. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But their proposal if something sweetened, was adopted. In the next few months, we will take part in the reform of the European Union aimed at these measures as from 2013. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has drawn a red line, which intends not to exceed it. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It says all that - although now infamous - measures are no longer is there the old workings of the euro after this date. </seg>
<seg id="24"> 2013 will be the year of birth of a new area, where the offending countries be punished hard, may be forced to do so, to declare insolvent and in this case, the private sector must assume part of the costs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows US that we must, take a hard course of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improving the productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it was mentioned by Spain in boom times, will simply not be tolerated. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would do bad to understand it. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not just a question, up to three percent by 2013 down up the budget deficit. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much harder. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, is to deceive ourselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the current turmoil in more peace move. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And that we will use the opportunities offered to us by spring 2013. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero has also understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies on Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, Establishing order in the House, their way is has. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But the red line drawn by Germany is here, and it looks not like that because something would change. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Among the possibilities under consideration, which is that we would have to leave the euro area crowded with little serious countries, cannot be ruled out. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In this case Germany could tell US still, it had warned us. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Sports and rule bypass </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tricks such as those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to circumvent a sanction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The exclusion anti-Strasbourg allegedly by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game by 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League meant that much ink, it was shed, whether a unsportliche Act or not was and whether any both players should be sanctioned by UEFA. </seg>
<seg id="4"> As is well known, lost two players time a few minutes before the end of the game (your team had already clearly won), and played several fouls, so that the referee showed them the second yellow card. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way, and since Real Madrid lead his group would, be the two players meet the prescribed penalty for the next League match against the Auxerre and go into the next stage without cards. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Finally, the Disziplinarkommitee of the UEFA punished the coach of the Club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but followed in this sport rules. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of the arisen debate to the case goes to back, that a team of football club Real Madrid (who in his hymn claims of nobility and honor and had punished his players for similar incidents elsewhere) it played the leading role, and on the dramatization by Mourinho, more to its long history as a theatrical and provocative technician has added an episode. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case the debate is about, whether this behavior prohibited expressly authorized by the articles of Association contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a rule bypass. Actually, adheres to the rules of sport this approach, but seem the meaning to get around. </seg>
<seg id="11"> On this occasion he should undergo damage the sporting spirit. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that has not been jeopardised by these acts because there was no aggressive play. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the offending player to take unjustified advantage from the opposing team. This did not happen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradox of the plot of the players of Real Madrid is that it is not what we usually see cheating or understand rule bypass for the circumvention of the rule was not secretly carried out to avoid a penalty, but it should be so striking as possible, so that she will be punished by the referee. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players waited and happy accepted the sanction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is what kind of advantage moved the offender from the intentional fouls. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Here should be that the rival is not brought in a less favourable position or such benefits for the played game highlights were, for the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to play with less players. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because then, the Club does not have these players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The advantage is obviously that the players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a long term, up to a certain degree of uncertain benefit, because the team could leave eventually. Also, the players use this procedure to receive a sanction and go over in the second cycle of the card, in which they leave due to accumulation of card with a card less than in the first cycle. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Thus, it is not so clear whether it is really an advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Ultimately, such practices are directed not against the sporting spirit, to which strategic decisions belong, to draw a maximum benefit from the provisions. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case the player wanted to avoid any sanction (that would be a clear case of rule bypass actually), they wanted to choose more when they are this subject. </seg>
<seg id="24"> You made a strategic decision without avoid a punishment or to escape from it. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Although the line between creativity and control environment is, I believe that it is on this occasion a clear case of ingenuity. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the polemic arose as a result of two factors: because it went to two self exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked rule transmission. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The damage caused by these actions the principles of sport is less ethical than rather aesthetic art. </seg>

<seg id="7"> Following risks enumerates the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones, the Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W.

<p>
<seg id="3"> Interpol emits a red warning to the tracking and discovery of Assange. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Everything that is related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complex labyrinth in which the issues can be difficult to clear up. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Yesterday, a "red alert" for the "discovery and prosecution" of Assange was from Interpol. </seg>
<seg id="6"> However it is not to a traditional arrangement on the arrest. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In addition, it is not new, she came from 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It has to do anything with the recent unveiling of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse, which the Australians must face in Sweden. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It also assures the Attorney of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "The police knew where and how she can get in touch with Mr Assange." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Already on 20, the international police agency based in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden was from the arrangement, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the power by the Swedish authorities. </seg>
<seg id="11"> As things stand. The 188 Interpol countries depend to identify Assange and locate "to arrest him for the time being and to deliver." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Although Interpol may not order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many Member States consider the red warning according to the Organization as a carte blanche for a Arrestierung - that - be required by the national police in particular, if they have a bilateral extradition treaty, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is probably resident. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The action outraged Assanges lawyers, who published a letter gesture, in which they informed it that the 39 founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by videoconference. </seg>
<seg id="14"> You also remind that Assange requested after departure from Sweden and received the permission of the Prosecutor, compared with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Chief of security of Stalin. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "This is like a hunting, not as a legal prosecution," is charged in the letter. </seg>

<seg id="17"> On Monday, he gave a time via Skype from an undetermined location the head of the magazine interview. During the conversation, he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "If it can be shown that she was responsible for the arrangement North American diplomats spy on the United Nations and international agreements signed by the United States that has failed, she would have to resign," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> His mind was sentenced yesterday by the White House, Robert Gibbs, Press Secretary, described the request for withdrawal as "ridiculous and absurd." </seg>
<seg id="20"> "I am me why we should attach importance to the opinion of a type that has a Web site not sure," he told the channel CNN. </seg>

<seg id="23"> Congressman Peter King, who will lead the Chairman of the national Sicherheitskommitee of the House of representatives from January, has prompted the State Department to study the possibility, on the list of terrorist organisations to put Wikileaks "in order to seize the money and anyone who supports or contributes to pursue." </seg>

<seg id="5"> The party is aware that his resignation not enough the allies of the former party of Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is now so weakened as her mentor itself and not same headaches will give him like other former trends. </seg>
<seg id="6"> That is why the leader of Esquerra trying with a wink to win the new critics, which would secure his position until the next local elections. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Carod demand allies of the President, to make his Office as only the party. An insufficient gesture since Puigcercós controlled the supreme body of the congresses. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But because they do not have a sufficient majority to the promotion of resignations, they will schedule a process plan from now with the Executive Board until May. </seg>
<seg id="14"> For them, expect to working on a document of strategic reorientation that the line on 18 will present to the Council to vote to be able to participate. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Their intention is to guarantee Puigcercós. On the other hand this to promise, bring forward the Congress in the fall of 2011, which already holds the party leadership for a fact. </seg>

<seg id="17"> In this sense, the article-in-Office Conseller Josep Huguet signed on his blog, is symptomatic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In view of this, which is an ideologist Puigcercos, the owner of Innovació held it for a fact that the leader "in exchange for various objectives" was backed up. </seg>
<seg id="19"> He was on five, of which two are in the foreground are. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hydro-Québec has granted $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project in mutual agreement project planning companies. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium is consisting of from the company BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, that the most important part, which received the project management, to a total of $295 million no-bid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This consortium, called was "Énergie gérance," 2004 as a side effect of the decision by Hydro-Québec, the private sector made their responsibility to deliver, this important hydroelectric project amounting to a sum of $5 billion. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In early 2005 the Consortium earned the lucrative contract "Énergie gérance," without that there had been a public call for tenders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For the Parti Québécois, accessing consortia represents a serious ethical problem that evokes the risk of competition of displacement manure, as well as a price increase. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "This is a new way of abgekarteten game and ruled out the competition." </seg>
<seg id="8"> "This means that to perform out now instead of fix games instead of in a secret way in open form," said Sylvain Simard, a member of the PQ, at the press conference yesterday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the early morning, Simard had raised the issue before the National Assembly, because it seems it hard to understand, as the interest of the public in this way can be used. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon by she has vehemently denied that it itself would have been in this Treaty a stitch. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "I remain faithful to my line," she ranted by she encouraged, the PQ was "dishonestly" approach, and it "lack her of hardness." </seg>
<seg id="12"> She said it was"the least" that the PQ is sorry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The model of the Consortium is a worldwide practice. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is usually a time such temporary Alliance, which allows two or more companies to pool their expertise regarding a bid on a tender for a complex project. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The project "Eastmain" reveals a high level of complexity in the extent of his work. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The construction process is underway and should be set up by 2012. </seg>
<seg id="17"> However, the contract was awarded without having had a competition to take place; There had already been negotiations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In addition, the model of the Consortium in the Quebec even with relatively simple projects no longer represents an exception. </seg>
<seg id="19"> As the newspaper last week noted "Le Devoir," the model applied in the engineering and consulting services of the Consortium is the subject of government investigations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> A brief scan of Québec of business register allows to call more than 200 consortia of which some of constant duration appear to be. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In this way, for example, the company Dessau in partnership works with the majority of their core competitors, which include CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Any link, and of which there are several dozen, traces back to one and the same legal entity, namely to Dessau. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The Consortium "Énergie gérance" terms, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James of a special labour force dynamics is subject to and that Hydro-Québec account pays this fact since the 1970s in a special way." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Real Laporte, the large employer of the Société d ' énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a declaration, that the nose of the fact pucker up have, that the contract for the project management was approved by Convention. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "If you make a call for tenders and there are only a few candidates, your prices will be fast." </seg>
<seg id="26"> "You have two options: either you take the people that are on this Mart and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price." </seg>
<seg id="27"> "The idea is that not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people,," Laporte confirmed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> This "Énergie gérance" approved the consortium agreement is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti québécois. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The contracts were approved either by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project. </seg>

<seg id="4"> It is a pity, although it bathes in a media universe, where it only so teeming with information in favour of more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain, a deficiency which is known as brake its commitment, as the first reading, which was held yesterday. </seg>

<seg id="6"> Two-thirds of Quebecers are people, indeed to believe nor the commitment to the environment of companies such as the Green corporate advertising, so the meter of the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke sophisticated reveals. </seg>

<seg id="8"> After the same pattern of the discourse of politicians is taken population seriously documents only 14.6% of Quebecers. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="9"> The information with regard to responsible consumption seems nevertheless important for the stimulation of this consumer segment that is currently animated consumers by approximately only one-third of Quebecers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In fact, emptiness and dubious nature of the information slowed down the zeal of 46% of consumers. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is the second, identified by the barometer brake after the higher price of the products. </seg>

<seg id="2"> To participate in the Quebec Government, which by the Société Angus and parallel was prompted the company to financially in the takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The developer company of Angus as well as parallel, that a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of culture for the transfer of Daniel Langlois, cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard St. Laurent had hoped for the company, to deliver it again his actual cinematic function, apparently did not get what they have requested. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Although, the Government has accepted to involve themselves, but on their own terms on this matter. </seg>
</p>
<p>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new American diplomatic cables, which were sent out by WikiLeaks, reveal the secret of what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of Canadians towards the Americans believe; they expose but latter the sense of superiority with the same blow to Canada. </seg>
<seg id="3"> As a result the American diplomats in are surprised that the Canadian voters at the ballot has not the Canadian American relations in the sense, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the Conservative Government to enforce its budget of 2009! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were sent out yesterday publicly, offer even more spicy details as the mere substantial content, where one has to nibble. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Connect dating from September 22, 2008, i.e. during the period in which the Federal package of election campaign in full swing was located, reported from what point the United Nations is no longer participate in the operations discussed by their political bosses. </seg>
<seg id="6"> To the surprise of David Wilkins, in Ottawa, American Ambassador. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Mr Wilkins offers various policy options to this situation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "An inferiority complex almost intrinsic the Canadians requires Canadian, political leaders, much more likely causes may, to speak, as the United States in this election lay the Black Peter (such as 1988 in the campaign of the free trade) inner issues of everyday life," as he describes. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The United Nations, so he concludes is thus "the proverbial Goliath in this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of him." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The Ambassador is the less this "deafening silence," since the two countries have intensive political and economic relations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Logically," he rated "it so should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and even more a party leaders to drive a such essential relationship, which has the voters at the polls as a key factor in the sense." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The other term in this sense of importance reads in the communication sent from Terry Breese, Chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, on 22 January 2009, that President Barack Obama to prepare for his first visit to Ottawa. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Her trip will help to ensure the survival of the Government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget, where Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, originated due to a Belebungsprogrammes of 30 to 40 billion dollars in early February," describes Breese. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Nowhere, he had mentioned that the Government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas, to prevent that the Parliament would overthrown by the coalition and the as conditional survival of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed recovery programme. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Another, from January 2008 dating and communication on the part of Ambassador Wilkins wrote notified Washington of the growing increasingly negative image that the broadcast of CBC, dramatic series of the United States spread. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Ambassador is concerned about shows like border little Mosque on the Prairie, intelligence and H2O, where you can watch little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "No. fly list," or even contributions for the purpose of by Muskelprotze of the CIA of carried out interrogations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Again, another message extensively reported how Hillary Clinten have asked for their French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting, whether Europe is willing to include certain prisoners from Guantanamo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Mr Kouchner to the question with Yes answered have, but on the basis of an individual "case to case" - decision. </seg>
<seg id="19"> At the end of the meeting, so described, "has he given the Secretary of State a paper in terms of Omar Khadr, a 15-year old Muslims of Canadian origin." </seg>
<seg id="20"> "The Secretary of State has promised again to see the file." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> We finally add to heat up in the minds with regard to the website of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Tom Flanagan, a consultant very closely related old and Stephen Harper, had stated on CBC, that those responsible for this massive leak "should be killed." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Global plan for the renewal of the lighting </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The UN has proposed yesterday a plan for the renewal of the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in terms of achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (CFC) in Cancun, which is almost one-third of the additional reduction must be implemented, to stabilize the Earth's climate by 2020. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This ambitious plan takes up his position in the steps of the concrete projects which implement the United Nations in Cancun hopes to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments of developed countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to the plan yesterday expressed the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (GT) of CFCs votes due to the lighting on the Earth would be avoided if the incandescent bulbs, which has a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, by fluorescent or better yet, would be replaced by light-emitting diodes (LED). </seg>
<seg id="5"> Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This corresponds to the equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the worldwide fleet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In Copenhagen the large exhaust issuers such as the United States, China, Europe, and others, which was also Canada, had committed last year to voluntary reduction plans, which should reduce the global CFC emissions of 53 gt on 49 gt. </seg>
<seg id="8"> From this balance sheet, you would have to deduct still 5 GT today by the year 2020 to stabilize the climate increase to 2 degrees Celsius, to make sure that this gets out of control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> 95% Of the energy in the form of heat escapes in the incandescent bulbs, and the remaining 5% produce the light. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Reduce the energy consumption by 75% with the compact fluorescent bulbs, with the new LED light bulbs, you reduce this energy again to twice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The compact fluorescent bulbs keep on average between 6000 to 10,000 hours. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The new LED light bulbs, as for example those which the manufacturer of Philips has brought this week on the market - this company has by the way in the UN study competition - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives a hint of the savings of the Auswechselung plan, which should be applied in 100 countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> In addition to the fact that hese completely new light bulbs make only very little heat, they can work with a variable resistors. </seg>
<seg id="14"> And they contain no mercury. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury, and that you therefore must dispose it as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except the producers provide a reception. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The main source of mercury emissions on the planet is the report, but as not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather to the coal plants that emit much more mercury, the electricity wasted by the incandescent bulbs produce. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Alone in the United States, these coal plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The report sets out in detail the profits, which would generate each country thanks to this international program. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Indonesia would cut such as a billion dollars a year to buy electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which corresponds to an equivalent of 3.5 coal, whose building 2.5 billion would cost Indonesia. </seg>

<seg id="3"> One thing is certain: the output of the discipline of the FIFA 2018 will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold, (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain Portugal, Netherlands Belgium). </seg>
</p>

<seg id="5"> On Tuesday in any case, the gap would have been his record of 210 basis points with German interest rates and the prices of the contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy were increased to 263 points, which had caused a certain Gysi in Rome. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out that the discrepancy of Spain to the German interest rates is located at 400 basis points at its Council of Ministers. </seg>
<seg id="7"> His right-hand man, Gianni Letta, expressed as "seriously concerned" by the "market disruptions" and a possible risk of infection from the direction of Ireland. </seg>

<seg id="15"> "If necessary, new cost-cutting measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At the time, Italy receives the support of international institutions. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and his accounts are regulated, we repeat already for a long time," assured Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, which is in charge the IMF with Italy. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "At the moment there are no problems, not to short-term to long-term point of view, because of Italy despite his high level of debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. i. R.) calls for lower stabilization progress than from other countries," observed Pier Carlo Padoan, Chief Economist of the OECD. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The question remains after the political discontinuity. </seg>
<seg id="20"> On 14 December Silvio Berlusconi will face is a motion of censure of the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of those who preferred end of March could be organised elections. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Since the debate about the modernisation of the transport industry on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it's raining billions. </seg>
<seg id="3"> At least in the discussions. </seg>
<seg id="4"> One Paris call in particular the 23 billion for the Metro Grand is in memory, the of the Société du Grand Paris to be built. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> To direct the construction of the SSP in the way, the State has declared a capital endowment of EUR 4 billion. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum which would then allow the SGP to give a part of the financial value to her twice on the markets. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Today, it has finally come to first projections. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The supplementary budget by 2010, this morning revised by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly, contains the measures, to raise the first part of this money. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It concerns two different operations: the creation of a special tax to the Erschließund and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The former, so it takes article 15 of the draft of the law, is "in favour of the public institution of Société du Grand Paris." </seg>
<seg id="11"> It is estimated: "The product of this tax amounted to 117 million euros per year." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Cities is a restructuring of existing business taxation: "to modernise it, the resulting from her product to increase and this increase of the Société du Grand Paris to deliver." </seg>
<seg id="13"> How much would this bring? </seg>
<seg id="14"> A mystery. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This sum is not in the text. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> It is far from the 4 billion. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "It is running, that the fiscal resources to the EUR 4 billion of the capital amount available is added, which are applied by the State and the Société du Grand Paris and be done for the project," is available in the explanatory statement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> At of the SSP, you will find this system not offensive. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "From the moment in which it recorded revenue (the two taxes, d. R.), you can cover the designing for over three years and then draw from the 4 billion," as explains. </seg>
<seg id="20"> "This is recorded in the budget and deducted gradually." </seg>
<seg id="21"> The SGP estimated that 2013 will be started 2014 to record the 4 billion for the budget. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> This measure, the 4 promised billions to is long can seek runs risk of provoking a very moving, parliamentary discussion. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The first public meeting will take place on 7 December. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Vengeful hacker and bustling spies </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The WikiLeaks affair has a double meaning. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On one side has a scandal that only a scandal in the sinner is hypocrisy that governs the Beziehunge between the States, the citizens and the press emerges it as obvious scandal. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand, announces major changes at the international level, and a foretaste of the future dominated by regression. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But we go in order. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each created by a secret service file (of any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper clippings. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary," American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi's throw from nothing more than that which it across anyway to read got months in every x any journal (except those owned by Berlusconi), and the terrifying karikaturierte profile of Gaddafi's offered substance cabaret artists already for a long time for their skits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule according to which the secret dossiers may consist only of already known news, is not only essential to the dynamics of the intelligence services, and that in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le Château, the Knights Templar or the Rosenkreuzler) exactly repeated that what was already written in previous works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is not only the fact, that the author of occult texts will publish any research (yet because he does not know where would be the non-Existierende news to find), but because those devoted to the occult, believe in nothing other than the, what they already know and confirmed what they have already learned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the mechanism of success by Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Just as the secret files. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informant is lazy and lazy (or limited mind) also the head of intelligence is (otherwise he could what ever, for example, editor of Liberation), which considered only as true what he recognises. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The secret details of Berlusconi, who the State Department had sent the American Embassy in Rome, were the same as those that already the week before had published in Newsweek. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> So why was made such a fuss to the revelations of this dossier? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On a page say that what already know every educated person, and that the messages - at least since end of World War II and since the Government each other can call himself or an airplane can take to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and to , with the exception of some small representation tasks, in espionage Centers transforms have. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Any any spectator of discovery films knows this very well, and it is not from hypocrisy, that to do so, to ignore this. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Still, the fact to repeat it publicly violated the task of the hypocrisy and serves to put the American diplomacy in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Secondly: The idea that a x any hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world, is the significant blow to the prestige of the State Department. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Also the scandal of less brings the victims, as rather the "executioner" in distress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But, we devote ourselves to the profound nature of what happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Formerly, Orwell's time, you could combine all power like a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwell's prophecy could have since then quite rightly point out that, where you can control each movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, visited hotel, the selected motorway and so on; the citizens would become the total victims of the eye of power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> If you are but do in mind, what's going on today, that even the secret Crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, so the tour ceases to be on one side and is circle-shaped. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power controlled every citizen, but everyone, or at least the hacker - chosen as the Avenger of the citizen-, can bring the secrets of the power in experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> How can a power adhere but, that is no longer able to maintain their own secrets? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is true, Georg Simmel said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty mystery may never be revealed); It is also true that any knowledge of the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's basically free is a mystery of mysteries, because it reveals the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks disclose that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means any power to rob them. </seg>
<seg id="28"> WikiLeaks Merkel or Sarkozy did wrong, however, but Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The consequences of this insult be what, which was added a so huge power? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the States in the future will provide more online no reserved information - this would amount to a poster glued on the street corner. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is also apparent that it is in vain with the current technologies to hope, to be able to keep secret confidential reports via telephone. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of State is moving in a plane and has contacted one of his colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could private and only for certain ears relations are maintained in the future? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I am well aware that my prediction for science fiction and romanhaft sounds at the moment, but I feel this compelled to introduce the Government agents to me moving actively to uncontrollable routes in a secret way, carrying their messages anywhere else than in the mere memory to, and also hiding the little written information which they have received, in the Schuhabsatz. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically, the espionage trial of Watergate had to had less success than WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity to write that the technology is progressing today like a cancer, namely backwards. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionized the communication, reconstructed a Telegraph (telephone) wire to the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The (analog) video cassettes had allows the film researchers, spotting a movie band for band by from behind forward fast and reveal all secrets of the Assembly could, while the (numeric) CDs enable today nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter, so in macro portions. </seg>
<seg id="39"> With the high-speed trains, you drive three hours from Rome to Milan, whereas this requires three and a half hours by air including the transfers. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It is therefore not unusual that policy and communications return on car and horse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> A final observation. </seg>
<seg id="42"> In the past she tried to understand press, which were forged for secrets between the messages. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Currently, there are the messages that ask for sensitive information by the press. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Climate: its promise of financial schönredet such as France </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time, compliance with the promise of funding quickly dissolved (also called "Fast Start" or anticipated funding) to investigate, which have been realized by the developing countries. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And already the rough French blandishments are revealed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With the Copenhagen Treaty developing countries are committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The EU has pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France 1.26 billion euro (i.e. 420 million per year). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On the occasion of the opening of the COP16 the EU has pulled all the stops to convince its partners of the fact of their commitment with regard to the fast-start financing: detailed procedure report by its Member States, press conference, large side events, brochure distribution. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The operation of transparency is appreciated for its actual value remarkably and grade: the developing countries and civil society would it like if all developed countries did the same on the same level of precision. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The EU announced to have released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, which takes them on the right track to the respect be Zollung of their commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you look in detail but, things are a little more complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should be "new and additional" according to the Copenhagen Treaty, to ensure that bet was introduced, without detriment to the detriment of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what "new and additional" means. </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the Commission proposed harmonising, certain Member States, including France, blocked the process. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today, everyone chooses the indicative amount, which he considered to be the best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those of the year 2009 chosen: the international finance are retained, and are included in connection with the financing of "Fast Start" for over three years 150 million. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries have chosen similar values, either with regard to year or conditions at the level of official development assistance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> On the other hand France of think was that the financing "all new projects" of 2010 are "new and additional." </seg>
<seg id="17"> In other words: there are no values on the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of official development assistance. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Specifically said can the total of the French support of the developing countries remain stable (or also lose weight) - France pretends to comply with its commitment to the "new and additional" financing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> An another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Furthermore, there is no rule, and each selects his calculation mode. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, such as, for example, France, are borrowed £ 1 as € donated equivalent with 1. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Obviously, it is difficult do so: the trouble is not the same. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use can be justified by loans for certain profitable investments (projects often bound to the control of emissions, based on effective technology), it is deceptive to introduce the euro, which is recognised as equivalent for a donated euro... Also, only the cost of the loan for the country as a commitment should be counted (that is the equivalent of a rate of interest). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">  (Aber_Frankreich_hat_nichts_anders_indem_Sinne_als_die_folgende_Überlegung:_es_"respektiert"_seine_Verpflichtung_von_420_Millionen_Euro,_indem_es_91,5%_Darlehen_ (389,8_Millionen_Euro) accepts and donates 8.5%) 36.1 million euro) -see also the EU document, to convince yourself. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only EU country that uses loan to a great extent. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany calls 46% while engaged in Denmark, the Netherlands, or the Slovakia (among others) their obligations to 100% by donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends 1€ to fulfil their obligations, is France just 10 cents and is including a comparable use. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Beautiful mumbo jumbo! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> All in all operating France in its fast-start financing with a double fraud: a part with a Weiterentwicklkung of the action of time and partly with the reality of the use of financial. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France succeed to be that it has spent millions in accordance with his promise of 420 million "new and additional" believe and this saves 36.1 million euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the Treasury (since it seems probably that it was Bercy conducted the arbitrage) could result in a double negative effect; Once EU-internal (why the other Member States with the donations, if go there but enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries be... so not completely fooled </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter of the early financing just a small question on relatively short time compared to the overall discussions on the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it could be the drop too much in the huge machine of the UNFCCC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Let us hope that this will be not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Whatever is the, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year of early financing. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In the first place France could announce 2011 and 2012 a change in its update type for the year, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and the retributive justice with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> But above all France could bring the discussions on the subject of the dispute of the long-term financing to the front (an another, crucial and currently-debated topic): not one escapes the question of the "reverse accountability" or the update type of its loans. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could change its position, to be as progressive with regard to the dispute, as is that with other things. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The hope is so based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive next week in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Naturally, a surprising announcement about the fast start of France and his vision of the "reverse accountability," as well as the use of loans would raise the international trust which is necessary for further discussions. </seg>

<seg id="2"> A child of 10 years is 81 different chemical substances throughout the day, this Wednesday so a published by the Association Générations of futures (former movement for the protection of the rights and the respect of future generations) study. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Association, which declared that their results "given the small number of analysed samples play a statistically significant value, but represent illustration nature of the treated problems," had that between July and September usually within four, by a roughly ten-year child meals consumed bought food plus a snack in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and Obstteilen, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water a day, as well as sweets of laboratories looking for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants examined. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The balance sheet of plate is devastating: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as possibly or probably carcinogenic classified and five karziogen certain classified, as well as 37 substances with Endokrinin disruptive factor, according to studies of several institutions such as, for example, the International Cancer Research Center. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "Even if in the near totality of the cases the legal limits for each chemical, individually consumed substance not be exceeded, so you take this survey but very well, that the reality in which is suspended the consumer may be carcinogens or substances with Endokrinin disruptive factor"," Is worrying," the Association noted. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> At the dinner was the salmon steak with 34 identified, chemical residues on the "reichhaltigsten," and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unloaded. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The final risk of this "pollutant cocktails" for the consumer "is probably underestimated," according to the study. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> In turn, the "Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts" (EE-LV) has proposed "given the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "increase in civilisation diseases." </seg>
