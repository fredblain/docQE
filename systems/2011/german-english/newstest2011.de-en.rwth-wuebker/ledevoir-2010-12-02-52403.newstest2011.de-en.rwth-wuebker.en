The secret of komplexgeschüttelten Canada lifted 
The new, American diplomats, who were told by Wiki Leaks, open up about what the United Nations under the Minderwertigkeitskomplex the Canadians to the Americans, however, with the same blow the mixing of the latter to Canada. 
Consequently, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters at the ballot kanadisch American relations in the spirit, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government to enforce its budget by 2009. 
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were told yesterday, offer more juicy details as the substantive content, in which the very people. 
One of 22 September 2008 carved, i.e. in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage in full swing, reported, which do not join the United Nations more of their political leaders discussed operations. 
To the astonishment of David Wilkins, in Ottawa, the American ambassador. 
Mr Wilkins offers a variety of channels this situation. 
"The Canadians led to an almost innewohnender Minderwertigkeitskomplex, perhaps the Canadian political leaders have much to talk about the issues of everyday life, as the United States in this election the can (as in 1988 when the campaign on free trade) ," he says. 
The United Nations, he concludes, is "the proverbial Goliath this election: omnipresent, but potentially threatening to speak of him". 
The ambassador understands the "deafening silence" the less, since the two countries have close political and economic relations. 
"Logically ," he assessed," it should be the ability of a candidate of a party, and much more of a party leaders for holding such a crucial relationship, which has in the polls as a key factor in the spirit. " 
The other, this sense of importance is in on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, broadcast, communication is to prepare the President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa. 
"Their trip will help ensure the continuation of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget in early February, which will give Canada its first deficit after more than a decade known, which is due to a recovery program in the 30 to 40 billion dollars ," describes Breese. 
Nowhere did he mentioned that the government's parliamentary session before Christmas had to be postponed, so that Parliament would be overthrown by the coalition and would be the case with the opposition parties on the quality of the proposed recovery programme. 
Further, in January 2008 and carved from the ambassador Wilkins written communication Washington from the increasingly negative image that the broadcast on CBC, dramatic series by the United States. 
The ambassador is worried about programmes such as Border, Mosque calls on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly" list can observe or payments for the purposes of Muskelprotze of CIA interrogations. 
Yet another communication widely reported, as asked Hillary Clinton in her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting on whether Europe is prepared to accept some detainees from Guantanamo. 
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question, however, on the basis of an individual "case by case" decision. 
Àm at the end of the meeting, described as ", he has given the state secretary a paper on Khadr Omar, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslims. " 
"The Secretary of State has pledged to look through the acts again". 
Finally, we note that Discussions passions on the Web site Wiki Leaks. 
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very closely related adviser, declared on CBC that the people responsible for this massive leak "should be killed". 
He had talked to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
