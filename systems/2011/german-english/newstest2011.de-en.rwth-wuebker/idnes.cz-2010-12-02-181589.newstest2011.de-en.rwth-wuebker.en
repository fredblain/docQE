The army has so many detonators that could umwickeln quite the Czech Republic, but only two years 
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometres detonators, detonated with bombs. 
In the previous year had supplied the Ministry of Defence, 224 kilometres but because of the army camp. 
It is reassuring to know that ausgesorgt the armed forces for 225 years. 
The problem is the durability of the detonators - two, but no more than four years. 
The army bought the detonators of the Company STV Group, for example, mere 40 million kroner. 
In his explanatory statement for the purchase of this huge amount, but because of the General Staff MF DNES, the soldiers would consume annually, but because of the 60 kilometres. 
Research by the army Pyrotechnikern, according to the MF raised DNES, comes from the fact that the army is a very intensive pyrotechnic education - by all the generals and officers of the army commandos, to the secretaries and women. 
The defense minister Alexandr Vondra and army General Vlastimil Picek. 
This is the only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres Zündschnüren halfway. 
The length of calls for 25.000 Detonationen. 
But it also would extend this army stocks for more than ten years. 
But if the old rule of experts that are sufficient for the training of each new professional soldiers two metres but because completely, then the army by these Neueinkäufe - in the light of the increased needs of pioneering and special forces - created a reassuring stock for the already mentioned in 225 years. 
The soldiers complained of Schnelleinsatzbrigade recently at the Defense Minister Vondra, they had almost no cartridges for small arms, so that more are almost certainly being restricted because of the lack of funds. 
Not to mention the lack of trousers. 
"I am not a, why they buy from us such huge detonators." 
But that is their decision, they will know that what they need them. " 
"For us, the army has been a good customer, we want to get as much as possible against traffickers ," says the manager of the STV Group Děcký Jan. 
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence will present the purchase of hundreds of kilometres, but because the army had been so for at least ten years with this "ammunition" eingedeckt. 
Jan Děcký from the STV Group speaks only of the duration of the four-year utility detonators and police and army Pyrotechniker only two years. 
"The perfect storage are also mentioned in the four years of", one of them, which wants to remain unnamed, but not as a soldier accused the criticism of the army. 
After the expiry of the duration of use must be tested thoroughly any ammunition, whether it is reliable and does not threaten the lives of the soldiers. 
These tests are not in vain, but cost more money. 
Another argument of the Defense Department is the amount of the rebate for 445 km but because. 
"It cost us sixty percent less than the letztjährige delivery of 244 kilometres ," says spokesman Pejšek the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence. 
Only by way of comparison, the annual consumption of Zündschnüren by the police, Pyrotechnikern liquidate the munitions from the Second World War or the Soviet army's brother, a few years, barely 1.500 metres. 
And the police are always such quantities of ammunition, which they can use up before the end of the utility. 
The safety of the Pyrotechniker because, in addition, we have the opportunity to flexible purchases more modern and reliable detonators. 
The Ministry of Defence has huge problems relating to the winding-up of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty, when preparing the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak People's Army on their campaign on the Rhine. 
According to the Pyrotechnikern, raised the MF DNES, expects the Czech armed forces in a few years ago, the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old detonators, which today as "good" has bought.
