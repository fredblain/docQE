The 2018-2022 World Cup, FIFA appoints the Olympic Games 
In a corruption suspect appoints the executive committee of FIFA on Thursday the host countries in the world championships in 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice, in which the Rangeln for influence and threaten to push the lobbying the technical criteria in the background. 
One thing is certain: the 2018 edition of the grasp of the FIFA is in Europe, its traditional stronghold, (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands). 
The 2022 edition will be something exotic; hopes the International Football Federation, after the first of its kind on the African continent in 2010 new countries (Australia, Qatar) win for himself, or his office in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to pursue. 
The list of personalities, the delegation of (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Prime Minister, Zidane, Beck mothballed, Cruyff) is the degree of economic and political use of a world championship. 
The machinations behind the scenes are threatening to hold until the last minute. 
Otherwise, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy of the candidates. 
After the evaluation report of FIFA, English, Spanish, Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts bessseren arguments than their competitors. 
But these considerations will not be for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees at the election so important. 
The Sunday Times, the achievement of the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) was at the beginning of the revelations, as well as opportunities for their own country, the cradle of football, can ruin, which was allowed to carry only once the World Cup, in 1966. 
The BBC had given the ground again on Monday, when they had broadcast a documentary report, the three senior members of the Kommitees, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz Issa and Hayatou under fire. 
Reason enough to upset the FIFA and the leaders in English, which had operated primarily with David Cameron over the last few weeks, an intensive lobbying. 
The head of government hopes for a repeat of his predecessor Tony Blair successful chess train, which was made in 2005 for the organisation of the London 2012 Olympic Games. 
This would be sufficient intensive use, to enhance the image of England before the Committee? 
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain Portugal does not lack assets with its already finished stadiums, his expertise (82 World Cup in Spain, the Olympic Games in Barcelona in 92, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and his football culture. 
But the economic and financial drawbacks of the two countries could dampen their ambitions. 
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, the chances of Russia, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become the weighty outsiders, rise. 
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided, however, the unumwundenen suggestion to the Bezichtigungen the English press "unfair competition in the run-up to the vote" denounced by the Committee members. 
"We bewirft it with dirt, they are trying to embarrass them ," Putin railing. 
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, to be the logical favourites. 
First world economic power, FIFA headquarters of the main sponsors, the country seems a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up separately on a very good project. 
But these new nominations seem premature for two countries that had co-organised the competitions in 2002. 
Another threat: the FIFA are eagerly awaiting approval of the 2026 World Cup in China, the Asian opportunities to 2022 lapses. 
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn with the leaders futuristischer stadiums out all the stops, FIFA their expansion in the direction of new areas, however, these two countries a greater risk, for sure. 
Australia might as well as Japan and South Korea among the European countries akquittierten weakness of television rights (due to the time delay) suffer, the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
