To hell, warrior! 
Splatter fits the art cinema? 
The director Nicolas Winding Refn testing with his fighters epic "Valhalla over there Rising" old genre borders. 
In the audience may have thought of the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn Valhalla over there, "Rising" has changed? 
A captured Vikings warriors with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) freed himself from his tormentors and with almost superhuman forces multitudes of his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody Action, precisely because it uses our hero like rough methods of killing and seized his enemies before the Gedärme from the vibrant, if he has a bad mood. 
On the other hand, says Einauge, as it is called, the film is not a word, and the other characters sought to succumb to a maximum of one or two sentences or a few agonizing death cries. 
Otherwise silent and feasted on the hill gruselig beautiful landscape of Scotland, the Vikings world of about a thousand years ago the scene. 
Ideal for adult Cineasten with interest for Existenzialismus and very serene camera. 
Well, if a film has several target groups, it is a shame, if they are mutually exclusive. 
Director Winding Refn applies since his wild and gestylten drug dealers trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically, his works with a little humor the mainstream or a little less brutality, Arthouse accessible. 
Most of the art cinema friends are likely to be deterred from around the spritzenden brain mass and the Gedärmen. 
The Action fans dying at the latest, boredom, if Einauge from freely suspensive reasons with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship is on his way to Jerusalem and trapped forever in a downturn and fog, before the team apparently in America and silent. 
No wonder, then, that "Rising Valhalla over there" has been found in Germany no cinema distribution and appeared only on DVD. 
This is particularly because of the magnificent images of a hangover, but also because it is hiding behind the façade of a blood-stained unpretentious and sometimes exciting piece of cinema, which deserves some attention. 
In this film is not about dialogues or a stringent action, it is all filmgewordener atmosphere, a fever dream. 
And there is no escape for the spectators. 
Refn give him barely a moment of relaxation and puts him with his icy images and the dark trance world Sound Track very slowly throat, but above all with the unspeakable hatred of him is from the heart of the characters. 
Only a small blonder boy, the Einauge faithful to one side, something like innocence, all others are driven by anger. 
The vast majority of the einäugige hero, whose motives, but the will of enemies and allies temporarily at some point the warriors from hell, perhaps to the ambassadors of the devil himself. 
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the Verdorbenen anyway. 
"Valhalla over there Rising" is a puzzling, the film can hate and admire, Ärgern, Aufregen and laughable.
