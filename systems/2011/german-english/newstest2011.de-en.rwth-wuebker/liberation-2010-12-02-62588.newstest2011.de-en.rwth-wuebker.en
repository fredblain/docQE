Rachsüchtige hackers is spies and 
The affair Wiki Leaks has a double meaning. 
On one side, it turns out the obvious scandal, a scandal, which is simply a scandal in the Sinner hypocrisy, the Beziehunge between states, the public and the press. 
On the other hand, it announces radical changes at international level, and gives a taste of the future dominated by regression. 
But we are moving in the right order. 
The first aspect of Wiki Leaks is the confirmation of the fact that any of the intelligence produced a file (x) any nation composed entirely of Zeitungsausschnitten. 
The "extraordinary ," American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi's throw anything more than what we had to read for months anyway in any particular x Journal (except for those whose owners Berlusconi), and the appalling karikaturierte Gaddafi's profile was Kabarettkünstlern already for a long time for their skits. 
The rule, not the secret files from previous news, is essential for the dynamism of the secret services, and not only in this century. 
If you go into a library dedicated esotherischen publications, you will see that each plant (the Grail, the mystery of Rennes le Chateau, the Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) exactly the repeated what has been written in previous works. 
This is not, therefore, that wants to publish the author occult texts (no research yet, therefore, that he did not know, not to turn to when news of the exist), but because those who dedicate themselves to the Okkultismus, nothing else than to believe what they know and have already confirmed what they have learned. 
This is also the best mechanism of Dan Brown. 
Similarly, the secret files. 
The informant is lazy, lazy and (or limited mental) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be, for example, editor of Libération), the only considers to be true, he acknowledges. 
The Top Secret information on Berlusconi, who had sent the U.S. embassy in Rome, the Staatsdezernat were the same as those who had already Newsweek published the week before. 
So why was made such a fuss about the revelations of this dossier? 
On one side, which stipulate that any educated person knows already that the messages - can call at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the Government each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of a few small representation tasks, have turned into espionage centres. 
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that acting to ignore it. 
Still, the fact to repeat it publicly, the task of hypocrisy and serves to put the American diplomacy in a bad light. 
Second: the idea that can tap a x any hackers geheimsten the secrets of the most powerful country in the world, poses a significant blow to the prestige of the Staatsdezernats. 
The scandal also produce fewer victims, rather than the "executioner". 
But we are of the profound nature of what has happened. 
Formerly, to Orwell's times, was able to concentrate all power as a Big Brother, every gesture of his subjects are controlled. 
Orwell's prophecy could prove as absolutely right, where you can monitor any movement, thanks to the telephone, making any transaction, visited the hotel, the motorway and so on; the citizens would become the victims of the eyes of the total power. 
But if you consider what is happening today that can escape, not even the secret Krypten the power of the control of a Hackers, listening to the control of, unilaterally and will zirkelförmig. 
The power to control every citizen, every citizen, or at least the hackers - acquired as avenger of the citizen - can bring the secrets of power. 
How can a power that is no longer able to maintain their own secrets? 
It is true, Georg Simmel said that is a real mystery a hollow secret (and a hollow secrecy can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's basically a secret free of Geheimis because it exposes the public sphere; to lay in the styles of Wiki Leaks openly that the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty secrets, means to deprive them of any power. 
Wiki Leaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Angela Merkel, but on the other hand, Clinton and Obama. 
What will be the consequences of this violation that has been inflicted on such a huge power? 
It is obvious that the states in the future no longer reserved for information online - which would amount to the street corner angeklebten posting. 
But it is also clear that, with the current technology is to be hoped in vain, to be able to keep confidential reports on the telephone. 
Nothing is easier than figuring out whether and when to move a head of state in a plane and has contacted one of his colleagues. 
How could be maintained in the future, and only to some ears certain relations? 
I know very well that my prediction sounds at the moment, science fiction and romanhaft, but I feel compelled me to imagine the government agents, in a secret way preoccupied with uncontrollable march routes, moving their communications anywhere else than the mere memory in order, and the few written information that they have, in the verbergend footwear sales. 
The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically has enjoyed the espionage attempt by Watergate less success than Wiki Leaks. 
I had the opportunity to write that the technology now like a cancer, backwards. 
A century after the Telegraph wireless communications, reconstructed the Internet with a Telegrafen (telephone wire). 
The video cassettes (analogue) had enabled the researchers film, a film auszukundschaften band for band by was able to lift it from behind, spulen and all the secrets of the assembly, while the numerical (CDs) allow nowadays is to jump from chapter to chapter, macro portions. 
With the high-speed trains you drive within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this requires by plane, including switching three and a half hours. 
It is not unusual that policy and communications technology on car and horse. 
One final observation. 
In earlier times tried to understand the press, which have been forged between the secrets of messages. 
Currently, the messages, the confidential information from the press.
