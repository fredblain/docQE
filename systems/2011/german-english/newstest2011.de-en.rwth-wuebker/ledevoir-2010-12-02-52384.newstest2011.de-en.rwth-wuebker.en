450 million in contracts without tender 
Hydro Quebec has approved by mutual agreement project planning firms $450 million in contracts for the hydroelectric project Eastmain- 1 A Sarcelle Rupert. 
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consisting of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, the most important, namely the project management, has received a total of $295 million without tender. 
The consortium, called "gérance Énergie", was 2004 as a side effect of the decision of Hydro Quebec, the private sector accountability, this important to entrust hydroelectric project amounting to a sum of $5 billion, formed. 
In early 2005, earned the consortium "gérance Énergie" the lucrative contract, without a public tender. 
For the Parti Québécois the embrace of business consortia a serious ethical problem, raising the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung and a price increase. 
"This is a new way of a conspiracy and refuted the competition." 
"That means that instead of taking fixes rather than on secret manner in an open manner ," said yesterday Simard Sylvain, representative of the PQ, at the press conference. 
Early in the morning Simard had raised the issue before the National Assembly, because it seems to him hard to understand how to serve the public's interest in this way. 
Ressourcenministerin Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon, when she vehemently denied that it had acted on this treaty is a stitch-up. 
"I stand by my line ," she railing, nourished by the PQ" dishonest ", and" lack of rigour ". 
She said that it was "the least" that the PQ apologize. 
The model of the consortium is common practice. 
It is usually a time such temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise in a bid to a tender for a complex project. 
The project "East Main" has a high level of complexity in terms of its labour scale. 
The construction is under way and should be drawn up until 2012. 
However, it has been awarded the contract without a competition could take place; it had already made in negotiations. 
Moreover, the model of the consortium in the Quebec even with relatively simple projects no longer an exception. 
As the newspaper Le Devoir "noted last week, is in a civil engineer and advisory system used model of the consortium of government investigations. 
A short screen of the Quebecer company register makes it possible to identify more than 200 consortia, of which appear to be of some duration consistent. 
In this way, for example, the company Dessau is working in partnership with the majority of its main competitors, CIMA +, Génivar, SNC lava Lin or Roche and Tecsult, together. 
Any link, and there are several dozen, at one and the same legal entity, namely Dessau. 
What the consortium "gérance Énergie", Normandeau minister stressed that "is subject to the territory of the Baie James special labour dynamics and that is Hydro Quebec this fact since the 70 s in a particular way '. 
Réal Laporte, the major employers of the Société d énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that the nose on the fact that frowning has approved the project led to agreement. 
"If you are an invitation to tender and there are few applicants, will your prices." 
"You have two options: either you do the people who are in this Walmart and saying you: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price." 
"The idea is, however, that is not the price, but the expertise of the people ," said Laporte. 
The consortium "Énergie gérance" approved contract is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50.000 of the Parti Québécois received $. 
The contracts were either approved by the Hydro Quebec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain- 1 A Sarcelle Rupert. 
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" more than 100 engineering and consultancy contracts, the companies or their subsidiaries including, in particular, laboratories, resources have been allocated between 2002 and March 2010. 
SNC lava Lin had tightened up 22 contracts per se, Génivar Tecsult had received 16, 14 and 10, Dessau without their participation in the "gérance Énergie" mitzurechnen. 
All of these contracts were negotiated. 
It is worth a total of $344 to 449 783, including the contract with "gérance Énergie" about $295 131 in 564. 
Sylvain Simard had indicated that the four firms, which make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM Axor) and the "libéral Parti du Quebec is well known ." 
Minister Normandeau had let it be known that PQ was also linked with the firms that they "funded" before they clarified that it was contrary to their executives.
