Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank us to make our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen, according to which the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably many times in the future, must make. 
The Bundesbank called for the lifting of the plan to buy government debt, as if they were ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. It should be maintained only an einwöchiger permanent access. 
After the crisis in Ireland, we expect that the current liquidity measures "until at least March" extended and maintain the quarterly contracts with unlimited access to the quarter end to ensure liquidity at least until June. 
We also expect that to continue the program to purchase bonds and will spend a means signal. 
If it does not meet the expectations created, discarded the reaction of the markets yesterday, and if halstarrig insists on the fact that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us! 
As with the ECB meeting in May, when the bank not to buy government debt securities and collapsed as a result, the markets could be repeated this story tomorrow.

The sum is estimated at about $10 000 million in the short term and possible further in 15 000. It is time to February, in order to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized. 
Although Ireland has lost its credibility, after it had failed to recognize the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures in the framework of the rescue plan acceptable and to reduce the uncertainty. 
However, the government next Tuesday's parliamentary approval for his new budget. Since it does not have the sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.

Today, there is a crucial auction of a three-year government bonds, which benefit from Trichet effect. That is why we are in a strong demand, which will remove all doubt about our ability to refinance. 
For Spain would be the application of an aid plan a self-sacrifice. 
We would receive liquidity, which we do not need. The Treasury has EUR 40 billion, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without notice. 
Nevertheless, should be in line with our strategy of the Caesar's wife: "Now is not only that, but also his appearances. " 
Only the courage, we create!
