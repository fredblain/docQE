Pilsner soil funds - arrests by the police at a public tender 
In the building of the soil in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police arrests in the last few days. 
It has been taken of the European media entrepreneurs and real estate brokers Luboš G. by the Detektiven in handcuffs. 
This allegedly tried to manipulate a just a public competition to the settlement of Restitutionsansprüchen so that Koštunica did the competition offered land a specific interests. 
This is said to have paid Luboš G. for half a million. 
"At this stage, I can only confirm that the police a person convicted of the crime of fraudulent practices in a public competition ," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner prosecutor of the newspaper," Právo more details could not provide them with regard to the ongoing investigations. 
24 hours later was released the 46-year-old entrepreneur from the police. 
How he was able to manipulate the public competition, we can speculate about the lack of official information. 
The spokeswoman of the land fund Lubomír Černá led to the question of Právo, the police have made in the Pilsner antenna of the land fund actually arrests and this during a public competition. 
"It was a client and nothing to do with one of our staff ," it was. 
The public competition had Mrs Černá, according to the correct name 'call for tenders of claims on the transfer of land in accordance with the law "and would take place in cases where bezeigen several applicants offered interest in the land. 
"These people are in the context of a higher value through the transfer to Restitutionsansprüche RAL, proclaimed as the land value." 
"In accordance with the requirements laid down the order of the potential acquirer, then gives the fund the land to the person with the highest offer ," said the spokeswoman of the fund. 
Luboš G. were apparently information, who had filed the request and because he was justified, since he had bought a number of Restitutionsansprüchen, he offered a real estate interests that he is withdrawing from the competition. 
Obviously, against a fat severance pay. 
That would also be a sufficient explanation as to why he had to arrest him such a large amount of money. 
Luboš G. had in the past too good contacts with the Pilsner soil. 
So he played in the issue of the former chief of the land fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted because he failed to substitute restitution of properties that have been passed already location decisions on construction projects. 
At the time Luboš G. acquired the land fund, for example, land intended to build public roads, more precisely, where was the construction of the access to the main route Borské pole industrial area. 
Later he exchanged this very favourably with the magistrate directly against a house in the historic centre of the city, which exceeded the value of the properties. 
The Kleinbeigeben City Hall had at that time, with a heavy heart, in order not to jeopardise the works by blocking the properties.
