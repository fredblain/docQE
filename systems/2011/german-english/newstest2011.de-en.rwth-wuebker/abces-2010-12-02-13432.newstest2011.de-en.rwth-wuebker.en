People's Party won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9 
With the results of 28 November, the PP in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona play a crucial role 
After the significant increase in Members' votes and the last regional elections, the PP is focusing on the general election - preferred or not. Their expectations are more positive, because the number of votes, the party achieved this in these elections, is normally twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia. 
So the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the parliamentary elections of 2008, while it was in the regional elections in 2006, only 316.222. 
Last Sunday, the PPC 384.091 votes. 
If this rising trend - the result of the diversion of the voices of the PSC and the capture of the electorate of the PP - should continue, analysts predict that the PP that could rise in the parliamentary elections, the PPC from 8 to 12 members of Congress, while also CiU four (it now has 10) and the PSC have at least 9 Members (25) would lose. 
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE. 
According to the analysis of the People's Party would lose a Member of the ERC - currently has three - while ICV its Members or could gain much more. 
Should the election calendar, however, the next date with the municipal elections in May 2011. Even then, the People's Party (PP), the language of the scales in order to put an end to the socialist hegemony in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the city of Barcelona Council, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: EUR 661 million for 2011. 
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC cities Barcelona, Tarragona, and Lérida Gerona, in which the Socialists do not reach a majority on its traditional allies and ICV (ERC) can draw, will lose. 
After the Republican debacle, it is not strange that this party their representation in the local council Barcelona, where they would have to reach 5% of the vote, will lose. 
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in their share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, and Lérida Tarragona. 
The nationalists are convinced that we can play the main role in Tarragonas swing. There they had before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP. 
The PP en Lérida lies only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Pietro's, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times. 
In other important areas, such as in Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus has had a significant increase in the People's Party. 
It is currently the PP in 34 municipalities of Catalonia and the creation of lists in so many places as possible.
