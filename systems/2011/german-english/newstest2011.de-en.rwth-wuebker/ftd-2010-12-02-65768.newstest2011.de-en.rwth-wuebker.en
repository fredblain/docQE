Ogoniland is burned off 
The water in the rivers is ölbraun, it smells like the petrol station: billions of litres of crude oil spills have destroyed the natural in Nigeria's Ogoniland. 
The people of theft, corruption and illegal Ölkochen. 
Celestine Akpobari thinks it well. 
"Struggling not to ," reassured the Ökoaktivist journalists:" Just get enough slime today before the lens. " 
The 37-year-old Nigerian has attempted an abzulichten until the breast in the water watenden boys surround him with the Schlieren: in the regenbogenfarbenen water on the scene almost nicely. 
That are below the surface brown swathes of crude oil, is not to see. 
In the past they have gathered here eimerweise shrimp, Esther told Badom on the shores of the Bodo Jetty river. 
Meanwhile, the lazy river waters completely dead. 
Five years ago, poured from a geborstenen pipeline vast quantities of crude oil in the vast wetland. 
Fishermen from the nearby small, Bodo must row six hours to get in fischhaltige waters: in the heart of the Niger Delta, Ogoniland is seen as one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world. 
On the journey through the river basins criss-crossed mangrove swamps, the full extent of the devastation evident. 
Rather than shed some water frantically the motor boat brown gruel, who has his hands in the water, ölige finger. 
The roots of the mangrove Bäumchen stand out as black Lakritzstangen, sad, some are true to their Wedel palm trees. 
Vogelschwärme, as usual in wetlands, in vain: as soon as the silent foreign Border, is spreading in the petrol station smelling like a former paradise straws calm. 
"What happens here is ecological warfare ," says Celestine Akpobari gloomy:" We are living in constant danger to health. " 
The comparison is appropriate. 
The area where the Ogoni is a battlefield for decades disputed that there were more than 60 years ago, the first Explorateure from Europe, organised here in the 80 s with the later executed writer Ken Saro Wiwa, the first opposition here had to stop the Shell group 1993 production, because it was too dangerous for its oil workers. 
Even today, the company is not allowed to return to Ogoniland. While pumping from the delta region of triple the size of Switzerland, with more than 5000 drilling sources and 7000 kilometres of pipelines every day more than two million barrels of black gold, broke the oilfields in Ogoniland, the corporation is too unstable the situation. 
Every few hundred metres stählerne Gestelle stand out as bizarre sculptures from the water, "Christian Bäumchen" the heads of the boreholes far too zärtlich. 
They are up to 50 years old, the canisters had most to the core. 
Always stop such drilling head, says Akpobari, then rinne a constant flow of crude oil into the water. 
More than two billion litres leaked after experts estimate that in 50 years into the ecosystem of the Yangtze, year after year, the amount of oil, as in the case of the "super tanker Exxon Valdez," 21 years ago into the sea in Alaska - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind. 
Who is to blame for the continuing ecosphere MCA, it is argued. 
While the Shell, sabotage and organised Öldiebstahl for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists berstende drilling heads and lecke pipelines as the main polluters. 
The Shell in Nigeria significantly lower safety standards than anything else in the world, accused the U.S. scientist Richard Steiner's group 2008: alone is the rate of defects in the pipes "many times higher than elsewhere ." 
In one place, from a distance, looks like an abandoned garage ölverschmierte open-air, from the mangrove characters: you are ölverschmiert splitternackt and up to the neck. 
Under one of the many kegs, which combined with tubes, scattered there are sometimes arbitrarily on the site, flackert a fire: an illegal small refinery. 
In the heated barrel of crude oil on the fire several hours, Michael, the head of the group. 
First introduced petrol through the pipes in the reception, spits a little later, at the end of the line, finally, diesel and kerosene. 
So, Michael and four people on a daily basis up to four barrels à 300 litre diesel: "That brings us a 34.000 Naira "- around $22. 
The delta residents use the chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state of sub-Saharan Africa. 
Nigeria has a single refinery. 
With the 40 euro cents per litre of diesel ridiculously low price can undercut the illegal Kocher still: their raw material they get for free. 
He comes from "Bunkerern", the tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: go to the country, according to experts in the entire Niger Delta on a daily basis, at least 16 million litres of crude oil. 
Only a very small part of the provisional intermediary raw material is processed illegally, however: the lion's share of organised criminal networks, which also includes politicians and senior military officers, tankers and dispose of it on the world market. 
The debate is whether the environmental disaster the all too easily able to engage the population or the lax practices, the activist Akpobari for purely academic. 
"The oil companies would be perceived as invaders and would have destroyed the livelihood of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries." 
Meanwhile, destroying the relationship between the Ogoni mainly to Shell but that only a withdrawal of the group into question would be: "Perhaps face different nationalities, such as better than the Chinese." 
Since Michael nervous. 
"It is high time that disappears ," says the muskulöse and. 
"Every minute the soldiers." 
The illegal Ölveredler caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not arrest, but a painful bribes. 
Also, the mainly from the country's north, soldiers - like all Nigerians - benefit from the raw material. 
"This damned stuff has brought our country in every respect to the dog ," says Akpobari.
