China considers its targets to reduce greenhouse gases, 
The representative of China stated on the COP16, his country had made huge efforts to reduce carbon footprints, and it would maintain its offer to reduce by 2020 40% to 45% of its greenhouse gases. 
China considers his offer to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 2020 to 40 to 45 percent, Su Wei, the representative of the country on the COP16. 
In his first public appearance at the 16th world climate summit COP16 (United Nations), Su Wei, his country had made huge efforts to lower carbon footprints and the conversion of its industry. 
He said that in the last four years, his country of 245 million dollars in order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. 
However, he said that China would not change its targets, but would work together with the international community on this matter. 
He said that the Chinese unterteile strategy on climate change in four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support of pilot programmes. 
In all aspects, we have made progress, including the adoption of a new energy bill last year, which meant the targets for reducing greenhouse gases, he said. 
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China the authorities of the states which had cooperated with the central government and local authorities to achieve the objectives of energy saving, the efficient use of energy and the reduction of emissions. 
In addition, he tells, have been taken or completed some multiannual plans, both those who were funded by the Chinese government, as well as those that received the money from other countries. 
For example, he was referring to the programme for Effective use of energy, which was introduced in the last five years and investment by the United Nations (U.N.), had received from the government and from private hands. 
It is also a project at the provincial level on climate change, another exchange of traditional incandescent light bulbs by Energiesparbirnen and another to mitigate and adapt, he said. 
Martin Krol government, scientific adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that the efforts of China would be far greater than is commonly believed. 
He showed that measured in terms of per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China six tonnes per person, while it is in the United States 100 tonnes. China is a neunprozentigen overall contribution to environmental pollution. 
It is also unprecedented progress in the field of energy. Energy efficiency has increased in the last five years, twenty percent and by the year 2020 is a further, he said.
