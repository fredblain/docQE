The demokatrische routine, 
The democracy movement in Latin America will be stronger, as the support of private companies. 
Crime is a bigger problem than the unemployment. 
In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States. 
These results, the Latinobarómetro survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist. 
This survey will be carried out regularly since 1995 and shows that the exchange of views in this region. 
Two facts fall in this year's poll in September and October, particularly in the eye. 
First, the good mood in Latin America 
And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions. 
In many countries of the South American Pacific coast has increased the democratic movement is strong. (Table 1). 
In Peru, for example, where the economy is growing every year since 2002 by about 6%, the number of democracy advocates from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. 
In Mexico, where the economy since the collapse last year begins, there is such a trend. 
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are staunch Democrats, reducing the regional average. Diagram (2). 
Approximately 44% of respondents said that they would be with the country's democratic practice. There are as many as last year, however, 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3). 
About 34% of the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both of these values is identical to that of last year, but a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively). 
A decade ago undermined Latin America's economic crisis, the efforts for more democracy. 
It lasted this during the world economic crisis, it may be that the countries of Latin America only a brief recession, and have recovered quickly. 
In addition, the poor have been absorbed by a stronger social network. 
(According to reports by the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America this week rose by 2009, the poverty rate in Latin America only slightly, and has fallen this year at 32%.) 
But from country to country, there are strong differences mood graph (. 4). 
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread progress thinking. 
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession mount and have increased violent crime, this is less the case. 
Only the second time since the beginning of the survey respondents see many in Latin America in the crime in their country a greater problem than the unemployment graph. (5). 
Some 31% say that they were either themselves or a family member in the past year, victims of a crime. But, compared to 38% last year, the values and the lowest level since 1995. 
The rising economic performance is reflected in the strong support of the private sector and the market economy: 71% of respondents überregional said that the private sector for the development, in 2007 there were 56% (6). Graph. 
Approximately 58%, that only the market economy in their country, compared with 47% last year. 
Interestingly, have retained 62% of respondents in Venezuela this view (and 80% are in favour of a private sector), although their leftist President, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private companies. 
Brazil, according to the 19% of respondents (18% last year), the biggest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year). 
The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see in the United States, the most influential country, taken over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua and Venezuela.
