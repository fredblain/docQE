Erdarbeiten puzzling 
The Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria. 
The country is, however, to comment on - nor does it controls. 
At midnight on 5 and 6 September 2007 are at least four Israeli F- 15 I fighter planes, a mystery, würfelförmiges building in Syria. 
It is on the banks of the Euphrates; the next major city, 30 kilometres, is Dair as Saur. 
Their name comes up in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, built with Syria allegedly with help from North Korea in the Quader, hidden in a valley, the lack of electricity. 
According to a briefing of the U.S. foreign intelligence agency CIA at the end of April 2008 would have been appropriate, also under the name of the nearby town of el Kibar so common reactor to produce plutonium - to build nuclear weapons. 
For other purposes, by contrast, the technology from the fifties. 
The CIA has produced a video presentation with blurred satellite images. 
By Computeranimation they played a, where they are supposed to be what components of the reactor, before the destruction of the Yongbyon fell a copy of the North Korean nuclear model from the centre. 
In addition, it presented photos, the building from the show or even the atrium. 
The reactor has been just before the operation, it said, but has not yet been drawn up with fuel prongs. 
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more than it was then known, the mystery over time were more likely to grow. 
Former U.S. President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack fairly sure that Syria built in el Kibar a reactor, but hardly points to the fact that the country "an active nuclear weapons program". 
Some intelligence officers in Europe are still cautious and prefer to speak of a "alleged reactor ," even if the CIA presentation of" plausible ". 
You do not have hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. 
Asked how he was sure to have a nuclear reactor, said a senior U.N. diplomat in the summer only shrug, the IAEA "enough material to ask questions ." 
The rubble of the alleged "unused military building", the Syrians are rushing to one side and planierten the terrain. 
Nevertheless, took place in June 2008 an IAEA team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el Kibar traces of uranium that had been made by people. 
In addition, the IAEA on a Member State provider of commercial satellite images from the period immediately after the attack, the more meaningful than the one presented by the CIA. 
However, to get these recordings on the market, because of the unknown client - perhaps Israel - it has bought exclusively. 
The IAEA could not verify their authenticity. 
Syria has always, never a secret nuclear program or built a nuclear reactor. 
The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus. 
But the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely. 
Since then, refuses to Damascus to discuss it - as well as on the satellite images. 
It also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el Kibar and access to the wreckage of the bombed-out building. 
But Israel says sticking. 
"We will never comment on this ," said recently at the time of the attack, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position. 
So limps toward the investigation of the case since June 2008 fruitless and "is becoming increasingly to a serious credibility problem for the authority ,", a senior Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna - after all, is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area, which the IAEA. 
As the key to progress in the investigation, the IAEA apparently three other facilities, the "in" functional link to relate to the alleged reactor - and unlike this. 
The inspectors have so far not open, what plants are, or what role they have or what they considered suspicious. 
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally as Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived from nearby towns. 
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and satellite images of a building complex in Masyaf, which is probably one of the suspected of objects. 
It may be in or adjacent to a military base - with this explanatory statement denied Syria, the IAEA access to the three locations. 
In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that will be sent on ahead so the IAEA from the United States, in order auszuspähen military installations. 
Because the nuclear detectives were turned off by the U.S. secret services to the facilities. 
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos that was transported between the three locations and the Quader material on the Euphrates. 
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna, could at least one of the plants' in connection with the fuel production ". 
"But there was no evidence of sensitive activities" uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes that are necessary to build nuclear weapons. 
The type of reactor operated with enriched uranium, which is not. 
But where the uranium could have come from and where it should be separated from it later the plutonium for the bomb, on these key issues, there are at most plausible assumptions. 
It is also unclear whether debris that could run the valuable traces, stored in three places. 
As if the hundreds of lorry loads from the earth, no one wants to have information about where the rubble. 
The only a few kilometres from el Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, salt mine al Tibni, has studied the Syria 1998 on their suitability as a storage facility for radioactive waste, the IAEA as unlikely. 
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had it in a recent analysis of satellite images for the prestigious journal Jane's Intelligence Review 'of the reactor. 
Borrowed from the orbiting show that Syria to the three suspected places Erdarbeiten and large container, after the IAEA access. 
This may be a coincidence, but little to dispel the suspicion. 
In addition, they say in diplomatic circles, have used the IAEA several months to develop a plan for inspections, which should allow Syria to maintain military secrets - shows the amount of the interest of the inspectors. 
Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte this proposal. 
Had reassured Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, yes, that is why it is not a high sense of urgency, such as U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months' special inspections, one of the harshest means that the Vienna nuclear authority to enforce controls. 
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, these inspections should suggest, has been "an option, for which I am in the future ', but still he hesitates. 
It is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it needs for a majority of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and many of the 35 countries represented there are anything but eager for an escalation. 
On the other hand, as a diplomat: "What if they end up with nothing?"
