NASA announced the discovery außerirdischen life 
The U.S. space agency called a press conference to vorzustelle tomorrow a Fund, will have an impact on the search for life in space. 
The National Air and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States is tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiologische discovery which could confirm the theory of the existence außerirdischen life. 
The Fund will be presented tomorrow at 13.00 a.m. at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts from the Astro biology. It is a science, the origin, development, distribution and investigates the future of life in the universe. 
In convening the press conference, NASA, they will be "an aufsichtserregenden Fund for the search for außerirdischem life", triggering speculation with experts from other countries. 
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments, which was considered so far for unbwohnbar, can exist human-like creatures. It raised the hypothesis that these provisions are intelligent creatures - like people - could transform, if improved their living conditions. 
Apparently, it is a microbe, at the bottom of the mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California, has been found. They live in an environment that was too toxic for all possible forms of life, as the sea arsenhaltig sharply. 
In one way or another the micro Biesbosch the arsenic than Überlebensressource. In this capacity increases the chances that it on other planets, which do not have our protective atmosphere, there could be similar. 
If verstoffwechseln these organisms that arsenic, is in accordance with the Astro biologists, that "it is a different way of life, there is a second life form that sets us apart from the obvious." 
The space agency is tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference, the scope of their funds. 
The conference, the Geobiologin Pamela Conrad who investigated the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, the largest moon Titan (the Saturns) under the question of whether resembles its chemical composition of the earth, studied.
