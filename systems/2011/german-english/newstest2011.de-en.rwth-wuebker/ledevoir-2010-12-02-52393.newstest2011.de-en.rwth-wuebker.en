Government loan for the takeover of eXcentris 
The Quebecer government, which has been asked by the Société Angus and the Parallèle companies to participate financially in the takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris, with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a loan deal. 
The developers society Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of about seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture for the adoption of the Daniel Langlois, eXcentris cinema complex on the Boulevard Saint Laurent, to entrust this back its cineastischen function, not what they have demanded. 
The government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, however, to their own conditions. 
Instead of the expected Quebecer donation offers the government a bond in lower than initially expected, which could create a viable solution to advantageous conditions, at least in the view of the state from the scaremongers entnehmbaren sources. 
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, the Bittgesuch has been corrected since the overall, it once again. 
A proposal, together with an action plan were already by the President of the "Société de développement of entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, sent to St Pierre, the minister in charge of the eXcentris acts. 
Several days ago, he had to send a final technical report. 
The proposal of the cabinet was sent to the SODEC, however, on Wednesday. 
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December time to respond to this. 
In any case, seems to have been pushed the premise of the Heads of State donation really on the side. 
Let us remember that had made the Quebecer owners community of cinemas and cinema complexes against direct government investment to support the takeover of eXcentris by made the argument that the Culture Ministers have to provide financial aid for real estate projects, he also have other cinema halls. 
Several other participants in the market segment of the market, there have, however, by contrast, substantial economic assistance. 
Kinochef Daniel Langlois was reported after the construction of the self-financed cinemas over ten years, with great difficulty, the authors cinema in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exception from the treasury. 
The lack of cinema halls, the independent films in Montreal, is more than obvious, and eXcentris knew to keep its clientele. 
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, a privately financed campaign in which they hope that a sum of $700 000 to boost the acquisition. 
Since the spring of 2009, only one screen to show films in eXcentris, Le Parallèle. 
The aim of the prospective purchasers, the three cinemas on 27 February next year with a demonstration of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "hommes et des dieux 'to open. 
Christian Yaccarini but the newspaper "Le Devoir recalled" and not ignored, he and his group of the enviable proposals, which they did.
