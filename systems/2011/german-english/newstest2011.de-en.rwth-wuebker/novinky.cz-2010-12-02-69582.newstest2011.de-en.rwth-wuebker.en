Czech children get drunk with Branca beer and rum is out - it is simply too slow 
Branca, rum and vodka, for once, a good whisky, has stolen the father of the house from the bar. 
These are the drinks, must be notbehandelt after enjoyed Czech drunken teenagers under fifteen most frequently. 
No exception are children who need to ausschlafen their hangover repeatedly in the hospital. 
This comes from the experience of doctors, which will be faced with similar cases in the children's wards of hospitals. 
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it takes too long to be drunk." 
"The trend is clearly hard alcohol ," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the chief doctor of the children's department in the mittelböhmischen Hořovice clinic. 
"Whisky, if it is possible to snatch the father a bottle from the House bar, and if not, then at least Branca or vodka. 
"Vodka has the advantage that it can be blended with juice, then he does not smell so strong ," said the chief doctor. 
The spokeswoman of the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him. 
"Most often refers to Branca or rum." 
"This is the current trend of alcohol, particularly in primary schools." 
"Occasionally, it was also about slivovice, take it from home", Mrs Jurinová. 
Chefarzt Pelikán according to thirteen or -year drinkers in the hospital receiving no exception. 
Before the clinic in Hořovice, from which he has been working for this year, he was for ten years in the paediatric ward of the hospital, where Motol produced the rescue vehicles angetrunkene pupils from local and long distance. 
"A girl had to be hospitalisiert four times." 
"She began her career at the age of 12, the first time with 3.5 mg of alcohol in the blood and in combination with" Extase "was taken ," the doctor describing a particularly severe case. 
"It was in the exhibition site in Holešovice on any dance party." 
"The interesting thing was that it was not their mother at all odd that her daughter was 48 hours to go home ," surprised by the chief doctor. 
The lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance in the toasts with its own Sprösslingen is seen as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children. 
A real dependence in the true sense of the word, it is not, according to experts in children. 
"Alcoholism is a longstanding chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomenon and that is not the case in these children." 
Those who have repeatedly alcohol, is mostly a negative in terms of the family social Background characteristic, "said chief doctor Pelikán. 
The spokesman for the hospital Motol, Mrs Jurinová, have been admitted by mid-November approximately forty drunken children in the department for our children and youth. 
However, only the cases of severe alcohol poisoning, which accounted for a hospital stay is required, in the statistics. 
Drunken children who are taken to ambulatory treatment from parents or, if necessary, by the police, are not registered. 
In addition to the cases where children only as a bottle of spirits in the school austrinken Bank is there, in the view of Mr Pelikán three jahreszeitliche Amplituden, which is totally unreliable: Walpurgisnacht New Year's Eve, and the end of the school year. 
"The latter for two reasons - either from distress because of the bad certificate or joy at the holidays." 
"In the Walpurgisnacht I have already drunk seven children in the host ," said Dr Pelikán. 
A betrunkenes child who spend the night under medical supervision, paradoxically, is better off than a child who is the next day with a nasty hangover. 
The headaches in the morning, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, which is in hospital with a flüssigkeitsspendenden infusion of glucose and nutrients that are lacking in the body. 
"They are clearly better off, because after the" beautiful "experience in the evening, with good humour, without doing something somewhere." 
"They are just a little confused about where they are ," admits a doctorate Pelikán, although it is polluting the patients at least sometimes the good humour, by listing them the costs that they will cost the treatment. 
Because of the transport with the rescue vehicles and the night in an Akutbett well and to a few tens of thousand kronor. 
"Every now and then I have used it as an educational tool, if I have calculated directly to children at the time of the visit, which has cost their drunkenness and that it can happen that they need to work on the whole holiday to earn the money for a single such Fete ," added Dr Pelikán. 
In his view, not the health insurance companies, however, to redress procedures, the demand for the trunkenen children costs from parents.
