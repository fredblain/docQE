Euro: the ECB is forced to retain their purchases of government paper 
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to show how exiting from the crisis, or at least announce the layout of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures, the end of the year to conclude. 
The duty of the European debt crisis, the Central Bank in Frankfurt cannot afford without a doubt, even today, to put more than tense situation in the European bond markets, not to cause the deterioration. 
The political costs would be far too high. 
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde had yesterday at a press conference the stance taken by the ECB, active role in favour of the resolution of the state budget deficit. 
It has not dared to say whether they thought the central bank could do even more, for example, by boosting its programme of purchases of government bonds. 
"I reserve my reasons for my European trading partners (...)". 
Jean Claude Trichet, President of the ECB had been an eloquent speaker of the previous day in Brussels during his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament for its projects, but rather to point out that the programme of purchases of government securities in the secondary market "dismal" and that we in the Assembly on Thursday "to see how the decisions".

In practice, the bond purchases of the treasure chamber of the ECB last week to around 1.35 billion euros. 
According to leaks and some traders should they have made yesterday new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government paper. 
Overall, the central banks of the Eurosystem since May 2010 purchases of 67 billion euros. 
Among the dealers will be questioned the anticipation of a further implementing the purchase price in any way (see page 29).

"For the first quarter of 2011, provided for progressive withdrawal seems more likely ," anticipates, Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal. 
Oppenheim. 
In its intervention in the market for government debt, "the ECB should aufrechthalten such a purchase volume of bonds, which revived the sluggish market ," adds Norbert Bräms. 
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the markets of the national debt in the euro zone, the central bank has no other choice than to maintain their presence in the market. 
"They must at any price to the Steller lack of investors in the market and will act as the hasty enthusiasm on the weakest states paid to prevent returns ," verve yesterday an important bond holders. 
Because if interest rates are soaring, would prevent the states even more to reduce their debt or to stabilize. 
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
