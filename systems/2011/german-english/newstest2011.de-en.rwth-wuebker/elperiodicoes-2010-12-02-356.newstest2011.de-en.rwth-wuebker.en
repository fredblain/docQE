Sport and rule circumvention 
Tricks like Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to circumvent a sanction. 
The alleged by two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos), launched in the game of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League meant that much ink has been spilled about whether it is an unsportliche act or not, and whether it should be sanctioned possibly both players by UEFA. 
As is well known, the two players for a few minutes ago post-match (their team won already clearly) time and played several fouls, so that the referee showed them the second yellow card. 
In this way, would give the Real Madrid and his group, the two players the mandatory sanction the next league game against the Auxerre comply with and without the cards in the next phase of the game. 
Finally, punished the Disciplinary Committee UEFA's coach of the clubs, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money. 
The provocation of a yellow card or similar under such circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football. 
It has spread so far that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport followed rules. 
Part of that debate about the case to the fact that a team of football clubs Real Madrid (the anthem in his precious courage and honor and on other occasions his players for similar incidents had punished) played the main role, and the proportion of Mourinho, the episode has added a more to its long history as theatralischer provocative and technicians. 
In any case, the debate about whether this does not contradict the statutes expressly prohibited behaviour to the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts of circumvention rule. Indeed, this approach to the statutes of the sport, but seem to circumvent its meaning. 
In this matter should be examined the damage caused to the spirit of sport. 
The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game. 
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the offending players an unfair advantage from the opposing team. And it did not happen. 
The paradox is the act of players of Real Madrid, that it is not what we normally under false game or circumvention rule, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly, in order to avoid a penalty, but they should be as visible as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. 
The players were waiting and took the sanction happily. 
Another issue is what kind of took advantage of the offender from the deliberate fouls. 
It should be pointed out that neither of the rival in a disadvantageous position were still erheischt advantages for the feigned game, was the obvious result of this action, that the team with fewer players continue to play. 
It is also an useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have the players. 
The advantage is clear is that the players in the next phase of the Champions League game without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game. 
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree of uncertain advantage, because it could leave the team at some point. Moreover, the players with this approach a sanction and go in the second cycle of cards, in which they leave for accumulation of cards with a card less than in the first cycle. 
It is not clear whether it really is an advantage. 
In the end not such practices against the spirit of sport, are among the strategic decisions to pull out of the maximum benefit. 
In this case the players wanted to avoid any sanction (that would be a clear case of circumvention rule), they wanted to elect more when they go through this. 
They took a strategic decision, without a penalty to avoid or to flee before her. 
Although blur the line between inventiveness and regulatory environment, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness. 
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: two of exclusions and because of the nature of the Regelübertragung provoked. 
The damage was caused to the principles of sport by these actions, is less ethical than aesthetic.
