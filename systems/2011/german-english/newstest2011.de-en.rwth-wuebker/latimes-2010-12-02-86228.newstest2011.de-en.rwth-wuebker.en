Grammy nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding, surprisingly, was awarded in the category newcomer of the year 
If you auftritts at the request of a president, will see the people there. 
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding, at the ceremony at the Nobel prize in 2009. Now it has been nominated the 26-year-old jazz singer and Bassistin überrachsenderweise for this year's Grammy category newcomer of the year. 
In view of the fact that Spalding since her album "Esperanza jazz scene in the 2008" is already a celebrated star, the nomination appears a little unusual. But it is in accordance with the Grammy rules under which an artist before publication of the Albums, with whom he has been in the public knows, should have issued a maximum of three albums. 
The ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society ," is certainly a step forward. And with their beschwingten voice and a good sense of pop, radio and Latin Music, is quietly Spalding with Norah Jones, 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz Interpretin in this category of the nomination Spaldings. 
It was also the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer trio nominated in the category Instrumentalalben. The darling of the critics saw a huge success. 
Among the competitors Iyers include, among other things, "Moody 4 B" of the experienced Saxofonisten James Moody and "Positootly" of the Keyboarders John Beasley. 
Trombone Shorty, a favorite raubeiniger from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBOs "Treme", was awarded in the category Zeitgenössischer jazz, in the otherwise rather albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber. 
The Secret Societ wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue won in the category of large group probably deserved attention. He is thus against Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and adventurous Dave Holland and his Oktett, whose Life Ablum "pathways" is a good example of a democratic Bassisten as band leader.
