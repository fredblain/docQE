The ice in the University of 
"Gelato at the University of Bologna" be prepared Eiskonditoren better times of the year. 
The three-day course for the future Gelatieri has the largest gains and visitors from all over the world. 
Why is there, in fact, the whole ice? 
Gela is being damaged by the animals and the Gelataio. 
The Gela is being damaged animals, in German, the old-fashioned Eiskonditor, the cream of all the rules of Italian Eismacherkunst. 
The Gelataio is catching up with the Spachtel ice cream from the refrigerated shelf, cut them in the Waffel and sold them. 
In order to know this, we must be in Anzola dell Emilia drive in the province of Bologna. 
But who would like to know more about ice, which is not in the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani over. 
The ice University has established the manufacturers of Eismaschinen in 2003 so that the ice cream from his machines everywhere the Italian high ideals. 
The three-day course for the future Gelatieri has the largest gains and visitors from around the world. 
But there is also Spezialkurse travel spread over several days around the chocolate ice cream and internships in the domestic Eisdiele. 
Some dreams in mid-life crisis by a new career, others venture just take the treacherous ice of vague aspirations. 
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from every continent - from Brazil on Hungary to Saudi Arabia. 
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow Food Movement and wants to offer in the country's industrial Cream Ice in future an European quality product. 
Anke from Berlin is corporate adviser and wants to eintüten after years in a nerve-racking job. 
Two young Egyptians dream to open in Cairo an Eisdiele. 
A man from Malta and from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian Chamber Mrs Yulia, because their children love Italian ice cream. 
Maestro Gela is being damaged animals Luciano Ferrari said the participants the ideal attributes of the perfect ice cream. 
It is not only good taste, but also the seidige fluidity and good consistency. 
Luciano has not forgotten his training but also the icing on the cake of national and even Latin Überbaus: "Italy Gelato is simply the best - and then there is still plenty of romanticism." 
The first step towards the production seems quite simply. 
Luciano repeals the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a big Mixgerät, heated with an electronic programme to 85 degrees and then cools immediately to four degrees. 
Then he pulls the plug on a machine, and in a white base pasteurised cream, basis for all Milcheissorten. 
The lecturer will immediately bombarded with questions: can produce only ice cream with natural substances without stabilizer? 
How can the experimental a free rein? 
Luciano warns, from the Zeitgeist astray. 
How many ice cream "only from natural ingredients," has used may nevertheless stabilisers - usually a natural product, such as Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne. 
Of course, can produce ice without stabilizer, it must only be sold within a day, otherwise sackt it, and the customer bites on Eiskörnchen louder. 
Some variation on the basic mass are permitted. 
It will be more exciting with flavourings. 
For the taste of ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit or the sweets section of the supermarket. 
There are also some powder and Pasten. 
"The suppliers will try to foist onto you dozens of aromatised additions." 
"But you should experiment just." 
Either the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruit. 
Or the ice cream from the white of the mass, with eggs, cream and yellow with cocoa powder on the basis for all sorts of temptations offered chocolate. 
Now, the course participants in the Eismaschinen. 
Luciano leaves they each have four different types of vanilla, chocolate, Mokka and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives. 
The same experiment will be subject to the Fruchteissorten. 
More flavouring substances, more fruit puree - taste is not necessarily better. 
Hazelnut ice cream tastes not necessarily nussiger if it contains more hazelnuts. 
The most popular kiwis ice, the working group, which used more fruit, less water and less stabiliser. 
A balanced mix highlight the taste of a Gelato correctly, says Luciano. 
Eisherstellung is a computing task: will use peach puree with high sugar, must be reduced the amount of sugar in the basic recipe. 
For lemon ice is an extra dose of sugar. 
Luciano draws a device, with a consequent impact on the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winemakers to measure the Oechsle in grape must). 
Fortunately, facilitate the Rechnerei tables. 
Ice to make no longer requires as much physical effort as before. 
Not only the device for the automatic establishment of the mass. 
There is also a device in which the final ice mixture and at the same time cremig is cooled to minus temperatures. 
Of all the automation despite not remain small margins. 
The Brazilian Gustavo acquitted himself and his colleagues rate from top to bottom with fruit puree, as he puts the oversized hand blenders out of control. 
"In every direction ," says Luciano Maestro, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens."
