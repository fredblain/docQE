The Offenkundigkeit second mandate: 
De Gaulle had whittled away. 
Mitterrand had to believe that he stutze. 
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation. 
Nicolas Sarkozy and even less than this. 
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next. 
The current head of state will be making a candidate in 2012. 
But the Offenkundigkeit is the side of the Mysteriums, which evokes the presidential function, not. 
So we have to do so, as if the doubts from now on. 
In one, as well as in the other direction. 
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac, a third mandate is not excluded, without believing themselves. 
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy in serious Tone, his decision "at some point in the autumn of 2011". 
He Tuesday evening in the Elysée before the UMP parliamentarians from the perspective of "two mandates" would let it be known that had spread a little Fieberhaftigkeit. 
This was the official announcement of his candidacy? 
Far from it. 
The president was simply remind you that will limit the constitutional amendment of 2008 the number of five-year terms to only two. 
He made a statement that no announcement. 
It is not the first time that he mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone. 
"You have the worst case, seven and a half years with me, or at best ," he told them in July 2009. 
A new in May 2010: "does not mean that I do not think about the stage." 
His words of yesteryear do not make him more candidates than the previous day, no less. 
Should they cause, then from a double. 
The acceleration of the Wettlaufes the candidacy with the PS on one side. 
But it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal, who is Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal themselves. 
On the contrary, it is obvious his candidacy in 2012, which was adopted by many members of the PS as early warning to the challenge. 
The bad opinion polls on the other side. 
For the first time, the voters of a candidacy by François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to the poll BVA L Express) prefer. 
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP," responded immediately and cautious in the context of the Prime Minister. 
"If he would be a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin. 
"He will always believe, to be able to win ," corrected Alain Juppé, who has resigned with the Offenkundigkeit.
