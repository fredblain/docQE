Clotilde Reiss affair: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediating role for Syria 
In more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who in Iran for "espionage" was detained, the French public in breathing, enabled the diplomacy in alert and focused the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran. 
All of this under the attentive eyes of diplomats from the United States. 
The Wiki Leaks and obtained by the newspaper Le Monde durchgesehenen American documents give some background to this crisis. 
They describe how the Elysée had told the Americans that his strategy, which went as far as this advice for dealing with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of Wanderern). 
They show how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman the release of Majid Kakavand, have an in France, and by the American justice due to trade with material in favor of the Iranian nuclear program Iraners wanted to Gegeleistung. 
Finally, they put the way in which to manipulate the French Presidency has tried to use the media to make this the idea, the Syrian President Bachar Al Assad have played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss, in a harsh light. 
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard. 
An on 12 August 2009 in Paris redigiertes diplomatic telegram entitled "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hijackings ." 
François Richier, Elysée adviser in strategy issues addressed in the company of Mr Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay in North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone. 
They said the French method. 
The advised the Americans to do everything we can to rückzuführen their own nationals who were forcibly detained in Iran. 
"Noise ," they said," articulated loudly and clearly and without letting up, "the words' basic human rights, ""innocence,"" immediate release" in the media. 
This is necessary in order to bring the Iranian regime in embarrassment that respects very sensitive to its image. 
"This is all the more so, since you ask the Iranians not to do it ." 
Because "silence solves nothing ," over the discussion about attempts to unauffälligem routes, the Iranians' master in evasive manoeuvres ". 
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of a "normal," Iranian tactic: "hostage to political blackmail ." 
He announced the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (on 16 August should come into being, on the day they take refuge in the French Embassy) "demand the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" ($230.000) bail. 
And he said, the Elysée am anticipating further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will get worse ." 
The Iranians could "arrest in the near future, another of the roughly 1.800 French citizens who live in Iran ," he said. 
28 August 2009. 
Clotilde Reiss has been sacked twelve days from prison, is still in Iran. 
The information was circulated: the Iranians Kakavand Majid, whose extradition to the United States due to illegal trade in empfindlichem electronics materials to Iran, has been sacked after a judge's decision in Paris. 
The American Embassy, like many other observers, questions on this disturbing coincidence. 
For Washington, the illegal Iranian networks of the nuclear programme of material, the release of Majid Khakavand bad news. 
France has taken a horse trading in purchasing? 
The liberation of the Iraners against the French woman? 
During a meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assured that this was not the case. 
The Elysée, he says, not only was "completely surprised by the decision of the judge ," but also tried to rebel against. 
"There has been a heated exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot Marie), "the French government cannot change the past ," he says. 
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Kakavand Majid under "strict supervision" of the French secret service. 
The Elysée adviser chooses a telephone number, again, the American diplomat, the Iranians "are currently in the chair of the Iranian embassy buildings in Paris ." 
While not without damaging the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran the Elysée his efforts, through statements by the media and organised "flight testing "judging, the Syrian President Assad Bachar Al playing a" significant "and" influential intermediary role ." 
The Americans are watching this activity is not without irony and that the manipulation of the fruit, as reflected in several press articles in the official French version. 
One of 25 August 2009. The datierendes telegram "media blitzkrieg of the French authorities". 
Why there was so much "thanks," Mr Assad, wonders the Paris embassy. 
"Despite their declarations of Lobpreis, the French authorities to secretly, that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians". 
The document also deals with the reasons that have brought the Elysée to indulge this fiction. 
The intensive communication efforts "aims to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria," he said. 
2008, launched a policy which at that time "was perceived by many critics votes in France and abroad as premature and undeservedly ." 
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" Paris "is trying to bring Syria, can achieve what we laud by playing a constructive role in the region". 
The aim is also to "discord between Syria and Iran ." 
The American Embassy knows this from a good source. 
On 11 August had entrusted to François Richier her, "of course we do not know whether the Syrians what happens". 
"But we have, despite everything, they thanked." 
"This should at least cause confusion for the Iranians". 
Clotilde Reiss, on 16 May 2010 to France. 
Nicolas Sarkozy receives in the Elysée. 
In a statement he is grateful to the president of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role for the release of our compatriot ."
