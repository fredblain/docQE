Climate: amount as France its financial promises 
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to comply with the quickly resolved financing promises (also known as "fast start" funding or premature), which were carried out by the developing countries. 
And already are exposed the rough French blandishments. 
With the Copenhagen Treaty have committed themselves to developing countries, 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012. 
The EU has pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France (1.26 billion euros (420 million) per year. 
At the opening of the COP16 has learned the EU out all the stops to convince its partners from the fact of its commitment to the fast start funding detailgetreuer approach: report of its Member States, press conference, great side events, distributing leaflets. 
The operation transparency is noteworthy and I feel valued for its real value: the developing countries and civil society would like, if developed countries were all the same thing at the same level of precision. 
The EU announced, released in 2010 2.2 billion euros, which it puts on the right track to Respektbezollung commitment of $7.2 billion in 2012. 
If you look into the details, but things are a little more complicated. 
This money should, according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new and additional" to ensure that has been tabled an additional commitment, without benefit to the detriment of public development aid. 
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means. 
While the EU Commission had proposed a harmonisation, certain members states, including France, blocked the procedure. 
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark, which he considers to be the best. 
The EU Commission has chosen, for example, a benchmark for those of 2009: the international financing will be retained, and within the framework of the "fast start" funding over three years to 150 million. 
Other countries have similar guidelines, either in a year or about conditions at the level of public development aid. 
In return, France was of the opinion that the financing "of all new projects" 2010 "new and additional". 
In other words: there are no benchmarks in the spending of the previous year or at the global level of official development assistance. 
Specifically, the total amount of French support for developing countries stable (or decrease) - France, his commitment to the "new and additional" to keep funding. 
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. 
Moreover, there is no rule, and everyone chooses its calculation method. 
Some, such as France, 1 Euro borrowed as being equivalent to 1 Euro donated. 
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the trouble is not comparable. 
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to the emission reduction projects, which are based on maximum technology) can be justified, it is misleading to present the euro, the captured as equivalent to a donated Euro... They should be counted only the cost of borrowing for capital commitment as a donor country (that is, the equivalent of an interest rate). 
But France has nothing other than in accordance with the following comment: "respected" its commitment of EUR 420 million, 91.5% of loans (389.8 million) and donates 8.5%) 36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince themselves. 
France is the only land of the EU that loans. 
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among others) to their commitments to 100% with donations. 
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union in 1 Euro to fulfil their obligations, France just 10 cents and understands including a comparable effort. 
More beautiful hocus-pocus! 
All in all, France in his fast start funding with a double deception: part with a Weiterentwicklkung the action over time and partly with the reality of the financial commitment. 
France will succeed, believe that there are 420 million "new and additional" has spent millions in accordance with its promises and save 36.1 million euros. 
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it appears that it was Bercy, who carried out the arbitrage) could have a negative effect on twice; once the EU (why the other member states with the donations, but if there is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, since not all developing countries are completely... 
The chapter on premature, only a small issue on relatively short time compared to the entirety of discussions on the climate. 
But it may be too much of the drop in the machinery of the UNFCCC. 
We hope that this will not be the case. 
However, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year premature funding. 
In the first place, France could announce a change in its accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for his commitments and the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union. 
But above all, France could bring the discussions on the subject of long-term financing forward (another key topic) and at the moment: you can escape the Verrechenbarkeit "or" not the kind of recording its loans. 
France could change its position in order to be as advanced in terms of the issues, as is the case with other things. 
The hope is based on the new environment minister Kosciusko Morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun. 
A surprising announcement on the fast start of France and his vision of "Verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loans would increase by nature, the international confidence, which is necessary for further discussions.
