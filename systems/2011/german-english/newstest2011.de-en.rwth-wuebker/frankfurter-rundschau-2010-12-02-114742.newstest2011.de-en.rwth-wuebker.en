Controllers in the twilight zone 
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa was undermined by the experimental Crops with industry. 
That said, the group of experts test biotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology. 
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well ," said test biotech boss Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich. 
The head of the Efsa group of experts on genetically modified crops, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert, for years the lobbyists'Association Ilsi under contract. 
The will of corporations such as Monsanto, Bayer or Nestle. 
Kuiper contributed significantly to the Efsa testing requirements for Crops and, in a clear conflict of interest, Then. 
The Efsa rules are absatzweise word for word with the Ilsi position papers and had the hallmarks of the industry, which is to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma. 
It was the second time that indication test biotech a conflict of interest. 
As a senior manager Efsa recently without conditions or transitional period for the Swiss company Syngenta farm - and have changed the sides. 
The German broadcasting resources (MDR) had recently unveiled personal connections between of EU authority and industry lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Office, as EU parliamentarians sympathetic. 
The Efsa can see, however, no conflict of interest. 
We refer to all serious data, also on the industry, as long as they are of a high technical quality, says in a statement. 
The experts who work for Efsa, charged that they have no contact with the industry. 
They would have to disclose this but open. 
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States. 
This describes himself as a neutral forum for experts from academia, industry and policy - among other things, the risk assessment for biotechnology without lobby. 
In the case of criticising independent experts such as Then that allow genetically modified crops currently without any attempt to feed animals and shall not tested the response of Crops environmental influences. 
"We want to know, for example, genetically modified maize on the land ," says Then. 
Current practice is merely an isolated proteins to test but not the whole Genpflanze, what am no reliable results. 
"If you don't look for the risks, how do you find them ?" asks Then point an accusing finger. 
It also provides for Hilbeck Angelika. 
The research scientist since 1994 in the genetic engineering and is currently in the Technical School Zurich. 
The industry is trying in this field as in the United States in Europe more and more to influence critical scientists or discredit. 
There was therefore hardly researchers who are intertwined with corporations. 
For business critical studies were published in the rule. 
"The industry controls the security research ," said Hilbeck.
