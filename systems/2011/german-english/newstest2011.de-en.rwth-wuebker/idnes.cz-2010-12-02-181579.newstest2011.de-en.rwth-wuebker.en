The right and the right mattress beds rust? Women have other things than men 
The tollste bed frame, but the quality of the mattress deck area - rust and make the bed. 
They must complement each other harmoniously, however, in order to meet the wishes of the actual user. 
In choosing to play a role in many cases, the weight, the size of the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the Schläfers. 
Equally important is the Interieur, which have to mattress and rust. 
A typical example? 
In a weekend house in which will not heated regularly, are not Latex mattresses, as they need much longer, "warm". 
In addition, they are much more difficult than usual Polyurethan mattresses. 
And they should be changed regularly. 
If they are not sufficient Entlüftungskanälchen at heart and still have to be a solid record, movement of moisture: It is not excluded that emerges from the mold. 
In the election, of course, also plays a role, which is used to be. 
Anyone who has been a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with Weichschicht, will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with hard surface. 
"All ice hockey players who have returned from the NHL, have complained to me that they cannot sleep more correctly." 
"For their abgeschundenen shoulders, heels and waists, they need a Weichschicht from Visco sparkling (Memory Foam - a form of memory Polymer)." 
"I recommend including diabetic people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the" information "from the ligaments and skin badly ," said Sylva Hadamcziková who specialised in padded furniture. 
That is why I have many years ago ice hockey players, but also other customers, with Visco foam mattresses (Memory Foam). 
"Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses provide, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico." 
And we must not necessarily be a famous ice hockey players, the benefits of the Visco surfactants estimate. 
This "miracle" actually works quite simple. 
The sparkling optimalisiert his toughness and form the heat absorbed, in other words, he schmiegt itself, the warm body. 
Nowhere is there, in the middle of the night shifts are not around as after a major battle. 
We simply sleeping much better. 
The viskoelastische sparkling also offers protection against Dekubitus (gangrene). 
In the election of the mattress size should add to body size is still the length of the foot soles, or about 21 to 34 cm. 
As Mrs Mann, who are 180 cm tall, so a 210 to 220 cm bed. 
Each of the sleepers should be at least 90 cm deck width available, 180 cm. 
In separate beds, for example, in singles, 120 to 140 cm. 
For the sake of comfort and also for any visitors. 
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb for the ideal bed width: "If you remain on the back, should be enough room for the easy angewinkelten arms ," advises Ing. Prokopová Helena, the guild champion of the Polsterer and Raumausstatter who, for years the issue of healthy Schlafes and the ergonomics of furniture, and then put this issue to the schools. 
In a double bed everybody needs its own rust and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping for a mattress so high. 
Otherwise we have no choice but to Roste in differing degrees to install and it is not every bed frame. 
Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with the skeleton 15 cm, should account for at least three centimetres in the form of class and fine cushion. 
"With the hand or placing may feel the feathers under any circumstances ," warns Prokopová Helena. 
Every mattress makes a special type of rust. 
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document as of Siam twins have to be found in the bedroom. 
These mattresses and cannot reveal the reference can wash what today already. 
And since you lose in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years, slowly to a huge (and congested sieve). 
Experts also reject advertising slogans, the mattress with a lifespan of up to 25 years, or even a lifetime guarantee. 
Every case has its ifs and buts. 
And that is why a practical advice from dealers: mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width of the hygiene of the waschbaren, not abziehbaren salary, however, it is recommended to use a Matratzenschoner, and wash it easily. 
Even if they are made in the mattress salary with Rundumreißverschluss, so you get after the opening two halves (immensely important for the washing process and the washing machines size!), is the manipulation with larger mattresses, above all, how often the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. 
They are in bed instead of a Rostes a record? 
In order to get out! 
Or, at most, for a bed for unpopular guests and for a single night. 
It should also provide them the record with ventilation holes (if not included) and mattresses with the skeleton and 15 cm minimum level with the Taschenfederkern and fine cushion. 
Polyurethan mattresses are not in such a document. 
For not verstellbare standards Roste with 14 to 18 (the last Lamellen) are Latex or sandwich mattresses (possibly also combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay themselves Roste with a larger number of standards, from 28 or more in services, with Lordosenstütze in Lendenwirbelbereich and the ability to regulate the tough standards. 
On verstellbare Lamellen Roste are no mattresses with the skeleton, because they do not respond to the workplace disguise. 
In addition to the suspension of the Steife pen to be offered special flexible shoulder modules. 
This is a special fastening the services that makes it possible einzudrücken the pen, or verwinkeln so that they allow the specific Einsinken the shoulder of the Schläfers. 
Especially for men with broad shoulders, an important matter. 
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started, "gentlemen mattresses' Weichzonen for the shoulder area. 
Also in the ladies - is intended to give these Weichzonen in the Hüftgegend. 
For ambitious customers are punktelastische Flügelfedersysteme (Lattoflex) or Roste with punktelastischen Pads contact with the Multitorsionsfederung. 
The pressure will be distributed to several points, reducing the tension. 
But - if the right mattress and rust right a bad (too large and fülliges) used pillow, most of the benefits. 
Here too, a rule of thumb: the pillow to prop up the head, his top should extend only to the shoulders, so that we can relax the shoulder muscles. 
The ideal is a 50 x 60 cm deep cushions, as it may, for example, the Scandinavians. 
In the pages of the pillow (along with the Schulterentlastungszone rust or in the Weichzone in the mattress) make up the back. 
Some of our modern mattresses, with the former (hay and straw bags packed) but in common. 
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials, or at least their mixtures. 
Also in mattresses says the new magic word "organic". 
Instead of oil raw materials used in the manufacture of Polyurethan foaming increasingly naturelle oils - for example, Rizinus and soya oil. 
Soya is used well known by all manufacturers. 
"Organic mattresses, which is to say their nuclear materials from purely natural ," said Petr Vašíček by the company Tropico Plus. 
Naturstoffe but also be used in the production of mattress salaries - one of the first was Aloe Vera. 
You can take but also micro capsules, which spread the sleeping fresh forest or Lavendelduft. 
Here, too, makes a difference between a man and a woman. 
While the men "kühlender" is used plant extracts from birch leaves, so that the mattress to absorb the heat and cool the body, can have the salary for women "wärmende" effect. 
Extracts from red Paprikaschoten stimulate the blood circulation, the weaker sex is sleeping in the wohlig so warm. 
And today's favorite? 
Mattresses from Kaltschaum (he has greater Poren with destroyed cell structure and is therefore atmungsaktiver than standard Polyurethan and much more flexible). 
The combination of the various Steife (severity) of Kaltschäumen and Visco foaming create additional zones mattresses, who know exactly where to head, hip and heels. 
For a quality mattress, but 7000 kronor and fork. 
Gesundheitsmatratzen but usually are burdened with lower value added tax, as they apply as medical devices. 
The first Czech companies was Gumotex this advantage. 
You can see, the mattress and not to save the rust is so easily. 
Every now and then there are special offers from manufacturers and retailers who offer two for the price of a mattress. 
So the brand Magniflex the mattress Duofreeze with in the verstepptem Visco sparkling Memory for 11.990 CZK. 
The second you get free of charge. 
It was the Tempur material that launched the era of viskoelastischen sparkling substances with open cell structure and high density in almost kosmischem pace. 
No wonder, but they have been developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to the launch of enormous excessive impositions. 
Tempur will heat soft, entrenched in a cool environment it in turn. 
So it fits perfectly in the human body and distributed on the best way the body. 
It is therefore not only an ideal for the prevention of fire, but increased pressure generally sleep comfort. 
Viskoelastische sparkling substances are not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as, for example, used in particular Fußpolstern, allowing the legs and the vessels. 
Domestic manufacturers use the sparkling substances Eucatherm C, Twin Saver or similar products.
