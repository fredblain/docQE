Cheshire appeal on Twitter attention 
Half a dozen of them tippten in the riots in the courtroom. 
In the minutes, verschickten them on Twitter their reports on grausige testimonies. 
In the end, the defence, there were more than 140.000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and beds gekettete children in a house, the flare-up in flames. 
On Thursday, the process closely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was indicted, three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to find an official end, if the ruling on the death sentence, which the jury, falls. 
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted applications to court, the grounds for appeal and will employ the courts for years to come. 
One of the provozierendsten reasons is that it through the intense coverage of the process - through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporter - to a "circus" atmosphere and a widespread, swift penetration rebel details, so that the jury had been illegally by public outrage. 
This objection could lead the Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules in the courtroom is necessary. 
"As I have seen during this process, I believe that it is a real danger, if the arrival of the new technologies in the courtroom that every individual's right to a fair trial ," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' main defender. 
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue chamber of the Supreme Court, said last week the applications by decision succinctly when he said that the "new media" would be monitored carefully, and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion. 
But this was not the last word on this matter. 
For decades, the appeals court noted that the coverage of the notorious cases doubts about the fairness of the process. 
In his historic 1966 decision, the Supreme Court of the United States the ruling against Dr Sam, a Sheppard osteopaths from Cleveland, who is said to have killed his wife, lifted and said in its ruling that because of the New Media, "a carnival atmosphere in the courtroom ". 
Some believe that a television series and the game film "On the flight" is based on this crime. 
Some say lawyers, court appeals, which Mr. Hayes condemnation for half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary to ensure that the channels of communication from the courtroom, which at the time of the case were Dr. Sheppard still inconceivable. 
"There is a good reason, about the impact of new media in processes, which will be followed by a wider public, to be worried ," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut. His report says that it is imposed arbitrarily. 
Professor said Donohue, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of instant communications from the courtroom, could make the process fairer. 
The Twitter is just one of many that the lawyers of Mr. Hayes to discuss for years and thus delaying a condemnation. 
The defenders claim, for example, that have been regarded Mr. Hayes could already be, as the judges Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential judges by showed during the almost-certain selection grausige scene photos. 
Some of the judges said that photographs of the victims, Petit Jennifer Hawke, 48 years, and their TÃ¼chter, Hayley, 17 years, and thanking, 11 years, they have met with disgust. 
The defenders say, they would also make the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge mistakenly have exchanged a Juror, who was a critic of the prosecutor's office, and that he had exerted undue pressure on the ruling, as he had taken the unusual decision to make the jury over the weekend. 
The judges were not isolated. 
But their arguments about the influence of the extensive coverage of the process is perhaps the greatest interest. 
In a judgment that the challenge they have submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign for the office of the governor and the American Senate candidate. 
They argued that sparked the New media continually the flames of emotion on the case. 
"Such a daily crush of media Scandinavia, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom ," the lawyers wrote," has seen it before in New Haven, and perhaps not even across the country. " 
Its focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial. 
In interviews, some journalists that the assertion that these are rabble-rousing than direct news reports, which will be reimbursed more slowly, is a technikfeindlicher, the verarme reporting about future processes. 
But some lawyers, Appelationsgerichte would often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes need the Adaptation through the courts. 
Mr. Hayers lawyers reinforce this claim. 
In its objection to the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, which was lifted the sentencing of Dr Sheppard due to the reporting and made it clear that the new media, new rules. 
"This case ," they wrote," represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century. "
