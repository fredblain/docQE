Weak applause for China 
Taiwan's voters are coming slowly closer link to the mainland. 
What Taiwan from his big brother on the other side of the Straits? 
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, or 70% of all eligible voters, so that in the five city districts to elect mayors and city councils. This will be seen as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying jeou. 
The revolutionary business relations, einschl. A partial free trade agreement, Ma is itself a symbol for relations with the mainland. Its policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mainland for the first time since 1949. 
Ma has passed the test, but only barely. 
Although his party, the Kuomintang (KMT), three of the five mayors, they received a majority of votes. 
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the vote, the KMT won 45%. 
In a presidential election would have meant for Ma problems. 
Since his election two years ago was the vote of his party by about 8%. 
For the first time the DPP even with the KMT in town councils. 
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as truck convoys with rioters, flags schwenkende mass parades and only scantily clad dancers. 
There were even compulsory, mysterious assassination attempt. 
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, on the eve of the election in a speech to a KMT candidate, 
As a man from the crowd in the face. LIEN was wounded and killed an umstehender viewers. 
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter Lien kill or wanted to settle a dispute with the candidates. 
Regardless of the attack, according to Tsai Ing whom, the leader of the DPP, the election and the DPP in a bad light, which has caused the KMT more votes. 
China may have been the biggest winners of the campaign. 
Remarkably, there was little point in relations with the mainland. 
Instead, the candidates have plans to social housing and job creation. 
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat. 
For this reason, the KMT their relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground. 
But this time avoided the DPP to stir up feelings against Chinese. 
They responded to the new knowledge that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China. 
Ma, for its part, would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese its China policy. 
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy to attract Taiwan with economic incentives in the community. 
China sent a negotiator in Taipei, a summit to investment security and medical cooperation. 
Certainly it wants a political integration. But first things first. 
It is therefore prefer until after the presidential elections in 2012. 
The DPP has reinvented itself now. 
Two years ago it was weakened sharply: the former party leader Chen Shui bian sat in jail for corruption. 
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he began for the absolute independence. 
But under Tais reign, a new generation gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the professionals and the youth. 
Tsai took as a presidential candidate of the DPP support, such as Su Tseng chang under Chen. 
Their party is doing everything in order to show that they, too, is in a position to build close ties with Beijing. 
Tsai is planning a blacksmiths ideas as a contact point between the DPP and China, however, broad discussions. 
Tsai stated publicly that their party a "credible alternative" to Ma's • rapprochement with China. 
Chen seems very angry about this change. 
From his cell, he said, the candidate of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence. 
He called for the pragmatists Su even to renounce the presidential candidacy. 
Even without the interference of Chen's DPP difficult to choose their potential candidates. 
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis. 
Ma's values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidate wanted to campaign without him. 
The main reason for his unpopularity seem unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor. 
According to a KMT spokesman to reorganize his cabinet, and local institutions. 
The strong performance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan a rapprochement only restricted. 
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese economic cooperation with China as inevitable. 
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there are no return".
