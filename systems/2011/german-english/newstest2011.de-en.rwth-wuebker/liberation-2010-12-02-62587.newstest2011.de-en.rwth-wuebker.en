Métro Grand Paris: first financial vignettes 
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy on the Ile de France in full swing, it rains. 
At least in the discussions. 
Recall, in particular, the $23 billion for the Grand Paris metro, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris. 
In order to guide the start of construction of the SGP, has declared a state of the capital allocation of EUR 4 billion. 
In the theoretical scheme is the amount that would allow the SGP and to give the markets a portion of the financial sum on her Zweifachen. 
Today it is finally to first projections. 
The supplementary budget for 2010, looked at this morning by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly, which contains measures to raise the first part of this money. 
There are two ways: the creation of a special tax to Erschließund and higher taxation of office on the Ile de France. 
The former, remove Article 15 of the bill, "for the benefit of the public service broadcaster Société du Grand Paris". 
This is calculated: "The product of this tax amounts to EUR 117 million per year ." 
Zweitere is an overhaul of existing corporate taxation: "to modernize them in order to increase the resulting from their product and to entrust this increase the Société du Grand Paris". 
How much would it? 
A mystery. 
This amount is calculated not in the text. 
Of the 4 billion is far away. 
"It is said that the fiscal resources will be added to the 4 billion euro capital endowment, which will be paid by the state and the Société du Grand Paris gradually for the project ," says the explanatory statement. 
The SGP is not this system at all offensive. 
"Since the moment when we recorded revenue (the two taxes, that R.), the design over three years and then take heart from the 4 billion ," he says. 
"This will be noted in the budget and deducted gradually". 
The SGP estimated that will begin in 2013, taking 4 billion for the 2014 budget. 
This measure, which promised 4 billion people will be able to look for a long time, had a right to parliamentary debate. 
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
