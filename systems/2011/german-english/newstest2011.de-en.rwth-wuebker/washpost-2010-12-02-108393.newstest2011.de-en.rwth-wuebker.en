Khmer Rouge forced veterans to confrontation with the past 
In a dimly illuminated, betonierten class room with dirty and abblätternden walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School, the man who has built, the Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok. 
"Everyone loves Ta Mok." 
"He was a good leader and he cared about his people ," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years. 
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butchers ', the commander in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, the infrastructure and home to thousands of former soldiers. 
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, will be challenged longstanding supporters in Anlong Veng. 
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum victims public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime. 
In June, the government distributed a school book that tells for the first time a former child soldiers in the history of the Khmer Rouge. 
And in July, a Community Court of the United Nations and Cambodia for the first time, a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, was sentenced to 35 years in prison. 
With each of these developments, the fear among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, hindered their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia. 
"There is still reluctance and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything ," said Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime. 
"It was for life under the Khmer Rouge glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." 
"It is dividing families themselves." 
During the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, were executed an estimated 1.7 million people, or they died of disease, starvation or overwork. 
When the Vietnamese invaded in 1979 and overthrew the government Ied Pol Pot, fled the remnants of the regime and its military to the Cambodian border to Thailand. 
Here, they surrendered by December 1998, when the last movement. 
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary's guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok, the next generation in Anlong Veng. 
But in the mid-1990 s, when led by an UN-sponsored peace agreement in 1993 to the first democratic elections in the country, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, joining the government, which led to the Kapitulationen of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998. 
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not yielded, was arrested in 1999 by government forces in the Dangrek Mountain. 
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh, where he was waiting for his trial. 
As their patrons they no longer protected, ran most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters in the grinding poverty of rural Cambodia and many of the movement in nostalgic memories. 
Even if there were a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge their local government posts, because they niederlegten their weapons, the ordinary soldiers poor, illiterate farmers. 
"These people have benefited little from the capitulation ," said Sok Leang by the Centre for justice and reconciliation, in Cambodia, in Anlong Veng, public forums holds 
"They are enshrined in the agricultural utopian ideology of the regime." 
"They grew without any professional knowledge." 
Sor Lim, 55, who had joined in 1974 as a teenager, the Rhmer Montrouge, fought in the jungle to Anlang Veng before he niederließ, 1998, to lead a life as a poor rice farmer. 
"The life under the Khmer Rouge was good ," he said. 
"TA Mok has given to eat each." 
"But now, because we have to take care of themselves." 
The Khmer Rouge tribunal has raised concerns here. 
Early next year will try to court, Nuon Chea, president Khieu Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge ministers. 
The instructions of the court, it is the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities to condemn, but it is not said whether it will follow these four cases, further action. 
It has done little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng. 
Current media speculation has focused on the Chaem, 64 years, which have been during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's district manager in the province Manteay Meanchey. 
In 2007, it had told representatives of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, they launched the construction of the dam Trapeang Thma, a project that killed thousands of forced laborers probably. 
On a hot night in Chaem came from work in the fields of their wooden house on a dirty streets outside Anlong Veng. 
As the sun long shadow over the desiccated grass threw in the Chaem refused to discuss their past the Khmer Rouge. 
Should the court subpoena them, they would refuse to go, she said. 
"Cambodia is living in peace and stability ," she said. 
"There would be no more prosecutions, would be war." 
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has fled in 1878 by the Khmer Rouge, has also repeatedly warned that the situation is uncertain, would accuse the court more suspects, although experts and historians to discuss this. 
"Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past ," he said. 
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to move forward, said Chhang Youk by the Documentation Centre. 
"Reconciliation with the Rouge times means gathering the broken pieces ," he said. 
"It is our duty to put this broken parts together so that we can understand everything." 
The centre has created the first by the government approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75 page "history of Democratic Kampuchea". 
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history books for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages of the Khmer Rouge. 
How often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's links to the regime. 
Valeak touch, 19, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students to understand an important part of their history. 
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it. 
"My family in many parts of the book, and the court," he said. 
"They are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people are sentenced by the court." 
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process is complex and complicated, said Sok Leang. 
But the public forums, the school book and the court, and influence, "he said. 
Still, the Khmer Rouge, a powerful attraction. 
High in the mountains Dangrek leads a überwucherter shrubbery and with plastic waste verdreckter a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof. 
Pol Pot's body had been burned after his death in 1998 on a pile of tyres. 
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a mobile phone sales Rin roadside, said that they did not know much about the man who had been burned. 
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray ," she said. 
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later on the day they wanted to go to Pol Pot's final resting place, where it will take a more mature bush bananas - in the hope that he will bring their luck.
