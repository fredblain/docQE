Red Bull prevails in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens 
The car will be improved with a software in real time. 
Since moved in Red Bull in 2004 in the world of Formula 1, their history in this fine universe of the speed of surprises and successes. 
Initially, no one paid attention to the newcomer and sharply rising despite his background during the last few seasons, the sprint last November at the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso. 
Without the skills of the German pilots and world mayor Sebastian Vettel or reduce the strength of the engine of Renault, is the "secret weapon", the multinational Siemens Red Bull, and created a winning team, has become a legend. 
In reality, is a powerful software for simulation of trials, the German company 2007 for purposes not related to auto racing, on the market. 
This PLM described as a computer programme was for the development of assembling chains in factories around the world, energy plants and precise instruments. 
Is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is built, the more mistakes and to avoid unnecessary costs. 
Plm has the development of the cameras of Canon, the aircraft Sukhoi and the most famous of Nissan vehicles. 
Siegfried Rus worm, head of the industrial department of Siemens, said that the use of this software in the Formula 1 - factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time ," the changes and improvements that are found in the race and the tests that can design and implement. 
Russwurm contends that employed 1992 in the Rennst√§llen on average ten technicians who could bring in a season at most three or four improvements. 
In Red Bulls team employs 180 highly qualified young people. With powerful computer facilities they lead analyses and all sorts of changes to the racing cars. 
The Siemens managers, the PLM software is able to analyse all aspects of the racing cars of Red Bull and, with the exception of the engine, which explains why Renault solely responsible. 
The materials, the fuel, the Aero dynamism and security elements be changed. 
The changes can be transferred, thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclave in less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of the Simulators. 
The only limit that this crazy is technical perfectionism, the $40 million in 1 - a formula must spend for his race team in a season. 
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of his racing cars in a 50 km away from London. 
They are two buildings where visits - particularly of journalists - are limited. 
Everything that is happening is Top Secret. 
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber. 
But Red Bulls true formula 1 - zweifelslos hero is the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell. 
Behind the huge technological resources, which represents the energy drink manufacturers in the service of his participation in the race tracks, there are other players, whose support is invaluable and whose reputation is zero. 
The Technologichef the plant, Steve Nevey, stressed that could be said five years ago that the progress in the area of R & D for racing cars, with 50 percent and contributed to the victory of the pilots for the rest. 
Today we have changed the share values. The technology accounts for 85 percent of success, while it is estimated that the contribution of the pilots to 15 percent. 
Nevey acknowledges that can be replaced Vettel and Webber never by computer, because they "are not voraussagbare gladiators ."
