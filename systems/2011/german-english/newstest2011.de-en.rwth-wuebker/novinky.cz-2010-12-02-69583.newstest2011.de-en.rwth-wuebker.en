Two L- 159 light fighter planes out of a total of five, which has replaced the Czech Defense Ministry against the transport plane Casa C- 295 M, are flown on Tuesday in the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer EADS Casa - married. 
It is the first time that machines of this type in possession of a foreign army. 
Abroad, they were only in exercises or air shows. 
This is the flugfähige Zweisitzerversion L- 159 T1, which was run by the Czech army. 
The other three aircraft are einsitzige L- 159. 
These are einkonserviert currently in the Aero Vodochody, the facilitator of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over the last week. 
When they expediert aircraft physically from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, yet known. 
The einsitzigen fighter plane L- 159, in turn, have been singled out for the long term, these planes without further deposits and investment on the part of the department of the ministry. 
"The doppelsitzigen L- 159 T1 were exchanged in current condition and appearance ," said the newspaper Pejšek Právo. 
He added that the army will have to do without zweisitzige fighter planes, as the Ministry of Defence signed in May 2009 with 200 million Aero Vodochody a treaty on the conversion of four unnecessary L- 159 to zweisitzigen version. 
A new plane, the army in July, the second wants to take it by the end of this year. 
According to pejšek has committed itself to EADS, the fighter planes in the equipment of the NATO countries. 
"In the Treaty is clearly stated that the company EADS customers of the L- 159 aircraft and that these should be used for training pilots of NATO countries. 
"It is therefore up to the customer, in what way he realized the matter", Pejšek. 
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L- 159. 
The barter of five L- 159 against a transport plane Casa and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek. 
The Ministry of Defence had advertised at the time of purchase a tender procedures, but spoke directly to EADS. 
The defense argued at the time, this exchange will support the future export of L- 159 abroad. 
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which they used only 24, wanted to sell it. 
The purchase of aircraft Casa should have, in fact, a legal process. 
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence, at the European Court of Justice. The reason? It would have had to select the aircraft on the basis of a ganzeuropäischen tender and not be addressed by a single manufacturer. 
The army has taken three aircraft Casa, the last to arrive within fourteen days at the Kbely Airport.
