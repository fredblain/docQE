"This means in principle that can expect high-quality government officials now believe that the laws do not apply to them ," she added. 
Paul Coggins, main defenders of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview on Monday that he had a telephone call from a prosecutor and another the next day, in which he was told that the Ministry will make no complaints against his client. 
Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator, as his office in a statement on Wednesday repeated again, "acted in accordance with the law ." 
Mr. Coggins refused, the legal arguments that he had made to the prosecutors to explain in more detail. 
"I am not, in the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice and me. Let me just say this: We believe that made the right decision to have ," he said. 
Last month the Federal Election Commission to suspend the investigation because of a separate lawsuit by the ethics group, have breached a payment of $96.000 by Mr. Ensigns parents to the Hamptons against the federal election law. 
The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money is something other than a gift. 
NV Energy, a big company in Nevada, which has long supported the senator, was one of the firms in which Mr. Hampton was thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyists work. 
A documented E mail from December 2008, after the company got Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, had a meeting with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was at the Interior Ministry because of a thing "anklopfe". 
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and other customers from Nevada, Allegiant Air, agreed to lunch and asked the transport ministers to agree on a meeting on behalf of the airline, after those Mr. Hampton to lobbying.

In the announcement that Mr. Ensign no longer be the target of police investigations, said his press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, hope the senator that the Ethics Commission very quickly the example of the Ministry of Justice, and einstelle his investigation.
