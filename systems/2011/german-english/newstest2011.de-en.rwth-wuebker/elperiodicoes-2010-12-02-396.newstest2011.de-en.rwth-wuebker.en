Puigcercós, with a nod to the Carod shoulders of peace in the ERC 
The Republican leader of the party a secret ballot on his continuance in office. 
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the General Assembly principle. 
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for the umpteenth time, an internal rebellion in the ranks of the following the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes rudderless ERC. 
The party chairman is aware that his threat on the shoulders of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod Rovira. But he also knows that weakened the influence of this sector today as her mentor, and he will not bring the same headaches, like other former currents. 
Therefore, trying to win the leader of Esquerre with a nod to the new critics, which would secure his position until the next local elections. 
For a start announced yesterday that could make the region more than 200 members of the Council of ERC about his stay in office. 
With ballot papers, not with superior hand. 
If the Carodisten wanted to miss the Präsidenen a parking ticket, could they do this without fear of reprisals. 
Indeed, the boss wants to avoid the impression of division, as well as the submission to his person. 
In several interviews he reiterated that he would not feel with half of the votes plus one, and he added without giving any percentage values, an outcome "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good. 
The Carod someone close call from the president more than just the party office. Insufficient gesture, as Puigcercós controlled the supreme organ of the congresses. 
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to the promotion of resignations, they agree with the Board's action plan between now and May. 
They expect that, in the drafting of the document on strategic direction that the leadership on 18 will present to the Council, to be able to participate. 
Its intention is to underwrite Puigcercós. In return to this promise, the Congress in the autumn of 2011, what does the leader for a fact. 
The party leader of the ERC is of the view that the "Polyphonie" pity the stability and he is seeking once and for all, to bring the organization to wash their dirty linen behind closed doors. 
In this sense, the article, signed the Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog, symptomatic. 
With this in mind, this is a Puigcercós ideologue, the holders of Innovació it for a fact that the party chairman "in exchange for various objectives". 
He was one of five, two of which are in the foreground. 
Firstly, the "restructuring" of the board, so that this represents at least 90 percent of party members that the inclusion of new faces from Carods environment. 
The second could be the big news. 
Huguet proposes ERC should abandon the principle of the General Assembly as a functioning. 
So he verfechtet a reform of the statutes, which should enable the congresses of elected delegates. 
By the end of the General Assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós' team who fought in the last two conferences on how obsessed. 
Indeed, on the bebenden assembly of 2008 the party leadership with the review of the General Assembly, on a Congress that should concern itself with the reform of the statutes,. 
This date is yet to come, as infogle was not the internal Aufruhe of recent years tackling this issue. 
Now, without the critical sectors on the wings, could be the time to take up this matter once and for all.
