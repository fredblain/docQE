Durchgesickertes U.S. document Moscow portrayed as a port of corruption 
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and they are a part of the bribes and protection money, out walking, to the Kremlin. As reported in February, the American Embassy in Russia in a memo. 
Both police and the state security service, high protection money, so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says. 
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also by organized criminal gangs. 
Each layer of bureaucracy - Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as a "vertical of power '- takes its share of the money that is now moving up the ladder. 
The memo, which was sent out under the name of John Beyrle ambassador to Washington, was published on Tuesday by Wiki Leaks on its website. 
The memo is based on sources, whose names have been edited. 
It was written, while Yuri Luzhkov, Moscow's mayor, and accused him of corruption. 
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is little evidence that would have been demolished in the meantime. 
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a construction company, known for years have rejected accusations of corruption, and he has won numerous libel against such accusations. 
In September, he told a Russian television station, when he was asked for a documentary, which suggests that he is corrupt: "It is crazy, it is bad, it is dirty." 
Take the believe an incredibly large number of Russians that their society is corrupt. The polls have shown. 
But it is extraordinary that, as happened in the report of the ambassador, individuals, and it is unheard of that happening by a diplomat of a foreign country. 
"The direct link to the government of Moscow with crime has meant that some of them as" disturbing "and come to the conclusion that the government is more like a Kleptokrat acts as a government ," the memo. 
"Criminal elements" enjoy a kryshna "(a term from the world of criminals and the mafia, which literally means" umbrella "or protection), the police, state security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor, as well as by the whole of the Moscow government bureaucracy. 
Experts have discovered a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow. 
"Luzhkov is at the top." 
"The FSB and MVD, the militia are on the second stage." 
"The least reduced criminals and criminal inspectors at the lowest level." 
"This is an inkompetentes system, in which criminal groups in some areas a gap, because the city offers no help." 
The report says that the FSB money by the largest firms and arrested by the police, the small business people. 
A source, is, "said that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best for the protection of the FSB and MVD (and not by organised crime), as they do not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law." 
"This is why not ask the protection by criminal gangs, as in the past." 
The memo noted that, while the collection of funds, the protection of very modest, no; even those who pay to be arrested. 
Those who do not pay, closed their business very quickly - on the basis of one or other Vorwands. 
Medvedev has spoken several times to fight corruption, has said that he has made little progress. 
The message of the memo contains descriptions of men who with suitcases that were probably full of money, go to the Kremlin. 
"In his fight against corruption must leave Medvedev on the bureaucrats ," said Satarov named Georgy, director of In, a Moscow think tank, in a recent interview. 
"But he is part of the bureaucracy." 
"It is not part of the political class, because there is not a political class in Russia." 
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable. 
Nationwide, accusing the corruption, costing Russia more than $300 billion per year. 
The country ranks 154th in a recent study of the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparence International (countries of "the least corrupt" to "most corrupt" listed). 
The revelation of the memos of the American Embassy, which happened after Moscow time late at night, will certainly displeasure within the Russian government, although, as can be accused Luzhkov of Moscow's mistake, it can be for the Kremlin is also an opportunity to assert that will resolve the problems. 
In an interview with Larry King on CNN claimed that Putin could be the Wiki Leaks documents a forgery and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats have named Medvedev Batman and Robin. 
"The truth is that our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country ," he said. 
"But to be honest, we would have expected that this would happen with such arrogance, such pressure and so unethical manner, you know."
