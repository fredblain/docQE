Zapatero and the red line of Germany 
Berlin has opted for the favour of, keeping the euro, but at the same time, conditions for the whole of the European Union. 
The tension on the markets have triggered a two-fold response from the government. 
On the one hand, has produced José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and micro enterprises, the regulation of temporary work agencies or the removal of the EUR 426 of support for the unemployed, not unemployment benefits, to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of the Barajas airport and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery. 
On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former government minister Felipe González, the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible for the current crisis herausbeschwört said. 
How to understand these events? 
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their public relations. 
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro. 
In Germany, a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future, which clashes with the maintenance of the old traditions of most of its partners. 
In the face of the resistance in Europe begins to spekuliern in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis. 
The first is that a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south to leave the euro area. 
Second: the reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - though it sounds now for science fiction - supported by a majority of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population. 
The third: a restructuring of the Eurostat according to German proposals. This means that more macroeconomic control; strict financial management; penalties for countries that exceed the targets; möglichereweise the default of some countries, as well as the extension of the costs of adaptation measures on the private sector. 
The German position is clear and, for some time. That is why there are no excuses. 
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission incentives for deficits, and the German government is a constitutional reform from the sleeves in order to prevent this from 2016. 
It was the first signs of the divergence between what was necessary for Germany (strict fiscal plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. 
The second message, the Central European country, as hinausschob Merkel's decision to rescue Greece. 
At that time was heavily criticised. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion completely opposed to a bailout of Greece. 
Finally, Merkel in recent days October anew with a clear position. It calls for a reform of the European Union agreements to facilitate the rescue of a country and at the same time, the private lenders to pay a portion of the costs. 
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, Ireland crisis and everything was as follows. 
But her proposal, if somewhat sweetened. In the coming months we will be in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures from 2013 onwards. 
Germany has drawn a red line to. 
It says all that - even if they have to be taken now unpopular measures - there will not be as of this date the functioning of the euro. 
2013 will be the year of birth of a new monetary area, in which the offending countries should be severely punished, may be forced to declare themselves bankrupt and, in this case, the private sector is part of the costs. 
Germany shows us that we must take a hard line growth, with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances. 
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it has been led by Spain in boom times, will not be tolerated. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would do badly to understand it. 
It is not only about runterzufahren the government deficit by the year 2013 to three percent. 
The demands are much tougher. 
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, is to cheat ourselves. 
I hope that the current turbulence in more calm. 
And the opportunities that will be offered until will use the spring of 2013. 
It seems that Zapatero has understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the major companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that, despite the criticism of Merkel's hypothesis to create order in their own house, had their way. 
But the Germany of red line is there, and it does not seem that would change. 
Among the options under consideration is that we would have to leave the country with little serious cramped euro area, cannot be ruled out. 
In this case could say Germany still, it warned us.
