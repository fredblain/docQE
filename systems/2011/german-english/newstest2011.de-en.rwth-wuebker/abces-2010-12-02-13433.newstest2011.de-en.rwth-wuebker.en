The Catalan cell, Al Qaeda thousands of passports 
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand 
The seven of the police, the intelligence of the Barcelona police arrested Pakistanis and the Nigerians were from Thailand, dschihadistische cell, the different Al Qaeda groups, including the Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) "and" Laschkar e Tauba "(Let) - the latter was the Rin car bombings in Mumbai, which called for 2008 106 deaths - supplied with passports. 
The Spanish Interior Minister, these studies are very important, which goes so far that he assured, with "Operation Kampai "the counterfeiting of Al Qaeda worldwide" weakened "and" thus their ability to act ". 
The researchers estimate that in the two years, in which the cell in Catalonia, thousands of passports have been sent to Thailand, where these falsified and then to the groups that make up the criminal Galaxie Al Qaeda, have been sent out, so that their "fighters" were able to cross the borders of European and other Western countries. 
The cell which have been uncovered is not the only one of the jihadist network, which was active in Europe. That is why we have contributed to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units to the investigation. It is not inconceivable that in the territory of the EU in the next few days to similar attacks like the one that was carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona, will come. 
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Mohammad Ahmad, Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerians Babatunde Agunbiade arrested) was carried out in Thailand, another in the Pakistanis have been arrested Muhammad Athar Butt and Zee Han Ehsan Butt and the Thais Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung. 
They were guided by the Bangkok from Spain and other European countries registered cell. 
The Catalan network - some of it had been made in the year 2009 - stole especially tourists passports in accordance with the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front". 
This means that the documents be issued in the name of men aged 25 to 45 years and had to be valid for several years; they were allowed to have no visa stamp. 
In research circles stresses that could be demonstrated no connections between the detainee in Catalonia and the attack in Mumbai, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e Tauba" was stolen, one of the recipients of the groups in Spain and then in Thailand forged passports. 
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that had been sent a few days before the attack in Catalonia, a money transfer company several thousand dollars in purchasing Prepcom Aid cards for mobile phones "invested", which were later by the members of the "commandos" that caused the lives of 106 people, have been used. 
The police have seized an extensive documentation.
