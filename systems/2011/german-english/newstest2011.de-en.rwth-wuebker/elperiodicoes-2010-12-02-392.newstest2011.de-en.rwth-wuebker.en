On the hunt for Wikileaks chief 
Obama appoints a heavy responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new revelations. 
Interpol is a red warning to persecution and detect Assange. 
Everything with WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, who is a complicated maze, in which to investigate the facts only difficult. 
Yesterday there was an Interpol "red" warning "locating and persecution" of Assange. 
However, it is not a traditional orders to arrest. 
In addition, it is not new, it dates from 20 November. 
It has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the allegations of sexual abuse, which must face the Australians in Sweden.

"If it can be proved that it was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the United Nations and has not fulfilled by the United States signed international agreements, they would have to resign ," he said. 
His opinion was yesterday from the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, condemned the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd ." 
"I am not sure why we should value the opinion of a type with a website ," he told the CNN. 
Obama himself has a heavy responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, tasked with preventing new documents revelations. 
The attempt by the spokesman of the Pr√§sidenden Barack Obama, Assange to pay less attention, contrary to the views of the conservative politicians and commentators in recent days. 
Congressman Peter King, who will lead from January chaired the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility to put on the Wikileaks list of terrorist organizations, "in order to seize their money and everyone who supports or contributes to pursue." 
Tom Flanagan, adviser to the Canadian Minister Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to his statement, Assange "murdered" revoked. 
"Obama needs to him in a target and not use a manned aircraft or so what."
