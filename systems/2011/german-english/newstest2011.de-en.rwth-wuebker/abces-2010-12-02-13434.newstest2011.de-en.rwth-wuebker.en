PP of Ma's calls for a postponement of the tax agreement 
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez Camacho, took the opportunity to present their Artur Mas personally conditions in support of his term as prime minister of the Generalitat. These are no different from those already during the election campaign, and let the primacy of economic recovery and the omission of regionalist independence adventures, like a financial compensation agreement, which intends to propose the regionalist leaders at the height of his mandate. 
The leader of the Catalan Popular Party began with the safety of Artur Mas, which awarded her the 18 Members who they won last Sunday - a paragraph, which is more than enough to feel. Because the candidate of the civil CiU regionalist party relies on the fact that contains at least one of the opposition parties to vote when he took office. 
The future alliances seeking the regionalists in the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Congress, depend on a possible entente with the PP. The talks, the Mas currently with the other party leaders, however, revolve around Catalonia. 
As far as the leader of the party PPC, claims that the term "all discourses, which affect the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on the financial balance between State and the Autonomous Region - as in the Basque country, and the party's chief of CiU even a referendum, to be employed. 
The two leaders have in common is that they exaggerated the political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and want to abolish the inheritance and gift tax. 
With the details of the negotiations on the inauguration of Ma's focus on the part of the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat. 
Mas has already Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - announced the tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today, he will Puigcercós with Joan (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana) come together.
