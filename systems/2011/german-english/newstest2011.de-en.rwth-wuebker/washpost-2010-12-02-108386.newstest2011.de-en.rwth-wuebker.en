Can combine courtesy that which divides us? 
After a campaign of epithets and negativity broke out this week little civility in Washington. 
It is the harbinger of a real Zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion, before returning to quickly to the parties in the capital? 
The meeting Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress brought no breakthrough in the big issues, during the so-called "lame duck" session, the meeting at the end of a government in which decisions are taken no longer had to employ. 
After all, what we hear, it was neither to govern a polite discussion between the two sides of a consideration of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partisan collection points. 
The public meeting of the deficit commission's president on Wednesday was civilized, despite the political differences that exist between the members. 
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months a mutual respect obtained of the ideological divide that separates the members from each other. 
This is hardly enough to claim that it has entered a new era of cooperation. 
Both sides are now in a test phase, in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise, even while trying to weigh up the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters, according to a new parties warfare. 
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants at a minimum requirements or charges. 
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to be a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, could expect. 
No matter whether taxes, donations, or health benefits, the two sides are miles apart. 
Last but not least, voted in the November election, at least for a short time mild. 
"No question, the tone has changed ," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, which is now for the" Ethics and Public Policy Center "works. 
"This is inevitable after elections. 
Elections give partisan passions, the die again. 
And that is a good thing. " 
In some areas, particularly in those who are on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. " 
Bush's tax cuts end up at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it. 
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether temporarily or permanently. 
It is also expected to reach a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that people think that the favored tax cuts for the rich, while they support unemployed workers. 
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House has increased optimism that these issues during the "lame duck" session and at the same time to ratify the new START treaty. 
But warns William glass tone of the Brookings Insitution that a successful cooperation in pressing issues of the lame duck session "should not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation between the parties, if the new 112th Congress convened in January. 
Instead, he says, is a phase of the Nicht√ºbereinstimmens more likely, perhaps even inevitable. 
"After the things that need to be done, done, will turn these short-term psychology in confrontation ," he said. 
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - the courtesy to gain their cooperation. 
"I do not see much of what is happening today until 2012, when Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012 ," he said. 
The reasons have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Teeparty voters who were their education. 
However, Republican leaders are also concerned about the fact that they play poker too high, they know that they must try to fulfill their pledges to cut government spending and the healthcare reform law. 
This party lines are already in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Commission's deficit, which include a tax reform and raising some taxes and raising the retirement age and reduce government spending. 
The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have assumed that one of the toughest jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, so that the deficit issue on the public agenda that cannot be ignored. 
But they need within the Commission in 14 of the 18 votes in order to make its plan to official recommendation and they are struggling to come even close to this figure. 
The biggest opposition in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters, today at least, there is little room for compromise or little sympathy. 
Galton says two phases in the battle between the White House and Republicans in Congress. 
The first battle will be held next year in the form of party clashes, if Obama Republicans in the state budget, defying the taxes and the health system, followed later by a phase of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation. 
What will lead to this change? 
The public opinion. 
It is shown that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, the majority of Americans still that the two parties together. 
If confrontation in a dead end, as happened in 1995, both parties need to be careful about the public reaction. 
Who will always doomed to lose, will change the course and must find a compromise. 
This may indeed be an optimistic view. 
Partisanship and polarization are today than in the mid-1990 s, and they seem more ideological divide between Obama and the Republicans in Congress at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. 
At the same time, the activists of both parties in 2010 as a mere prelude to a much greater consistency in 2012 elections. 
In this sense, may have the courtesy which will be taken this week, will be welcomed by many Americans. 
But it will require both sides very much more effort to find a common denominator in the issues that divide the two still.
