" 
The ambassador also expressed his concern about the way in which the PP in this matter. 
"Despite their generally pro-American stance our experience teaches us that will no doubt the PP, a suggestion that the government Zapatero's actions of the United States, which could be interpreted as a possible human rights violations, have deliberately ignored or tolerated, will propose capital, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the government of the United States ," he stresses.
