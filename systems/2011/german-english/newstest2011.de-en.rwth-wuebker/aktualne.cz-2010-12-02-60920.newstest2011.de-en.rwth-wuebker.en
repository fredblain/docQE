The tenants of Bakala: it is an appeal in the oven - but pays higher rent 
An older man untersetzter leaves the clients of the center of the society RPG Byty "coal Barons" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental housing in the Czech Republic. 
Under the arm of a file with three new rental contracts to three apartments, for their own and the homes of his daughters and his son, who is serving a prison sentence. 
All three were in the framework of the so-called "deregulation" increased the rent. 
Instead of SEK 3500 monthly rent to fork the son next year for a 2 bedroom apartment with kitchen in the second category 4100 kroner. 
"There is no heat in the apartment, fluent in hot water and a simple coal fireplace, if he angered the finger at the new rental agreement's son, he has signed a power. 
"But what I saw signed ," he explains upset half and half resigned. 
The citizens association Byty $url {OKD.cz}, the new rental conditions as "illegitimate and immoral," advises the tenants to sign new contracts and until 7 December to wait when it intends to publish guidance as to how things are proceeding against such contracts. 
But the man to win only. 
"It says, the other", he makes a benighted face. 
The Ostrava region will be a large "deregulation" laboratory. 
After the New Year is this deregulation most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants pay no rent marketable. 
Aktuálně.cz decided, therefore, this "laboratory" to visit in person. 
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday packed. 
Right next to the door of the bodyguards of a security agency and a call. 
"Rent" 2011, is a special Tastfeld on the touch screen. 
Briefly touched upon and disgorge the device a list of numbers. 
We barely have the number "157" and piepst deciphered them on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting area. 
Half a hour later, the series. 
A little later an older couple walks into the waiting room to ask after the rent, but the onslaught in the waiting room is apparently not even the new rent. 
Most people are here to solve the problems, repairs, insurance and so on. 
From the middle of November fly in Ostrava region of the Kuverts with new rental contracts with most of the tenants out of a total of 44.000 homes in the portfolios of the RPG in the mailboxes. 
The RPG Byty proposes them in the letter, a rent increase from about 15 to 38 percent. 
The special counters for the new rent clients in the centre is open since 18 November. 
"The action is just over a week, that is to say, this is just the beginning", the women behind the counter after a moment of hesitation, as the "client", as a journalist. 
The deregulation and Bakalas former miners' homes are a hot topic. 
Before the elections had taken up the Ostrava originating from Parliament Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek from the ČSSD this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of them. 
"Twenty years I want a new floor." 
"Not even ne besch. Wc glasses were able to change it ," the man I mentioned earlier. 
Until now, the staff, especially pensioners on counters, in order to see whether they receive the promised moderation really tenants, which promises RPG when they enter the supply of specialist in time. 
The benefit of a half of February reduced rent will come from the other tenants, the new rental agreement until 15 December to sign. 
Until now, "deregulation" counters in Havířov but everything else, overloaded than demand. 
"Yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because of this ," officials estimate the counters. 
Rpg offered both on their Web sites, as well as wall panels individual rental agreements, where it is needed. 
Should the rent parties but the new rent, they will be determined by an independent court. 
"This is not a threat, it is the only possible and legitimate legal approach ," said RPG on its Web sites. 
"No one is in court ," says one of the staff of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client center gives it at least partly right. 
"I have (13.000 kroner), of which 5.000 stay with me for dinner, where should I find the money for a court dispute ," he says. 
Then the employees but uncertain. 
"Let us see." 
"Mr Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so people are still waiting for ," she warns. 
The rent regulated ends in most of the Czech Republic to the New Year 2011 and RPG Byty according to the rent increase an economic necessity. 
"The existing level of rent is not clear to the maintenance of the housing fund ," said Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of society RPG Byty - and the resentful of tenants, neglect of the housing fund is the homeowners the main reason for the increase in rent. 
While RPG could invest in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the rents collected four billion in homes, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 will be 5.2 billion. 
At the großformatigen LCD display on the ceiling of the cushion bellies in the waiting room of Havířov appear to keep a few brilliant red information. 
"The rent increases in 2011 at 15% and 31 200 homes, which means more than 90% of the homes of RPG." 
"Always means a maximum of CZK 7.50 per square metre and month ," is to read on the LCD screen. 
Only 400 homes from the portfolio of RPG increased the rent at 38 percent. 
"In these cases is the increase in extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre ," argues RPG. 
In 2600, the rent next year on the same amount. 
Rpg Byty promises that the deregulation of the skyrocketing rents, but gradually within four and eight years. 
What's more, given the company a further commitment: all revenue from the rent increase (see diagram) wants to put the company back into the homes, especially in heat savings - in new windows and insulation. 
But, as a priority should be given to those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
