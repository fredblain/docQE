A global plan for renewal of the lighting 
The U.N. has yesterday in Cancún a plan to renew the lighting of households, Trade and Industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (CFCs), equivalent to almost a third of the additional reduction, which must be implemented in order to stabilize the earth's climate by 2020. 
This ambitious plan takes his position in the concrete steps of major projects, the implementation of the U.N. in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by developed countries. 
After yesterday's plan would be the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) can be avoided, because of the lighting of the earth, CFCs, if the weißglühenden pears, which has a monopoly of between 50% and 70% in the market, by fluoreszierende or, better still, by light-emitting diodes (LED) would be replaced. 
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. 
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of global vehicle fleets. 
In Copenhagen last year had to exhaust the big emitters like the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans, which should lower the global CFC emissions from 53 to 49 Gt Gt. 
This review should be deducted, however, still 5 Gt to stabilize between now and the year 2020 climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius, in order to prevent this is out of control. 
In the weißglühenden pears show 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% of the light. 
With the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen, reduced energy consumption by 75%, with the new LED bulbs this energy demand once again twice. 
The Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen keep on average between 6000 to 10.000 hours. 
The new LED bulbs, such as those expressed by the manufacturer Philips this week on the market, the company has also participated in the study - have a life expectancy of 25.000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a weißglühende pear, which gives an indication of the savings of the replacement plan, which is to be applied in 100 countries. 
In addition to the fact that iese completely new light bulbs very little heat, they can work with a rule. 
And they contain no mercury. 
Several experts have pointed out that Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves, because they contain mercury and therefore must dispose of hazardous waste, which is not always possible in the developing world, except the producers are an adoption agency. 
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal plants that emit more mercury to produce the weißglühenden pears wasted electricity. 
In the United States alone, these coal plants 25.000 tons of mercury annually. 
The report sets out in detail the profits, which would account for each country, thanks to this international program. 
Indonesia would save as, for example, a billion dollars annually in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose edification Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
