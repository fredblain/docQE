More and more parents want people controls, in order to have the kids under control 
The fear for their own children grow and consider more and more parents to monitor them via GPS. 
The system that was originally invented to tracking down cars that can travel is just as well, would also be helpful in such cases, such as Janatková spurlosen recently in the disappearance of the nine-year Anička. 
The device is about as big as a packet of cigarettes but soon may not be greater than a wristwatch. 
Many people in the case of the missing Anička and as they consider ways and means looking to protect their children. 
For the price of a violation of their privacy. 
"We are trying to say that this is not Herumspionieren, but an effective means to reduce the likelihood that there will be a tragedy," Petr Pilin by society Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market. 
"I admit that it can come in individual cases of abuse of such devices, for example, if someone is in the pocket, without that he knows, but we had there been no such case." 
"Most customers buy it for security reasons ," adds Pilin. 
In his view, should know the child but always, what purpose the "box" and how they are used in an emergency. 
The child psychologist Dana Bočková points out, however, that a child, while it may not be such a thing, it simply abdicating its. 
"Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to certain things, if they want to be controlled." 
"The mobile phones initially gave birth to the parents' high expectations, but they can be shut down, just as easily, as these new controls ," says Ms Bočková. 
It is also questionable whether helps such a facility in the event of an attack. 
"The kidnappers planned kidnappings controlled virtually always whether the child has any electronics, which could be located." 
"Today is the mobile phone." 
"If such controls would look for wider use, they also, as it would be accompanied by massive advertising sales safe." 
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always one step ahead ," says the psychologist. 
She admits, however, that may be similar devices in a sudden attack by a paedophile helped. 
Roberta Čech by society RC monitoring, according to the tracking services for both cars, as well as for people who can help the existence of such equipment, even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack. 
"The device can adjust that it plays the position in certain intervals." 
"Even if it were to be destroyed immediately, at least the final position of the person concerned." 
"The more expensive equipment is even a tendency knife, that is, if you hinfällt motionless and breaks down, the device sends a warning for the position ," said Mr Čech. 
In his view could carry out similar services also smart phones with navigation, einzuspielen only a special software. 
The problem with the current positioning devices is that this is either in matchbox size, supporters are similar to or smaller mobile phones. 
There is always the risk that they will lose. 
Mr Pilin of the Macro Weil, according to testing in the present devices that look like ordinary digital clocks. 
"This has the advantage that do not recognise the potential attackers at all that it is a surveillance and tracking equipment. 
"He notes that only after a certain period of time, which gives the police a head start ," he adds. 
No matter what the direction of development - to Armbändern or supporters, always use the same technology, such as the vehicle tracking. 
The combination of positioning function with the help of the GPS system (as well as in the case of Ms in the car) and the role of a mobile phone, which reports the current position.
