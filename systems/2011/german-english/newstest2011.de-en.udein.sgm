<seg id="1"> What they should do which ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague are familiar neither with Voldemort, nor the 'Konditorei. " </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new Office of the gentlemen of the capital, from the ranks of ČSSD obviously certain language barriers need to be overcome, in order to be able to understand their old and new members from the ODS in Prague advice and representation at all in the town. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has members of the new Council from ČSSD cut off times a little ," as they have control the notorious slang that has become popular in recent years, in which the present coalition partners, in Prague at the helm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The encoded vocabulary, which was introduced in the mattered era of Mayor Pavel Bém of the Prague political elite, is borrowed from some of the most prominent actors and Causae situations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Surprisingly, showed that the new councils fall in relation to these new notions something in the dark. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The claim they, at least. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Voldemort "who is?" </seg>
<seg id="8"> "No idea." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am more a newcomer in the Prague policy ', Lukáš Kaucký, the new Office of the Commissioner for Culture responded to the test of" godfather's words. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But also the Office of the Commissioner Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar manner. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example, to the concept of "golf hole." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "The is the only expression of those who put me here that I would use and again." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "I think that not a lot of slang." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> From the vocabulary, the daily newspaper Aktuálně.cz had published in June this year, before the election, Congress of the ODS, the editorial editors pickte six terms, particularly those which are notoriously linked with the Prague government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Socialists should the terms' Voldemort, "" most Prague golf hole, "" in the Konditorei go "and" bull neck ,"" betrayal of the capital, "and" verblechen "define. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Prague Office three gentlemen agreed to the test, the fourth - Mr Weinert, the future head of the Prague education system promised - firstly of its participation in the talks, was declining but then not even the phone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The fifth council Mr, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test in the first place. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "I don't care about these things are, as the Civic Democrats to talk to each other, and I am not passing judgement." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "I think it is important, as we understand ourselves in the framework of our programmes," he responded. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> As has been suggested, would have realised Lukáš Kaucký in the abovementioned headline supposedly not that Bém mayor, Roman Janoušek is the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The term 'Voldemort "says Kaucky absolutely nothing and that the only word he erriet the test correctly," was the greatest Prague golf hole. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "It is the tunnel Blanka 'says Kaucký, added to security but still," but I know this more from the newspapers. " </seg>
<seg id="23"> And in jest: "I will probably show a language course." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The "Gulf hole" will then not only of matador Karel Březina, but also the Office of the Commissioner for the Environment Lukáš Plachý right as Blanka entziffert tunnel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Both Social Democrats also know, however, for whom the term stands and Voldemort Lukáš Plachý even knows where is this figure and in that way, what does it mean to be "to be moving in the Konditorei." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "I believe, in other words, to go to any old Prague restaurant works' Plachý is fairly close to solving the puzzle, when we know that this is the headquarters of Janoušeks firms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Březina he asserts, in line with, but this knowledge could have achieved more from the newspapers than this vocabulary own him. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Judging by the test participants after, it seems, under the Social Democrats, in fact, to be no similar eingebürgerten slang. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I have asked my colleagues, but it appears that there is no such thing as us." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "We would call on us by name, and then we also use words or nickname," the Chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský says - loosely from his party "Hulda." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "I was at school (Bříza Birke named), but I do not know whether my colleagues mention as" us tells Karel Březina his nickname. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Deník Aktuálně.cz the newspaper has tried out the names and see as - he works. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Mr Weinert Office is for the party of the kind of "one's grandfather" or less friendly to the "Old" the representative Miroslav Poche that made before the election by the party machinations Sponsorship attention is being called by some colleagues' Igráček " (famous Czech Lego's figure). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Nickname are the only thing that allowed the social democrats, in whose use of language. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Hulínský it may supposedly if it is called 'Hulda "but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman. </seg>

<seg id="13"> The investor, the wealthy industrialists Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a new building, but in the end, he agreed to the idea Gaudís to an unusual and even cheaper reconstruction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The rental house Casa Batlló devised, Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone. </seg>
<seg id="15"> He cooperated with the architect Josep Maria Jujol. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Not tollste bed frame, but the quality of the surface area lies - so, mattress and rust are the good bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> These must complement but harmonious to meet the wishes of the specific user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In selecting many things play a role - the weight, the size of the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of Schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Just as important the Interieur in which mattress and rust are subordinate is. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a heated Wochenendhaus, not regularly, will be suited Latexmatratzen are not good, since they need much longer "warm to be." </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition, they are much more difficult than usual a polyurethane mattresses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And - they should be changed on a regular basis. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If they have not actually enough Entlüftungskanälchen in essence and are on a strong record, moisture in congestion increases, so it is not impossible that is under their Schimmel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the election also have a role to play, of course, what we are used to. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Who has been a long time in a foreign country, where very high with mattresses soft layer usual, will be able to get used to the difficult low mattress with hard surface. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "All Eishockeyspieler who have returned from the NHL, have complained to me that they are not able to sleep more right." </seg>
<seg id="14"> Abgeschundenen "on their shoulders and waists, they simply need a soft layer from Visco's sparkling (Memory Foam - a form of memory's Polymer)." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I commend them including sugar sick people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the 'information' from ligaments and skin badly," declared Hadamcziková Sylva, specialising in padded furniture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> I have therefore concerned many Eishockeyspielern years ago, but also other customers that mattresses with Visco's sparkling (Memory Foam). </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses provide the Tempur manufacturers and others, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer of Tropico." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And we need not necessarily be a famous Eishockeyspieler to learn to appreciate the advantages of Visco's foam. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" actually works quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The sparkling optimalisiert said its severity and absorbierten form in the heat, in other words, it is downright schmiegt on warm body. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Anywhere it pinches in the middle of the night are not rolling around like after a major fight. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It simply sleep much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The sparkling viskoelastische also offers protection against Dekubitus (gangrene). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In the election of Matratzengröße should be the body size still include the length of Fußsohlen, i.e. around 21 to 34 cm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Man and woman are to the 180 cm high, need as a 210 to 220 cm long bed. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Each Schläfer should at least stand 90 cm is widely available, so together 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In Einzelbetten, for example, on singles, 120 to 140 cm are appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The comfort, and also for any visitors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed broad: "If one is on the backs, nor should be enough room for the easy angewinkelten poor," advises of mine tells. Helen Prokopová who Zunftmeisterin the Polsterer and Raumausstatter dedicated for years the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and this issue also on technical schools. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> In a double bed, everyone needs a rust and their own mattress, but be careful with the shopping, the mattresses are too high. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise, nothing else is left to install than Roste in different levels and it is not long on each bed frame possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with pen skeletal 15 cm, three centimetres to form class and the fine buffer should at least. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "With obvious or Hinsetzen one must feel the feathers, in any case," Helena Prokopová warns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Every mattress makes a specific Rosttyp required. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document as together evolved Siamzwillinge have to seek out in the bedroom. </seg>
<seg id="36"> These mattresses will not reveal itself and the reference you cannot wash, which today is already common practice and there is. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And as you lose in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat, it is clear that the mattress) after five to seven years ago, becoming a huge (and congested sieve. </seg>
<seg id="38"> That is also why experts advertising slogans reject who promise in mattresses a life span of up to 25 years ago, even a lifetime guarantee. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Any thing has its ifs and buts. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And that is why a more practical advice of dealers: Mattresses of 120 or 140 cm breadth, we should not be afraid of the hygiene waschbaren, abziehbaren salary, but it is recommended to use a Matratzenschoner that we can withdraw and wash easily. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even if Matratzenbezüge today usually produced with Rundumreißverschluss, so that you get after the opening two halves (immensely important for Waschvorgang and washing machines sizes!), the kind of manipulation with larger mattresses is, above all, on their own, often, like the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> They have in bed instead of a Rostes a solid record? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Get out! </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or no more than a bed for unloved guests and for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> So they should provide the record, rather, with ventilation holes (if not content) and mattresses are used with the skeletal and 15 cm minimum level with so pen pockets nuclear and fine buffer. </seg>
<seg id="46"> A polyurethane mattresses not belong on such a basis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For not verstellbare from Lattenroste with 14 to 18 play pen (Lamellen) Latex- Sandwichmatratzen (or is perhaps also appropriate combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay Roste with greater Lattenanzahl, from 28 and greater stroke do to regulate with Lordosenstütze in Lendenwirbelbereich and possibility which Lattenhärte. </seg>
<seg id="48"> On verstellbare Lamellenroste no mattresses belong with the skeleton, because they do not respond to the ergonomische disguise --. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Alongside the recruitment of Steife the pen make specific flexible shoulder modules will also be needed. </seg>
<seg id="50"> This is a specific fastening the pen, make it possible to make the stroke einzudrücken or verwinkeln so that they can provide the specific Einsinken Schläfers the back of. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Especially men with broad shoulders for an important cause. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There are even Matratzenhersteller who have started in 'Herrenmatratzen "soft areas to use the shoulder area. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Also the honourable is intended - they takes these soft zone in Hüftgegend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For most customers are systems (Lattoflex punktelastische wing stroke) or Roste certainly burden with points of contact " Pads Multitorsionsfederung with calls. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Pressure will be distributed to a number of points, thereby reducing the tensions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But, if you are on the right mattress and correct rust used a bad (too big and pillow fülliges) that most benefits are lost. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Here, too, as a rule of thumb: The pillow is to buttress its head, its leaders should only up to the shoulders rich, so the shoulder muscles to relax. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Ideal a 50 is therefore x 60 cm big cushions as it may be, for example, the Scandinavians. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="59"> Within the pages of this pillow should (with the side discharge zone in rust or soft zone in the mattress) offset the shoulder height. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Something have our modern mattresses with the former (with hay) Strohsäcken fat but common. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern manufacturer using ever more frequent natural materials or at least whose mixtures. </seg>
<seg id="62"> In mattresses the new magic word "bio means." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="63"> Will oil raw materials used in the production of natural oils Polyurethanschäumen increasingly figures - for example Rizinus- and soya oil. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soya is used well by all known manufacturers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> "Bio means in mattresses, which is its core from materials purely natural origin," says Petr Vašíček Tropico Plus by the company. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Natural substances are used, but also in the manufacture of Matratzenbezügen - one of the first was Aloe Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> One can allow themselves but also micro capsules, the spread in sleeping or Lavendelduft fresh woodland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Here, too, it makes a difference between men and women. </seg>

<seg id="72"> Foam mattresses from cold (he has greater Poren Zellstruktur with ruins and is therefore more active than breathing standard polyurethane foams, and also much more flexible). </seg>
<seg id="73"> Through the combination of various Steife (severity) by Kaltschäumen and Visco's foaming does occur more zones occur 'mattresses who know exactly where we are head, hip and at your heels. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="74"> For a quality mattress, however, has to be made to fork out over 7000 kronor and more. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Gesundheitsmatratzen are burdened but usually with lower VAT because they qualify as medical assistance. </seg>
<seg id="76"> The first Czech companies was Gumotex this advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> One looks to save on the mattress and the rust is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Sometimes there are special offers from manufacturers and traders who offer two mattresses for the price of one. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The fear for their own children is growing and as more and more parents consider it by GPS to monitor. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The system, which was invented initially to the tracing of cars, can monitor human as well, which would be useful in such cases, such as the trace recently unemployed Anička Janatková disappearance of nine years. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The device is currently about the size of a cigarette packet but soon, there will not be greater than a Armbanduhr. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Many people has enabled the case of missing Anička in fear and terror and so they are looking for ways to protect their children better. </seg>
<seg id="6"> For the price of a deterioration of their privacy. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "We are trying to say to everyone that there is no way around this by pioneers, but an effective way to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy," Petr Pilin by society Macro Weil says, is one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices to the Czech market. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> "I admit that it can come in the case of the abuse of such equipment, for example, if there is someone in the pockets, not that he is aware of them, but we have had so far, no such case." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "Most customers buy it really for security reasons," Pilin adds. </seg>
<seg id="10"> His opinion, the child should know but, increasingly, what purpose does the "box" and how you use them in an emergency. </seg>

<p>

<seg id="17"> "If such monitoring equipment were wider use, they would find these also because their sales certainly would be accompanied by massive advertising." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "In these cases, the police, the criminals are always a step ahead," the psychologist says. </seg>

<seg id="22"> "Even if it were to be destroyed immediately, at least the final position of the person concerned is available." </seg>
<seg id="23"> "On more expensive equipment, a bent knife has even incorporated, this means that if you are wrong and hinfällt movement is still sending out, the machine an immediate warning of position," claims Mr Čech. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> His opinion could perform similar services including smart phones with navigation, one needs only einzuspielen a special software. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The problem of the current positioning equipment, is that it is either to equipment in a matchbox's size, the supporters are similar or smaller mobile phones. </seg>
<seg id="26"> There is always the danger that you lose them. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Mr Pilin by the Macro Weil says that testing thus present devices, which look like normal digital watches. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Czech army has bought 445 kilometres Zündschnüre, detonated with bombs. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the year before, the Ministry of Defence had already made 224 miles powder to the army camp. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have ausgesorgt for 225 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The only problem is the durability of Zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Army bought the Zündschnüre of the company STV Group, for example, come to a mere 40 million kronor. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In its explanatory statement, the purchase of the huge quantity of powder replied the General Staff for MF consume Dnes, the soldiers would annually to 60 kilometres of powder. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to the research of Armeepyrotechnikern, the MF accosted Dnes that emerges from this indication that the whole of the army would have to go through an intensive year pyrotechnic training - of all of the generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaners. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Defense minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Only the remarkable annual consumption of 60 kilometres Zündschnüren reasonably can be justified. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This length is also actually 25,000 Detonationen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> But even so this army stocks would be sufficient for more than ten years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But if the old set of experts is that two metres powder enough for the training of every new professional soldiers completely, then the army through this Neueinkäufe has been, even under the terms of the increased needs of the pioneering special forces - a reassuring stockpile created for the already mentioned, 225 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Soldiers in the process of rapid deployment Brigade recently complained the defence minister, Vondra, they had almost no cartridges for small arms, so profound are limited due to lack of funds. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "I do not go well, why do they buy such vast quantities Zündschnüre of us." </seg>
<seg id="17"> But it is ultimately their decision, they will know to what they need them. " </seg>
<seg id="18"> "For us, the army is like a good customer, we come as traders largely look," the marketing manager of STV Group Jan Děcký says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of powder so that, the army would have been so at least eingedeckt for ten years with this "ammunition." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="20"> Jan Děcký of the STV Group, but only for a period of four years of use Zündschnüre Armeepyrotechniker and police, and only two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "In perfect storage also are probably four years, mentioned possible," admits of them, but I want to be accused as a soldier not criticism of the army. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the expiry of the duration of use must be tested thoroughly any munitions, whether it is reliable, and not the life of soldiers at risk. </seg>
<seg id="23"> These tests are not in vain, but will cost more money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Another argument of the Defense Department is the quantities rebate for 445 kilometres powder. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "They cost us 60 per cent less than last year's supply of 244 miles', tells us the viewpoint of buyers Pejšek spokesman of the Ministry of Defence. </seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> And the police only ever ordered such quantities of these munitions, which can consume it before the end of the use of the long term. </seg>

<seg id="1"> A long finger than ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Men, whose finger is long, as the ring finger, are obviously exposed to a lower risk of prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Is the surprising result of a study, which was published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This is to do with the levels of the male hormone testosterone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Our results show that the relative length of finger, can be used as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer and this is particularly among men by 60," which the study, said Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The fingers could help to determine to what men should undergo necessarily a prostate cancer test, particularly genetic risks or other risk factors are, if available, such as health problems, added Mrs added family Eeles. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> During the period from 1994 to 2009 with their counterparts in Britain had more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men. </seg>
<seg id="8"> With more than half of the participants in the study of the finger of the right hand was shorter than ring fingers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> For these men had the same likelihood of prostate cancer, and for 19% of those men whose vaccination and finger were equally long. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In men, whose finger was longer than the ring fingers, however, this risk has fallen by 33 per cent, in men by 60 even at 87 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The ratio of the length of the two aforementioned fingers, which are already in the prenatal age, apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones, which the child was exposed to in the womb. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Less testosterone is a long finger. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Previous research found that it is precisely this testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticists and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that he was aware of this study, however, he does not think that the relationship between the length of finger, and the risk of cancer, so far, shown for "completely." </seg>

<seg id="20"> Essential good taste is not only, but also the consistency seidige fluidity and the good. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Luciano forgets during his training but also not the icing on the cake of the national and even südländischen On construction: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is plenty of is romanticism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first step to manufacturing seems quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Luciano dump the basic ingredients of the milk, cream, milk powder, sugar, and stabilizers in a big Mixgerät, with an electronic programme all heated to 85 degrees and then immediately to four degrees are cooling. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Then it is the machine a Hahn, and out comes a pasteurised white Basiscreme, basis Milcheissorten for all. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Immediately the lecturer will almost bombarded with questions: Can we create ice cream only with natural substances without stabilising influence? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How can we ignore the own Experimentierlust free rein? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Luciano warns to lead from the spirit of the time. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Who of ice cream "just from natural ingredients' talk, has spent perhaps yet stabilisers - usually a natural product such Guarkernmehl from Guarbohne. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Of course, one can produce without ice, stabiliser, only then it must be sold within a day, otherwise it together sackt in, and the customer to louder Eiskörnchen bites. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Exciting it will with the flavourings. </seg>
<seg id="32"> For the flavour in ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients which you buy in the fruit's department or by the sweets of the supermarket. </seg>

<seg id="37"> Or on the ice cream out of the white primary mass, with eggs to yellow cream and cocoa powder on the basis of all kinds of chocolate for the temptations offered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Now the course participants must Eismaschinen. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano can establish they each have four different kinds of Vanille-, Schokolade-, Mokka- and hazelnuts would / ice, with or without egg in basic mass, with more or less Vanillearoma or other natural additives. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The same experiment also undergo the Fruchteissorten. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Added flavourings, more fruit geschmacklich mashed potato - that is not necessarily better. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Hazelnuts would / ice not necessarily more tastes nut if it contains more hazelnuts. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The most popular and the kiwi fruit ice provides the working group which used more fruits, less water and less. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Only a balanced mixture highlight the taste a Gelato correctly, Luciano says. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: Used peach and mashed potato with a lot of sugar, the sugar in the basic recipe to be reduced. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For Zitroneneis is an extra dose of sugar needed. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano, it draws a device with which he intended the sugar content of the fruit varieties (growers) judge the Oechsle in grape must. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Fortunately tables facilitate the calculation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> To make ice no longer require so much physical use as before. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Not only the equipment for the automatic restoration of basic mass helps. </seg>
<seg id="51"> There is also a device, in which the final mixture of ice and at the same time, and is beaten cremig cooling to minus temperatures. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The country, however, refuses to comment on that - there to be controls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Against midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli F / 15 I fighter aircraft are attacking a mysteriöses, würfelförmiges building in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is on the banks of the Euphrates, but the next major city, 30 kilometres away is as the Saur Dair. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Their name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, which Syria has allegedly being built with help from North Korea in which Quader, hidden in a valley, which departs from the electricity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing of the US abroad CIA secret service by the end of April 2008, were also under the name of the nearest town of Al Kibar reactor's expression was in a good position to produce plutonium - were from building nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes, however, is the technology from their fifties. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA conducted a video presentation above with fuzzy satellite images. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Per Computeranimation they ignored, where what components of the reactor should have been before the destruction, a copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center had fell. </seg>
<seg id="11"> They also presented photographs that show the buildings, from near or even the Home Area. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor was stood on the eve of the operation, it was said to have been drawn up but even with fuel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more aware than it was then, of course, the mystery was in time rather greater. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Former US President George W. Bush, recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was above the offensive is fairly sure that Syria's Al Kibar in building a reactor, but very little evidence was that it was in the country, "an active nuclear weapons programme." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some intelligence officers in Europe rather more cautious, and there are still only talk of an "alleged reactor," even if the CIA to keep the presentation of "plausible." </seg>
<seg id="16"> They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Asked how sure he was to have been a reactor, a senior UN diplomat replied only in the summer, neatly, the IAEA has "to provide enough material for questions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The rubble of the alleged 'unused military building "surpassed the Syrians may hurry and planierten the site thoroughly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Nevertheless, an IAEA team under former chief inspector Olli Heinonen was in June 2008, in el the Kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, the IAEA received a Member State commercial providers of satellite images from the period immediately after the attack, which is likely to be stronger than the one presented by the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, these recordings are not to get on the market, because of the unknown purchasers - perhaps Israel has - they bought the exclusive. </seg>
<seg id="22"> , the IAEA therefore cannot verify their authenticity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always claimed, never run a secret nuclear programme or built a reactor. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium has come from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But the dismissed the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then Damascus refuses to discuss the issue - just as on the satellite images. </seg>
<seg id="27"> It also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el the Kibar and access to the ruins of bombed-out building. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But also Israel remains silent. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We will comment on this never," most recently at the time of the attack by acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert reiterated the official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> So the investigation of the case has been dragging on since June 2008 in vain and "Authority is becoming a serious credibility problem for," as one senior Western diplomat gives at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna, finally, a grave violation of the NPT in the room is, the watchdog, the IAEA. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As key to making progress in the investigation the IAEA apparently sees three other institutions that are "functional link" with the alleged reactor, and unlike this still exist. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The inspectors have neither disclosed which assets are, nor what role do they have or what they does seem suspicious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to the German newspaper they are called internally with the IAEA than Marj as Sultan, the Masyaf Iskandariayah and, in turn, derived from nearby towns. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and made on satellite images to find a building complex Masyaf, which is one of the most likely suspect objects. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It is probably in or just next to a military base - exactly this statement denied Syria, the IAEA access to the three locations. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In Vienna it is, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will vorgeschickt by the US, auszuspähen at military installations. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Because the nuclear detectives had become by a typing of the US secret services at the facilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, and was being transported between the three locations Quader on the Euphrates and the material. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could "in connection with the production of fuel." </seg>
<seg id="40"> Although there were "no indications on sensitive activities" uranium enrichment and reprocessing, and processes that are needed for the construction of nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The type of reactor is operated with uranium, which is enriched. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But where the uranium would have to come from, and where it later, the plutonium should be separated for the bomb, to these central issues there are at most plausible assumptions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> Unclear whether debris that could offer valuable trace, were stored in three places. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As disappeared were the hundreds of lorry loads from the face of the earth, no one wants to have information about where the rubble remains. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The only a few kilometres from el the Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, salt mine al / Tibni, which Syria has investigated in 1998 on their suitability as the storage of radioactive waste, and the IAEA is unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had it in a recent analysis of satellite images on the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review brought in contact with the reactor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Admissions from the orbit show but that Syria carried out on three suspect places Erdarbeiten and large container remote after the IAEA has asked for access. </seg>
<seg id="48"> This may be a coincidence, but has contributed little to dispel the suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Moreover, it is said in diplomatic circles to the IAEA have spent many months on a plan for inspections there shows to develop, it should allow Syria to respect any military secrets - the effort alone how much is in the interest of the inspectors. </seg>
<seg id="50"> However, Damascus is bügelte even this proposal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Western diplomats were allayed in Vienna a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, so the matter have no great urgency, is approximately US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a couple of months' special through inspections, one of the harshest means that the Vienna nuclear authority, at the controls. </seg>
<seg id="52"> IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would propose these inspections, has already "a option, for which I am in the future 'spoken, but he hesitates. </seg>
<seg id="53"> There is a high risk in this way: On the one hand, it needs to ensure a majority of the board of governors of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented are eager to do anything else than an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other hand, as a diplomat, to bear in mind are: "What if they get in the end nothing?" </seg>

<seg id="1"> The demokatrische routine </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The democracy movement in Latin America will be stronger, as the support of private companies. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Crime is a bigger problem than the unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In many parts of the region the influence of Brazil is larger than that of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Latinobarómetro to the results of the survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This survey is carried out regularly since 1995 and shows so the exchange of opinion in this region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two facts fall in this year's poll in September and October, particularly in's eye. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First, the good mood in Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="9"> And, secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In many countries on the Pacific coast of South America, the democratic movement has increased sharply (beyond table 1). </seg>
<seg id="11"> In Peru the number of democracy advocate of 40%, for example, where each year since 2002, the economy is growing at around 6%, rose in 2005 to 61% this year. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Recovered in Mexico, where the economy, since the sharp drop in the last year, such a trend is to see. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries of the region, is convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (beyond graph are 2). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Approximately 44% of respondents said that they would be satisfied with their country's democratic practice, which is as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (diagram 3). </seg>
<seg id="15"> Approximately 34% trust the Congress 45% of their country and their government. Both values equivalent to those of the last year, but a sharp increase from 2003 (17% and 24%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> A decade, Latin America's economic crisis undermined the efforts for more democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> That this lasted during the world economic crisis, might be that the Latin American countries experienced only a brief recession and a speedy recovery. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Moreover, the poor have been absorbed by a stronger social network. </seg>
<seg id="19"> (According to reports of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, this week rose from 2009, the poverty rate in Latin America, only slightly and has fallen this year by 32%.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But from country to country, there is a strong mood beyond differences diagram (4). </seg>
<seg id="21"> Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has been reflected in a widespread progress thinking. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Increased in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was felt more and violent crime, this is less the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Only the second time since the start of the survey, many respondents see in Latin America in the crime in their country a bigger problem than in the unemployment graph (say 5). </seg>
<seg id="24"> Approximately 31% say that they themselves, or a family member in the last year were either victims of a crime, yet compared to 38% in the last year have fallen, the values and thus achieve the lowest level since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Rising economic performance is reflected in the increase in support of the private and of market economy: Around 71% of respondents on Regional said that the private economy is essential for development, in 2007, there were (graph) 56% say 6. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Approximately 58% said that the market economy can only express their country progress, compared with 47% in the last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly, 62% of the respondents have maintained in Venezuela this view (and 80% are) for a private business, although their leftist President, Hugo Chávez, nationalised many private companies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil has) according to 19% of the respondents (18% in the last year) the greatest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% in the last year. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see in the United States the most influential country, although this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela will be taken over. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband of Argentina's President, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, the driving their popularity rate by 20 points at about 50% upwards learned; this is the highest value since its election in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Its but that in the next year into a reelection, depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández is entertain a compromise than her late husband that her predecessor and political partners, Néstor Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The signs are not clear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Néstor Kirchner, who drew even after the election of his wife, the economic policy, made often budgets, which take into account the tax revenue, economic growth and inflation, not full. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This allowed the President some to spend the extra revenue as it pleases. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On paper, the Fernández government lost in the last year, the majority in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October, leading to further divisions. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten rally behind Cristina Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But after chaotic meetings (where an parliamentarian another in the face and other government of bribery accused) managed the Congress, not to approve the budget for 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I am not going to discuss it," the President. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The 2010 budget is now for the next year, allowing the President has more opportunity to spend money as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy is hot: They probably will grow this year by up to 9%. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official inflation z.Z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and salary demands of the trade unions - pushing up the value to nearly 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner, who has been beset it took office in 2003, when Argentina from economic crises, said growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not lowering inflation. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He refused to cooperate with the IMF, the private sector and has singled out for bullying as his säuberte the National Institute for Statistics and census Indec, subsequently schönte the official inflation statistics. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Mr Fernández now we can take? </seg>
<seg id="18"> It has called on the private economy and trade union leaders to talks. </seg>
<seg id="19"> According to official statements and wage increases are to be limited in the next year to 18%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the inflation undermined the growth spurt by a big devaluation in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Cristina Fernández would possibly why Argentina join financial economically to the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Earlier this year, the Government made an agreement with shareholders who had rejected the previous restructuring of the country in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Fernández now appears on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club to urge, which it owes about $6.7 billion. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Kirchners had rejected a review by the IMF, as is the custom elsewhere, always. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But in the last month, the economy minister, Amado Boudou announced that the fund will be in the process of drafting a new national consumer price index "technical assistance." It seems that the first step would be to the cleansing of Indec. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not known whether Mr Fernández will be after the end of its term, even without the support of her husband is politically active. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If so, they need to get the support of the middle class, which has largely Kirchnerism enough. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the Argentines return in March from their summer holidays, the wave of Sympatie, which was shown to her, will be largely fizzled. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If they want to win another election, it must decide whether to lift many political decisions quietly to her husband. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Which considers Taiwan by its big brother across the Straits? </seg>
<seg id="4"> On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, which are 70% of eligible voters turned out to vote in the five city mayors and city councils, and this is being seen as a broad assessment of the President Ma Ying jeou Party. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Through the development of revolutionary business relations einschl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma is itself a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland, its policy has changed the relationship between the Chinese native country for the first time since 1949. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Ma has passed the test, but only barely. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Despite his Kuomintang Party (KMT) of three makes the five mayors, they did not receive a majority of votes. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater autonomy of Taiwan, nearly 50% of the votes, the KMT has received 45%. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In a presidential election this would have meant for Ma's problems. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Since his election two years ago, the share of the vote, his party has fallen by around 8%. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For the first time drew even a the DPP, coupled with the KMT in the city councils. </seg>

<seg id="17"> Regardless of the attack has put Tsai of mine, and who, according to the leader of the DPP, the election undermined and the DPP in a bad light, which has brought the KMT more votes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> China was perhaps the biggest winner of the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Remarkably, the relationship has not been raised on the mainland. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and the creation of jobs. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat. </seg>
<seg id="22"> For this reason, the KMT does not put their relations with the government in Beijing to the fore. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But this time, the DPP also avoided stoking the anti's Chinese feelings too much. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy without China can not survive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Ma, for its part, would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese support its China policy. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The government in Beijing, will continue to pursue his strategy zurückzulocken Taiwan with economic incentives in the community. </seg>

<seg id="28"> It also wants a political integration, but the most important thing first. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It would prefer to wait until after the presidential elections in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The DPP has now reinvented itself. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Two years ago, it has been greatly weakened, the former party leader Chen Shin's bian sat in prison for corruption. </seg>
<seg id="32"> During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was strongly for the complete independence. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But under Tais gemässigter reign of a new generation of politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the professionals and the young. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Tsai was a presidential candidate, the DPP big approval, such as Su Tseng and chang under Chen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Their party is doing everything, to show that they, too, is in a position to build close ties to Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Tsai is planning a Ideenschmiede as a point of contact between the DPP and China, this presupposes prejudice free discussions. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Tsai stated publicly that their party "a trustworthy alternative" offer to Mas vorschneller rapprochement with China. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="39"> His cell from, he said, the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence. </seg>
<seg id="40"> He urged the pragmatists Su even to forego the presidential candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Chen's without interference of the DPP is difficult to choose their potential candidates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The KMT will have to undergo its own analysis. </seg>
<seg id="43"> MAS values are bad, in spite of rapid economic growth, and the KMT candidate wanted to lead their campaign without him. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Arsenic � resistant microbe could new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere permit </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The discovery of a foreign variety of bacteria that can live and others, of arsenic, opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Even though scientists this unusual bacterium discovered here on Earth, it is their view, a sign that a life is also without the vital elements saw as possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "This body has two options." </seg>
<seg id="5"> "He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "That makes it a very particular reason, although it is almost a kind of 'alien' way of life," said C.W. Paul Davies of Arizona State University and fellow author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> So far, six key elements have been viewed as vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> However, as the researchers found, the bacterium in Californian mono Lake continues to grow even when it replaced phosphorus by arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> 'One wonders what else is still possible, "the fellow author of the report, said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is an important step in the search for living außerirdischem, since scientists recognize life and its forms must, Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study concerned with microbes that have been found on the planet. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Announcing a press conference in which no details were given to the discovery known, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report of the discovery could act außerirdischen life. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "shows that other planet systems organisms with the help of other elements include biochemical processes can set in motion, and that the 'standard elements', which in our opinion that are absolutely vital, not necessarily clear Charles Cockell, a professor at the Research Institute Planetary and Space Sciences open university of Milton said," Keynes in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockel was not part of the research teams. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "This work is a first, because it shows that one element in fundamental biochemical processes and structures to be replaced by another," Cockell added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> This discovery was not accidental. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Felisa Wolfe Astrobiologischen Institute's Simon from NASA, which led the study chose the mono Lake because of the high level of arsenic content. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> As arsenic and phosphorus chemically identical, they took that microbes, who are both suspended, may be an element that can be replaced by another. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "The toxicity of Arsens is based mainly on the fact that it is chemically similar to phosphate." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "That the organisms would find it hard to distinguish one element from the other." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "But the difference is so large that arsenic works unlike phosphorus. It enters our biochemisches system, where it covered almost everything," said Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Researchers from the bacterium GFAJ 1 increased arsenic concentration. It to contain itself and grew. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The microbe grows in phosphorus better, but that it can also survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic occur based life form could happen, of course, either to earth or to another planet or moon, where arsenic more often. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> According to Jamie S. Foster, Dozentin for Microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that white phosphorous can be replaced by arsenic, not new, but so far there was no functioning example. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Arsenic above came in the early Erdjahren more often, she says, so the science is on the assumption that early life forms have used it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> "This is reason to believe that life may have evolved, unlike in early Erdzeitalter," Forster, who was not a member in Wolfe's Simon's research team. </seg>

</hl>
<p>

<seg id="3"> A New / York bankruptcy judge on Thursday to prepare offiziel "'Gläuberplan are blessed, in order to clear the debts to the tune of $5 billion to pay off and the 86 years of entertainment companies the way for new films and TV shows. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In accordance with the evidence of Thursday the plan meets the requirements of US bankruptcy law, that is the start of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, founders of Spyglass entertainment, nothing more. Barber and Birnbaum will preside over the slightly reduced studio as the main business leaders. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The staff numbers will be reduced by more than 400 to around 320. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For MGM Chapter 11 effectively only enters into force if JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned loan of $500 million to fund the new MGM's production. </seg>
<seg id="7"> At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which brings in even $75 million, the company is in charge of the financing should stand by the middle of December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Restructuring the studios began in May 2009, with the mandate to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management of companies that struggled with interest payments of $300 million per year to help resolve its financial problems. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In August, the chief executive Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, who has been known by its activities in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Efforts of Moelis & Cooper, to resolve financial worries auszubezahlen MGMs and the more than 140 Gläuber of studios that lasted longer than expected. </seg>
<seg id="11"> After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company to buy. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But the auction drew few bidders and no one wanted to pay the requested by the creditors $2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In the spring of this year, it all started from scratch when the MGM's team began with the restructuring plan, which was signed after months of debate and infighting, at the end of October, at last, by the creditors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> If MGM in the next few weeks has survived bankruptcy officially, Moelis Cooper for their work and receive a bonus of several million dollars. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The proportion of Moelis & company, which has already received $1.2 million, amount to $9.5 million </seg>
<seg id="16"> Cooper, which, for the management of the company a month $375.000 paid, receive a "success bonus" of $4 million) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. In this year the studios came only a film and produced an annual plan with seven or eight films, which will come from the beginning of 2012, in the cinema. </seg>
<seg id="18"> They also plan two films after "The small Hobbit" in Co production with Warner Bros. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The studio needed a separate bond between $265 million to $275 million for its financial stake in these two films, which are supposed to be directed by Peter Jackson. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The investor Carl Icahn, who has funded approximately 18% of MGM / loan, sought a merger of the studios with Lions gate entertainment, whose largest shareholder, he is. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the recent negotiations between the two companies has led to any result. </seg>

<seg id="3"> This decision will put an end to the worst piece of junk against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which caused headlines nationwide and his career was a drubbing he was seen as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As Senator Ensigns office announced that he was about the judgment, after a year of investigation "delighted." </seg>
<seg id="5"> The ethics committee of the Senate, could still impose an Disziplarstrafe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to the Ensigns lawyers they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were halted, and that no further prosecutions in this matter. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The judgment was for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice a surprise, in their view, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign has flouted the lobbying ban. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Interviews, emails and other documents, which have been shown for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times, gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of its election agents helped to lucrative contracts, in order to buy his silence about an affair with Hamptons wife Cynthia. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Cynthia Hampton was during an election campaign Ensigns as treasurer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Ensign took contact with a few political friends to give Hampton work, according to the documents and interrogations, he took it for the next recruitment Hamptons lobbying. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Since Hampton was recently in Ensigns election team, it was, he had a year no lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate. </seg>
<seg id="13"> According to ethics experts this unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who had before the affair was chummy against the ban on the revolving door 'Lobbykratie. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> In accordance with the published evidence "is apparently a consultation and the violation of the revolving door 'statutes," Stanley fire, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defense of clients, which are in the sights of the government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> While the Ministry of Justice it officially rejected, the reasons for the decision to give in the case of Ensign, Mr. Fire and other ethics lawyers, the Department seem very cautious in fuelled political prosecutions said after a multitude of failures, which have been followed with great interest by the media, including the decision of last year falling charges against former Senator Ted Stevens because of misconduct on the part of the public prosecutor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Prosecutors "are apparently fearful detention," Melanie Sloan said that the chairman of the association, "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organisation whose aim is the fight against corruption in political and government circles in the United States), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr. Ensign brought to court. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Which essentially means that high government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Paul Coggins, main defenders of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call on Monday, a public prosecutor, and another the next day, in which he was informed that the department will not levy charges against his clients. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with prosecutors, in order to convince them that the Senator, acted as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, in accordance with the law ." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr Coggins refused to explain the legal arguments which he had presented to the public prosecutors, more precisely. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "I am not satisfied, to go into the details of talks between the Ministry of Justice, and I am, just as much has to be said, we believe that we have made the right decision," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Last month, the Federal Election Commission has decided to discontinue the investigation because of a separate action by the group, after the payment of $96,000 of breach Mr. Ensigns parents to the Hamptons to the federal electoral law. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The Election Commission said that it had not been enough evidence that the money had been anything other than a gift. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> NV Energy, a major company in Nevada, which for a long time, supported the senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyists work. </seg>
<seg id="25"> An electronic mail of December 2008 shows that, after the company Mr. Hampton has moved as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a conversation with Mr. Hampton, where he told him that he anklopfe at the Ministry of Interior on a thing. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Mr. Ensign was also agreed with Mr. Hampton and other customers for Nevada, and Allegiant Air, to lunch and asked the Transport Minister, to arrange a meeting in the name of the airline, after it had stopped Mr. Hampton to lobbying. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Than last year for the first time, information burst on this affair to the public, to apologize to Mr. Ensign in his electorate and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been in the order of precedence of Republicans in fourth place. </seg>
<seg id="28"> After he was struck many months no more, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he would like to see a third term in the Senate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> In announcing that Mr. Ensign no longer the target of police inquiries, its press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper said the senator hope that the ethics committee very quickly follow the example of the Justice Department and his investigations once figures. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada," she said. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Cheshire's appointment makes attention on Twitter </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Half a dozen of them away tippten in the riots in the courtroom. </seg>
<seg id="3"> They verschickten tact in the minutes on Twitter their reports about grey of testimonies. </seg>
<seg id="4"> At the end, so the defence, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the process, about rape and to beds gekettete children in a house which go up in flames. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Thursday, will be closely followed the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, to have killed, an official end to find, if the verdict on the death sentence, that the jury has spoken, falls. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted requests in court to explain the reasons for an appeal and will concern the courts for years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> One of the most provocative of the reasons is that it was due to the intense coverage of the process, even through extensive use of Twitter by average reporters, to a "circus atmosphere" and such a widespread, swift penetration rebel details so that the jury had been influenced in an improper manner by the public outrage. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This objection could induce Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules to be in the courtroom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "As I have seen during this process, I believe that there is a real danger that if the basins of the new technologies in the courtroom this influenced each individual's right to a fair trial, Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes said," main defenders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Chamber Court, rejected last week's requests, via referendum succinctly when he said that the new media "would be monitored carefully," and that there is no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But that was certainly not the last word on this matter. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Court for decades a Proverbs have found that the reporting on notorious cases casts doubt on the fairness of the process. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In its historic decision taken in 1966 the Supreme Court of the United States has overturned the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, osteopaths from Cleveland to have killed his wife, and said in its decision that it would have been because of the New Media "Karnevalsatmosphäre in a courtroom." </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some believes that the television series and the movie based "on the flight" to this crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some lawyers say courts a Proverbs, which consider sentencing Mr. Hayes half a century later, might follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication channels from the courtroom, who were at the time of the case, Dr Sheppard still inconceivable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "There is a good reason, on the impact of new media in processes which will be followed by a broader public, to be concerned," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School, who has studied the use of the death penalty in Connecticut, according to his report is it arbitrarily imposed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor Donohue said some Appelationsgerichte might be fascinated by the idea that restricting an immediate communications make the courtroom, it could be the process fair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Twitter case is just one of many that make the lawyers of Mr. Hayes to discuss in years and thereby prolong a condemnation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defenders claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes might have been already guard, as Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reaction of potential Juroren by showed them during the grey Jurorenauswahl cent scene photos. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some Juroren said that photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke's Petit, 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years, they have been met with revulsion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defenders say, they would also make the constitutionality of the death penalty, called into question, and argue that the judge wrongly have exchanged a jury, who was a critic of the public prosecutor's office, and that he had improperly exerted pressure on the ruling, as it had taken the unusual decision to ask the jury over the weekend. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The Juroren were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But their arguments about the impact of the extensive reporting on the process may drag the greatest interest. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In a judgment ruling, which they submitted last month, have made it clear that the case of the intelligence in Connecticut had dominated and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American Senate of the candidates have been discussed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They argued that the new media have constantly fanning the flames of the emotions on the case. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "Such a daily crush of Medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom wrote," the lawyers, "it has never before seen in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Its focus on reporting by Twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In interviews some journalists said that the claim that this direct messages were a rabble-rousing but reports that are reimbursed more slowly, is a hostile view of technology, of the report on future processes verarme. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> But some lawyers said Appelationsgerichte were often confronted with the argument, social and technical changes need the Adaptation by the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr. Hayers lawyers step up this assertion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In its objection, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court, from 1966, in the conviction of Dr Sheppard was lifted due to the reporting and made it clear that the new media require new rules. </seg>
<seg id="32"> "This case," they wrote, "represented Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Courtesy can combine what divides us? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> After a campaign of epithets and negativity this week broke out little civility in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It is the sign of a genuine two parties cooperate or a moment of delusion before we revert quickly back to the struggle of the political parties in the capital? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress produced no breakthrough in the big issues that we had to look at what has been called the "lame duck session," the session at the end of a period of government, no more decisions to be taken. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After everything we hear, was there to govern either a polite discussion between two sides or an account of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partisan collection points. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meetings of the president's deficit commission was similarly civilized on Wednesday, in spite of the political differences between the members. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems clear that there is a strong interaction will create over a period of months, a mutual respect that the ideological gulf that separates the members from each other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> This is hardly enough to claim that it is thus a new era of cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Both sides are in a test phase, in which the one demands of the other signs of cooperation and a willingness to compromise, while they do not even attempt to balance the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a new party warfare. </seg>
<seg id="10"> So the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment were limited by the participants at a minimum requirements or allegations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep, as you could see a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, expected. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or pension, the two sides are miles apart. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Last but not least the November election has, at least for a short time, Washington voted mild. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representatives of the Bush administration, is now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "After elections that is inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elections give partisan passions, the die again. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And that is a good thing. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In some issues, particularly on those who are on the agenda of the "lame duck session," Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. " </seg>
<seg id="19"> Bush's tax cuts to end at the end of the year, and no one in favour of it. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way to get some, or even all, either temporarily or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Likewise, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that, it believes, who favors tax cuts for the rich, while unemployed workers refuse assistance is to be expected a compromise regarding the increased unemployment benefits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House of the optimism has risen that we can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and ratify at the same time, the New START treaty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But William Glaston the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent questions of the lame duck session "not necessarily to a lasting cooperation between the parties must lead if the new 112. Congress will convene in January. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead, he says, for a period of not more than once immensely is more likely, perhaps even inevitable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "After the things that must be done, is done will turn, these short psychology in confrontation," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many, is the courtesy to real cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "I see a lot of what is happening from now until 2012, as Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event from 2012," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons have a great deal to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Teeparty voters, who were instrumental to their education. </seg>
<seg id="29"> How concerned the Republican leaders also may be that they vie too high, they know that they need to try to reduce their commitment to the government and to set aside the health reform. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> This party lines are already in the first reaction on the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include a tax reform and the raising of some taxes and raising the retirement age and reduce the government spending. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, according to their own assessment, so very pushed to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need within the Commission, 14 of the 18 votes to get its plan for formal recommendation and they are fighting hard to get even in the vicinity of this figure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The biggest resistance in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial issues, today at least, little leeway or little sympathy for compromises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The first battle will take place next year in the form of party clashes if challenging Republicans Obama in terms of the state budget, taxes and the health care system, to be followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will lead to this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> The public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It is proved that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans wants still that the two parties are working together. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If confrontation in an impasse, as has happened in 1995, then both parties need to be careful with the public reaction. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Who will always doomed to lose, will have to change tack and seek a compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> This may indeed be an optimistic view. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Partiality and polarisation today are greater than in the middle of the 1990s, and they appear to be a wider ideological gulf between Obama and the Republican Congress than at the time, between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At the same time, the defenders of the two parties in 2010 as a mere prelude to see a much wider choice of 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Seen as the courtesy, which will be taken this week display may be welcomed by many Americans. </seg>
<seg id="45"> But it will require both sides much more of an effort to find common ground on the issues that divide the two remain separate. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="6"> But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, longstanding supporters in Anlong Veng will be challenged. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In April a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims of public confrontation with the people who have supported once the regime. </seg>

<seg id="5"> The establishment must accept not only a social prestige lost, because they had not discovered the criminal acts of Pflegers in time, but is now paying a high compensation sum, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the victims. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime goes back to August 2009, and that he had since been murdered. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - Former patients of the old nursing home - because it suspected that no doctor had examined the mortal remains personally, but the formalities have been phased out because of their age and disease, by telephone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The director of La Caritat verneinte flatly this point and said that could "lack of action any time have been the cause of the incident." </seg>
<seg id="9"> The lawyer of La Caritat added that there was "no evidence in the legal dispute for negligent acts a person other than the accused." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Already as "death angel" Getaufte 11 murders confessed to the other day and said that the first of the crimes perpetrated on 29 August 2009, and one and a half months later, the second old lady to have murdered. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first crime, where he was administered a mix of various sedatives. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The director of La Caritat said the access of the staff to the drug is difficult to control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The insulin injections and tranquilizers cocktail 'of carers in six of nine crimes committed to rid the patient with the death of their suffering. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But the results of laboratory research will highlight, whether Vila is lying and his first victims actually chose a less cruel death or whether he ausbrannte this from the inside, by them Bleichlauge insist, as he had done, according to the confession when three women he murdered between 12 and 17 October. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> In La Caritat Pflegers listens to the testimony of no faith, not even as far as the number of murders gestandenen, which might well be more; that attitude it justified that Vila had made very different statements in court, and that it makes no sense, his approach after eight successful murder suddenly to change. </seg>
<seg id="16"> They say that they turned it for this reason, and to clarify the scope of these incidents of the judiciary. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tensions in the markets triggered a dual response from the government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Hand José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has submitted new adaptation measures, from tax reductions for small and micro enterprises, regulating by temporary employment agencies or the lifting of the 426 euro support for unemployed people who receive no unemployment benefits, and the privatisation of 49% from AENA, the management of the airports Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery. </seg>

<seg id="7"> It is anticipated, that Merkel's position is no mistake of their public relations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> While Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective about the shape of our future that is at odds with the preservation of the old traditions of a large section of its partners. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Given the resistance in Europe, beginning in Germany too spekuliern on three possible ways out of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first: A strong euro, with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries in the south, would have to leave the euro area. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The second point: The reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - although it now sounds more like science fiction - supported by a large part of the public opinion, around 50% of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Third: A review of the euro under German proposals, which means that greater macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of the countries that the targets being broken; möglichereweise the default of a number of countries, as well as the extension of the costs of potential adjustments to the private sector. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="14"> Germany's position is clear and has been for some time, and that is why there are now no excuses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First in 2009, when both of the IMF and the European Commission that created incentives for deficits and the German government drew up a constitutional reform from the sleeves to prevent it from 2016. </seg>

<seg id="17"> The second signal suspended the Central European country, as Merkel delayed the decision to bail out Greece's painful. </seg>
<seg id="18"> At the time, which has been severely criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion were totally opposed to a bailout of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Merkel has, after all, in the days of last October again with a clear position, and it is calling for a reform of the agreement of the European Union to allow the bailout of a country and to commit at the same time, the private lenders to bear some of the costs. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position has been interpreted as anti - European as they propelled the Irish crisis and everything as follows. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But its proposal, though sweetened somewhat, was adopted, and in the coming months, we will be able to participate in the reform of the European Union, which is to allow these measures from 2013. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Sport and rule circumvention </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tricks such as Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to avoid a sanction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The supposedly by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) has instigated exclusion in stake of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League resulted in a great deal of ink has been spilled about whether there a unsportliche was whether or not to act and should be punished, possibly both players by UEFA. </seg>
<seg id="4"> As is well known, the two players lost a couple of minutes before the end of the game (your team had won already clearly) time and played several fouls, now so the referee showed them the second yellow card. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way, and, as the Real Madrid would make his group, the two players will meet the prescribed sanction the next league match against Auxerre and enter without tickets in the next phase of the game. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Finally Disziplinarkommitee the UEFA punished the coach of the club, Jose Mourinho, with two of the games and the players involved with various sums of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow card under these or similar circumstances, is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this game - following rules. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of the debate, described that have arisen in the case is the fact that a team of football clubs Real Madrid (of his anthem themselves and credit claims and on other occasions, his players are punished for similar incidents had) the key role played, and the drama by Mourinho, of an episode more to its long history as theatralischer and provocative technicians added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any event, the debate is about whether this is not explicitly prohibited by the statutes behaviour contradicts the principles of sport, that means whether these acts are a rule circumvention. Indeed, this approach has to deal with the regulations of the sport, but it seems to make sense. </seg>
<seg id="11"> On this issue of the sporting spirit caused damage should be investigated. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that was not threatened by these acts, because it has not been an aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another aspect of a clean game is drawn to avoid a situation in which the offender to be unjustified benefit players from the opposing team, which did not happen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradox of the action of players of the Real Madrid is that it does not reflect what we normally regard as wrong or circumventing the rule of the game, because the circumvention of the rule has not been taken secretly to avoid a sanction, but they should be as striking as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players waited and took the sanction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is what kind of advantage went from the offender to the deliberate Fouls. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Here that the rival was neither in a disadvantageous position still benefits to have feigned erheischt this game, it should be pointed out, because the obvious result of this action was that their own team had to continue to play with fewer players. </seg>
<seg id="18"> There is also no useful strategy for the next game, because the club has not then on these players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The benefit is evident in the fact that the players could start the next phase of the Champions League game without cards, which threaten their participation in any future game. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a long term, up to a certain degree, uncertain advantage, because the team could leave too, at some point, the players received a sanction with this approach, and in the second round of World Cup tickets on that they because card accumulation with a card less than in the first round. </seg>
<seg id="21"> So that it is not clear whether there really is an advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Ultimately directed not against such practices the sporting spirit to the strategic decisions, in order to learn from the rules a maximum benefit. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case, none of the players wanted to circumvent sanctions (which) would, in fact, a clear case of a rule around, they wanted more to choose, when they are subjected to this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They made a strategic decision to avoid without a penalty or to flee before her. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Though the border between inventiveness and regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that it is a matter for a clear case of inventiveness. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: Because it was about two self exclusions and because of the type of provoking Regelübertragung. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The damage inflicted on the principles of sport by these acts are less ethical as aesthetic nature. </seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg id="9"> Concludes the United Nations, he is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: Omnipresent, but potentially to menacing to talk about him." </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The UN has proposed a plan yesterday in Cancun, on the renewal of the lighting from households, commerce and industry in 100 countries, with a view to achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (CFCs), which is almost a third of the additional reduction that needs to be done to stabilize the earth's climate by 2020. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This ambitious plan is its position in the concrete steps, large projects, which hopes to implement the UN in Cancun to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments from industrialised countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> After yesterday's plan the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (GT) of the earth because of lighting on CFCs cast would be avoided if the White ardent pears, which are as yet a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, through fluoreszierende or better still), by emitting diodes etc (LED would be replaced. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In Copenhagen last year undertook major Abgasemittenten as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada was to voluntary reduction plans, the global CFCs should emissions by 53 GT downsized to 49 GT. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Of this balance, however, we should withdraw 5 GT to stabilize from now until 2020 climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius to avoid that this out of control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the White ardent pears 95% of the energy in the form of heat escape, and the remaining 5% of produce the light. </seg>
<seg id="10"> With Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs we reduced these energy needs, again twice that. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen believe that, on average, between 6,000 and 10,000 hours. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The new LED bulbs, such as those that brought this week the producer Philips to the market - that society has, in fact, part of the UN study - a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a White ardent pear, which is to give an indication of the potential savings Auswechselungsplanes, which can be used in 100 countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> In addition to the fact that issue iese completely new light bulbs very little heat, they will also be able to work with a regulatory resistance. </seg>
<seg id="14"> And they do not contain any mercury. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Several specialists showed that Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen have reserves, because they contain mercury, and that is why as they dispose of hazardous waste has to, which is not in the developing countries always possible, but the producers are an adoption centre available. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The major source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, is not the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but the coal power stations that emit far more mercury to produce the electricity wasted White ardent pears. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the United States alone this coal power stations emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The report gives a detailed account of the gains, which would each country, thanks to the international programme. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Indonesia would, for example, a $1 billion per year in buying electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2 saved, this means an equivalent of 3.5 coal power stations, whose spiritual Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion. </seg>

<seg id="5"> They describe how the Elysée had told the Americans of his strategy that went as far as to give this advice to deal with its own crisis of "hostage" in Iran (a small group of Wanderern). </seg>
</p>

<seg id="8"> In fact, he had done nothing in this regard. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="13"> "Power noise," they were saying "loudly and clearly articulated and endlessly" the words' fundamental human rights ,"" innocence "and" immediate release "in the media. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime in a predicament that respects very sensitive to its image. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> "Is all the more to do as you ask Iranians, that does not." </seg>
<seg id="16"> Because 'silence solves nothing ," the debate over experiments on at unauffälligem ways, the Iranians are" master in Ausweichmanövern. " </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Today it is, after all, to initial projections. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The supplementary budget by 2010, seeing this morning by the Finance Commission of the National Assembly, that contains the proposed measures to raise the first part of that money. </seg>
<seg id="9"> There are two measures: The creation of a special tax to Erschließund and higher taxation of the offices on the Ile de France. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Rachsüchtige hackers and emsige spies </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> WikiLeaks the affair has a twofold significance. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On one side, they turned out to be a very obvious scandal, a scandal that is simply a scandal the Sinner hypocrisy which the Beziehunge between states, the public and the press run. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand, it announces radical changes at international level, and is a foretaste of the regression dominated by the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But we go after the series. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any of a secret service produced acts (any nation is composed) exclusively from newspaper cuttings. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary," American revelations about the sexual habits Berlusconi's throw nothing more than what we got through months anyway to read in any other journal (except those whose owner Berlusconi is), and the frightening karikaturierte profile Kabarettkünstlern Gaddafi's has provided for a very long time for their Sketche fuel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule, according to the secret dossier must comprise merely known news, is essential for the dynamism of the secret services, and not only in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go into a library dedicated esotherischen publications, you will see that every station (on the grail, the mystery of Rennes' le's Chateau to Templer or Rosenkreuzler repeatedly) exactly what was written in previous works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is not only so that the author wishes to occult texts not publish research (or that he did not know where news about) would find it not exist, but because those who devote themselves to the Okkultismus to think of anything other than what they already know and confirmed what they have already learnt. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Mechanism this is also the success of Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> As the secret files. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited intellect) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he would be whatever, editor of Libération, for example), which considers only be true, which he acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Top Secret information about Berlusconi, the US Embassy in Rome sent the Staatsdezernat had, were the same as those that Newsweek had already published the week before. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Why such a fuss about the revelations of this dossier was therefore made? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On one side of this effect what any educated person knows already and the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and, since then, too, may be able to call for the Government to each other or an aircraft companies have been able to take at the dinner - have lost their diplomatic functions and turns, with the exception of a small representation tasks in espionage centres. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Any spectators of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not happening from hypocrisy that people act to ignore it. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Yet: The fact that we are repeating it public, violated the duty of the hypocrisy and serves to put the American diplomacy in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In the second place, the idea that a yet any hackers to tap into secret mysteries of the most powerful country in the world, there is a significant blow to the prestige of Staatsdezernats. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Moreover, the scandal brings fewer victims than the "executioner" in trouble. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we devote ourselves the profound nature of what has happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Formerly, to Orwell's times, we have been able to concentrate all power as a Big Brother, who controlled every gesture of his subjects. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwell's prophecy would be able to turn out ever since as absolutely right, where they can control every movement, thanks to the phone, making any transaction, it was hotel, the elected motorway, and so on; the citizen would the total victim to the eye of the power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> If you have, but what is happening today, even the secret Krypten of power no longer can escape the scrutiny of Hackers, the Kontrollgang ceases to be unilaterally and will circle shaped. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Power controlled every citizen, but each citizen, or at least of the hacker - chosen as the avenger by the citizen - that the secrets of power can bring in experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> But how a power can keep, which is no longer able to protect its own secrets? </seg>
<seg id="27"> True, Georg Simmel said that a real mystery is an open secret (and a hollow secret can never be exposed); it is also true that whatever knowledge about the nature of Mr Berlusconi or Merkel's, in fact, is a mystery without Geheimis, because it exposes the public sphere; but disclosed by WikiLeaks style that the secrets were empty secrets by Hillary Clinton means depriving them of any power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> WikiLeaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What will be the consequences of this snub caused to such a great power? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the state would be in the future, no reserved more information would be put online - the one on the street corner angeklebten displaying. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is to be hoped is equally obvious that it is with the latest technologies in vain to keep confidential reports of telephone secret. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of state in a aircraft move and one of his colleagues has contacted. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could be maintained in the future private and only for certain ears some relations? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know very well that my prediction sounds, at the moment, according to science fiction and Roman prison, but I find myself having to imagine the government agents in secret manner assiduous on uncontrollable march routes moving, their communications have nowhere else than on mere memory in order and also the few written information they get, in the shoe (verbergend. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: Basically of espionage attempt of Watergate had been less success, as WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity to write, that the technology is advancing today, like a cancer - backwards. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A century after the wireless telecommunications Graf had revolutionised the communications, the Internet, with a reconstructed Telegrafen (telephone) wire. </seg>
<seg id="38"> (Analogue) video tapes had the film allows them a film auszukundschaften band for broadband by the (in numerical) CDs enable spulen from behind, you could forward and reveal all the secrets of installation, while today, nothing else than to jump from chapter to chapter, at macro chickens. </seg>
<seg id="39"> With high speed trains, one travelling within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this means of switching by plane, including three and a half hours. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It is not therefore exceptionally that return policy and communication technology in cars and horse. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Climate: As France, its financial promises of talking </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> One year after the Copenhagen Treaty is there to investigate time referred to the observance of the funding promises quickly resolved (even 'fast start' or premature funding), which have been implemented by the developing countries. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And the rough French vulnerable to blandishments are discovered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With the Copenhagen Treaty the developing countries have pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France) 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> At the opening of the COP16 the EU has pulled out all the stops to prevent their partners from the fact of its commitment regarding the 'fast start' financing to persuade: Detailgetreuer action report of its Member States, press conference, as well as large events, brochures distribution. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Operation transparency is estimated remarkable and precisely for its real value: The developing countries and civil society would like to see all the developed countries did the same at the same accuracy level. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The EU declared, to have a release of EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, as it is on the right path towards Respektbezollung their commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you look into the details, however, things are slightly more complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should be according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new and additional," in order to ensure that an additional use was introduced to be without, to the detriment of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately, there is no consensus, what "means new and additional." </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the EU Commission proposed a harmonisation, have a certain number of members states, including France, to block the procedure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today, everyone chooses the benchmark, which he deems best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The EU Commission, has chosen as a benchmark for example those of 2009: The international funding to be maintained, and that is in the context of funding 'fast start' 150 million over three years. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries have similar guidelines, either elected in annual or concerning conditions at the level of public development aid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> By contrast, France was the view that the funding "of all new projects" of 2010 are "new and additional." </seg>
<seg id="17"> In other words, there are no guidelines for spending of the previous year, or at a global level of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Specifically said may be the sum total of the French support for developing countries is stable (or decrease) - France is to meet its commitment to the "new and additional" funding. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is no rule, and everyone chooses its Rechenmodus. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, such as France, are borrowed €1 as being equivalent to €1 donated. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Obviously this is acceptable only difficult: The trouble is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loans can be for some profitable investment (often justified to the emission control linked projects) are based on the most effective technology, it is captured deceptive to present the Euro to be donated as equivalent for a euro... moreover, only the cost of the loan should be counted for capital donor country than commitment, in other words, the equivalent of an interest rate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> France has nothing but respect different in spirit than the following observation: '"Accorded its obligation of 420 million euros, by embracing 91.5% loans (389,8 million) and of 8.5%)) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document, to see for yourselves. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only land the EU, that loans to a great extent. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany is calling for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands, or Slovakia (including) perform their obligations to be 100% of donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to meet their commitments, that France is barely 10 cents and understands, including a similar commitment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Beautiful Hokuspokus! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> All in all France operates in his fast start financing with a double fraud: A part with a Weiterentwicklkung the action over time, and partly with the reality of the financial commitment. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France will be able to give the impression that it has used 420 million "new and additional" million, in line with his promise, and it saves 36.1 million euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the Treasury (since it seems likely that there was Bercy, which has conducted the arbitrage) one could draw to borrow twice negative effect, once EU internal (why the other members states are continuing with the donations, if enough?), and then in the negotiations, the developing countries will not be fooled completely... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter of Premature finance only a small matter in a relatively short time compared to the entirety of discussions on the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it may be too much of the drop in the vast machinery of the UNFCCC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> We hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As it always was, it is vital to learn the lesson from this first year of premature funding. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Primarily France could be a change in its accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, and to do so in a spirit of respect for his obligations and compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> But above all France could lead the discussions on the dispute are the subject of long term funding forward (another key topic, and at the moment: You cannot escape the question of 'Verrechenbarkeit "or the recording nature of its loans. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could alter its position, in order to be as progressive in terms of the contentious issues, as it is the other things. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The hope is based on the new environment minister, Kosciusko / Morizet who will arrive next week in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A surprising announcement on the 'fast start of France and his vision of' Verrechenbarkeit ," as well as the use of loans would increase inherently international trust, the need for further discussion. </seg>
