To hell, warriors! 
Splatter fits the art cinema? 
The director Nicolas winding Refn testing with his fighters-epic "Walhalla Rising". 
In what may the Danish director Nicolas winding Refn have thought, when he has turned "Walhalla Rising"? 
A captured Viking warriors with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) freed themselves from his Peinigern and places with almost superhuman powers his opponents to - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody Action, precisely because our hero like thuggish killing methods and his enemies at the Gedärme from the living body, if he has bad mood. 
On the other hand, says Einauge, as he is called, the whole film about a word, and the other characters can at most times to one or two sentences or a few painful death shouting. 
Otherwise, silence and the gruselig beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland geschwelgt, the Vikings world of about a thousand years ago the scene. 
Ideal for adult Cineasten with interest to Existentialismus and very quiet camera journeys. 
Well, if a film has several target groups, it is a shame if they are mutually exclusive. 
Director Winding Refn is regarded as a kind of Danish his wild and gestylten drug dealer trilogy "Pusher" version of Quentin Tarantino, but refuses stoically, his works with something more humour to the mainstream or a little less brutality the Arthouse accessible. 
Most art cinema-friends are around the spritzenden brain mass and the Gedärmen deterred. 
The Action-fans will die from boredom, if Einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and pins an eternity in depression and fog before the team arrives in America and there is silent. 
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" has found no cinema-lending in Germany and now only on DVD. 
This is particularly the magnificent pictures a shame, but also because, behind the prätentiösen until bluttriefenden facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention. 
In This film is not about dialogues or a stringent action, it is all atmosphere, a film a fever dream. 
And there is no escape for the viewer. 
Refn takes him barely a moment of détente and drawn him with his icy images and the dark drift-like sound track very slowly cut the throats, but above all with the incredible hatred of him from the heart of the characters. 
Only a small blonder boy, faithful to the Einauge retains as something as innocence, all others are driven by anger. 
The vast majority of the one-eyed man hero whose motives are never explained, but for enemies and temporary allies at some point warriors from hell, perhaps the Ambassador of the devil himself. 
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the Verdorbenen anyway. 
"Walhalla Rising" is an unexplained film you hate and admire, the angry, upset and astonishment. 
An experience.
