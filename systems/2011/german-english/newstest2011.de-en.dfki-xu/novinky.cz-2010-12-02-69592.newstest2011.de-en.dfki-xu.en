Their projectiles by laser with an accuracy of just a few metres into the goal. 
The special bore 25 mm shells that were developed for this gun and dangerous explosives to function effectively as small grenades. 
The missiles can be programmed so that they can not only to the target, but at any point their ballistic explode on impact. 
That means that you cannot use it against an enemy that hides behind a barrier - a wall or in the trench.

"Shall we say, it has measured 543 m." 
"If you abdrückt, invites the weapon and shooting the Geschoss on the distance 543 metres plus minus one, two or three metres.
