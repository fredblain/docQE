The army has so many Zündschnüre quite the Czech Republic that umwickeln could you but only two years 
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometers Zündschnüre shopped with explosives were to be released. 
The year Before, the Ministry of Defence has 224 miles powder to the army camp. 
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces for 225 years ausgesorgt. 
The only problem is the durability of the Zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years. 
The army bought the Zündschnüre by the Company STV Group, including For paltry 40 million kronor. 
In his reason for the purchase of this enormous amount of powder said the General Staff MF DNES, the soldiers would use per year to the 60 kilometres powder. 
According to the research from Armeepyrotechnikern, MF DNES point raised is clear from this data that the whole army of an intensive year pyrotechnic training - all generals and officers of the army commandos, up to the secretaries and cleaners. 
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded. 
Only then could the substantial annual consumption of 60 kilometers Zündschnüren reasonably justified. 
This length to 25,000 Detonationen. 
But even if this army inventory for more than ten years. 
But if the old rule of experts is that the training of each new professional soldiers two metres powder is quite sufficient, then the army by this Neueinkäufe - also from the point of view of the increased needs of the pioneering special units - a reassuring supply for the already mentioned 225 years. 
It complained soldiers of the quickly use Brigade recently, in the Defence Minister Vondra, they have almost no more cartridges for hand guns, so register are severely restricted because of the lack of resources. 
Not to mention the Unterhosenmangel. 
"Me is not why they are such huge sums Zündschnüre buy." 
But it is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need. " 
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we, as traders to do as much as possible," says the sales manager of the STV Group. 
Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the Ministry of Defence justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of powder, the army could so for at least ten years with this 
Jan Děcký of the STV Group but talks only of a four-year duration of the Zündschnüre and police and Armeepyrotechniker only two years. 
"With perfect storage are also mentioned possible four years", one of them, but wants to remain unnamed, not to be accused of the criticism of the army as a soldier. 
After the expiry of the term use any ammunition to be tested thoroughly, whether it is reliable and must not endanger the lives of the soldiers. 
These tests are not for nothing, but cost more money. 
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers powder. 
"It cost us 60% less than last year's supply of 244 miles," spokesman Pejšek tells us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence. 
Only by way of comparison, the annual consumption of Zündschnüren Pyrotechnikern of the police, the ammunition from the second world war or the Soviet brother army exceeds some years has barely 1,500 metres. 
And the police always order just such quantities of ammunition it before the end of the Gebrauchsdauer can consume. 
The safety of the Pyrotechniker because, in addition, one holds the possibility of more modern flexible purchases and therefore reliable Zündschnüre open. 
The Ministry of Defence has already huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tonnes of munitions from times of the Warsaw Treaty, as the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak People's Army for their campaign to the Rhine. 
According to the Pyrotechnikern MF DNES raised the Czech armed forces have the same problem in a few years in the killing of hundreds of kilometres of old Zündschnüre today as "good" has bought.
