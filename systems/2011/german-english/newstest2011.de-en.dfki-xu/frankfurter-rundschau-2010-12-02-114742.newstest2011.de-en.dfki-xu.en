Inspectors in the twilight 
The European Food Authority EFSA is with Genpflanzen experimental industry. 
This charge now formulated the group of experts Testbiotech which sees herself as an independent institute for the impact of the biotechnology. 
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well documented," said test biotech leader Christoph then on Wednesday in Munich. 
The head of the EFSA panel of genetically modified crops, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert was for years the lobbyists Ilsi under contract. 
The will of companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer paid. 
Kuiper was instrumental in the EFSA test requirements for Genpflanzen worked and am in a clear conflict of interests, then criticized. 
The EFSA rules are (manner, word for word, with position papers of the Ilsi and deceive the imprint of the industry, which really should be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma. 
It was the second time that a conflict of interest bem√§ngle test Biotech. 
It is a high-level EFSA Managerin recently without restrictions or transitional period for the Swiss agricultural company Syngenta, and have changed sides. 
The central German radio (MDR) recently had personal links between kontrollierender EU authority and industrial lobby reveals what the Federal Office for as well as EU parliamentarian has made open. 
The EFSA can However, see no conflict of interest. 
We will take all serious data back to the industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, says in a statement. 
The experts who work for EFSA, we ask that they have no contact with the industry. 
But they have to disclose them. 
Kuiper gives his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US. 
This describes himself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including on risk assessment for biotechnology without lobby. 
In the matter criticize independent experts as then that genetically modified crops currently without any rat-feeding in animals are allowed and the reaction of Genpflanzen environmental influences not tested. 
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize on the field", says then. 
Current practice is only isolated proteins, but not the whole Genpflanze to test how artificial no reliable results. 
"If one does not seek the risks, how is it then?" Asks then pointed. 
It is also Angelika Hilbeck. 
The scientist research since 1994 in the engineering and is currently at the Technical University of Zurich. 
The industry is trying in this area, as in the United States now in Europe is becoming more critical scientists to influence or discredit. 
There is therefore hardly researchers, companies are intertwined. 
For businesses critical studies would normally not be published. 
"The industry is controlling the security research", said Hilbeck.
