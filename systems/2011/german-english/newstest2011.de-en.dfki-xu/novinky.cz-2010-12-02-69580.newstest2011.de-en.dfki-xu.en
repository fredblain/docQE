These had allegedly tried to manipulate a public competition to be held just Restitutionsansprüchen processing so that the competition offered plots a specific zufielen interested. 
This should Luboš G. paid for half a million. 
"At this stage, I can only confirm that the police a person for the offence of fraudulent practices in a public competition is," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner prosecutors' Právo further details could not provide it in terms of the ongoing investigation.

The spokesman of the soil fund Lubomír Černá led to the question of Právo, the police have Pilsner of soil Fund arrests and this during a public competition. 
"It was a client and not one of our employees' defined her. 
The public competition, according to Mrs Černá had the correct name 'call for tenders of claims on the transfer of land in accordance with the law "and would take place in cases in which several applicants offered interest in the land bezeigen. 
"These people are in the context of the transfer to request a higher value of begleichenden Restitutionsansprüche than the proclaimed land value." 
"In accordance with the offer entitlements will determine the order of the potential acquirer, then gives the soil fund the land on the person with the highest offer," said the spokesman of the fund. 
Luboš G. were obviously provide information to those who request had notified and because he was justified in person as he had bought a number of Restitutionsansprüchen, he offered a property interests in that he is withdrawing from the competition. 
Obviously against a fat compensation. 
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money in to arrest him. 
Luboš G. had in the past too good contacts with the Pilsner land fund. 
So He also played in the issue of the former head of the ground fund Václav Sankota a role has been prosecuted because he Ersatzrestitutionen plots, which already made location decisions were taken. 
At the time Luboš G. acquired the land fund, for example, land to build public roads were intended to be precise, more specifically, in the place where the construction of the area Borské Pole was planned. 
Later He exchanged this very favourably with the government against a house directly in the historic center of the city, the value of the land far exceeded. 
The local authority had gone back with a heavy heart, which works by blocking the land.
