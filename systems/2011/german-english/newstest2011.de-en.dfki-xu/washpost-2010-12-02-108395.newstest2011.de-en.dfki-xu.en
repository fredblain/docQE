Belarus agrees not to collect weapons-grade uranium. 
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. 
The deal was in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Council. 
The US government has for years tried to convince Belarus, not collect more highly enriched uranium and appeared to have reached a hurdle last spring. 
But officials of the U.S. government told the Washington Post that in the last two months, two secret agreements with Belarus have been taken to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a research center. 
The setting the stage for the agreement on Wednesday, to remove the rest of the material, according to an official staff because of the sensitivity of the subject, anonymous, about 500 pounds. 
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear security summit of the 47 nations" in April, the White ruled Russia. 
And it was obvious good enough, at the invitation of the former Soviet republic to secure the next summit in 2012. 
"I was really enthusiastic about the fact that they want a seat in the nuclear security summit (2012)." 
"It shows me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the partnership Global security, a group promoting nuclear safety. 
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant step" of Belarus. 
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials within four years. 
Since then, the U.S. government six countries, their highly enriched uranium to get rid of. 
Belarus will be the seventh. 
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush. 
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, the Byelorussian President Alexander Lukashenko has said that the nation will never give up its uranium. 
"How retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which basically weapons is capable of, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at that time. 
"This is our raw material... 
We will not make any dirty bombs from this and we will not sell it to anybody. " 
Belarus still approached a few months ago the United States, interest in the meeting of an agreement. 
The first Attempt to remove the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material easily contaminated by radiation, say officials. 
It was in a Spezialzug load, the more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, officials say. 
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials. 
The U.S. government pays $14 million for this effort, with a large part of the money flowing in the Belarusian research with depleted uranium, which can be used for nuclear weapons. 
"This was extremely careful coordinated in order to build confidence," which led to the agreement which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, the global threat reduction. 
The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende study estimates that Belarus this year at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium, and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus will be under the joint agreement camps until 2012. 
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights. 
But the statement Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement. 
"The progress of this global security issues heißend welcome the United States of America and Belarus aware that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens", she says.
