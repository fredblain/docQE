Tech Toys keeps your present budget in balance 
This year's favourite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect Videokonsole. Both games can be a great hole in your gifts budget. 
An iPad costing as much as five BMX bikes for $99, while the price for a Kinect game about 10 classic Spring rush or approximately 48 doses Play-Doh. 
But you can protect your present budget. 
I recently visited in search of three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale club. 
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law had entered into force. This year the technology toys are more efficient and cost less than last year. 
And while fewer new toys with its own website, is the best known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin. 
There are more and more button-cell-powered toys on the market, and many of them contain wiederaufladbare batteries. 
Here are a few suggestions. 
(Unless otherwise indicated, all the prices of Toys "R" Us.) 
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for children from the age of 3 years) are Plüschfiguren, as big as guinea pigs that sing a note on her stomach. 
Even in a down note by mehrmaliges pushing can play a song. 
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony. 
Respect: If you with the pressing started, you can no longer stop. 
For a combination of Gesand and dance is the Dance star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60 for children, 2) the best choice. 
On the basis of last year developed Elmo Live technology offers the animatronische doll recantations as' Simon says' and, thanks to the new hinge feet with Radblockierung dominates the moon-Walk. 
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. Their parents complained about the lack of volume. 
If you are a child of the eighties, you surely remember Alphie, one of the first computerized Lernspielzeuge. 
Now he is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40, for children from the age of 3), with a whole bunch of issue cards with which a car journey to a lesson can be, with a preached with Autokorrektur-Funktion as a teacher. 
If you want to entrust your child Smartphone, here are three independent alternatives. 
MobiGo of VTech ($60 for children 3 to 8) is the cheapest and benutzerfreundlichste solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. The Games, however, are not as instructive as contained in the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children 3 to 12), the first major review of the Leapster-Reihe is equipped with a new, brighter screen. 
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes. 
IXL of Fisher-Price ($90 for children 3 to 7) for the Games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD-Kartenlaufwerks can also family photographs to be seen. 
Finally, there is still Scrabble flash ($30 of Hasbro, for children from are no bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen. 
At stake is the blocks words together, before the time. It is great for an improvised Buchstabierwettbewerb. 
More and more toys have a kind of online connection. 
If you are on offer in the toy shops, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important. 
For your child an online animal in Club Penguin, you can, for example, a Disney Club Penguin 2 'mix' n match figures package ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code. 
If you enter the code Online, your child in Club Penguin Store enough bill for two other parts. 
This can be roller skates or a Puffle soft toy. 
The latest Kopfzellen-betriebene Mikroroboter, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children 5) is not bigger than the head of your toothbrushes. 
The Käfer moves quickly to 12 vibrierenden silicone legs in any direction. 
It makes it Fun to send him through a maze Klötzen. 
And he has something. 
Our fell from the kitchen table and survived even some time in the mouth of our dog.
