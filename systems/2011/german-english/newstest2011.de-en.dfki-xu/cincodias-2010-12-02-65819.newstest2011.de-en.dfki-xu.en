Posturing of the European Central Bank (ECB) 
The Investors have responded strongly to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, warned that "markets should not underestimate our capacity for response." 
The euro Peripheriländer risk premia increased dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%. 
We should, however, the possibility that the ECB can deceive and the euro gained to points, which led to concern not underestimate. 
The events of yesterday are typical for an illiquid market collapses in the extent to which he recovered, but following the closure of short and highly speculative positions. 
The institutional investors will not lose his fear. 
A month ago the European Central Bank to reverse our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen, whereby the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably many times in the future, must backtrack. 
The Bundesbank has called for the lifting of the plan to buy government debt, as they are ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. it is Only a einwöchiger permanent access will be maintained. 
After the Ireland-crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures "at least until March" extended and the quarterly contracts with unlimited access at quarter end to guarantee the liquidity until at least June. 
We also expect that the program to buy bonds and spend a stärkendes signal. 
If the established expectations are not met, the excellent response of the markets yesterday thrown back and if halstarrig insisted that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us! 
Just as with the ECB meeting in May, when the bank confirmed the purchase of government debt into account and then the markets collapsed, could this story tomorrow. 
The ECB must be credible and persistent. 
In May showed the teeth and on Wednesday said they, too, which they bought a new collapse of the market. 
Yesterday was the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal rather weak. 
The state asset management was only 500 million to 5,28% to 750 million 4,81% in the previous auction. 
Yet the interest rates in Portugal by 30 basis points across the curve and reflected a perception changes in the markets after the words Trichet's. 
In Ireland, the numbers of the fault hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland. 
The sum is estimated at approximately 10 000 million in the short term and possibly further 15 000. There is time until February, private capital or these banks will be nationalized. 
Although Ireland has lost all its credibility after it had not recognized the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures are acceptable in the context of the rescue plan and help to reduce the uncertainty. 
However, the government must obtain the parliamentary approval to his new budget next Tuesday. Because it still does not have the adequate support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty. 
Angela Merkel has their discourse with regard to the summit of the Heads of State and Government on 14 December moderate. There is political unity needed to show that together we play the same score. 
The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries the ninth symphony Beethoven's. 
The Spanish Government yesterday emphasised the action plan on Friday is expected to be approved by the Council of Ministers. 
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reducing the public deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. sound like Vivaldis Four seasons in the ears of investors. 
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock markets. 
Compared with February was the response of the government and the Bank of Spanish quickly and convincingly, and we benefit from the surprise effect. 
Today there is a major auction of a three-year government bonds, which will benefit from the Trichet effect. That is why we are a strong demand, which will remove all doubt about our ability to refinance. 
For Spain the application of an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice. 
We would get liquidity which we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without notice. 
Nevertheless, our strategy should comply with the motto Caesar's wife: "Now is not only the existence, but also of the licence." 
Only courage that we create.
