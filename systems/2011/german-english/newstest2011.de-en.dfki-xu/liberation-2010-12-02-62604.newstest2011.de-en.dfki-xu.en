Climate: As France Finanzversprechen table 
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the quickly dissolved financing pledge (also called "fast start" or premature finance), which the developing countries. 
And the rough French vulnerable to blandishments. 
With the Copenhagen treaty the developing countries have committed to provide 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012. 
The EU has 7,2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year). 
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has pulled out all the stops to convince their partners of the fact of their commitment regarding the fast-start-financing: Detailgetreuer Vorgehensbericht its Member States, press conference, events, brochures distribution. 
The operation transparency is remarkable and at valued for its real value: the developing countries and the society would like to see all developed countries did the same on the same accuracy level. 
The EU announced that in 2010 2.2 billion euros to have released what they are on the right path to Respektbezollung commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012. 
But if you look in detail, things are a little more complicated. 
This money should be according to the Copenhagen treaty "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional deployment, without detriment of public development aid. 
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what "new and additional" means. 
While the Commission had proposed a harmonisation, certain Member states, including France, the procedure blocked. 
Today everyone chooses the benchmark, which he considers the best. 
The EU Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those of the year 2009: The international funding are maintained, and 150 million in "the framework of the fast-start" over three years. 
Other countries have similar standards, either on year or about conditions at the level of public development aid. 
In return, France was of the opinion that the funding of all new projects "of the year 2010 are" new and additional ". 
In other words, there are no guidelines on the spending of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid. 
Specifically, the sum total of French support for developing countries remain stable (or decline) - France, his commitment to the "new and additional funding". 
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. 
There is still no rule, and everyone chooses his Rechenmodus. 
Some, such as France, 1 borrowed €as being equivalent to €1 donated. 
Obviously this is only reasonable that the effort is not comparable. 
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to the emission reduction projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro, for a donated euro... should also hijacked only the cost of the loan for the capital donor country than commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate). 
But France has nothing else in terms than the following consideration: it "respected" his obligation of 420 million euros by 91.5% loan (389,8 million euro) and of 36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to convince themselves. 
France is the only land the EU that loans to a great extent. 
Germany 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among other things) their commitments to 100% with donations. 
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €to fulfil their obligations, France just 10 cents and understands including a comparable effort. 
Fine Hokuspokus! 
All in all, operates France in its fast-start financing with a double fraud: To A part with a Weiterentwicklkung of the action over the period and partly with the reality of financial support. 
France manage to think that 420 million "new and additional" millions in agreement with his promise and saves 36.1 million. 
The manipulation of the Treasury (as it appears that it was Bercy, the arbitrage has carried out) could be a double negative impact; even EU internally (why the other member states with the donations, if there is to lend?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries not completely fooled... 
The chapter of the premature funding only a small issue on relatively short time compared to the discussions on the climate. 
But it could be too much in the massive machinery of the UNFCCC. 
We hope that this will not be the case. 
As always, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year of early funding. 
In the first France could announce a change in its accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, and in a spirit of respect for his obligations and the counterbalancing justice with the other countries of the European Union. 
But especially France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of long-term financing dispute (another and at the moment: You can escape The question of "Verrechenbarkeit" or the recording its loans. 
France could alter his position to be just as progressive with regard to the disputes, as it is in other things. 
The hope is based on the new environment minister Kosciusko-Morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun. 
A surprising announcement on the fast-starting of France and his vision of the "Verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loans would increase the international confidence by nature, which is necessary for further discussions.
