Rachsüchtige hackers and busy spies 
The affair WikiLeaks has a twofold significance. 
On one hand, it proved to be an obvious scandal dictator, a scandal that only a scandal in Sinner hypocrisy is the Beziehunge between states, the citizens and the press. 
On the other Hand announces it profound changes at international level, and is a foretaste of the future dominated by regression. 
But we are going in the right order. 
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any drafted by a secret service) composed exclusively of newspaper cuttings. 
The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi's throw anything more than what you over several months anyway in any other Journal to read (except for those whose owners Berlusconi), and the frightening karikaturierte profile Gaddafi's offered Kabarettkünstlern for a very long time for their Sketche. 
The principle of the secret dossier should only be already known news is essential for the dynamism of the secret services, and not just in this century. 
If you go to a library, esotherischen publications, you will see that every plant (on the grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) exactly what happened in previous works. 
This is not, therefore, that the author occult texts does not want to publish enquiries (still therefore, that he would not know where exist to find), but because those who are the Okkultismus, nothing other than what they already know and confirmed what they have learned. 
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown. 
As the secret files. 
The informant is lazy and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (for example, it could otherwise be whatever editor in Libération), the only true considers what he acknowledges. 
The Top Secret information on Berlusconi, the American Embassy in Rome had sent the Staatsdezernat were the same as those who already Newsweek published the week before. 
So why was such a fuss about the revelations of this dossier? 
On one side suggests that any educated person already know and that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the Government can call each other or a plane, in order to make dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of a couple of small have changed. 
Any viewer of investigation films knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that acting to ignore it. 
However, the fact to repeat it publicly, violated the task of hypocrisy and serves to American diplomacy in a bad light. 
In second place: The idea that an any old hacker can tap the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world, is the most significant blow to the prestige of the Staatsdezernats. 
In addition, rather than victims, the scandal the "Executioner" in trouble. 
But we are the profound nature of what happened. 
Previously, Orwell's time, it was all power as a Big Brother pool, every gesture of his subjects. 
Orwell's prophecy could have where one can control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction, visited the hotel, the elected motorway and so on; the citizens would total victims of the eye of power. 
But if we see what is happening today, that even the secret Krypten power no longer control of a Hackers can escape, to be directed Kontrollgang and will circle shaped. 
The power controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - chosen as avenger by the citizen - the secrets of power in experience. 
How can a power that is no longer able to protect their own secrets? 
It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be unveiled); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel of Geheimis, because it exposes the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks disclosed that the secrets of Hillary Clinton any power. 
WikiLeaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama. 
What are the consequences of this injury, which has caused a big power? 
It is obvious that the states in future no longer online information - that would be a reserved in the street corner angeklebten form. 
But it is also clear that with the current technology in vain hope is confidential reports on telephone secret. 
Nothing is easier than finding out whether and when a Head of state in a plane and continuing contacted one of his colleagues. 
How could in future private and only to some ears certain relationships? 
I know very well that my prediction at the moment for science fiction and novel prison, but I am forced to imagine the government agents in secret way preoccupied on uncontrollable march routes shattering, their communications anywhere else than the mere memory of decay, and the few written information they received in the footwear (verbergend. 
The information would be stored in single copy in closed drawers: Basically the Spionageversuch of Watergate had less success, as WikiLeaks. 
I had the opportunity to write that the technology as a cancer progresses, namely backwards. 
A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionised the communication, the Internet reconstructed a telegraph with (telephone) line. 
The (analogue) video cassettes, the film allows them a film band for broadband auszukundschaften by forward from behind spulen and could reveal all mysteries of the assembly, while the (digital) CDs, today nothing other than from chapter to chapter to jump in macro-portions. 
With the high-speed trains travel within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this including of switching requires three and a half hours. 
Therefore, it is not unusual that policy and communications technology come back to car and horse. 
A final observation. 
In earlier times, the press to understand what secrets between the messages were forged. 
Currently, there are the messages that confidential information from the press.
