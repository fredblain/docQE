Global plan for the renewal of the light 
The UN yesterday in Cancun a plan to regenerate the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (CFC) suggested that almost a third of the additional reduction, which must be implemented in order to stabilize the earth's climate by 2020. 
This ambitious plan adopted its position in the steps of the concrete major projects to implement in Cancun, the UN hopes to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by developed countries. 
After yesterday's plan would the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the lighting on the Earth's CFCs be avoided if the white glowing pears, which has a monopoly of 50% to 70% on the market by fluoreszierende or, better still, by Leuchtdioden (led). 
The lights are responsible for 8% of global emissions. 
This is the equivalent of 70% of emissions of global vehicle fleets. 
In Copenhagen last year the big Abgasemittenten as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans, the global CFC emissions of 53 Gt to 49 Gt should. 
This review should, however, still 5 is deducted from now until 2020 to stabilise the climate increases to 2 degrees centigrade in order to prevent this spiral out of control. 
In the White glowing pears hole 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light. 
With the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, with the new LED bulbs reduces these energy needs two fold again. 
The Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen keep on average between 6,000 and 10,000 hours. 
The new LED bulbs, such as those that the manufacturers Philips has put on the market this week - this society has taken part in the UN - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-hot pear, a hint of the savings of the Auswechselungsplanes should be applied in 100 countries. 
Besides the fact that iese completely new light bulbs very little heat, they can work also with a rheostat. 
And they do not contain any mercury. 
Several experts have shown that Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves, what is not always possible in the developing countries because they contain mercury and that it therefore as hazardous waste dump, which of an adoption agency. 
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, not the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal-fired power plants that emit far more mercury to produce the white-hot pears wasted electricity. 
In the United States alone that coal plants 25,000 tons of mercury annually. 
The report sets out in detail the profits which each country thanks to this international programme would generate. 
Indonesia would such a billion dollars a year in buying electricity and save eight million tonnes of CO2, which means the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose edification Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
