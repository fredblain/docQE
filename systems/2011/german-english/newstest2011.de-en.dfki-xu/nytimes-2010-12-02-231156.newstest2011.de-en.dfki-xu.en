Cheshire-appeal calls attention to Twitter 
Half a dozen of them tippten in the riots in the courtroom. 
The minutes-stroke verschickten via Twitter their reports on grey cent testimonies. 
In the end, the defence, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the process for rape and beds gekettete children in a house that flare. 
On Thursday, the process will be closely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was accused three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to have killed, an official end, if the ruling on the death sentence, the panel has ruled. 
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted applications to court, the grounds for an appeal and the courts for years to come. 
One of the most provocative reasons is that it through intensive reporting on the process, even by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - a "circus atmosphere" and such a widespread, swift penetration rebel details, so that the jury was improperly influenced by the public indignation. 
This protest Appelationsgerichte could lead to deal with the question of whether the new technologies require new rules in the court. 
"As I have seen it during this process, I think that it really is a danger, if the arrival of the new technologies in the courtroom influenced the individual right to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes main defender. 
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue chamber of the Supreme Court, rejected the applications by referendum succinctly last week when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there is no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion. 
But this was certainly not the last word in this matter. 
For decades, court objections have noticed that the reporting of famous cases doubts about the fairness of the process. 
In his historic decision in 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States the ruling against Dr Sam Sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, killed his wife, and said in his decision that there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media. 
Some think that the television series and the movie "On the flight" based on this crime. 
Some lawyers say, court judgments, which Mr. Hayes condemnation half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary for the communication from the courtroom at the time of the fall Dr Sheppard were unimaginable. 
"There is a good reason to be worried about the impact of the new media in processes that will be followed by a broader public," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut. according to his report, 
Professor Donohue said, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of an immediate communication out of the courtroom could make the process fairer. 
The Twitter issue is just one of many, the lawyers of Mr. Hayes explain to discuss years and thus delaying a condemnation. 
The defenders claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes had already been explanation as judge Blue could not allow them to test the reaction of potential Juroren, giving them during the Jurorenauswahl. 
Some of the judges said that photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-petit, 48 years, and their TÃ¼chter, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years, they would have met with disgust. 
The defenders say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge mistakenly a jury have exchanged views, a critic of the department, and that he improperly exerted pressure on the ruling, as he had taken the unusual decision, the jury over the weekend. 
The judges were not isolated. 
But their arguments about the impact of the extensive reporting on the process is perhaps the greatest interest. 
In a judgment appeals they have submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American Senate. 
They argued that the new media would have kindled the flames of the emotions on the case. 
"Such a daily crush of Medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," wrote lawyers' has previously in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide has not yet seen. " 
Their focus on reporting by Twitter is controversial. 
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that this direct news is rabble-rousing but slower than the reports will be reimbursed, a technology hostile view is that the report on future processes verarme. 
However, some lawyers said, Appelationsgerichte would often faced with the argument, social and technological changes need the Adaptation through the courts. 
Mr. Hayers lawyers reinforce this assertion. 
In their objection they related to the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, in the conviction of due to the coverage was lifted, and made clear that the new media require new rules. 
"This case," they wrote, 'Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century. "
