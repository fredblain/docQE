Mystery of the komplexgeschüttelten Canada lifted 
The new American diplomats pipes were spread by WikiLeaks, to reveal the secret about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of the Canadians opposite the Americans; they show but with the same blow the superiority of the latter open against Canada. 
Consequently, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters at the ballot has not the Canadian-American relations, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government budget from 2009. 
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington yesterday publicly offer were spread more juicy details than mere substantial content, in which it has a very bad outcome. 
One of 22 September 2008 carved link in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage was in full swing, reported about what the United Nations is no longer in their political leaders discussed operations. 
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the used in Ottawa, American ambassador. 
Mr Wilkins offers various channels this situation. 
"The Canadians almost packages inferiority complex, led the Canadian, political leaders, to talk about internal matters of everyday life, rather than the United States in this election the buck (as in 1988, when the campaign on the free trade)," he describes. 
The United Nations, he concludes, are therefore 'the proverbial Goliath this election: omnipresent, but potentially too to speak about him ". 
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" since the two countries have close political and economic relations. 
"He logically assessed," should the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leaders to drive such a crucial relationship, the voters at the polls as a key factor in the spirit. " 
The other expression of this sense of importance reads on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business sources in Ottawa, sent communication, President Barack Obama on his first visit to prepare in Ottawa. 
"Their trip will help support the continued existence of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, when Canada its first deficit after more than a decade, will be the basis of a recovery programme in the $30 to $40 billion is" Breese. 
Nowhere, he had said that the government had to postpone parliamentary session before Christmas, in order to prevent Parliament from the coalition would throw and the conditional continuation of opposition parties would impact on the quality of the proposed expansion programme. 
Another, from January 2008 and affair on the part of the ambassador Wilkins drafted communication Washington agreed by the increasingly negative image that the broadcast on CBC, dramatic series of the United States. 
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts as Border, little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" or contributions for the purposes of Muskelprotze CIA see of interrogation. 
Yet another communication reported in detail about how Hillary Clinton remarked with her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner during their first bilateral meeting then asked whether Europe is ready to certain prisoners from Guantanamo. 
Mr Kouchner is said to have the answer is yes, but on the basis of an individual decision. 
Àm at the end of the meeting, described the Secretary of State, "he has a paper in terms of Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim Canadian origin." 
"The State Secretary promised to check the acts once again". 
We are, after all, still say that the people heat up with regard to the web page WikiLeaks. 
Tom Flanagan, an old and very closely Stephen Harper adviser, had on CBC said that those responsible for this massive leak "should be killed". 
He had to Mike Huckabee here from the United States.
