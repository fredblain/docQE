Bond for the takeover of eXcentris 
The Quebecer government by the Société Angus and the parallèle called on companies to participate financially in the takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris explains with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive loan. 
The developer society Angus and the company Parallèle, a donation of EUR seven million dollars from the Kultusministerium for the adoption of Daniel Langlois cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent had hoped that once its actual cineastischen function to entrust, do not seem to receive what they have demanded. 
The government has accepted, in this case, however, on their own terms. 
Instead of the expected donation provides the Quebecer government instead a bond in less than initially hoped that a viable solution to create favourable conditions could, at least in the opinion of the state scaremongers entnehmbaren sources. 
A first action plan and a question after 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, the Bittgesuch, since the sums moderately downwards. 
A proposal together with an action plan has already been approved by the president of the 'Société de Développement of entreprises culturelles "(SODEC), François Macerola, the 
Several days ago, he had a recent technical report. 
The counterproposal of the cabinet was sent to the SODEC, however, on Wednesday. 
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December time to respond to this. 
In any case, the premise of the state donation really pushed aside. 
Let us remember that the Quebecer owners Community cinemas and cinema complex against a direct state investment to support the takeover of eXcentris revolted had invoked by the argument, the Culture Ministers have no financial assistance for real estate projects there, which he sent to other cinemas. 
Several other market participants of the segment heard but in contrast, substantial economic assistance. 
Cinema chief Daniel Langlois had the self-financed construction of the cinema over ten years with great difficulty, the authors cinema in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exception position on the part of the treasury. 
The lack of cinema, the independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew his clientele. 
The Société Angus and the company parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, in turn, is a privately funded Campagne, of which it is a sum of $700 000, in order to boost employment. 
Since the spring 2009 continued only a single screen, to show films in eXcentris: Le parallèle. 
The Objective of the future buyers is the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the demonstration of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "The hommes et des dieux 'to reopen. 
Christian Yaccarini but has the newspaper Le Devoir "not removed, and it ignores what he and his group of the revised down proposals keep them.
