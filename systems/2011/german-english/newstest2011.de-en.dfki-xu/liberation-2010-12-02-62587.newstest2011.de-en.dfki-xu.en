Métro Grand Paris: First financial vignettes 
Since the debate about the modernisation of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it rains billion. 
At least in the discussions. 
We call this the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris in memory of the Société du Grand Paris is being built. 
At the start of construction - the SGP, the state capital allocation of EUR 4 billion. 
In theory, this system is the sum of the SGP is then in the markets, a part of the financial sum to her twin. 
Today it is, after all, the first projections. 
The supplementary budget by 2010, this morning by the Commission looked at the National Assembly, contains the planned measures, the first part of this money. 
It is two measures: The creation of a special tax to Erschließund and higher taxation of offices on the Ile de France. 
The former, so remove Article 15 of the draft law, "the benefit of the public service Société du Grand Paris". 
This is numbered: "the product of This tax amounts to 117 million per year. 
Zweitere is a reorganization of the existing corporate taxation: "In order to modernise it to increase its educational product and this increase of Société du Grand Paris's". 
How much would this make? 
A mystery. 
This amount is not in the text. 
Of the 4 billion is away. 
"It is said that the fiscal resources to the 4 billion euros of the Kapitaldotation being added by the State and the Société du Grand Paris and for the project to be done," is the explanatory statement. 
In the SGP will take place this system not offensive at all. 
"For the moment when we recorded revenue (the two taxes, R.), the design over three years, and then only from the 4 billion windfall", it is claimed. 
"This is noted in the budget and gradually withdrawn." 
The SGP estimates that 2013 will be started, to note the 2014 4 billion for the budget. 
This measure, the 4 billion promised there will be long, is in danger of a very eventful, parliamentary debate. 
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
