The ice-university 
The "gelato University" in Bologna Eiskonditoren are prepared for better seasons. 
The three-day course for future Gelatieri has the largest feeder and visitors from around the world. 
Why is actually the whole ice? 
The Gelatiere and the Gelataio. 
The Gelatiere, in a little old-fashioned the cream, after all the rules of the Italian Eismacherkunst. 
The Gelataio is catching up with a Spachtel the ice cream from the Kühltheke, it abolishes the Waffel and then selling them. 
In order to know this, you do not need to Anzola Dell Emilia in the province of Bologna. 
But who would like to know more about ice, is not "gelato-University" the Italian firm Carpigiani over. 
The ice-University has set up the manufacturers of Eismaschinen in 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines everywhere the high Italian ideals. 
The three-day course for future Gelatieri has the largest feeder and visitors from around the world. 
But there are also more day Spezialkurse around the Schokoladeneis and internships in the domestic Eisdiele. 
Some dreams in the midlife Crisis of a new career, other cars simply let the treacherous ice of vague aspirations. 
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil and Hungary to Saudi Arabia. 
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow-food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial 
Anke from Berlin is business adviser and after years in a nerve-racking job eintüten. 
Two young Egyptians dream in Cairo to open a Eisdiele. 
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia, because their children Italian ice cream. 
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari declared the participants first of all, the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream. 
It is not only good taste, but also the seidige fluidity and good consistency. 
Luciano forgets his training but also not the icing on the cake of the national and even construction: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still plenty of romanticism." 
The first step to manufacturing seems very simple. 
Luciano dump the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a major Mixgerät with an electronic program everything to 85 degrees heated and then immediately to four degrees. 
Then he turns to a tap on the machine, and is a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all Milcheissorten. 
The teacher immediately with questions: Can ice cream only with natural substances without stabilizer? 
How can one of their own Experimentierlust free rein? 
Luciano warns, the spirit of the age to be fooled. 
Who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients", has probably still stabilisers - usually a natural product, such Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne. 
Of course you can ice without stabiliser, only it must then be sold within a day in, and the customer bite on Eiskörnchen louder. 
Certain variations in the mass are allowed. 
It gets more thrilling with the flavours. 
For the taste in the ice maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients which one buys in the fruit-department or the sweets of the supermarket. 
In addition, there are powder and Pasten. 
"The suppliers are all trying to foist onto dozens of aromatic additives." 
"But you should just experiment." 
Either the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruit. 
Or in the ice cream from the white Grundmasse, with eggs on the yellow cream and cocoa powder into the basis for all kinds of Schokoladen-Verführungen. 
Now the course participants in the Eismaschinen. 
Luciano will each have four different types of Vanille-, Schokolade-, Mokka- and produce Haselnuss-Eis - with or without eggs in the mass with more or less Vanillearoma or other natural additives. 
The same experiment will also be subject to the Fruchteissorten. 
More flavourings, more fruit Püree - geschmacklich is not necessarily better. 
Haselnuss-eis tastes to nussiger if it contains more hazelnuts. 
The most popular kiwi ice, the working group, the more fruit, using less water and less stabiliser. 
A balanced mixture stresses the taste of a Gelato properly first, says Luciano. 
Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: Will peach-Püree used with a lot of sugar, the sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced. 
For Zitroneneis an extra dose of sugar is necessary. 
Luciano a device, with which he prefers the sugar content of the fruit varieties (wine fairs so that the Oechsle in musts). 
Fortunately for the calculation of tables. 
Ice to make requires not so much physical use as before. 
Not only the device for the automatic restoration of basic mass helps. 
There is also a device in which the ready-made ice-mix at the same time cremig beaten and cooled on minus temperatures. 
Despite all the automated remain accidents. 
The Brazilian Gustavo acquitted him and his colleagues from top to bottom with Fruchtpüree than the colossal hand blenders spiral out of control. 
"In every direction," says Maestro Luciano, "it is only a matter of time until something happens."
