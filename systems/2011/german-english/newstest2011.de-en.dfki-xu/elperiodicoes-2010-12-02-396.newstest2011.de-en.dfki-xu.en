Puigcercós addiction with a nod to the Carod close to peace in the ERC 
The Republican leaders allowed the party a secret ballot on his continuation in office. 
Huguet suggests a more pluralistic government and the end of the plenary session principle. 
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for the umpteenth time an internal rebellion in the ranks of the after the loss of 11 Members and half of the rows 
The party chairman is aware that his threat of resignation the close to the former party leader, Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the impact of this sector is now so weakened as her mentor, and he will not bring the same headaches as other former currents. 
Therefore the leader of Esquerra with a nod to the new critics to win, which would secure his position until the next local elections. 
For the beginning kündete yesterday that more than 200 regional council members of ERC on his secret could stay in office. 
With ballot papers, not with superior hand. 
If the Carodisten wanted to miss the Präsidenen a parking ticket, they could do this without fear of reprisals. 
Indeed, the head of both the impression of division and subjection to avoid his person. 
In several interviews he confirmed he would deal with the half of the votes plus a not feel confirmed, and he added without giving values, a result "in the Bulgarian style" would also not be good. 
The Carod close to demand the president is more than just the party office. An inadequate gesture, since Puigcercós the supreme body of controlled congresses. 
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to speeding up of resignations, they will be the chairman of an action plan from now until May. 
For this they expect that in the drafting of the document on strategic reorientation that the leadership on 18 will submit to the vote in the Council to be able to participate. 
Their intention is to underwrite Puigcercós. In return, this promise, the Congress in the fall of 2011, what the party is already a fact. 
The chairman of the ERC believes the "Polyphonie" damages the stability and he strives once and for all, the organisation in washing their dirty laundry behind closed doors. 
In this sense, the article, which the President-in-Conseller Josep Huguet signed in his blog, symptomatic. 
Given the Puigcercós is an ideologue, kept the holders of Innovació it for a fact that the party chairman "in exchange for various objectives" will be based. 
He was one of five to two. 
First, the "restructuring" of the board, so that at least 90 percent of the party members, that means the inclusion of new faces from Carods environment. 
The second could be the great news. 
Huguet Suggests ERC should the General Assembly principle as a functioning finally abandon. 
He verfechtet a reform of the Statute, which should make it possible to hold the meetings with elected delegates. 
By the end of the General Assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós' team that already in the last two conferences fought obsessively. 
Indeed, on the bebenden assembly of the party leadership with the review of the 2008 General Assembly principle at a convention on which should deal with the reform of the statutes. 
This deadline is still out, because infogle internal Aufruhe of recent years, addressing this issue was not advisable. 
Now, without the critical sectors are on the lookout, the time has come to this issue once and for all.
