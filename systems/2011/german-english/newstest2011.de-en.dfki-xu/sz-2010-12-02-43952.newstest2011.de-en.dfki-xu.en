Dear in times of war 
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer with the work on her still nameless Regiedeb√ºt begun, there is anger. 
The script has even written a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man. 
We know a lot more about it - but that is enough for unrest. 
The rumour persists, the woman, a Muslim, Verliebe during the war in Yugoslavia their Serbian rapists. 
Bosnian women's associations have immediately protested, and some in Sarajevo planned Drehtage short term were transferred to Hungary. 
The film is marginalised in Hungary and is now in the post-production, but it will still protesting in Bosnia. 
Bakira Hasecic of the organisation of female war victims wrote about the UN refugee agency UNHCR of Jolie and asked for a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has reported, Jolie is itself an ambassador of the UN Refugee Relief. 
Diplomatically, it is not - it has the women, weeks before a meeting in Hungary, which offered but rejected. 
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic. 
Love stories in rape camps have not, and Jolie attitude towards the victims betraying her enough on the script. 
According to the UN refugee agency has recommended that Jolie as ambassador, told the Guardian. 
But what exactly has Jolie for scenes written? 
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, the their script to read, has given a Drehgenehmigung for Sarajevo - it is not clear why Jolie very is still not occurred. 
The young author even claimed that they had no political intentions with her film, with great effort in the Yugoslav conflict has wanted to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all sides involved. 
The content, however, remains vague. 
As a second Synopsis circulating on the film in the network, but rather different sounds: The lovers knew there was a war to break and, when a Bosnian Muslim, abducted in a Serbian Camp, where he works as a guard. 
What sounds is significantly different than the variant "rape victims verknallt in torturer". 
That Jolie film really starts before the war - that much is certain. 
The pressure on them, as Jolie, was "unfair and is based on misinformation". 
Now, it is only the hackers of Hollywood: Peace gain by the script, like so many before, illegally into the net.
