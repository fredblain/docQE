The track of stones 
Uli Gsell has also concerned what totalling approximately 400 kg. 
On Monday night he was supreme power station, the Tuba on the back. 
It was Demo. 
It snowed. 
The story is well known: In September were the dredging angerückt and had started a major piece of the north wing. 
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: Thousands marched against S21, billions Tieferlegung the train station. 
When it came to freeze, a large part of the wing lay in ruins. 
Split in 6000, 7000 pieces. 
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, between 1914 and 1920. 
Gsell is Bildhauer in Ostfildern, 43 years old. 
He has secured a few of the pieces. 
"These stones are relics." 
"They must not disappear." 
He swarms: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earth." 
When he took a aufsägte, after Zigarettenqualm rat. 
He does not know What he will do with the chunks. 
Stones have time. 
Uli Gsell also. 
The track of the Stuttgart stones in a forest in Tübingen to a former Munitionsdepot the French army, where Manuel Rongen Stein-Reich has built. 
The 44-year-olds with old stones. 
He has bought all, on the demolition in Stuttgart fell. 
"It would be a shame, they would be ground to gravel or in the landfill will disappear", he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen, which was once a Wachhäuschen. 
It was insulted and threatened him, he tells when in September in the newspapers that he bought the remnants of the north wing of the demolition entrepreneur. 
But he has talked with the S-21 opponents for days. 
And he has said that he now nothing for the demolition. 
And if it is, then it is the wisest thing when the stones were used. 
About 200 S-21-opponents then took an average of 80 kilos of serious Quader with, Stückpreis 6,50 to 14 euros. 
As memory, but some in the hope of him on a reconstruction to be able to return. 
Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 large truck loads. 
About half is still in the forest, the rest is sold. 
Garden owners, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer. 
From wherever they are and have weggeschleppt what boot and supporters could bear. 
The Stuttgart stones of contention have been transformed into "Mäuerle" or in Kräuterbeeten limits. 
"This stone Is actually nothing special", says Rongen. 
"Would not be in the political component." 
He is rising in his SUV, makes a tour through his 20 hectares great empire. 
He has studied law and halted, later biology, then he is interested in computers and finally stones. 
And stone lovers. 
he stores 40000 tons of stones. 
From across Germany karrt his treasures. 
He says he is the greatest Altsteinhändler of the Republic. 
He is slowing down. 
In the snow are skilful behauene sand stones. 
"They were once the Dresden Marienbrücke," he said. 
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he he. 
"My favorite stone." 
It is the way through the forest. 
It shows a bunch: Red limestone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station. 
And on. 
"Beautiful Travertin." 
Once belonged to the gallery of the Neckarstadions Stuttgart Quader. 
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the cathedral Sankt Blasien, tuff of the Heilbronner hospital. 
Which work, which efforts, which sweat. 
If Rongen thinks, as the stones were hit by hand and moved with simple block and tackles they were ox carts, he will be very reverential. 
"It would be a scandal if it would Schreddern." 
He is not rich, rich. 
But 14 people employed the Steinhändler today, also have high in the forest Steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a Glasbläser and settled a horticulturalists. 
"We work hard, but it is satisfactory," says the Resteverwerter. 
Soon he must to Cologne. 
There, too, there are obstacles to save.
