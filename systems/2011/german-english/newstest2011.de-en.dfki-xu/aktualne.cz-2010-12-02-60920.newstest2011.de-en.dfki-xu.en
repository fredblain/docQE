A tenant of Bakala: He fueling the kiln, yet pays higher rent 
An elderly untersetzter man just leaves the clients centre of the society RPG Byty of "Kohlebarons" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest Privatbesitzers of rental housing in the Czech Republic. 
Under the arm a file with three new rental agreements to three homes: For the own one and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who has just served a prison sentence. 
All three in the context of the so-called "deregulation" 
Instead of 3,500 kronor per month to rent the son next year for a two-room apartment with kitchen of the second category. 
"And there is not fluent in the apartment once hot water and heat must be in a simple coal stove," if he angered the finger at the new lease of the son, whose signing he has a power. 
"But what I signed," he says half annoys and half resignedly. 
The citizens association BytyOKD.cz the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral," advises the tenants, the new agreements not to sign simply and to wait until 7 December at which it intends to publish guidance as it combats such contracts. 
But the man beckons only. 
"One says this, the other the", it makes a benighted face. 
The region Ostrava becomes the large "deregulation laboratory" so. 
After the New Year is this deregulation most rental housing in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not been highly marketable pay rent. 
Aktuálně.cz, therefore, this "laboratory" personally. 
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the region Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday full. 
Alongside the door the Bodyguards a safety agency and a call. 
"Rent" in 2011, so is a special Tastfeld Touchscreen. 
Short angetippt and already spuckt the device a list of numbers. 
We have Hardly decoded the number "157" and they the large display from the ceiling of the waiting area. 
Half a minute later in the series. 
A little later an older couple enters the waiting room to ask after the rent, but the onslaught in the waiting room is obviously not the new rent. 
Most people are here to the usual problems to solve, repairs, insurance and so on. 
As of mid-November fly in the region Kuverts Ostrava with the new rental agreements with the most tenants of a total of 44.000 apartments in the portfolios of the RPG in the letter boxes. 
The RPG Byty suggests them in the letter a rent increase of around 15 to 38%. 
The special counter for the new hire in the clients centre is opened since 18 November. 
"The action is a little over a week, which means that this is only the beginning," answer the ladies behind the counter for a moment of hesitation, as the "client" as a journalist dictator. 
The deregulation and Bakalas former miners' apartments are a sensitive issue. 
Before the elections, the parliament vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek being from Ostrava of the CSSD had taken up this issue quite loudly, no wonder, then, that the newspapers are full of them. 
"Twenty years of them I want a new floor." 
"Not even ne besch. WC-tinted spectacles, they were able to change" the aforementioned man air. 
Until now, according to the staff, especially pensioners on counters, in order to convince whether they really receive the promised rent reduction which promises them if they Spezialangebot sign in time. 
In a half reduced February rent the other tenants, the new lease until 15 December sign. 
Until now, "switch" in Havířov but anything other than overloaded of questions. 
"From yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 for here appreciate the counters officials. 
RPG offers both on their websites, as well as Wandtafeln individual Mietvereinbarungen, where it appears necessary. 
But they will not agree to the new rent, the set by an independent court. 
"This is not a threat, but as information about the only viable and legitimate legal approach to understand," said RPG on its websites. 
"No one goes to court," says one of the staff of RPG Byty and a man in the street in front of the client centre gives it at least partly right. 
"I have 13.000 (kroner) pension, it left me 5,000 eating, where I should the money for a legal dispute," he says. 
Then the employee but uncertain. 
"Time." 
"Mr Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and people still waiting for it," she notes. 
The regulated rent ends in the largest part of New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty the rent increase is an economic necessity. 
"The existing level of the rent is not enough for maintaining the Wohnfonds from," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the Wohnungs portfolios of society RPG Byty and - particularly those of the disgruntled tenants criticised the neglect of the housing fund, according to the homeowner was the main reason for the rent increase. 
While RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the rent collected four billion in housing could invest in the four years from 2011 to 2014 to 5.2 billion. 
In the large format 'LCD display from the ceiling to the Polstersesseln in the waiting room of Havířov appear staged is always a few red shining information. 
"The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31 200 homes, which means more than 90% of the apartments of RPG." 
"Always this means most 7,50 CZK per square metre and month" is on the LCD screen to read. 
Only 400 homes from the portfolio of RPG has increased the rent by 38 percent. 
"In these cases, it is to the increase of extremely low rents from 19,66 CZK per square metre," argued RPG. 
In 2600 homes remains the rent at the same level next year. 
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation rents not spectacular, but gradually within four and eight years ago. 
What more - the company imposes a further obligation: All revenue from the rent increase (see diagram) wants it back in the houses, especially in heat savings - in new windows and insulation. 
But, primarily to those people who are the agreements on the rent increase sign.
