The President Barack Obama supported the nationwide mobilization to support the Dream Act - law to legalise undokumentierter students with a news on his personal blog in the social network Twitter. 
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - law, then call your senators and urge the adoption of this law," twitterte Obama. 
His brief communication contains a cyber link to a larger document that calls on the public to contact their senators, unterzüglich with, since the vote of the law is imminent. 
"With your voice, to which we wait, the time has come to listen to you," he said. 
The news was widespread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all vote for every law, except for the extension of the tax rebate from the time of Bush and the financing of the government would be extended. 
Such a blockade, which was announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators could the vote of the Dream Act, legislation and other projects, such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
On the blockade of the Republicans of the law Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trust that, once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable for the other projects could be established. 
"I think we have a lot of time..." 
"We All agree that the tax issue must be completed before the end of the year..."

The chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, kündete on Tuesday, "he would vote at the end of the debate", so that the Dream Act - law legalisation initiative undokumentierter students from next Thursday in the Senate could vote, although the next week was more likely. 
The version of the dream Act - law or the law of the American dream would approximately 800 000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were 16 years old, have lived in this country during the last five years and a higher education or in the army. 
The defenders of the law need 60 votes for the adoption of the initiative, which is why they are dependent on the votes of a handful of Republicans. At the time The organisations of the advocates of this project are organising an intensive clout in the adoption of the law. 
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats. 
However, one of them, the Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, he would vote against and only a Republican, Richard Lugar Indiana, has announced his support of the law. 
Therefore the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side, if other Democrats should vote to turn our backs on the initiative. 
Among the most umworbenen Republicans from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and the Senator George Lemieux from Florida, the mandate of Senator Mel Martinez took over. 
Other Republicans in the past, backed the Dream Act, Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said that it on another occasion not more. 
Another Republican who had voted for the bill, John McCain, his position has not yet been set. 
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate before the biggest obstacles.
