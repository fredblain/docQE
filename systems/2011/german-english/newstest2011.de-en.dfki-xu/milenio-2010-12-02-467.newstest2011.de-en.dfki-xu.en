China considers its targets to reduce greenhouse gases 
The representatives of China said at the COP16, his country has made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and it would maintain its offer by 2020 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases. 
China considers his offer to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases by 40 to 45% assured Su Wei, the representative of this country, on the COP16. 
In his first public appearance at the United Nations (16 world climate summit COP16) assured Su Wei, his country would have enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and convert its industry. 
He said that in the last four years his country has invested $245 million to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. 
However, he said that China would not change his goals, but on this matter would work together with the international community. 
He said that the Chinese strategy on climate change in unterteile four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, construction of institution and support of pilot programmes. 
Have we made progress In all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy bill last year, the targets for the reduction of the emission of gases meant, he said. 
On the other hand, he stressed that the authorities of the federal states with which the Central State and the communities working together to achieve the targets for energy saving, the efficient use of energy and the reduction of emissions. 
In addition, He has enough number multiannual plans have already been undertaken or completed, both those who have been funded by the Chinese government, and those of other countries. 
For Example, he was referred to the programme to the Effective Use of Energy, which was introduced in the last five years, the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands. 
It is a project at provincial level on climate change, another exchange of traditional incandescent light bulbs with energy-saving pears and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said. 
Martin Krol, scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts are far greater than is commonly believed. 
It showed that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China six tonnes per person betrage 100 tonnes, while in the United States. China is responsible for a nine overall contribution to environmental pollution. 
Just do it unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. The energy efficiency in the last five years and 20 percent by 2020 is another, he said.
