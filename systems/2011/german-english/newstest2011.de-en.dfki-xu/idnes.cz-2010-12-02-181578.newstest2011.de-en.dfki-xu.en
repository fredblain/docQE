A bone House fascinates even after 100 years. If you look at the Interieure of Gaudi 
The roof appears to the backs of prehistoric Echse, the stairs as the vertebral column of Dinosauriers and Balkone are aufgerissene Fischmäuler. 
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. 
Of the local inhabitants, the house with his organic forms the nicknames "bones house." 
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, Kachelsplittern and mosaic, the scales facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all of these are typical features for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi. 
The facade of the House plays with wonderful lines, gentle colors and textures that remind of nature and living creatures. 
Only On closer inspection we noticed that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order. 
In the night, the whole façade, plastic, dramatic and the special Anleuchtung reinforces the glory of the colours. 
The same dynamic lines and tortuous forms also dominate the interior of the House. 
Waves geformtes wood copied the window frames, support, Zierelemente of doors, even Gucklöcher and trade. 
The House Batlló in the quarter Eixample on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No 43 was created from the rebuilding of a House from the year 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese said. 
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906. 
The investor, the wealthy industrialists Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a wholly new building, but he agreed to the idea Gaudís on an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction. 
The rental house Casa Batlló devised Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone. 
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol together. 
Just On the drawing board created the Dekorationen for the representative housing of the Realitätenbesitzers and also the use of mosaics of the façade was his idea. 
In the design of the facade, but also many other Bildner and artists with. 
The joint work on the drafting of the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí. 
So Jujol also involved in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá in the park Güell where other works of Antoni Gaudí. 
Shortly after its completion, the home of the local inhabitants got the nickname "bone house" because of his organic forms. 
Others called it the specific Fensteröffnungsmechanismus because of the "yawning House". 
It also says that the top of the building is the sword of Saint George, of the existence of Catalonia. 
But also further bildhauerische elements symbolize hidden religious motives. 
Gaudí designed a central heating system unique for the time for the House with Entlüftungskanälen and typical Kaminen. 
Something weird is their 45-degree slope already. 
In his creation Gaudí consistently ignored all the building codes and did not influence this. 
Before the start of construction - although he absorbed from the the city of it claims made about the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers were two years later so horrified by the result that they remedy. 
Gentlemen of the Council found that among other things, that the construction with its pillars even in the public pavement intervening. 
To amendments, however, it was not quite the opposite - just 15 days after the call of the urban community, Josep Batlló a submitted an application to the approval of the lease of the two höchstgelegenen floors of the house - and was promptly. 
The homeowners themselves, in the lower floors. 
In the gallery in the 2 Stock was a Gesellschaftssalon, on the third floor were bedrooms and private rooms of the house. 
The ground floor was leased to a jeweller. 
The whole sechsstöckige buildings undergoing a steps up to Dachterrasse. 
The main elements of the redevelopments were all right corner and straight lines removed and replaced by bent and geschwungene walls. 
Gaudí but also with a modern approach to mutual connection of rooms. 
The social part through the opening of Salontüren completely combine and greater society chatting comfortably without vertraulicheren on talks with a certain degree of intimacy. 
The House received by Gaudís retrofit except a new facade of a very unusual roof and two other floors. 
Impressive is also Gaudís game with the light, and the blue and white glasierten Kacheln with which the courtyard dressed and light. 
The game of these two colours gives maximum light all floors of the House. 
He made simply use the principle, that white better reflects the light and dark colors, sunlight on the contrary. 
The House Casa Batlló, in 2005 the World Heritage List Unesco, everyone can now visit. 
The first floor is the geräumigste and prächtigste home made available to the public. 
The homeowner decided only in the years on this step and this on the occasion of the 150.Geburtstags of the famous creator. 
As we noted that this is a very profitable business, it has retained the surveys, and extended it to other common and the Dachgeschossräume, including the Dachterrasse. 
The price for the inspection of the monument is no trifling matter, however, he is EUR 16,50, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get 20% reduction. 
This figure exceeds the entry prices to other Gaudí-buildings in the city. 
Anyone Who wants to get to know the real atmosphere of the House with his Drachentürmchen should try to close friendship with one of the inhabitants and visit him at home.
