In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium, made of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, the most important part of the project management, to a total of $295 million has received. 
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance" überantworten was founded in 2004 as part of the decision by Hydro-Québec, the private sector their responsibility, this important hydroelectric project a sum of $5 billion dollars, formed. 
At the beginning of 2005 ergatterte the consortium "Énergie gérance" the lucrative contract without a public tender. 
For the Parti Québécois is resorting to companies consortia a serious ethical problem that the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung and a price increase. 
"This is a new way of conspiracy and refuted the competition." 
"This means that rather than fix games instead of secret way now in open form," said carrying Sylvain Simard, a member of the PQ, at the press conference. 
In the Early morning Simard had raised the issue before the National assembly, because it seems to him hard to understand how the public's interest in this way can be used.

"I remain faithful to my line," she lashed out, confirmed that the PQ was "dishonest" and "lack rigour". 
She said it "was the least" that the PQ apologize. 
The model of the consortium is common practice. 
It is usually a time of such temporary alliance that allowed two or more companies to combine their expertise on a requirement for a tender for a complex project. 
The project "East Main" has a high level of complexity regarding his work extent. 
The construction is under way and is expected to be established to 2012.

In this way, for example, the company Dessau is working in partnership with the majority of its main competitors, including Cima +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult together. 
Any link, and there are several dozen, at one and the same legal person - Dessau. 
What the consortium "Énergie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a particular labour dynamic and hydro-Quebec this fact since the 1970s in a special way bill pays'. 
Réal Laporte, the big employers of Société d 'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement the nose on the fact that the Treaty on the project management after agreement was approved. 
"If you make a tender and there are few candidate will your prices soar." 
"You have two options: Either you do the people who see in this Mart and say: We will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price." 
"The idea is, however, that the price is crucial, but the expertise of the persons". 
The consortium "Énergie gérance" approved contract is part of a long list of contracts on more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois. 
The contracts were either the hydro-Quebec or the SEBJ East Main-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert approved for the project.

SNC-Lavalin had 22 contracts to gerafft, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without their participation in "Énergie gérance counting". 
All these contracts have been negotiated.

Sylvain Simard had said that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of "Parti
