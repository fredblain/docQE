What should they do, the ČSSD? the Czech Social Democrats in Prague are not aware of Voldemort, "Konditorei." 
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously certain language barriers should overcome their old-new colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and in the town of representation to understand at all. 
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz members of the new Council from the ČSSD a little "abgeklopft ', as they dominate the notorious slang, which in recent years has become established, in which the current coalition partner in Prague at the helm. 
The codierte vocabulary, in the long era of Mayor Pavel Bém was introduced by the Prague political elite, some of the most well-known actors, situations and Causae borrowed. 
Surprisingly, the new councils in relation to these new concepts somewhat in the dark. 
They claim At least. 
"Who is Voldemort?" 
"No idea." 
"I am more of a newcomer in the Prague politics", Lukáš responded Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, on the test of the "godfather vocabulary". 
But also the Council Mr Březina - a political veteran, responded in a similar way. 
For example on the concept of 'golf hole ". 
"This is the only expression of those which you present to me here which I use now and then." 
"otherwise, I think that not much of slang." 
From the vocabulary of the daily newspaper Aktuálně.cz in this year's June before the choice Congress of the ODS had published the editorial staff picked six concepts, particularly with the Prague magistrate. 
The Social Democrats should the concepts' Voldemort ',' biggest Prague golf hole, "" go in the bull necks "," betrayal of the capital "and" verblechen ". 
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Mr Weinert, the future leader of the Prague school system - beginning his participation in the talks, but then not even the headphones. 
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset 
"These are things I don't care and how the Civic Democrats themselves talking about - I do not." 
"For me, it is how we understand our programmes," he countered. 
As already indicated, would have Lukáš Kaucký mentioned in the above headline claim not recognised by the influential entrepreneurs and friend of the ex-mayor who was Bém, Roman Janoušek. 
The term "Voldemort" says Kaucky absolutely nothing and the only concept, which he correctly guessed at the test was "the biggest Prague golf hole". 
"This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, added to safety but added: "But I rather know this from the newspaper." 
And jokingly: "I will probably have to show a language course." 
"The golf hole" will not only matador Karel Březina, but also by the town councillor for the Environment Lukáš Plachý right as a tunnel Blanka. 
Both Social Democrats also know, however, for whom the term Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý senses even where this figure is and what it means to go "in the Konditorei 
"I believe that that is, in some kind of Prague restaurant company to go Plachý quite close to the solution to the problem, when we know that it is the seat of Janoušeks firms. 
In line with Březina, but he claims that this knowledge to have drawn from the newspapers, rather than him this vocabulary would own. 
The test participants, judging by the Social Democrats, in fact there seems no similar eingebürgerten slang. 
"I have also asked my colleagues, but there is obviously something we really not." 
"We call on our behalf, sometimes we use words or nicknamed", says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - from his party to "Hulda". 
"In school I was Bříza (Birke), but I do not know whether to call my colleagues," tells us Karel Březina his nickname. 
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried and behold - it works. 
Mr Weinert Office is for the party of the kind of "Opa" or less friendly to the 'old', the representative Miroslav poche, ahead of the elections by machinations of the party's sponsorship, some Members' Igráček "(known Czech Lego-figure). 
Moniker is the only one that the Social Democrats in the whose language. 
Hulínský may not, "Hulda ', but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered yet another moniker of the Prague chairman. 
His nickname "Doctor of rubber truncheons-rights" has alleged that Petr Hulínský his title juris doctor in the Bratislaver police academy.
