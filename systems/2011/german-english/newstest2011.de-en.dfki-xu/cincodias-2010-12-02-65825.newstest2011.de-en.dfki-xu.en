Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens 
The cars are improved with a software in real time. 
Since 2004 Red Bull in the world of the Formula 1, her story in this exquisite universe of the speed of surprises and successes. 
Initially, nobody gave the newcomer attention and, despite its sharply rising background over the last few seasons in the final last November, all to the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso. 
Without the skills of the German pilots and champion Sebastian Vettel or the performance of the engine of Renault to belittle want is the "secret weapon" that the multi-Siemens Red Bull in the hands, and created a winning team, have become legend. 
In reality is a powerful software to simulate processes, the German company in 2007 for purposes which do not have to do with motor racing the market. 
This was dubbed PLM computer programme for the development of assembling chains in factories around the world, energy plants and precise instruments used. 
The goal is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is built, so as to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs. 
PLM has made the development of the cameras of Canon, the airplanes of Sukhoi and the most famous vehicles of Nissan. 
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial department of Siemens, said that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 - factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes and improvements to the race and the tests, design and implement. 
Russwurm contends that in 1992 from the maximum average 10 technicians worked in a season three or four could introduce improvements. 
In Red Bulls team are now 180 highly qualified young people. With powerful computer systems, they cause analyses and all possible changes to the cars. 
The Siemens managers said the PLM software is all the components of the Rennwagen of Red Bull to analyze and improve, with the exception of the engine, the only responsible for Renault. 
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are changed. 
The changes, thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech Autoklaven in less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the Simulators into reality. 
The only limit this madness technical perfect is set to spend $40 million, a formula 1 team for his races in a season. 
Red Bull has its high-tech factory for the development and production of its cars in a remote place built 50 kilometres from London. 
It is two buildings in which visits - particularly of journalists are severely limited. 
Everything that is happening is, Top Secret. 
The workforce includes 580 people, including two pilots, the world champion Vettel and marks Webber. 
But Red Bulls true formula 1 - hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell. 
Behind the huge technological resources, which the Energy-Drink manufacturer in the service of his participation on the tracks, there are other players whose support priceless and whose fame is zero. 
The Technologichef the plant, Steve Nevey, emphasised that five years ago, we could say that the progress made in the field of F for cars with 50 per cent for the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest. 
Today the share values have changed. The technology is 85% of success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 per cent. 
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computer, because they "are not voraussagbare gladiators'.
