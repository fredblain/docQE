Weak applause for China 
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer link to the mainland. 
What does Taiwan by its big brother across the Straits? 
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the electorate, to elect mayors and city councils in the five city districts. this is a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou. 
By building a cutting-edge business relations, einschl. of a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbol for relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949. 
Ma has the test, but only just. 
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party, three of the five mayors, it received a majority vote. 
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has a greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%. 
In a presidential election would mean for Ma problems. 
Since his election two years ago, the percentage of his party about 8%. 
For the first time, the DPP, together with the KMT in town councils. 
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as truck convoys with Krawallmachern, flag-shift end mass parades and only scantily clad dancers. 
There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt. 
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT held a speech at a KMT candidate on the eve of the election, 
When a man shot in his face from the crowd. LIEN was wounded and a umstehender spectators were killed. 
Bizarre wiser is not clear whether the shooter Lien kill or wanted to settle a dispute with the candidates. 
Regardless of the attack, according to Tsai mine-whom, the leader of the DPP, the election and the DPP in a bad light, what the KMT has brought more votes. 
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign. 
Remarkably the ties with the mainland. 
Instead, the candidates discussed on plans to housing and the creation of jobs. 
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat. 
For This reason, the KMT their relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground. 
But this time the DPP avoided, the anti-Chinese feelings too much. 
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China. 
Ma in turn would like to confirm that the majority of the Taiwanese its China policy. 
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue his strategy, Taiwan with economic incentives in the Community. 
China sent a negotiator to Taipei, immediately prepare for a summit to investment security and medical cooperation. 
Certainly it wants a political integration. But the most important things first. 
It is thus prefer to wait until after the presidential elections in 2012. 
The DPP has since reinvented. 
Two years ago it was strongly weakened, the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption. 
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008 he was strongly for the absolute independence. 
But under Tais reign has developed a new generation gem√§ssigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the employees and the youth. 
Tsai took place as the presidential candidate of the DPP approval, such as Su Tseng-Chang Chen. 
Their party is doing everything now to show that it is capable of building close ties to Beijing. 
Tsai is planning a think tank as a contact point between the DPP and China. however, this requires open-minded discussion. 
Tsai stated publicly that their party is a "reliable alternative" offer to Mas vorschneller rapprochement with China. 
Chen seems very angry about this change. 
From his cell, he said, the candidate of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence. 
He called the pragmatists Su even to abandon the presidential candidacy. 
Even without Chen's intervention does the DPP hard to choose their possible candidates. 
The KMT will have to undergo own self-analysis. 
Mas values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidate wanted their campaign without him. 
The main reason for his unpopularity unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor. 
According to the statement of a KMT spokesman he will alter his cabinet and the local institutions. 
The strong performance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is a rapprochement only restricted. 
Most Taiwaneses consider the economic cooperation with China as inevitable. 
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no return."
