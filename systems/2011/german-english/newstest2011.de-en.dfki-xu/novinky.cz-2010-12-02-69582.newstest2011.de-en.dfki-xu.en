Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it is simply too slow 
Fernet, rum and vodka, once again a good whisky, the father of Hausbar has stolen. 
These are the drinks after enjoyed drunken Czech teenager under fifteen most notbehandelt. 
Children are No exception, their hangovers the ausschlafen repeatedly in the hospital. 
This is from the experience of doctors, with similar cases in the opening of the children's departments of clinics. 
"Beer or wine is completely out of fashion, simply because it takes too long to be drunk." 
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol", said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief doctor of the children's unit in the Bohemian clinic Hořovice. 
"whisky, if it succeeds, the father of a bottle of Hausbar to snatch, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka. 
"Vodka has the advantage that it blended with juice can smell it not so hard," says the head doctor. 
The spokesman of the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him properly. 
"Most 'Fernet or rum." 
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools." 
"Sometimes it was also about slivovice, you take home", Mrs Jurinová. 
Chief doctor Pelikán, three or four-year-olds drinkers in the hospital admission long is no exception. 
Before the clinic in Hořovice he ten years since this year, he was working in the paediatric-department of the hospital Motol, where the rescue angetrunkene pupils from Middle and distance selling ablieferten. 
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times." 
"She started your career with 12 years ago, when the first time with 3.5 per mil alcohol in the blood and in combination with" Extase "has been hospitalised," the doctor described a particularly severe case. 
"It was in the exhibition site Holešovice on any dance party." 
"The interesting thing is that it was her mother does not strange found that their daughter came home 48 hours" surprised the chief doctor. 
The lack of interest by parents or their incredible tolerance in Anstoßen with their own Sprösslingen is regarded as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children. 
A real dependency in the true sense of the word, according to experts in children. 
"Alcoholism is a long-term chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomenon to understand and that is not the case with these children. 
Among those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, is mostly a negative family-social background characteristic, "says chief doctor Pelikán. 
The spokesman for the hospital Motol, according to Mrs Jurinová until mid-November, was about 40 drunken children in the local department of child and youth medicine. 
Yet only the cases of serious alcohol poisoning, a hospital to go in the statistics. 
Drunken children after ambulatory care from parents or may be brought home by the police, not registered. 
Apart from the cases in which children as only a bottle of spirits in school desk austrinken there are opinion of Mr Pelikán three year time Amplituden, 100% is good: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year. 
"The latter for two reasons - either from pain because of the bad certificate or joy on the holiday." 
"In the Walpurgisnacht I have already seen in the opening seven drunken children at once," said Dr Pelikán. 
A betrunkenes child spend the night under medical supervision, paradoxically, is better off than a child who has to contend with a nasty hangover the next day. 
The headaches in the morning after the Dehydration and lack of glucose that can be in hospital with a liquid-giving Infusion with glucose and nutrients to the organism is missing. 
"Clearly they are better off, because after the 'beautiful' experience in the evening, raise them with good humour to somewhere without something hurts." 
"They are just a little confused about where they are," Dr Pelikán admits, although he sometimes at least good humour to perish by the patients he considers the costs they will cost the treatment. 
Because the transport with the rescue and the night in an acute beds come well on a few tens of thousand kronor. 
"Occasionally I have an educational resources used, if I have direct children visit calculated what their drunkenness has cost and that it can happen that they take the whole holiday on must work to earn the money for a single such Fete", added Dr Pelikán added. 
In his view, the health insurance funds but not for redress procedures in order to cure the trunkenen children necessary costs of the parents.
