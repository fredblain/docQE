Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, considered the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher in Iran for "spy", the French public in breathing, left the diplomacy on red alert and akzentuierte the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran. 
All this under the close scrutiny of the diplomats of the United States. 
The WikiLeaks and obtained by the newspaper Le Monde - American documents give some background to this crisis. 
They describe how the Elysée the Americans had stated his strategy, which went so far as this advice for dealing with their own crisis of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of hikers). 
They show how the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman not the release of Majid Kakavand, one in France and from the American justice because of trade with materials in the Iranian nuclear programme Iranian Gegeleistung. 
Finally, they put the manner with which the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media to the to make credible, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss, in a harsh light. 
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard. 
A redigiertes in Paris on 12 August 2009 Diplomatentelegramm bears the title "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostage." 
François Richier, Elysée consultant strategy, in the company of Mr Paoli, director of the Quai d "Orsay to North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone. 
They told her French method. 
The advised the Americans, all keen to do their own nationals rückzuführen which would forcibly detained in Iran. 
"Makes noise", they said, 'the word "basic human rights", "innocence," "immediate release" in the media. 
This is necessary in order to the Iranian regime to embarrass respects the very sensitive to his image. 
"all the more so since you ask, the Iranians not to do that." 
Because "silence solves nothing", the debate over attempts to unauffälligem routes, the Iranians are "master in 
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is a "normal, Iranian tactics ":" Hostage taking for political blackmail ". 
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss (from prison, on 16 August, on the day that they are going in the French embassy) 'demand the payment of a large amount of money in the Iranians' (230,000 euro bail). 
And he lets announce, the Elysée anticipates further taking of hostages, a phenomenon that will intensify. 
The Iranians could "in the near future, another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens arrest living in Iran," he said. 
28 August 2009. 
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison in 12 days, will, however, continue to be detained in Iran. 
An information was circulated: The Iranians Majid Kakavand, whose extradition to the United States for illegal trade in empfindlichem electronics demand material to Iran, after ratification of a judge in Paris has been released from prison. 
The American Embassy is, as with many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence. 
For Washington, that the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of this for the nuclear programme scheduled the release of Majid Khakavand bad news. 
France has a horse-trading on board? 
The release of the Iranian against the Frenchwoman? 
At a further meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September François Richier assured that this is not the case. 
The Elysée, he says, was "completely surprised by the decision of the judge," but have also tried it. 
"It has a heated exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government can not change the judicial decision," he says. 
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remain under "strict" control of the French secret service. 
The Elysée consultant chooses a telephone number, again, then the American diplomat, the Iranians "is currently in the chair of the Iranian Embassy in Paris." 
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran spares the Elysée not, through its efforts to make pronouncements and organised escape attempts "by the media believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an" important "and" influential mediator role ". 
The Americans are watching this activity without irony and notice that the manipulation carries fruits, since several press articles reflect the official French version. 
One of 25 August 2009 datierendes telegram calls "the media the French authorities". 
What is so much "thanks" towards Mr Assad, wonders the Paris embassy. 
"Despite their statements Lobpreis secretly the French authorities, that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done." 
The document also deals with the reasons that have led to the Elysée this fiction. 
The intense communication efforts "aimed at Sarkozy's policies of opening to Syria to confirm," he analysed. 
A 2008 launched policy was "by many critics in France and abroad was perceived as premature and undeserved." 
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" Paris "Syria is trying to laud what can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region". 
In addition, It is aim "to sow discord between Syria and Iran. 
The American Embassy knows this from a good source. 
On 11 August, François Richier her: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians have whatever". 
"But we have thanked them despite everything." 
"This should at least cause confusion on the part of the Iranians." 
Clotilde Reiss is back to France on May 16, 2010. 
Nicolas Sarkozy will receive it in the Elysée.
