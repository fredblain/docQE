More and more parents want Menschen-Überwachungsgeräte in order to have the kids under control 
The fear for our own children, and so consider more and more parents to control them by GPS. 
The system, which was originally invented to hunting down cars, can just as well people locate what would be helpful also in such cases, as the disappearance of nine-year Anička Janatková. 
The device is about as big as a packet of cigarettes but soon it will be no bigger than a wristwatch. 
Many people, the case of the missing Anička in a funk and so they are looking for ways to better protect their children. 
Also for the cost of a violation of their privacy. 
"We are trying to say that it is not around Pioneers, but an effective way to reduce the likelihood that it will lead to the tragedy", Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market. 
"I admit that it cannot abuse of such devices, for example, if you know someone in the pocket, without it, but so far we have had no such case." 
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons", adds Pilin. 
In his opinion, should the child but always know what purpose the "box" and how they are used in an emergency. 
The Kinderpsychologin Dana Bočková notes, however, that a child, if there is such a thing it simply emptied. 
"Even very small children show great creativity, when it comes to certain things deliberately to lose if they do not want to be checked." 
"The phones awoke initially great expectations among parents, but they can be just as easy, as this new surveillance equipment," says Mrs Bočková. 
That is also controversial, whether such a body in the event of an attack actually help. 
"At planned abduction, the kidnappers almost always checked whether the child has any electronics, it could be located." 
"Today is the mobile phone." 
"If such monitoring equipment wider use, they also found, since their sales will be accompanied by massive advertising." 
"In these cases, the criminals are always a step ahead of the police," says psychologist. 
It acknowledges that similar devices in a sudden attack by a paedophile can be extremely helpful. 
Roberta Čech RC monitoring by society, according to the tracking service offers both for cars and for individuals, the existence of such a device then, when it immediately after the attack. 
"The device can be adjusted namely so that it reports the respective position in certain intervals." 
"Even if it would be destroyed, at least the final position of the person concerned." 
"In more expensive equipment is Even a Neigungsmesser integrated, in other words, if you are going hinfällt and movement, the device sends a warning immediately indicate the position," said Mr Čech. 
In his view, similar services could also smart phones with navigation, it just needs a special software einzuspielen. 
The problem with the current positioning devices is that it is either equipment in matchbox-size, similar to the supporters or smaller mobile phones. 
There is always the risk that it loses. 
Mr Pilin of the Macro because according to tests in the present, devices, which look like ordinary digital clocks. 
"This has the advantage that the possible attackers do not realise that it is a monitoring and tracking device. 
"Or he realises what the police only after a certain time, a time lead there," he adds. 
No matter which way the trend is towards Armbändern - or, as always, the same technology used in vehicle tracking. 
So the combination of positioning function through the GPS system (just as the Ms in the car) and the function of a mobile telephone which the current position.
