In the middle of Secret 
In the weeks after the sudden death of your man told Argentina's President, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, their popularity rate by 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007. 
Whether this helps her to a re-election next year, it depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández is willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner. 
The signs are not clear. 
Néstor Kirchner, even after the election, his wife economic policy, was often budget plans, the tax revenue, economic growth and inflation does not fully into account. 
This allowed the couple to spend the extra revenue as they see fit. 
On paper, the Fernández-government lost the majority in Congress last year. 
But the opposition is divided and Kirchners death after a heart attack on 27 October, leading to further disagreements. 
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández. 
But after chaotic meetings (which a member of another in the face, and others accused the government of corruption), the Congress, the budget for 2011. 
"I will not discuss," the President. 
The 2010 budget now for the next year, which the President has more opportunity to spend money as they see fit. 
The economy is hot: Probably it will increase this year by up to 9%. 
The official inflation rate is z.Z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - up to almost 30%. 
Kirchner took office in 2003, when Argentina was beset by economic crisis, said growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not reduce inflation. 
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, has singled out for bullying as the private sector and säuberte the National Institute for Statistics and census INDEC, prompting the official inflation statistics schönte. 
Can Fernández take a more moderate way now? 
It has business and union leaders for talks. 
And According to official statements should be limited to 18% next year. 
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have a strong boost to the economy. 
But the inflation undermined the growth spurt by a large devaluation in the year 2002. 
Perhaps for this reason, Cristina Fernández Argentine financial economically back to the rest of the world. 
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with shareholders, the former rescheduling of the country in 2001. 
Now it seems Fernández on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which it owes about $6.7 billion. 
The Kirchners have had a review by the IMF, as happens elsewhere, always rejected. 
But last month, the economy minister, Amado Boudou known that the funds in the drafting of a new national consumer price index "technical support". It looks as if this were the first step to clear up the INDEC. 
It is not known whether Fernández after leaving office without the support of her husband politically active. 
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, most of Kirchnerismus. 
If the Argentinians in March from their summer holidays, the wave of Sympatie she was shown abgeebbt. 
If they would like to win another election, she must decide whether they many political decisions of their man quietly lifted.
