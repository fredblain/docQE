The Control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and they are a part of the bribes and the protection money which she to the Kremlin. As reported in February, the American Embassy in Russia in a memo. 
Both police and the state security service blackmail high protection money so that they can hold their expensive standard of living in Moscow 
They collect money not just of legitimate businesses, but also by organised criminal gangs. 
Every shift of the bureaucracy - Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has described as a "vertical of authority" - takes its part of the money that the ladder to the top. 
The memo, which under the name of the ambassador John Beyrle was sent to Washington on Tuesday of WikiLeaks published on its website. 
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited. 
It was written during Yuri Luzhkov Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption. 
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that in the meantime would have been cleaned. 
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a construction company, have repeatedly rejected accusations of corruption for years, and he has many defamation lawsuits against such accusations. 
In September, a Russian television station, when he was asked for a documentary, which suggests that he is corrupt, "it is crazy, it is dirty, it is dirty." 
Like A huge number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, the surveys show. 
But it is unusual that, as the report of the ambassador, individuals, and it is unheard that a diplomat from a foreign country. 
"The direct link of the government of Moscow with the crime has led to some them as" disturbing "and come to the conclusion that the government as a government," the memo. 
"Criminal elements Enjoy a" kryshna "(a term from the world of the criminals / the mafia, which literally means" roof "or protection) about the police, the state security service (FSB), the MVD) and the office of the prosecutor, as well as by the whole Moscow government bureaucracy. 
Professionals have dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow. 
"Luzhkov is paramount." 
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage." 
"Least follow the ordin√§ren criminals and the criminal inspectors at the bottom." 
"This is a inkompetentes system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city offers no help." 
The report says that the FSB pockets of the largest companies and the money the police small business people arrested. 
A source said, "declared that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get the protection of the MVD and FSB (and not by organised crime), not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law." 
"That is why the protection by criminal gangs no longer needed as before." 
The memo noted that, while the collection of the money is complete, the protection itself be very modest no; even the ones who pay are sometimes arrested. 
That does not pay, find their business very quickly closed - because of one or other pretext. 
Medvedev has spoken several times to combat corruption, but noted that he has made little progress. 
The memo the message contains descriptions of men, with suitcases full of money, probably in the Kremlin. 
"In his fight against corruption Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of when, a Moscow think tank, in a recent interview. 
"But he is part of this tape." 
"It is not a part of the political class, because a political class in Russia no longer exists." 
Without politicians, without an opposition without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable. 
Nationwide, Giving, corruption Russia more than $300 billion per year. 
The country is ranked 154 a recent study of the global perceptions of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparence International (countries the least corrupt to 'most corrupt "). 
The disclosure of the memos of the American embassy, what happened after Moscow time late in the evening will arouse within the Russian government, although, as Luzhkov can be blamed for the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be a possibility for the Kremlin to claim that one solves the problems. 
In an interview with Larry King for CNN Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats have called him Medvedev Batman and Robin. 
"The truth is that our interaction is an important factor of domestic politics in this country," he said. 
"But to be honest, we did not expect that to happen with such arrogance, such pressure and unethical way, you know."
