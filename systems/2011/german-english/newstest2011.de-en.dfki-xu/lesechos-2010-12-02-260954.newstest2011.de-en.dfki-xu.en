Second mandate: The Offenkundigkeit 
De Gaulle had really away. 
Mitterrand had to believe that he stutze. 
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation. 
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that. 
A mandate in the Elysée calls on the next. 
The current head of state will be other candidate in 2012. 
But the Offenkundigkeit is the side of the Mysteriums, the presidential function, not to. 
So We must act as if the doubt henceforth. 
In one, as well as in the other. 
In 2006 the supporters Jacques Chirac, a third mandate is not excluded, without even to believe that. 
On 15 November assured Nicolas Sarkozy in serious by his decision, "some time in the autumn of 2011". 
On Tuesday evening in the Elysée before the UMP members of the prospect of "two mandates" let slip, was thus a little Fieberhaftigkeit spread. 
The official announcement of his candidacy? 
Far from it. 
The President had just remind you that the constitution in 2008, the number of five-year term for just two. 
He made a statement that no announcement. 
It is not the first time that the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone. 
"You have the worst seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009. 
On a new one In May 2010: "Does not believe that I do not think about the later stages." 
His words of the day before yesterday do not make him more than the previous day, but also no less. 
They should comment, then from a double reason. 
The acceleration of the race around the candidacy with the PS on one side. 
But it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal, Segolene Nicolas Sarkozy, to reveal. 
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, many members of the PS adopted earlier than to EU-diplomatic. 
The bad polls on the other side. 
The first time the voters would right a candidacy of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to a survey by the BVA-L Express) prefer. 
"We have a candidate with the UMP and there are no discussions about the environment of the prime minister responded immediately and carefully. 
"If he were a defeat as possible, he would not candidate", Jean-Pierre Raffarin agrees with. 
"He will always think to be able to win", Alain Juppé, with the Offenkundigkeit has resigned.
