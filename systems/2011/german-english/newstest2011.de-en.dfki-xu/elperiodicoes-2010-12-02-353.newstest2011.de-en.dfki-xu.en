Zapatero and the red line Germany 
Berlin has opted for keeping the euro, but at the same time, conditions for the whole of the European Union. 
The tension on the markets have triggered a double response of the government. 
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has submitted new adaptation measures, starting with tax rebates for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary work agencies or the abolition of the 426 euros support for unemployed up to the privatisation of 49 per cent of AENA, the management of airports Barajas and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery. 
On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former government Minister Felipe González the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis presents. 
How are these transactions to understand? 
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their public relations. 
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro. 
It is Germany a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future to maintain ancient traditions of a large part of his partner. 
Given the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis. 
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south to leave the euro area. 
The Second: The reintroduction of the German Mark - although it is more science fiction sounds, supported by a large part of public opinion, approximately 50% of the population. 
The Third: A transformation of the euro in accordance with German proposals. This means: More macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; Punishment of the countries, crossing the requirements; möglichereweise the default of certain countries, as well as the expansion of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector. 
The German position is clear and has been for some time. So there are no excuses now. 
First 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits, and the German Government constitutional reform in order to prevent it from 2016. 
It was the first signs of the polarisation between what Germany was thought necessary (strict fiscal plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. 
The second sign the Central European country when Merkel postponed the decision to save Greece painful,. 
Then it was strongly criticised. But the fact is that the political agreement in Germany, the public and the published opinion absolutely against a rescue of Greece. 
Finally, Merkel in the last October days again with a clear position. It calls for a reform of the agreements of the European Union in order to facilitate the rescue of a country and at the same time, to a part of the cost. 
This position was interpreted as anti-European as Ireland crisis and everything is as follows. 
But her proposal, if a little sweetened, was approved in the coming months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which these measures from 2013. 
Germany has drawn a red line that it intends not to exceed. 
It says all that - even if unpopular measures must be taken, as of that date will no longer be the old ways of the euro. 
2013 will be the birth of a new currency area, in which the countries to ban be severely punished, be forced to declare themselves bankrupt and in this case, the private sector must take on a part of the costs. 
Germany shows us that we need a strong growth path, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improve productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances. 
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as was mentioned by Spain in boom times, will simply not be tolerated. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would do badly not understand it. 
It is not just about the deficit to 3% by the year 2013 runterzufahren. 
The demands are much tougher. 
Under these conditions, And the worst thing we could do is to cheat. 
I hope that the current turbulence in more rest. 
And that we will use the opportunities offered to us by early 2013. 
It seems that Zapatero has taken this so well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the major companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, in order to make their way. 
But Germany-red line is there, and it is not that something would change. 
Among the possibilities is that we are the countries with little serious full gestopften euro area, not to be excluded. 
In this case, we still say it could have warned us.
