Sports and rule bypass 
Tricks as Alonso and Ramos in the match against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will of a sanctions. 
The alleged two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) instigated exclusion in the game of 23 November against Ajax in the champions League led to much ink has been spilled about whether it was a unsportliche act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA. 
As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before game end (their team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls, now that the referee showed them the second yellow card. 
In this way, and since the Real Madrid his group, the two players the prescribed sanction the next league game against the Auxerre and without maps in the next game phase. 
Finally, the Disziplinarkommitee of UEFA, the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with various sums of money. 
The provocation of a yellow card in this or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football. 
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but followed in this event. 
Part of the debate that have arisen outlined the case goes back to that a team of the football club Real Madrid (which in his anthem blocked and honour and on other occasions his players for similar incidents had punished) played in the drama by Mourinho, an episode to its long history as theatralischer and provocative technicians. 
In any case, the debate about whether this is not explicitly banned by the statutes behavior contradicts the principles of the sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a rule circumvention. Indeed, this approach to the statutes of the sport, but its meaning. 
The damage caused to the sporting spirit should be examined. 
The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect which was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game. 
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the offending players an unjustified benefited from the team. that has not been done. 
The paradox of the action of the Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally under wrong game or rule bypass understand, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly taken to avoid a penalty, but it should be as striking as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. 
The players waited and took the sanction happily. 
Another question is what kind of advantage the offender from the deliberate fouls. 
It should be emphasised that the rival either in a disadvantageous position was still benefits for the feigned game were erheischt, because the obvious result of this action was that the team had to play with fewer players. 
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because then the club does not have these players. 
Obviously the advantage is that the players the next phase of the Champions League game without tickets, their participation in a future game could begin. 
But it is a long-term, up to a certain point uncertain advantage, because the team eventually leave. In addition, the players with this approach a penalty and in the second Kartenzyklus because of card accumulation with a card less than in the first cycle. 
So it is not clear whether it is really an advantage. 
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the sporting spirit, also strategic decisions at a maximum benefit from the rules. 
In this case the players wanted to avoid any penalties (that would be a clear case of Regelumgehung), they wanted more choose when they undergo this. 
They took a strategic decision without a sentence or to flee before her. 
Although the boundary between inventiveness and rule surroundings is blurred, I think that this issue is a clear case of inventiveness. 
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen because of two factors: Because it was two exclusions and because of the way the provoked Regelübertragung. 
The damage done to the principles of the sport by these acts is less ethical than aesthetic.
