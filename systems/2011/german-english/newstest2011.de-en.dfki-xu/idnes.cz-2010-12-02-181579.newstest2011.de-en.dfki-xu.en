The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have other desires than men 
Not the tollste bed framework, but the quality of the deck area - mattress and rust make the good bed. 
These are, however, ways to meet the wishes of the specific user. 
In the choice many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the Schläfers. 
Equally important is the Interieur where mattress and rust. 
Typical example? 
In a Wochenendhaus, not regularly heated, are not well suited since they are much longer, "warm". 
In addition, they are significantly heavier than usual polyurethane foams mattresses. 
And, it should be changed regularly. 
If they do not have enough Entlüftungskanälchen in the heart and still have a strong record, is congested and moisture, so it is not ruled out that the tape. 
In the election Of course also plays a role, to what one is used. 
Anyone who has been a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with soft class, will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with hard surface. 
"All you get from the NHL have returned, have complained to me that they can no longer sleep right here." 
"For their abgeschundenen shoulders, and Hüften they simply need a soft layer from Visco-foam (memory Foam - a form of memory-polymer)." 
"Among other things I recommend these to also diabetic people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the" information "from the ligaments and the skin is bad," says Sylva Hadamcziková, furniture. 
Therefore I have many years ago Eishockeyspielern, but also other customers this mattresses with Visco-foam (memory Foam) concerned. 
"today, it is no longer a problem, because the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico 
And one does not need to be a famous you get the benefits of the Visco-foam learn to appreciate. 
This "miracle" actually works quite simple. 
The foam optimalisiert his toughness and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, he schmiegt downright warm body. 
Nowhere is there, in the night one does not roll around as after a serious fight. 
It is simply sleeping much better. 
The viskoelastische foam also offers protection against Dekubitus (gangrene). 
In the choice of the Matratzengröße should be to height is still the length of the Fußsohlen add some 21 to 34 inches. 
A man and woman in the 180 cm are big need as a 210 to 220 cm bed. 
Each of the Schläfer should at least 90 cm is widely available, is 180 cm. 
In Einzelbetten, for example in singles, 120 to 140 cm. 
The comfort and also for the visitors. 
Otherwise the following rule of thumb for the ideal bed broad: "If you on the back, should have enough room for the easy angewinkelten arms," advises mine. Helena Prokopová, the guild masters of the and Raumausstatter for years the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and this discussion at a university. 
In a double bed everyone needs a own rust and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are too high. 
Otherwise there is nothing different amounts than the Roste assembling and this is not possible in every bed framework. 
Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, should be at least three centimetres in the form of class and the fine cushion. 
"With the hand or the Hinsetzen the feathers on no account should we felt", warns Helena Prokopová. 
Each mattress makes a special Rosttyp. 
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and under position as evolved Siamzwillinge have no place in the bedroom. 
These mattresses can not be let drop and the reference you cannot wash, today already. 
And since we are in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years slowly to a huge (and sieve). 
Even so, experts advertising slogans in mattresses a lifespan of up to 25 years, yes even lifelong guarantee. 
Every cause has its ifs and buts. 
And so a practical Council by dealers: Mattresses of 120 or 140 cm diameter the hygiene of waschbaren abziehbaren salaries should not be afraid, however, it is recommended to use a Matratzenschoner, easy and washing. 
Even if today usually Matratzenbezüge with Rundumreißverschluss manufactured so that you get after the opening two halves (immensely important for the Waschvorgang and washing machines size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. 
They have in bed instead of a Rostes firm record? 
Get out of it. 
Or for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night. 
So they should record to provide ventilation holes (if not included) and mattresses with the skeleton and 15 cm minimum level with so-called pockets of the core and finely cushion. 
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a pad. 
For not verstellbare Lattenroste with 14 to 18 (Lamellen) are suitable Latex- or Sandwichmatratzen (possibly also combinations of Latex and Kokos), keep pay this Roste with a larger Lattenanzahl, of 28 and more Federleisten from, with Lordosenstütze in Lendenwirbelbereich and the ability to regulate the Lattenhärte. 
On verstellbare Lamellenroste does not include mattresses with the skeleton, since they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment. 
Alongside the attitudes of stiff the pen will make special flexible shoulder modules. 
This is a special strengthen the pen, which allows the einzudrücken or even afford to verwinkeln that they allow the individual Einsinken the shoulder of the Schläfers. 
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important matter. 
There is even Matratzenhersteller which have started to use soft Herrenmatratzen "zones for the shoulder area. 
Also to the ladies is thought - they are fighting these soft zones in the Hüftgegend. 
For most demanding customers are punktelastische wing stroke systems (Lattoflex) or Roste burden with points of contact-Pads with so Multitorsionsfederung. 
The pressure will be distributed on several points, thus reducing the tension. 
But, if the right mattress and right rust a bad (too big and fülliges), most are used Kopfkissen benefits lost. 
Here too, a rule of thumb: The to the head, his top should only up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles relax. 
Ideal is therefore a 50 x 60 cm big cushion, as for example the Scandinavians. 
In the side of the head cushion (along with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or soft zone in the bed) the shoulder height. 
Have our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (fat) Strohsäcken but with hay. 
Modern manufacturers use natural materials, or at least their mixtures. 
Also In the new magic word "organic". 
Instead of oil raw materials used to manufacture of Polyurethanschäumen increasingly natural oils - for example Rizinus- and soya oil. 
Soya is used by all well-known manufacturers. 
"Organic mattresses, which is in its core of materials purely natural origin is," said Petr Vašíček by the company Tropico Plus. 
Natural materials, but also in the production of Matratzenbezügen - one of the first was Aloe Vera. 
But one can also micro-capsules grant to sleep, Mr President fresh woodland or Lavendelduft spread. 
Here too there is a difference between men and women. 
While the men a "cool" Pflanzenextrakt from Birkenblättern used so that the Matratzenbezug absorb the heat and cool the body, the salary for women "wärmende" effect. 
Extracts from red Paprikaschoten stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex when sleep wohlig warm. 
And the current favorites? 
Mattresses from cold sparkling (he has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and also much more flexible). 
The combination of the various stiff (tough) of cold foams and from know exactly, where head, hip and heels. 
For a high-quality mattress, though, has to fork out 7,000 kronor and more. 
Gesundheitsmatratzen but are usually with lower value added tax, because they are regarded as medical device. 
The first Czech companies were Gumotex this advantage. 
You see, in the bed and the pair to save is not so easy. 
There are special offers of manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses for the price of one. 
So the brand Magniflex offers the mattress Duofreeze with in relation verstepptem Visco-foam memory for 11.990 CZK. 
The second will be free to do so. 
It was the material Tempur which the era of viskoelastischen sparkling substances with open Zellstruktur and high density in almost kosmischem pace. 
No surprise, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the starts. 
Tempur is in heat soft, cool environment cemented it again. 
So it is to the human body perfectly and distributed the body printing in an optimal way. 
It is therefore not only ideal for the prevention of fires increased pressure, but generally the sleep of comfort. 
Viskoelastische sparkling substances will not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special Fußpolstern used the legs and the vessels to provide relief. 
Local producers use for example the foam materials Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
