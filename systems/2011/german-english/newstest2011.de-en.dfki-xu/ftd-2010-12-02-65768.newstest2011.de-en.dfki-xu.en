Ogoniland is burned 
The water in the river is ölbraun, it looks like at the station: billion litres of oil crude oil have destroyed the nature in Ogoniland in Nigeria. 
The people of theft, corruption and illegal Ölkochen. 
Celestine Akpobari mean well. 
"You not haunts", reassured the eco-activist journalists:" You will still have enough oily sludge from the lens. " 
The 37-year-old Nigerians has followed the attempt, a leading up to the chest in water watenden boys with the surrounding Schlieren abzulichten: In the regenbogenfarbenen water the scene almost nicely. 
That Under the surface brown Rohölschwaden, is not to see. 
Have they buckets of shrimp, told Esther Badom on the bank of the Bodo-Jetty river. 
Now is the lazy river waters completely dead. 
Five years ago, poured from a geborstenen high-radioactivity tons of crude oil in the vast wetland. 
Fishermen from the nearby city Bodo must now six hours row to fish containing waters, in the heart of the Niger Delta Ogoniland is one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world. 
On the journey through the Flussläufen criss-crossed Mangrovensümpfe is apparent the full extent of the devastation. 
Instead of helles water wühlt the motor boat brown brew, who in his hand into the water, ölige finger. 
The roots of the Mangrovenbäumchen stand out as black Lakritzstangen from the soil, sad I occasionally present palms their Wedel depend. 
As otherwise they are usual in wetlands one searches in vain: As soon as the says, is spreading in the as a filling station riechenden 
"What happens is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari gloomy: "We live in constant danger for the health." 
The war comparison is apt. 
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battlefield disputed for decades: Here, more than 60 years ago, the first Explorateure from Europe here in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa later executed the first organised resistance here the Shell had to stop his production company in 1993 because it was dangerous for its oil workers. 
Today the company denied the return to Ogoniland, while across the delta region of the three size of Switzerland with about 5,000 Bohrquellen and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines are pumped more than two million barrels a day of the black gold fields in Ogoniland, the situation is too unstable to the company. 
Every few hundred metres stand out stählerne Gestelle as fanciful sculptures from the water: "Christbäumchen" are the heads of the boreholes much to zärtlich mentioned. 
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded. 
Always breche such a Bohrkopf, says Akpobari, then rinne a constant flow of crude oil into the water. 
More than two billion litres of after experts estimate in 50 years into the ecosystem of the delta arrived: Year after year the amount of oil, as the wreck of the super-tanker Exxon Valdez '"21 years into the sea off Alaska became one of the biggest environmental disaster in the history of mankind. 
Who is to blame for the continuous eco-meltdown, it is argued. 
While the Shell company sabotage and organised Öldiebstahl blames for more than 90% of the pollution, environmentalists berstende Bohrköpfe and lecke pipelines as the main culprit. 
Shell in Nigeria attach much lower safety standards than usual in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner, the group's 2008: The rate of defects in the pipes were "considerably higher than elsewhere". 
In one place, which from a distance looks like a deserted, oil-smeared workshop in the open emerge from the mangroves figures: You are stark-naked and up to our necks ölverschmiert. 
Under one of the many barrels, partly with tubes, partly arbitrary scattered on the site to identify future has come a fire: An illegal small refinery. 
In the barrel of crude oil on the fire several hours fervid, says Michael, the head of the group. 
First seen petrol through the pipes in the Auffangtopf later spits at the end of the pipeline, kerosene and diesel. 
So produce Michael and four staff on a daily basis up to four barrels of diesel à 300 liters: "It brings us 34.000 Naira a" - around 22 dollars. 
The delta residents use the chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state of black Africa. 
Nigeria has only a single refinery. 
Ridiculously low with just 40 euro cents per litre diesel price can undercut the illegal Kocher even their raw materials, because they get it for free. 
It comes from "Bunkerern" the pipeline network across Ogoniland tap: Go to the country, according to experts in the entire Niger Delta lost at least 16 million litres of crude oil. 
Only a tiny part of the provisionally between raw material is stored illegally veredelt: The lion's share of fill organised criminal networks, which include politicians and senior military tankers and in command on the world market. 
The debate is whether the environmental disaster to the activities of the population or the lax production of activist Akpobari for purely academic. 
"The oil companies would not be perceived as intruders and they would have the livelihood of the fishermen not so thoroughly destroyed, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries." 
Now is the relationship of the Ogoni especially Shell but destroyed so that only a withdrawal of the group in question would be: "Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese stand out as better." 
As Michael nervous. 
"High time that it disappears," says the muskulöse put. 
"The soldiers can come Every minute." 
The illegal Ölveredler of the special forces are caught, they are not arrest, but a painful bribes. 
The mainly hail from the north - as all Nigerians - soldiers want to benefit from the raw material. 
"This damn stuff has brought our country in every respect to the dog," says Akpobari.
