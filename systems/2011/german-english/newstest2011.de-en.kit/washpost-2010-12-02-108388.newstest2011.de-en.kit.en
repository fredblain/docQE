US Durchgesickertes document Moscow portrayed as a port of corruption 
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and it is a part of the bribes and protection money that they einsammelt, further to the Kremlin, reported in February, the American Embassy in Russia, in a memo. 
Both police and the state security service blackmail high protection money, so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says. 
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also by organized criminal gangs. 
Each layer of the bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as a "vertical has described the authority" - takes its part of the money managers to the top. 
The memo, which under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was sent to Washington, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on its website. 
The memo is based on sources, whose names were edited. 
It was written, while Yuri Luzhkov even Moscow's mayor, and it accused him of corruption. 
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is little evidence that in the meantime, would have been cleared up. 
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who has a well-known construction company, have rejected for years of corruption charges again and again, and he has won a number of libel complaints against such accusations. 
In September, he told a Russian television station, when he was asked for a documentary, which suggests that he is corrupt, "it is crazy, it is dreckig, it is dirty." 
The floor. A incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, which polls have shown. 
But it is unusual that, as happened in the report of the ambassador, known as individuals, and it is unheard of that happening by a diplomat of a foreign country. 
"The direct link to the government in Moscow with the crime has led to some of them as" disturbing "and come to the conclusion that the government is more like a Kleptokrat acts as a government," the memo. 
" Criminal elements enjoy a " kryshna " (a term from the world of criminals and the Mafia, which literally " umbrella " or protection means), which is on the police, state security (FSB), the service supervisor (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor extends as well as the entire Moscow government bureaucracy. 
Experts have discovered a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow. 
"Luzhkov is paramount." 
"The FSB, MVD and militia are on the second stage." 
"Finally the ordin√§ren followed by criminals and criminal inspectors at the bottom." 
"This is a inkompetentes system, where criminal groups in some areas, close a loophole, because the city is offering no help." 
The report says that the FSB gets money from the largest firms, and that the police arrested small business people. 
A source, it is, "said that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get the protection of the MVD and FSB (and not by organised crime), because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law." 
"That is why the protection by criminal gangs are no longer needed as they used to." 
The memo noted that, while the collection is full of money, even a very modest protection not; even those who pay are sometimes arrested. 
Those who do not pay their business closed very quickly - because of one or two under. 
Medvedev has spoken several times to combat corruption, but has also said that he has made very little progress. 
The memo's message contains descriptions of men with suitcases were probably full of money, go to the Kremlin. 
"In his fight against corruption Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of When, a Moscow think tank, in a recent interview. 
"But it is part of this bureaucracy." 
"It is not part of the political class, because of a political class no longer exists in Russia." 
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable. 
Nationwide, estimates by the corruption is costing Russia more than $300 billion per year. 
The country ranks in seat 154 a recent study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparence International (countries lists of "most corrupt" to "most corrupt"). 
The disclosure of the memos, the American embassy, which accused after Moscow time late in the evening, will certainly displeasure within the Russian government, even though, as Luzhkov for the mistakes of Moscow, for the Kremlin, it can also be an opportunity to claim that we solve the problems. 
In an interview with Larry King on CNN, Putin argued that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats have Batman and Medvedev Robin. 
"The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor in the domestic politics in this country," he said. 
"But to be honest, we would not expect this to happen such arrogance with such pressure and such unethical manner, you know."
