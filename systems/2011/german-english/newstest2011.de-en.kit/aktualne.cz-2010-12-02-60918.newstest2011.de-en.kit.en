What they should do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort, or the "Konditorei." 
The new Office of Capital gentlemen from the ranks of the ČSSD apparently certain must overcome language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and in the town of representation at all. 
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has members of the new Council of ČSSD times a little abgeklopft ', " as they dominate the notorious slang, the custom has in recent years in which the current coalition partners in Prague at the helm. 
The codierte vocabulary, which was introduced in the mattered era of Mayor Pavel Bém of the Prague political elite, some of the best-known actors, borrowed situations and Causae. 
Surprisingly, showed that the new councils in relation to these new concepts of something in the dark. 
They claim that at least. 
"Who is Voldemort?" 
"No idea." 
" I am more of a newcomer in the Prague policy, " Lukáš Kaucký responded that the new Council Mr for culture, to the test of the ' Godfather ' vocabulary. " 
But the Council Mr Karel Březina, a political veteran, responded in a similar way. 
For example, to the concept of ' golf hole. " 
"That is the only expression of which you are presenting me, which I occasionally use." 
"Otherwise, I do not think much of slang." 
From the vocabulary that the days of leaf Aktuálně.cz in this year's June prior to the election of the ODS congress was published, the editors pickte six terms, especially those that are notoriously associated with the Prague government. 
The Social Democrats should go the concepts of "Voldemort," "greatest Prague golf hole," "into the Konditorei," "bull neck," "betrayal of the capital," and "verblechen define." 
Three Council Prague gentlemen agreed to the test, the fourth, Mr Weinert, the future head of the Prague education, first promised his participation in the conversation, but then not even the listeners. 
The fifth council, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset. 
"These are things I don't care, and how the Civic Democrats talking among themselves, I shall not." 
"It is important for me, as we understand in the context of our programmes," he konterte. 
As has been suggested, would have Lukáš Kaucký supposedly in the above-mentioned headline not recognized by the influential businessman and friend of the ex-Oberbürgermeisters Bém, Roman Janoušek. 
The term "Voldemort" says Kaucky nothing and the only word he correctly in the test erriet, was "the greatest Prague golf hole." 
"It is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, added to the security but added: "but what I know from the newspaper." 
And jokingly: "I will have to take a language course." 
"The golf hole" will not only of matador Karel Březina, but also by the Council on the Environment Lukáš Plachý right as entziffert Blanka tunnel. 
Both Social Democrats also know, however, for whom the concept of Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find this character is, and also what it means to go "in the Konditorei." 
"I believe, that is, in a Prague restaurant operation," Plachý is pretty close to the solution to the problem, if you know that this is the headquarters of Janoušeks firms. 
He is in line with Březina asserts, however, this knowledge is more likely to have drawn from the newspaper that he would be this vocabulary. 
After the test participants, it seems, indeed, under the Social Democrats to be no similar naturalisations slang. 
"I have asked my colleagues, but there is obviously something that we really do not." 
"We call upon us, and we also use acronym or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - from his party colloquially called "Hulda." 
"I was in school Bříza (Birke), but I do not know whether to call my colleagues," tells us, Karel Březina his nickname. 
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried out the name and behold - he works. 
Council Mr Weinert is less friendly to the party-friendly " one's grandfather " or the " old, " the representative Miroslav Poche, the well-known Czech Lego-figure before the elections by machinations at the party's sponsorship vocal, some colleagues ' Igráček " (). 
Nicknames are the only one that the Social Democrats in the intra-Party parlance. 
Hulínský may not, if it is called ' Hulda ', but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman. 
His colorful name "doctor of rubber truncheons-rights" allegedly related to the fact that Hulínský Petr his title Doctor legal has acquired in the Bratislaver Police Academy.
