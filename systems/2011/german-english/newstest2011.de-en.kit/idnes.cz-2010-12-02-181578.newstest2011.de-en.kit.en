A hardline House fascinated even after 100 years, if you look at the Interieure of Gaudi 
The roof seems to the back of a prehistoric Echse - such as the vertebral column is one of Dinosauriers and Balkone aufgerissene Fischmäuler. 
That is the Casa Batlló of Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. 
Of the local population of the house, with its organic forms the nickname of "bone House." 
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, Kachelsplittern and mosaic, seeking to shed facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of the youth style of Antonio Gaudi. 
The facade of the house is playing with a dream of lines, zärtlichen paints and Texturen in nature and living creatures. 
Only on closer inspection, we noticed that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful planning. 
On the night the whole facade is still plastic, dramatic and the special Anleuchtung reinforced the luster of the paint. 
The same dynamic lines and tortuous forms also dominate the interior of the House. 
Waves geformtes wood copied the window frames, support, Zierelemente of doors, even Gucklöcher and trade. 
The House Batlló in the Eixample quarter in the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia 43 by converting a house dating back to 1877, the architects of Emilio Sala Cortese said. 
The reconstruction took two years and was completed 1906. 
The investor, the wealthy industrialists Josep Batlló was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a new building, but ultimately, he agreed to the idea Gaudís on an unusual and cheaper renovation. 
The Miets house Casa Batlló devised, Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone. 
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol together. 
On the drawing board is the Dekorationen for representative apartment realities of the owner and the use of Mosaiken the facade was his idea. 
In the design of the facade, however, also worked with many other Bildner and artists. 
The joint work on the drafts of the Casa Batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation Jujola and Gaudí. 
So Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudís house Casa Milá in Güell Park, where the other works by Antoni Gaudí. 
Shortly after its completion, the house of the local population of its organic forms because the nickname ' bones ' house. 
Others described it as the specific Fensteröffnungsmechanismus due to the "yawning house." 
It also says that at the top of the building is the sword of Saint George, the barons of Catalonia. 
But other bildhauerische elements symbolize hidden religious motives. 
Gaudí devised for the house of a unique for the time Zentralheizungssystem with Entlüftungs channels and typical Kaminen. 
There is something bizarre in its 45-degree inclination. 
In his creation consistently ignored Gaudí all then building codes and in no way diminished by this. 
He lifted before construction of the city the appropriate a construction permit but the claims made by him on the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers two years later with the completion were so appalled by the outcome that they demanded. 
The council met with gentlemen, among other things, too, that the building, with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk. 
There were changes, however, not more, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call from the urban community, Josep Batlló granted an application for approval of the renting of the two highly situated floors of the House, and he was promptly. 
The homeowners themselves, in the lower floors. 
In the gallery on the second floor was a company Salon, were on the third floor of the bedroom and private rooms of the apartment. 
The ground floor has been leased to a jeweller business. 
The whole sechsstöckige buildings is going through a set of stairs up to the roof terrace. 
The basic elements of the feet were all right-wing corner and straight lines removed and replaced by bent and geschwungene walls. 
Gaudí but also worked with a modern approach to mutual combination of spaces. 
The social part can be completely by the opening of the showroom doors and a larger society could comfortably chatting and in vertraulicheren talks to a certain degree of intimacy. 
The House received by Gaudís restructuring, a new facade of a rather unusual roof and two other floors. 
It is also impressively Gaudís game with the light, as well as the blue and white glasierten Kacheln is dressed the courtyard and the light. 
The game gives these two paints all floors of the House, the maximum amount of light. 
He was simply reflects the principle of using that White the light better than dark colors absorb sunlight on the contrary. 
The Casa Batlló House, which has been included in 2005, the World Heritage List Unesco today, everyone will be able to visit. 
In the first floor of the geräumigste and prächtigste apartment made available to the public. 
The homeowners decided only in the year to this step, and that on the occasion of the famous 150.Geburtstags Creator. 
When it was discovered that this is a very profitable business, it has maintained in the surveys, they also extended to other joint and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace. 
The price for the visit of an, however, is no trifling matter, he is 16.50 euros, students, retired people, groups and card holders of tourists get 20 per cent reduction. 
This amount exceeds the entry price to other Gaudí-construction in the city. 
Those who know the real atmosphere of the House, with its Drachentürmchen would learn, should try to make friends with one of the inhabitants and visit him at home.
