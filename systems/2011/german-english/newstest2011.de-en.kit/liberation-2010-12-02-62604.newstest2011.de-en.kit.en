Climate: how France talking his financial promises 
A year after the Copenhagen treaty, it is time to examine the compliance with the quickly resolved financing promises ("almost start" or premature financing called), which were carried out by the developing countries. 
And they are already exposed the rough French blandishments. 
With the Copenhagen treaty have developing countries committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012. 
The EU has pledged 7.2 billion euros over three years, France, 1.26 billion euros (420 million per year). 
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has pulled out all the stops to convince its partners from the fact of their commitment to the fast-start funding: faithful detail action report of its Member States, press conference, great side events, distribution of brochures. 
The operation transparency is remarkable and estimated precisely for its real value: the developing countries and civil society would like to see all the developed countries with the same precision level. 
The EU announced 2.2 billion in the year 2010 euro have released what it puts on the right path to Respektbezollung its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012. 
But if you look into the details, things are a little more complicated. 
This money should be according to the Copenhagen treaty "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional deployment was introduced, without, to the detriment of public development aid. 
Unfortunately, there is no consensus, which means "new and additional." 
While the EU Commission had proposed a harmonisation, have blocked certain members states, including France, the procedure. 
Today everyone chooses the indicative value as it best. 
The EU Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those choosing of 2009: the international financing will be maintained, and in the context of the financing of the fast-starting " over three years to 150 million. 
Other countries have similar guidelines, either on year, or about conditions at the level of official development assistance. 
In return, France was of the opinion that the financing "of all new projects" of 2010 were "new and additional." 
In other words, there is no benchmarks in the spending of the previous year or at the global level of official development assistance. 
Specifically, can remain stable, the total amount of French support for developing countries (or decrease), France, to comply with its commitment to the "new and additional" funding. 
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. 
There is no rule, and each elects its calculation method. 
Some, such as France, borrowed 1 _ as being equivalent to 1 _ donated. 
This is obviously very difficult acceptable: the trouble is not comparable. 
If the use of loans for certain profitable investment (often to the emission-curbing projects based on actually technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro, which captured the equivalent for a donated euro... also should only the cost of the loan for capital donor country be counted as a commitment (i.e., the equivalent of an interest rate). 
But France has nothing else in mind than the following observation: it provides "respected" his commitment of 420 million euros, by 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros), and 8.5%) 36.1 million euros), also see the EU document in order to convince himself. 
France is the only EU land that loans to a great extent. 
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) with its commitments to 100% with donations. 
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union 1 _ spends to fulfil their commitments, France has just 10 cents and a similar commitment. 
Beautiful hocus-pocus. 
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double deception: a part with a Weiterentwicklkung the action on the time and partly with the reality of financial support. 
France, manages to suggest that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million, in line with its promises and saves euro 36.1 million. 
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy, the arbitrage has carried out) could be a doubly negative effect to; even internally (why drive the other members states with the donations, if it is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries are not completely fooled... 
The chapter of the premature funding only a small question on relatively short time compared to the discussions on the climate. 
But it could be the drop too much in the huge machinery of the UNFCCC. 
We hope that this will not be the case. 
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year of premature funding. 
First and foremost, France could be a change in his Verbuchungsart announce for the years 2011 and 2012, and in a spirit of respect for its obligations and compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union. 
But above all, France could escape the discussions on the subject of a dispute, the long-term financing forward (another crucial and currently topic): the issue of "Verrechenbar" or the Verbuchungsart not its loans. 
France could change its position, in order to be just ahead of the curve in terms of the contentious issues, such as it is in other things. 
The hope is based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun. 
A surprising announcement on the fast-starting of France and his vision of "Verrechenbar" as well as the use of loans would increase, by nature, the international confidence, which is necessary for further discussions.
