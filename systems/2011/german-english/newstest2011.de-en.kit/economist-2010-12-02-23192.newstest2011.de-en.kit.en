The demokatrische routine 
The democracy movement in Latin America will be stronger, as the support of private companies. 
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment. 
In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil's larger than that of the United States. 
These results came Latinobarómetro-poll published in 18 countries and is exclusively in The Economist. 
This survey will be carried out on a regular basis since 1995 and shows the exchange of views in the region. 
Two facts in this year's survey of September and October, particularly in's eye. 
First, the good mood in Latin America 
And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions. 
In many countries in the South American Pacific coast has increased considerably, the democratic movement (S. Table 1). 
In Peru, for example, where the economy every year since 2002, is growing by about 6%, the number of democracy advocates by 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. 
In Mexico, where the economy since the sharp drop in the last year, is to see such a trend. 
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the world's two most populous countries in the region, are staunch Democrats, reducing the regional average (S. graph 2). 
Around 44 percent of the respondents said that they are satisfied with the democratic practice in their country, as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3). 
Some 34% trust Congress of their country and 45% of their government, both of which correspond to the values of the past year, however, show a significant increase over 2003 (17% and 24%). 
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crisis undermined the efforts for more democracy. 
Also during the world economic crisis lasted perhaps is that the countries of Latin America's only experienced a brief recession and quickly recover. 
In addition, the poor have been absorbed by a stronger social network. 
(According to reports by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in 2009 only slightly to Latin America and has fallen again this year by 32%.) 
From country to country, but there is strong sentiment differences (S. graph 4). 
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread progress. 
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, it is less the case. 
It is only the second time since the beginning of poll see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country a greater problem than unemployment (S. graph 5). 
Some 31% say that either they or a family member in the last year have been the victim of a crime, but compared to 38 percent last year, the values have fallen and thus achieve the lowest level since 1995. 
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the increased support of the private and the market economy: approximately 71% at cross-regional level of those surveyed said that the private sector is essential for the development, in 2007, there were 56% (S. graph 6). 
Some 58 percent said that only the market economy can bring their country progress, compared with 47% last year. 
Interestingly, 62 percent of respondents in Venezuela maintained this view (and 80 percent are in favour of a private sector), even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, many private companies nationalized. 
Brazil has, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year). 
The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries will see in the United States, the most influential country, and this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua from Venezuela.
