Mystery of the complex in Canada lifted 
The new American diplomats pipes, which have been disseminated by WikiLeaks, strip away the mystery about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of Canadians feel towards the Americans; but with the same blow the genres the latter open to Canada. 
Consequently, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters to the ballot is not the Canadian-American relations in the spirit, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government to enforce their budget by 2009. 
The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington were yesterday publicly disseminated, still offer more juicy details than the mere substantive content, which has been a very bad outcome. 
A link datierende 22 September 2008, in other words, in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage are claimed in full swing, was reported, the point at which the United Nations is no longer in the operations of their political leaders. 
The great surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador in Ottawa,. 
Mr Wilkins offers various channels of explanation of this situation. 
"The Canadians almost economic inferiority complex caused possibly led the Canadian political leaders far more likely to talk about internal issues of everyday life, as the United States in this election pass the buck to (as in the 1988 campaign on free trade)," he describes. 
The United Nations, it concludes, are "the proverbial Goliath this election: omnipresent, but potentially threatening to talk about him." 
The ambassador understands these "deafening silence" especially since the two countries have intensive political and economic relations. 
"Logically," he assessed, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leaders to drive such a crucial relationship, the voters at the polls as a key factor in the way." 
The other expression of this sense of importance is to prepare in the 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business sources in Ottawa, sent communication, which President Barack Obama on his first visit in Ottawa. 
"Their visit will help the continuation of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade ago, the result of an expansion program of $30 to $40 billion," Breese describes. 
He had no mention of the government's parliamentary session before Christmas had to be postponed in order to prevent that Parliament would be toppled by the coalition and the continuation of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed expansion programme. 
Another datierende from January 2008, and on the part of the communication wrote Ambassador Wilkins agreed Washington from the increasingly growing negative image that the broadcast on CBC, dramatic series spread from the United States. 
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts as Border, little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which can be little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" or contributions for the purpose of Muskelprotze the CIA conducted interrogations. 
Another communication reported at length about how Hillary Clinton remarked with her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner in their first bilateral meeting was asked whether Europe is ready to accept some detainees from Guantanamo Bay. 
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question, however, on the basis of an individual "case-by-case" decision. 
Ã€m end of the meeting, described as "he has given the state Secretary of a paper in terms of Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslim origin." 
"The Secretary of State has promised that the acts by once again watch." 
We can see finally that the sensibilities on the Web site WikiLeaks. 
Tom Flanagan, an old and very closely Stephen Harper of advisers, had declared on CBC that the people responsible for this massive leak killed "should be." 
He was here to Mike Huckabee speaking from the United States.
