Red Bull triumphs in the F1s with a secret weapon by Siemens 
The car will be improved with a software program in real time. 
Since Red Bull in 2004 moved the world of Formula 1, her story is the speed of surprises in the select universe and marked successes. 
Initially, no one paid the newcomer and despite its sharply rising earned him during the last few seasons, in the final sprint last November, all on the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso. 
Without the skills of the German pilots and world master Sebastian Vettel or the current strength of the Renault engine to belittle want is the "secret weapon," the multinational Siemens Red Bull in the hands, and that created a victorious team, become a legend. 
In fact, is a powerful software to simulate processes, which the German company in 2007 for purposes that do not have to do with motor racing, on the market. 
This referred to as the PLM computer program was used for the development of assembling chains in factories around the world, energy plants and highly precise instruments. 
The goal is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before this will actually be built so as to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs. 
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the aircraft Sukhoi and the most famous commercial vehicles from Nissan. 
Victory Fried Russwurm, head of the industrial department of Siemens, said that with the use of these software in the factory formula 1 - Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes and improvements to the race and are found in the tests, and can carry out. 
Russwurm contends that in the 1992 regarding worked an average of ten technicians, the most in a season three or four were able to introduce improvements. 
They lead analyses in Red Bull team today are 180 highly qualified young people are preoccupied with powerful computer equipment and all sorts of changes to the Rennwagen. 
The Siemens managers said that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all parts of the Rennwagen of Red Bull, with the exception of the engine, the only responsible Renault said. 
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics, and the security elements will be changed. 
The changes can be transferred, thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech Autoklaven in less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of Simulators. 
The only limit imposed on this crazy technical perfect is the $40 million, which is a Formula 1 team - must spend on his race in a season. 
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its Rennwagen in a 50 kilometres from London distant place. 
There are two buildings where visits - particularly of journalists - are severely limited. 
Everything that is happening there is Top Secret. 
The staff includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber. 
But Red Bull Formula 1 true hero - zweifelslos is the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell. 
Behind the vast technological resources, the energy-drink-makers in the service of his participation on the race tracks to hide other protagonists, whose invaluable support and whose fame is zero. 
The Technologichef of the plant, Steve Nevey, stressed that it was five years ago, say that the progress made in the field of R & D for Rennwagen with 50 percent contributed to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest. 
Today's share values have changed, and the technology is 85 per cent of success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent. 
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computer, because they are "not voraussagbare gladiators."
