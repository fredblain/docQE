Police operations in China will be smooth 
As a training officer Tang Shenbin stepped on an urban place, reviewed his nervous subordinates and issued with military authority and more muted voice commands. 
He wanted to see his female members of Cheng Guan - China's robust guards of urban planning, feared and despised for their indiscriminate raids and their tendency to violence - to impress viewers. 
"Exactly!" 
"Look in front!" 
"Show them," he it to them, "as beautiful girls!"

By law, the critics. 
Unlike the police, these officials only the urban laws with the help of fines or other administrative penalties. 
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture. 
Beat in January 2008, officials in Hubei Province a viewer to death when they are filming them with his cell phone, as a protest campaign against a dustbin.

"Cheng Guan makes the government fear," lamentierte national newspaper China Daily last year, after another controversy about the tactics. 
The newspaper called for a "really thorough cleansing." 
Skeptics are the current approach is clearly inadequate. 
As the Distrik in October by complaint sought eight female recruits, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News, the question of whether the women had real tasks or only serve as optical distraction. 
Probably both. 
According to the vacancy notice women were at the age of 18 to 22, with good figure and sought "harmonious facial features." 
They should be above-average large - about 1,5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 customs.

"Whether the candidates get the job, first depends on their appearance, such as height, weight, facial features, etc." 
Then temperament and "inner qualities." 
In addition, "female Cheng Guan as flowers Vasen," he said and added, "but they still have other obligations." 
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the city administration of the Distrikts, would not agree with this description, 
But admitted that size in China in advertisements for both sex are not unusual. 
The same is true for equal facial features. 
Whether that is synonymous with good appearance, is controversial in China. 
But people with disabilities or physical changes need not apply. 
"We are unfortunately not use down or buck leagues," Mr Zheng. 
"Their image would not be good." 
Liu Yi, who is on the Baoguang Square near a monastery patroliert, 22, has Apfelb채ckchen and a well formed. 
They do not empfindetes as sexist, that will be placed great importance on their appearance.

"Mr Wang, disappear here, please." 
"We have already said so often," said Frl. Xu a trader who had fled on foot and temporarily abandoned his on a Fahrradkarre befestigten Nudelk체che. 
According to the officials, the work is more monotonous than demanding. 
"It is almost every day," said Huang Jing, 20, in their free time studying distribution system. 
"All routine." 
One reason is that the female officers are not commodities traders, as their male colleagues, confiscate. 
They can only threaten offenders to register their male superiors. 
This is to protect them from public hostility, officials in China are often exposed. 
This year, rioted outside hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, after the rumour kursierte, Cheng Guan-officials had killed a trader. 
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan-officials were injured in the late-night incident, 14 government vehicles were upset them or set on fire. 
Xindu remained free of such violent incidents. 
But unrest cannot be ruled out. 
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, in which the female patroulierten officials this morning, gathered more than 50 people on a street corner. 
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was contrary to the rules on the sidewalk instead of in a garage repaired.

After 15 min체tigem hesitation gave officials with cruel face to their vehicles and drove with the motorcycle and his owners. 
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male Streife, remained behind in which he was to be white name shield in order to remain anonymous. 
As her colleagues play the coordinators - men over 40 - a purely supporting role. 
But they were not trained to present a clean image. 
"Sometimes we go verbally." 
"But sometimes physically," Mr Li said soberly. 
"Most of the time people start with the dispute."
