Dear in times of war 
Since Angelina Jolie began last summer with the work on her still anonymous auspices debut, there will be trouble. 
She has even written the script, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serb man. 
Rather, we do not know about it, but that is enough for concern. 
A persistent rumour, the woman, a Muslim, verliebe during the Yugoslav war in its Serb rapists. 
Bosnian women's associations have protested immediately, and some of the days scheduled in Sarajevo were transferred in the short term to Hungary. 
Meanwhile, the film is marginalised in Hungary and in the post-production, but it is still protested in Bosnia. 
Bakira Hasecic, from the organisation wrote female victims of war, the UN refugee agency UNHCR of Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, now has a Bosnian newspaper reported, Jolie is ambassador to the UN refugee agency. 
Diplomatically, it is not, it has offered the women weeks before a meeting in Hungary, but what the rejected. 
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, Hasecic. 
Love stories in rape camps, it did not, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims of betraying her enough about the script. 
Her organization has recommended to the UN refugee agency, according to dismiss Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reported. 
What, exactly, but Jolie has written for scenes? 
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was to read their script, after some to-ing and fro-ing a screenwriter granted approval for Sarajevo, it is not quite clear why Jolie still did not. 
Even the young author claimed that they had no political intentions with their film, with a great deal of trouble incorporated into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and all the parties involved to give a voice. 
The content of it, however, remains vague. 
It has been circulating a second Synopsis on film in the network, which then quite different sounds: the lovers knew it even before war broke out and meet again, as a Bosnian Muslim, abducted in a Serb camp, where he works as a guard. 
What sounds considerably different than the variant "verknallt rape victims in torturer." 
That Jolie's film actually begins before the war, so much is safe. 
The pressure on them, Jolie, was "unfair and based on misinformation." 
Now she can only make the hackers of Hollywood peace: the script, like so many before, illegally on the Web.
