Weak applause for China 
Taiwan's voters slowly approaching a closer link to the mainland. 
What does Taiwan from his big brother across the Straits? 
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70 percent of all eligible voters, in the five city districts to elect mayors and city councils, which will be seen as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou. 
By building cutting-edge business relations, einschl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland, and its policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mainland for the first time since 1949. 
Ma has passed the exam, but only barely. 
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT), three of the five mayors, they did not receive a majority of votes. 
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates a greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%. 
In a presidential election that would have meant for Ma problems. 
Since his election two years ago, is his party's vote share has fallen by about 8%. 
For the first time the DPP even drew together with the KMT in the city councils. 
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as convoys of lorries with Krawall makers, flag-schwenkende mass parades and only scantily clad dancers. 
There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt. 
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT held on the eve of the election, a speech at a KMT candidate 
When he was a man from the crowd in the face. Lien wounded and killed a umstehender viewers. 
Bizarrer wise, it is not clear whether the shooter kill Lien or wanted to settle a dispute with the candidate. 
Regardless of the attack, according to Tsai mine-whom, the leader of the DPP, the election and put the DPP in a bad light, which has brought the KMT more votes. 
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign. 
Remarkably, the relationship has not been to the mainland. 
Instead, the candidates debated plans to social housing and the creation of jobs. 
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and oppose China's military threat. 
For this reason, the KMT is its relations with the government in Beijing. 
But this time avoided the DPP to stir up anti-Chinese feelings. 
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China. 
Ma, for its part, would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese supports his China policy. 
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy to attract Taiwan with economic incentives in the community. 
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a summit on investment security and medical cooperation. 
Certainly, it wants a political integration, but the most important thing first. 
It would rather wait until after the 2012 presidential elections. 
The DPP has now reinvented. 
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: the former party leader, Chen Shui-bian was convicted of corruption in the prison. 
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently for complete independence. 
But under Tais reign has developed a new generation gem√§ssigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the professionals and young people. 
Tsai took place as the DPP presidential candidate much support, as Su Tseng-chang under Chen. 
Her party now is doing everything it can to show that they, too, is in a position to develop close relations with Beijing. 
Tsai is planning a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this is open-minded discussion. 
Tsai said publicly that her party would offer a "trustworthy alternative" to vorschneller Ma's overtures to China. 
Chen seems very angry about this change. 
From his cell, he said, the candidate of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence. 
He called for the pragmatists Su even to abandon the presidential candidacy. 
Even without the interference of the DPP is difficult to choose their possible candidates. 
The KMT will have its own self-analysis. 
Ma's values are poor, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidate wanted to lead their campaign without him. 
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor. 
According to a KMT spokesman said he will transform his cabinet and the local facilities. 
The strong action by the DPP suggests that Taiwan is in favour of a rapprochement only restricted. 
At the same time, the majority of the Taiwanese economic cooperation with China as inevitable. 
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already a point of no return."
