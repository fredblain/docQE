World Cup in 2018 or 2022: FIFA appoints the host country 
In a chaotic frenzy on corruption suspicions appoints the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday, the host country of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup, a highly political election, in which the Rangeln for influence and lobbying the technical criteria to push into the background. 
One thing is certain, however: the edition of the 2018 FIFA King discipline in Europe, its traditional stronghold, to take place (the four candidates: England, Russia, Spain and Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium). 
The edition 2022 will then be a little exotic; the International Football Association hopes to win after the first on the African continent by 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia), or its branch in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to continue. 
The list of people who belong to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch leader, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) is the level of economic and political use of the World Cup. 
The machinations behind the scenes so threatening to get to the last minute. 
Otherwise difficult to establish a hierarchy of the candidates. 
After the evaluation report of the FIFA, the English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts bessseren arguments than its competitors. 
But these considerations are not so important for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees to the election. 
The Sunday Times, which was the finding of the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, could just as well can ruin the chances of their own country, the cradle of football, only once was the World Cup, in 1966. 
The BBC had on Monday again breeding ground, they had broadcast a documentary report, the three influential members of the Kommitees, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou is under attack. 
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and the English officials to embarrass had primarily with David Cameron, in these last few weeks, an intensive lobbying. 
The head of government is hoping for a repeat of the successful chess train from his predecessor Tony Blair for London in 2005, the organization of the Olympic Games in 2012. 
This intensive use would be sufficient to enhance the image of England before the Kommitee again? 
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal, there is no lack of assets, with its already finished stadiums, his expertise (82 World Cup in Spain, the Olympic Games in Barcelona in 1992, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture. 
But the economic and financial downsides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions. 
The possible reprisals against the English, as well as the cast doubt on solvency of Spain and Portugal, the chances of Russia which, despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transportation) has become the weighty marginalised. 
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided that the suggestion stating on the Bezichtigungen the English press "an unfair competition in the run-up to the vote" on the part of the Kommitee denounced members. 
"They bewirft with dirt, they are trying to embarrass them," Putin lashed out. 
For 2022 appear to be the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, the logical favourites. 
First economic world power, the headquarters of FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to be a long list of advantages compared with Japan and South Korea, which separately have established a very good project. 
But these new nominations seem premature for two countries which co-organised competitions in 2002. 
Another threat: the long-awaited awarding of FIFA's World Cup 2026 for China, the Asian opportunities lapses in 2022. 
With Australia and Qatar, with the Aufwartung futuristischer stadiums had pulled out all the stops, FIFA is pursuing its expansion into new areas, but these two countries represent a greater risk, for sure. 
Australia could suffer as well as Japan and South Korea among the European countries akquittierten weakness of television rights (because of the time shift), the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
