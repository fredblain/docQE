PP calls on Ma's postponement of the tax agreement 
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, yesterday took the opportunity to personally Artur Ma's their conditions to support his first as prime minister to present the Generalitat, these are no different from the already made during the election campaign and the primacy of economic recovery and the omission of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement, which the regionalistische leader wants to propose at the height of his mandate. 
The leader of the Catalan Popular Party responded to the security of Artur Ma's, the 18 members, which they won last Sunday - a paragraph, which is more than enough to feel vital, as the candidate of the Civic regionalist party CiU is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties in the vote when he took office. 
The future alliances, which leads the regionalists in the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Congress want to reply, depend on a possible entente with the PP and the talks, Ma's at the time with the other party leaders, however, are concerned with Catalonia. 
What the party leader of the PPC, these calls for support for the term "all discourses, affecting the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia," as well as an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the autonomous region - similar to the Basque country - and the leader of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum, at the back. 
Two political leaders is in common that they want to abolish the oversized political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and inheritance and gift tax.
