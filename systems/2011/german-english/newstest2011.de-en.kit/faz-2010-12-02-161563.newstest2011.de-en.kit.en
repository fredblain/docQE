The ice-University 
The "gelato University" in Bologna Eiskonditoren prepared for better seasons. 
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the biggest feeder and visitors from all over the world. 
Why, in fact, the whole ice? 
Invited by the animals and the Gelataio. 
The invited animals in German something old-fashioned the Eiskonditor, the cream is following all the rules of the Italian Eismacherkunst. 
The Gelataio is catching up with a Spachtel the ice cream from the refrigerated counter, they cut into the Waffel and then sold them. 
In order to know this, we must not go to Anzola dell ' Emilia in the province of Bologna. 
But who still want to know about ice, which is not in the "gelato-University," the Italian firm Carpigiani over. 
The ice-University, the manufacturer of Eismaschinen set up in 2003, so that the ice cream everywhere from its machines will meet the high Italian ideals. 
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the biggest feeder and visitors from around the world. 
But there are also more day special courses around the Schokoladeneis and internships in the Eisdiele home. 
Some dreams in the Midlife Crisis-of a new career, others venture just their vague aspirations on the treacherous ice. 
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil via Hungary to Saudi Arabia. 
Jacky, art teachers from California, loves the Slow-food movement and wants to offer the country's industrial Ice-Cream in future, a European quality product. 
Anke from Berlin company adviser and wants to eintüten after years in a nerve-racking job gone. 
Two young Egyptians dream to open a Eisdiele in Cairo. 
A man from Malta and one from Brazil to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housewife Yulia, because their children love Italian ice cream. 
Maestro-invited animals Luciano Ferrari declared the first participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice cream. 
It is crucial not only of good taste, but also the seidige fluidity and good consistency. 
Luciano forgets his training but not the icing on the cake of national and even Latin Überbaus: "Italian Gelato is simply the best, and then there is still plenty of romanticism." 
The first step towards the production seems quite simple. 
Luciano dump the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a big Mixgerät, all of this with an electronic program heated to 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees. 
Then he turns to the machine to a tap, and comes out a pasteurised white base cream, basis for all Milcheissorten. 
Immediately, the bestürmt lecturer with questions: you can only ice cream with natural substances without stabiliser? 
How can one's own free experimental mood? 
Luciano warns, the spirit of the time mislead. 
Anyone who has ice cream "only from natural ingredients," may nonetheless used stabilizers, usually a product of nature, such as Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne. 
Of course, it can be frozen without stabiliser, only to then be sold within a day, otherwise it sackt bite, and the customer on Eiskörnchen louder. 
Some are variations on the basic mass. 
There will be more exciting with the flavourings. 
For the taste in ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients in the fruit-department or to buy the sweets of the supermarket. 
Moreover, there is powder and Pasten. 
"The suppliers will all try to foist onto you dozens of aromatic additions." 
"But you should just experimenting." 
Either in the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruit. 
Or the ice cream from the basic white mass with eggs to yellow cream and cocoa powder to the basis for all kinds of chocolate temptations offered. 
Now the course participants in the Eismaschinen. 
Luciano they each of four different types of vanilla, chocolate, Mokka and produce hazelnut-ice, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural supplements. 
The same experiment will be subjected to the Fruchteissorten. 
More flavourings, more fruit-geschmacklich Püree, that is not necessarily better. 
Hazelnut taste-ice does not necessarily nussiger if it contains more hazelnuts. 
The most popular Kiwi-ice, the working group, which used more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser. 
Only a balanced mix of the taste of a true Gelato, Luciano says. 
Eisherstellung is a computing task: peach-Püree used with a lot of sugar, sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe. 
For Zitroneneis needed an extra dose of sugar. 
Luciano is a device, with which he determined the sugar content of the Fruchts places (winemakers measure so that the Oechsle in grape must). 
Fortunately, facilitate tables the calculation. 
To make ice does not require as much physical as before. 
Not only the device helps for the automatic restoration of basic mass. 
There is also a device in which the ready-made ice-mix at the same time cremig beaten and kept cool to minus temperatures. 
Of all the automation, not small mishaps. 
The Brazilians Gustavo acquitted itself and its rate colleagues from top to bottom with fruit Püree than the colossal hand blenders spiral out of control. 
"In every direction," Maestro Luciano says that "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens."
