The right mattress and rust right beds? Women have different desires than men 
Not the tollste bed, but the quality of the deck surface, so mattress and rust from good bed. 
Although this must complement each other in harmony, in order to respond to the wishes of the actual user. 
Many things in the selection of a role, the weight, the size of the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the Schläfers. 
Just as important is the Interieur in mattress and rust. 
Typical example? 
In a weekend house in which does not regularly heated, Latexmatratzen are not well suited, since they need much longer to be "hot." 
In addition, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethane mattresses. 
And they should be changed regularly. 
If they do not have enough Entlüftungskanälchen in the core and are on a solid record, snarled in humidity, so it is not excluded that among her tape. 
In the election, of course, also plays a role in what one is accustomed to. 
Who is a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with soft class, will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with hard surface. 
"All ice hockey players who have come back from the NHL, have complained to me that they can no longer sleep properly." 
"For their abgeschundenen shoulders, and Hüften they simply need a soft layer of Visco-foam (Memory Foam, a form of memory-Polymer)." 
"I would recommend, among other things, the health of people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the" information "from the ligaments and skin badly," said Sylva Hadamcziková to cushion furniture. 
That is why I have many years ago ice hockey players, but also other customers with these mattresses Visco-foam (Memory Foam). 
"Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses and others, offer the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico." 
And it does not necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey players in order to learn the benefits of the Visco-foam. 
This "miracle" actually works quite simply. 
The optimalisiert sparkling in accordance with his toughness and form of the absorbierten heat, in other words, he is usually right schmiegt on warm body. 
No, it is passing in the night, it is not as after a major battle. 
You simply sleep much better. 
The viskoelastische foam also offers protection against Dekubitus (gangrene). 
In the election of the mattresses size should be to body size still add the length of the Fußsohlen, around 21 to 34 cm. 
Man as a woman, to the 180 cm wide, need a 210-220 cm-long bed. 
Each of the Schläfer should at least 90 cm wide deck available, so 180 cm. 
In separate beds, for example, in singles, 120-140 cm are appropriate. 
For the sake of comfort and also for any visitors. 
Otherwise, the rule of thumb for the broad ideal bed: "if it is on the back, should be enough room for the easy angewinkelten," advises mine. Prokopová Helena, the guild of Polsterer and Raumausstatter, for years the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture, devoted to this subject in colleges. 
In a double bed everyone needs its own rust and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are also high. 
Otherwise, there is nothing to install the Roste different amounts and that is not possible for each bed. 
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with pen skeleton 15 cm, should at least three centimetres in the form of class and the fine cushion. 
"With the hand or the Hinsetzen must feel the feathers under any circumstances," Helena Prokopová warns. 
Every mattress makes a special Rosttyp required. 
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document how together evolved Siam twins in the bedroom. 
The mattresses are not reveal and we cannot wash, which today is already commonplace. 
And since you are in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years, becoming a huge (and congested sieve). 
That is why also reject experts advertising slogans in mattresses a lifespan of up to 25 years, or even promise lifetime guarantee. 
Each has their ifs and buts. 
And that is why a practical advice from dealers: mattresses of 120 or 140 cm range should be the hygiene of the waschbaren, not shy away from abziehbaren salary, but it is to use a Matratzenschoner, you can easily withdraw and washing. 
Even if today usually mattresses references are made with Rundumreißverschluss, so after the opening two halves gets (immensely important for the washing process and washing machines size!), is the manipulation with larger mattresses, mainly carried out alone, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. 
They are in bed instead of a Rostes a firm record? 
Get out! 
Or, at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night. 
So they should use the record to ventilation holes (if not included) and mattresses with pen skeleton and 15 cm minimum level with so-called Taschenfederkern and fine cushion. 
Polyurethane mattresses are on such a document. 
Not for verstellbare Lattenroste with 14 to 18 pen (Lamellen) Latex or sandwich placed mattresses (possibly including combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay in Roste with a larger number Latten, 28, and more responsible, with the Lordosenstütze Lendenwirbelbereich and the ability to regulate the Latten severity. 
At verstellbare Lamellenroste no mattresses with pen skeleton, because they do not respond to the ergonomische farce. 
In addition to the suspension of the Steife pen will also offer special flexible shoulder modules. 
This is a special Befestigung the pen, which allows the pen einzudrücken or even verwinkeln so that they will allow the specific Einsinken the shoulder of the Schläfers. 
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important matter. 
There are even mattresses manufacturers have started to use in "gentlemen mattresses" soft zones for the shoulder area. 
They also remember the ladies is intended - it takes these soft zones in the Hüftgegend. 
For the most demanding customers are to stretch the point Flügelfedersysteme (Lattoflex) or Roste with elastic point of contact-Pads with so-called Multitorsionsfederung. 
The pressure will be distributed on several points, and thereby reduce the tension. 
However, if the right mattress and right rust a bad (too much and fülliges) head cushion used most of the gains are lost. 
Here is a rule of thumb: the head cushion to ease the head restraints, its top should only up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles. 
The ideal situation is therefore a 50 x 60 cm big cushion, as it may, for example, the Scandinavians. 
In the pages of the head should cushion (along with the Schulterentlastungszone in rust or the soft zone in the bed) to compensate for the shoulder. 
Some of our modern mattresses have in common with the former (with hay filled) straw bags. 
Using modern manufacturers increasingly natural materials, or at least their mixtures. 
Also in mattresses that means new magic word "organic." 
Instead of oil, raw materials used to produce increasingly polyurethane foams naturelle oils, for example, Rizinus and soya oil. 
Soya is used by all the well-known manufacturers. 
"Organic means in mattresses, their core of purely material of natural origin," Petr Vašíček said from the company's Tropico Plus. 
Natural substances but also be used in the manufacture of mattresses salary, was one of the first in Aloe Vera. 
But one can also allow micro-capsules, which spread in the bed of fresh forest or Lavendelduft. 
Here too there is a difference between a man and a woman. 
While the men a "kühlender" used plant extracts from birch forest leaves, so that the mattresses absorb the heat and cool the body can have on the salary for women "wärmende" effect. 
Extracts from red Paprikaschoten encourages wohlig warm blood circulation to the weaker sex in the bed. 
And today's favorite? 
Mattresses from cold sparkling (he has more Poren with destroyed cell structure and, therefore, is breathing more active than usual trade polyurethane and much more flexible). 
The combination of the various Steife (toughness) of cold foams and Visco-foams added zones mattresses, know exactly where head, hip and heels. 
For a high-quality mattress has, however, 7000 to berappen kroner and more. 
Health mattresses but are usually with lower value-added tax, because they are considered medical device. 
The first was Czech companies Gumotex this advantage. 
It is to save money in the mattress and the rust is not so easy. 
Occasionally there are special offers from manufacturers and retailers, which offer two mattresses for the price of one. 
So the brand offers the Magniflex mattress Duofreeze with Visco-sparkling Memory in relation to verstepptem 11990 CZK. 
The second you get for free. 
It was the Tempur material that launched the era of viskoelastischen sparkling substances with open cell structure and high density in almost kosmischem pace. 
No wonder they have been developed for NASA, because the astronauts are enormous in the launch of excessive impositions. 
Tempur in soft heat, cool milieu, it will be confirmed once again. 
So it fits perfectly in the human body and distributed in an optimal manner the body. 
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent pressure fire but generally increases the sleep comfort. 
Viskoelastische sparkling substances but not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special Fußpolstern used the legs and the Gefäßen relief. 
Using local manufacturers, for example, the sparkling substances Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
