Dossier, Clotilde Reiss, the Elysée Palace exaggerates his intermediary role for Syria 
In more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French scholar, who has been detained in Iran for "spying," the French public in breathing, the diplomacy on red alert and focused the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran. 
All of this under the attentive eyes of diplomats from the United States. 
The American documents of WikiLeaks obtained by the newspaper Le Monde by - give some background to this crisis. 
They describe how the Elysée had declared the Americans his strategy, which went so far as to give this advice for dealing with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of Wanderern). 
They show how the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that it is not the liberation of the young French woman, for the release of Majid Kakavand, a stricken Iranian in France held captive and the American justice system because of trade in materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program to Gegeleistung. 
Finally, the way in which the French Bureau to manipulate the media purposely tried to make this the idea credible Syrian President Bachar al-Assad have played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, a penetrating light. 
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard. 
In Paris on 12 August 2009 redigiertes diplomats note entitled "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostage-taking." 
François Richier, Elysée advisers in strategy issues, is accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone. 
They told her the French method. 
The advised the Americans to do everything possible to their own nationals back, forcibly detained in Iran. 
" Make noise, " she said, expressing " loud and clear and constantly, " the words ' fundamental human rights, " " innocence, " " immediate release " in the media. 
This is necessary in order to bring the Iranian regime in a predicament that respects very sensitive to its image. 
"This is pursuing all the more so, since you ask, the Iranians not to do that." 
Because "silence solves nothing," over the discussion about attempts to unauffälligem routes, the Iranians are "master in time-wasting tactics." 
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of a foreigners ' expression: " hostage taking for Iranian tactic of " political blackmail. " 
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss, from prison (on 16 August, on the day when she sneaks into the French Embassy) "demand the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230000 euro bail). 
And he can say that the antizipiere Elysée further hostage-taking, a phenomenon which "will worsen." 
The Iranians could arrest "in the near future, another of the approximately 1800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said. 
28 August 2009. 
Clotilde Reiss is 12 days ago has been released from prison, but will continue to be detained in Iran. 
The information was circulated, the Iranians Majid Kakavand, whose extradition to the United States because of illegal trade in empfindlichem electronics demand material to Iran, after a ruling by a judge in Paris has been released from detention. 
The American Embassy, as many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence. 
For Washington, which the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material provided for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid is a Khakavand bad news. 
France has taken a horse-trading? 
The liberation of the Iranian against the French woman? 
During a further meeting with Kathleen Allegrone assured on 4 September François Richier, that this is not the case. 
The Elysée, he says, not only was "completely surprised by the decision of the judge," but also tried to revolt against it. 
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he says. 
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under "strict" supervision of the French secret service. 
The Elysée adviser chooses a telephone number, again, then informed the American diplomat, the Iranians "are currently in the buildings, led by the Iranian Embassy in Paris." 
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss, in Iran the Elysée spares his efforts, through statements and organised by the media "flight attempts" to believe that the Syrian President Bachar al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential mediator." 
The Americans see this activity is not without irony, and note that the manipulation is bearing fruit, since several articles in the press reflected the official French version. 
A telegram datierendes on 25 August 2009 evokes "the media bolt of the French authorities." 
What is based so much ' expression of thanks " to Mr Assad, wonders the Paris embassy. 
"Despite their full statements give Lobpreis secretly to the French authorities that they have only a vague idea what the Syrians have actually done." 
The document also deals with the reasons which have led the Elysée, this fiction. 
The intensive communication efforts "aims to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria," he analysed. 
A 2008 launched policy, which was then "by many critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserved perceived." 
"The Syrian role aufbauschend trying" Paris "to Syria, which laud can be achieved by plays a constructive role in the region." 
The aim is also to "to sow discord between Syria and Iran." 
The American Embassy knows this from a good source. 
On 11 August François Richier had entrusted to her: "of course we do not know whether the Syrians whatever." 
"But we have, despite everything, thanks to them." 
"This should at least confusion on the part of the Iranians." 
Clotilde Reiss is returning to France on 16 May 2010. 
Nicolas Sarkozy it receives at the Elysée. 
In a statement he is grateful to the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for its "active role in favour of the release of our compatriot."
