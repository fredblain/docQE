In the pursuit of Wikileaks chief 
Obama appoints a high level of responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new revelations. 
Interpol is a red warning to persecution and detect Assange. 
Everything that has to do with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated maze in which the only difficult situations. 
Yesterday, Interpol was a "red alert" to "locate and persecution" of Assange. 
However, it is not a traditional order on the arrest. 
In addition, it is not new, it comes from the 20 November. 
They must also has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse, which the Australians in Sweden. 
The lawyer also assured of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they make contact with Mr Assange." 
Already on the 20th, the international police agency based in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden in the order, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the authority by the Swedish authorities. 
As things stand, the 188 Interpol countries need to identify and presumably Assange, "him for the time being to arrest and extradite." 
Although Interpol's arrest of an affected individual cannot issue orders by a red warning, many member countries, according to the organisation of the red warning as carte blanche for a Arrestierung - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition treaty, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely. 
The action Assanges outraged lawyers who gesten published a letter in which they were informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is prepared by video conference to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities. 
They also recall that Assange requested the exit from Sweden and the prosecutor, who is compared with the sagenumwobenen Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security chief of Stalin, who received the authorization. 
"It is like a hunting, not as a legal persecution," will be charged in the letter. 
While the world looking for him - and his mother of Australia from the innocence of their son - keeps Assange on in an unknown location, but not in silence. 
On Monday, he was the head of the Time magazine via Skype from an unspecified location in an interview in the conversation he requested the resignation of US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. 
"If it can be shown that it was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the United Nations and signed by the United States has violated international agreements, they would have to resign," he said. 
His opinion was yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, described the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd." 
"I am not sure why we should put emphasis on the opinion of a type with a website," he told the CNN. 
Obama himself has a heavy responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, tasked with preventing new documents revelations. 
The attempt by the spokesman of the Pr√§sidenden Barack Obama Assange less attention, is in contrast to the views, the conservative politicians and commentators in recent days. 
Congressman Peter King, the January chaired the National Security Kommitee will lead the House of Representatives, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of Wikileaks to put on the list of terrorist organisations, "whose money seizures and anyone who supports them or makes a contribution." 
Tom Flanagan, adviser to the Canadian president Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to be his statement, Assange "murdered." 
"Obama would have to turn it into a target and not bemanntes plane or what." 
Anyone not apologising, was Mike Huckabee, baptistischer ministers, a former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate. 
"Whoever it was, in the government information leaked, he is guilty of treason and everything which is not an execution, eiine is mild punishment," he told the Fox stations.
