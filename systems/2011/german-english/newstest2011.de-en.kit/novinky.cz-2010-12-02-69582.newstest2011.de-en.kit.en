Czech children get drunk with ' Fernet and rum, beer is out, it is simply too slow 
' Fernet, rum and vodka, for once, has also let a good whisky, the father of Hausbar stolen. 
These are the drinks, which benefit from drunken Czech teenager notbehandelt must be under 15 most frequently. 
No exceptions are children, the ausschlafen their hangovers repeatedly in hospital. 
This is from the experiences of doctors, who are faced with similar cases in the inclusion of the children wards of hospitals. 
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion, simply because it takes too long to be drunk." 
"Today the trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, who the chief doctor of the children's department at the Central Bohemian clinic Hořovice. 
" Whisky, if it succeeds, the father to snatch a bottle from the Hausbar, and if not, then at least ' Fernet or vodka. 
"Vodka has the advantage that it can mix with juice, then he does not smell so much," said the head doctor. 
The speaker of the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him right. 
"Most often it is about ' Fernet or rum." 
"That is today's alcohol trend, particularly in primary schools." 
"Sometimes it was also about slivovice, we feel they are at home," Mrs Jurinová led. 
Chief doctor Pelikán according to 13- or 14-year drinkers long in the hospital reception is no exception. 
Before the clinic in Hořovice, in which he has been working for this year, he spent ten years in the paediatric section of the Motol hospital, where the ambulances angetrunkene pupils from ablieferten Middle and distance. 
"A girl had to be hospitalisiert four times." 
"Began her career with 12 years ago, when it was the first time with 3.5% alcohol in the blood and in combination with" Extase ,"" the doctor described a particularly severe case. 
"She was in the exhibition site in Holešovice on any dance party." 
"The interesting thing was that it is not strange, sponsored her mother that her daughter not 48 hours came home," the chief doctor surprised. 
It is precisely the lack of interest by parents or their incredible tolerance in the Anstoßen with its own Sprösslingen is regarded as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children. 
It is a real dependence in the true sense of the word is, according to experts, not in children. 
"Alcoholism is a longstanding chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomenon to understand and that is not the case with these children." 
Among those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, is mostly a negative directed-social background characteristic, " said chief doctor Pelikán. 
According to the spokesperson for the hospital Motol, Mrs Jurinová, have been locked up by mid-November, approximately 40 drunken children in our department for children and youth. 
However, only the cases with severe alcohol poisoning, which required a hospital stay, go in the statistics. 
Drunken children after ambulatory care from parents or, if necessary, by the police, are not registered. 
In addition to the cases in which children only once as a bottle of spirits in the school austrinken bank, there is the opinion of Mr Pelikán three year time Amplituden is 100% reliance: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year. 
"The latter for two reasons, either from distress because of the bad certificate or joy at the holidays." 
"I have in the Walpurgisnacht already drunk seven children at once seen in the reception," Dr Pelikán stressed. 
A betrunkenes child spends the night under medical supervision, paradoxically, is better off as a child, that only the next day to contend with a nasty hangover. 
The headaches later in the morning, the lack of the warrant and the glucose deficiency, can be in the hospital with a liquid-giving infusion with glucose and nutrients to the organism. 
"They are clearly better off, because after the ' beautiful ' experience in the evening, they create something hurts with good humour, without somewhere." 
"They are just a little confused about where they are," doctor admits Pelikán, who with the patients sometimes, at least it is polluting the good humour, he considers them the cost of the treatment will cost. 
Because of the transport vehicles with the rescue and the night in an emergency bed well and happy to a few tens of thousands of kroner. 
"Now and again I have used as educational resources, if I directly calculated the children during the visit, which has cost their drunkenness and that there is a risk that they have to work the whole holiday in order to earn the money for a single such Fete," Dr Pelikán added. 
In his view, the health insurance schemes are not, however, to redress procedure costs necessary to cure the trunkenen children from parents.
