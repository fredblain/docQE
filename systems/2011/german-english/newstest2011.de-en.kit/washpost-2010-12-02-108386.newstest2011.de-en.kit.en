Can combine courtesy that which divides us? 
After a campaign of dirty words and negativity is little courtesy this week in Washington. 
It is the sign of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion, before quickly returning to the battle of the parties in the capital return? 
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress produced no breakthrough in the big issues to deal with during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a period of government in which no decisions will be taken. 
After all, what we hear, it was neither a polite debate between two different sides to govern an account of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partisan points collection. 
The public meeting of the deficit, the President's Commission on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences that still exist between the members. 
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months to create a mutual respect, of the ideological divide that still separates members. 
This is hardly enough to claim that it is entered a new era of cooperation. 
Both sides are now in a testing phase - in which one of the demands of other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise, while it tried to weigh up the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters, according to a new party warfare. 
So were the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants to a minimum of demands or accusations. 
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep for a quick change in the atmosphere, which has in the past two years, could be expected. 
Regardless of whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or benefits, the two sides are miles apart. 
Last but not least, the November election Washington at least mild for a short time. 
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, which is now for "the Ethics and Public Policy Center is working." 
" It is inevitable after elections. 
Elections give partisan passions that die. 
And that is a good thing. " 
On some issues, especially those who are on the agenda of the ' lame duck session, "Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution." 
Bush's tax cuts end up at the end of the year, and no one supports this. 
Both sides want to find a way to make some or even all receive, whether it is temporarily or permanently. 
It is a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits to be expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that it believes that the favored tax cuts for the rich, while unemployed workers refuse to support. 
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House has increased the optimism that we can in these matters during the "lame duck session" and at the same time the New START treaty ratified. 
But William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation on pressing issues of the lame duck session " does not necessarily lead to a long-term cooperation of the parties must, if the new 112. Congress will convene in January. 
Instead, he says, is a period of Nicht√ºbereinstimmens more likely, perhaps even inevitable. 
"After the things that need to be done, this will be short-term psychology into confrontation," he said. 
Wehner is also sceptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - the politeness leads to real cooperation. 
"I see a lot of what happens from today until 2012, when Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event in 2012," he said. 
The reasons have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority to do in the White House and with the Teeparty-voters, who were their education. 
As the worried Republican leaders also may be that they vie too high, they know that they must try to their promise to reduce the expenditure of the government and the health-care reform, must be adhered to. 
This party lines are already in the initial reactions on the recommendations of the deficit Commission clearly what a tax reform and raising some taxes and raising the retirement age and reduce government spending. 
The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, insisted that the deficit issue on the public agenda, that they can no longer be ignored. 
But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes in order to make their plan for the official recommendation and they fight to come even close to this figure. 
The biggest opposition in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial issues, at least today, little room, or there is little sympathy for compromise. 
Galston says two stages of the battle between the White House and Republicans in Congress. 
The first fight will be followed next year in the form of party clashes take place, if the Republicans Obama in terms of the national budget, taxes and the health system, then two more from a period parteilicher cooperation. 
What will this change? 
The public opinion. 
It is proved that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties to work together. 
If confrontation is a blind alley, as happened in 1995, then both parties need to carefully look at the public reaction. 
Whoever is sentenced to lose, will change tack and seek a compromise. 
This may indeed be an optimistic view. 
Partisanship and polarization today are greater than in the mid-1990's, and they seem to be a major ideological divide between Obama and the Congress as a Republican at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. 
At the same time, activists see 2010 of both parties as a mere prelude to a much wider choice of consequence of 2012. 
So may the courtesy to display this week, will be welcomed by many Americans. 
But it will be very much on both sides will require more effort to find a common denominator in the issues that the two still separated.
