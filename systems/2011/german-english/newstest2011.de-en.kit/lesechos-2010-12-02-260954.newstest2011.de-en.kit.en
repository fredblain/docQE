Second mandate: the Open record of 
De Gaulle was really being whittled away. 
Mitterrand had to believe that he stutze. 
Giscard d 'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation. 
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that. 
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next. 
The current head of state is so candidate in 2012. 
But the evidence is open to the side of the Mysteriums accompanies the presidential function, not good. 
So you have to pretend that the doubts. 
In one, as well as in the other direction. 
In 2006, the Jacques Chirac's supporters, a third mandate is not excluded, without even to believe. 
On 15 November Nicolas Sarkozy assured in serious Tone to make his decision "at some point in the autumn of 2011." 
He would on Tuesday evening at the Elysée before the UMP parliamentarians, the prospect of "two mandates," therefore, had a little Fieberhaftigkeit. 
That was the official announcement of his candidacy? 
Far from it. 
The president was simply remind you that the amendment to the constitution in 2008, the number of five-year terms of office to only two. 
He made a statement that no announcement. 
It is not the first time that he mentioned the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone. 
"You have the worst case, seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009. 
At a news in May 2010: "does not believe that I am not after reflecting on the stage." 
His words from the day before yesterday, it is no longer the candidate than the previous day, but no less. 
They should provoke comments, then from a double. 
The acceleration of the Wettlaufes the candidacy on one side with the PS. 
But it is not the inclusion of competition with Segolene Royal, Nicolas Sarkozy, to reveal. 
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS earlier than urge to challenge. 
The bad polls, on the other side. 
For the first time the voters of the right of a candidacy by François Fillon prefer by Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the poll by the BVA-L ' Express). 
"We have a candidate, and there have been no discussions with the UMP," responded immediately and cautious about the environment of the Prime Minister. 
"If he would be a defeat as possible, he would not be" candidate, Jean-Pierre Raffarin. 
"He will always believe, to win," corrected Alain Juppé, has gone along with the Open record.
