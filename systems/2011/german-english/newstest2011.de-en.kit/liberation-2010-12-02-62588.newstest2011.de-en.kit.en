Rachsüchtige hackers and emsige spies 
The dossier, WikiLeaks has a double meaning. 
On one hand, it is turning out to be as obvious scandal, a scandal which is just a scandal in the Sinner hypocrisy, which ruled Beziehunge between states, the public and the press. 
On the other hand, it announces radical changes at international level, and there is a foretaste of the future dominated by regression. 
But we go to the next series. 
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any of the secret service produced acts (of any nation) exclusively from newspaper cuttings. 
The "extraordinary" to read American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi's throw no more than what you for months anyway in any any Journal (except those whose owners Berlusconi is), and the profile of Gaddafi's terrifying karikaturierte offered Kabarettkünstlern already for a long time, fuel for their Sketche. 
The rule that only the secret dossiers consist of already well-known news, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century. 
If you go into a library, esotherischen publications, you will see that each station (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, Templer, or the Rosenkreuzler) accurately repeats what has already been written in previous works. 
This is not alone, therefore, that the author occult texts do not want to publish research (nor, therefore, that he did not know where news of the failure to find exist), but because those who pay the Okkultismus, nothing other than to believe what they already know and confirmed what they already have learned. 
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown. 
Similarly, the secret files. 
The informant is lazy, lazy (or limited mental) is also the head of the secret service (he could otherwise whatever, for example, editor of Libération), the only true considers what he acknowledges. 
The Top Secret information on Berlusconi, the American Embassy in Rome had sent the Staatsdezernat, were the same as those that Newsweek before the week was published. 
So why such a fuss was made about the revelations of these files? 
On one side of this state, what every educated person already knows, and that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the government can call each other or take a plane in order to make dinner, have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small entertainment functions, have turned into espionage centres. 
Any old viewers of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy, that they are doing so to ignore it. 
Still, the fact that it publicly to repeat the task of the hypocrisy and serves to American diplomacy in a bad light. 
In second place: the idea that a n any hackers geheimsten secrets can tap into the most powerful country in the world, there is the significant blow to the prestige of the Staatsdezernats. 
Moreover, the scandal is less the victims rather than the "executioner" in trouble. 
But we have the profound nature of what happened. 
Formerly, Orwell's time, it was all power as a Big Brother pool of controlled every gesture of his subjects. 
Orwell's prophecy had since then as absolutely right, where you can monitor every movement, thanks to the telephone, each made transaction, visited the hotel, the motorway and so on; the total victims of citizens would be the eye of power. 
But if you look at, what is happening now that even the secret Krypten power can no longer escape the control of a Hackers, control motion ceases to be one-sided and will circle shaped. 
The controlled power every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers, chosen as an avenger of the citizen, the secrets of power. 
But how can a power that is no longer in a position to protect their own secrets? 
It is true, Georg Simmel said that a real secret is an open secret (and an empty mystery may never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's basically a secret is free of Geheimis, because there is the public sphere price; but in the style of WikiLeaks disclose that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to deprive them of any power. 
WikiLeaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel done wrong, but Clinton and Obama. 
What will be the consequences of this violation, which has been inflicted on such a huge power? 
It is obvious that the states will face in the future no reserved information online, that would be a angeklebten posting on the street corner. 
But it is also clear that it is in vain with the current technology is to be hoped, confidential reports on secret telephone. 
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state in a moving aircraft and has contacted one of his colleagues. 
How could in future be private and only for certain ears certain relationships? 
I know very well that my prediction for the moment, according to science fiction and the novel sounds, but I am compelled to imagine the government agents, digging away at secret way in moving to uncontrollable march routes, their communications anywhere else than with the mere memory manifested itself, and beyond the few written information they have, in the verbergend shoe sales. 
The information would be stored in single copy in locked drawers: in fact, the espionage attempt by Watergate less success than WikiLeaks. 
I had the opportunity to write that the technology nowadays as a cancer progresses, backwards. 
A century after the wireless telecommunications Graf had revolutionized communications, the Internet reconstructed a tele-Mr Graf with (telephone) wire. 
The (analog) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers, a film auszukundschaften band to band, by spulen from behind forward and all could reveal secrets of the assembly, while the (digital) CDs now allow nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter in macro-Portionen. 
With the high-speed trains it within three hours from Rome to Milan, while that by air, including the switching three-and-a-half hours. 
Therefore, it is not extraordinary, policy and communications technology in cars and horse. 
A final observation. 
In earlier times, the press has tried to understand what kind of secrets were forged between the messages. 
Currently, there are the messages, which are demanding confidential information from the press.
