No objections from the Spanish government against CIA flights 
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners on Spanish territory to Guantanamo, as from a telegram of the U.S.A. ambassador in Madrid. 
This reflects the enhüllten Wikileaks and the daily newspaper El País " (cable) transferred documents; it adds that the former deputy leader María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, the Spanish government should be informed, " to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain, will be monitored properly. " 
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, where the aid is shameful human rights practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, have been indicted, discussed the former American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega. 
The deputy leader, the report by the Council, "Zapatero met on the sidelines" and reiterated that Spain have nothing to hide in this matter. 
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objections to the secret service flights via Spanish territory." 
"They simply want to be informed," not "unprepared to be surprised," reported Aguirre via cable. 
The former foreign minister, Miguel Angel Moratinos, the ambassador pointed out that the Spanish government "this matter does not want to pay great attention to, even though the government has little influence, because they were in the hands of the judges." 
For its part, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez was to understand the message that he will not block the judicial initiative, the declassification of documents from the Spanish secret service central (CNI) and the defense minister about the CIA flights to request. 
"These reports contain no incriminating or sensitive information," the ambassador said after a meeting with the prosecutor. 
Nevertheless, the United States was about " the apparent coordination between the Spanish state prosecutor and the German prosecutors ' more concerned than about the deklassifizierte information of CNI and Department of Defense. 
"This coordination between independent Untersuchern will complicate our efforts to discreet handling between governments," Aguirre complained. 
At a lunch in March 2007, in which the ambassadors of the United States and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, commenting on the latter, "although the incredibly strong Spanish judges are protective of their independence and would do what they think is appropriate," he gave his staff instructions, bloated "rhetorical comments in order to avoid the tension abate." 
The ambassador also expressed his concern about the approach of the PP in this matter. 
"Despite the generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will no doubt, a sign that the government of the United States Zapateros acts that could be interpreted as a possible human rights violations, tolerated or deliberately ignored, capital, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the government of the United States," he stresses.
