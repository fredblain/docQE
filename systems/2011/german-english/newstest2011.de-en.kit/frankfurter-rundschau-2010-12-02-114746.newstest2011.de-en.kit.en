The trail of stones 
Uli Gsell has what concerned, a total of some 400 kilograms. 
On Monday night, he stood before Stuttgart railway station, the Tuba on the back. 
It was Demo. 
It was snowing. 
The story is well known: in September were the angerückt dredging and had started to break off a large chunk of the north wing. 
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: thousands demonstrated against S21, the billions of low more railway station. 
When it came to settlement freeze, there was a large part of the wing in ruins. 
Shattered in 6000 to 7000 pieces. 
Crailsheimer shell, a soft rough stone blocks between 1914 and 1920. 
Gsell is sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old. 
He has a couple of stones. 
"These stones are Reliquien." 
"They should not disappear." 
He schwärmt: "a cheap and poor, simple and earth." 
When he was a aufsägte after gerochen cigarette smoke. 
What he will do with the scraps, he does not know yet. 
Stones have time. 
Uli Gsell. 
The trail of the Stuttgart stones in a forest in Tübingen built on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen be stone-poor. 
The 44-year-old girl with old stones. 
He has bought all that fell on the demolition in Stuttgart. 
"It would be a shame, they would gemahlen Schotter or disappear in the landfill," he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen, once a guard was going crazy. 
Insulted and threatened him, he tells us, as in September, was in the newspapers that he bought the remnants of the north wing of the demolition business. 
But he has spoken with the S-21 opponents, for days. 
And he has told them that he could but nothing for the demolition. 
And if it is, then it was the wisest thing for the stones would be used. 
About 200 S-21 opponents took as one of the serious Quader, with an average of 80 kilos, bit price 6.50 to 14 euros. 
As a memory, but some in the hope of him in a reconstruction. 
500 tonnes of Rongen had bought 25 large truck loads. 
About half still stored in the forest, the rest is sold for a long time. 
Garden owners, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer. 
Whether they come from everywhere and would have weggeschleppt could boot and supporters. 
The Stuttgart stones of contention have long since turned "Mäuerle" or restrictions on Kräuterbeeten. 
"There is nothing special about this stone," Rongen said. 
"Would not be the political component." 
He is rising in his SUV, a tour through his great 20 hectares of the poor. 
Law he has studied and terminated later biology, he has an interest in computers and, finally, is stone dealers. 
And rock lovers. 
40000 tons stored stones. 
Karrt from across Germany his treasures. 
He says he is the biggest Altsteinhändler of the Republic. 
He is slowing down. 
Lying in the snow art behauene sand bricks. 
"They once belonged to Marian Dresden bridge," he tells us. 
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he schwärmt. 
"My favorite stone." 
It is the high road through the forest. 
He shows a bunch: red sand stone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe train station. 
And on. 
"Beautiful Travertin." 
Once the Quader belonged to the gallery of the Stuttgart Neckar stadium. 
Everywhere in the snow and stories, Travertin Cannstatter from the Stuttgart police Bureau, rötlicher Granit from the cathedral of St. Blasien, Tuff from Heilbronner hospital. 
What kind of work that effort, the sweat. 
If Rongen thinks of as the stones hacked by hand and with simple bottles moving trains and ox cart, it will be quite reverential. 
"But it would be a scandal if you would rather schreddern." 
He is rich not become immensely rich even less. 
But employs 14 people of stone dealers today, also have been high in the forest Steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a Glasbläser and horticulturalists. 
"We are working hard, but it is satisfactory," says the remnants exploiters. 
Soon he must to Cologne. 
There, too, there are obstacles to save.
