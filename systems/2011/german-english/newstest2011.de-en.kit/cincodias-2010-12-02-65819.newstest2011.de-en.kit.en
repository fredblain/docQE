Threats by the European Central Bank (ECB) 
Investors yesterday reacted sharply to the threat of ECB President Trichet, warned that "the markets should not underestimate our capacity to respond." 
The risk premia in the euro Peripheriländer have increased dramatically and the share of European banks by more than 5%. 
We should, however, the possibility that the ECB can deceive themselves and the euro barely increased in points, which has led to concern, not underestimate. 
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, in which he collapses again recovered, however, as a result of the closure of a short and highly speculative positions. 
The institutional investors will not lose its fear. 
A month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to make our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen reversed, according to the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably still a number of times in the future, we must pull back. 
The Bundesbank called for the lifting of the plan to buy government debt, because they are ineffective, and the lifting of all the extraordinary short-term liquidity measures, it should be retained only a einwöchiger permanent access. 
After the Ireland-crisis, we expect that the current liquidity measures "until at least March" extended and the quarterly contracts with unlimited access to broadcasting in the quarter to ensure the liquidity will be maintained until at least June. 
We also expect that the programme for the purchase of bonds will continue to spend and a stärkendes signal. 
If the expectations are not met, the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday thrown back and if halstarrig insisted that we take back our liquidity measures, can only God help us! 
Just as with the ECB meeting in May, the bank confirmed that the purchase of state debt securities to take into account and then the markets collapsed, this story could repeat tomorrow. 
The ECB must be credible and tenaciously. 
In May, it showed the teeth and said on Wednesday that they have bought, it provoked a new collapse of the market. 
Yesterday was the auction of one-year fairly weak state titles in Portugal. 
The state asset management was only 500 million from 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction. 
Nevertheless, interest rates fell by 30 basis points in Portugal across the curve, and reflected a perceptual changes in the markets after Trichet's words. 
In Ireland have been published the figures from the debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland. 
The sum is estimated at around 10000 million short-term and possible further 15000; there is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized. 
Although Ireland lost all its credibility, after the problem with the stress tests had not detected in July, the figures are acceptable in the context of the rescue plan and help to reduce the uncertainty. 
However, the government must next Tuesday received parliamentary approval for his new budget, as it still does not have the sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty. 
Angela Merkel has asked its discourse on the summit of heads of state and government on 14 December moderate. There is political unity in order to show that, together, we play the same score. 
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries of the Beethoven's ninth symphony. 
The Spanish government President yesterday's action plan to be adopted on Friday by the Council of Ministers. 
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reducing the public deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures and actions in the ears of investors such as four-year Vivaldis era. 
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges. 
Compared to February was the reaction of the government and the Bank of Spain quickly and convincingly, and we benefit from the surprise result. 
Today, there is a major auction of a three-year bond, which will benefit from the Trichet effect will be, so we are counting on a strong demand, remove all doubts about our debt-restructuring. 
For Spain, which would be getting an aid plan, a self-sacrifice. 
We would get liquidity, we would not need the Treasury has 40 billion euros, three times as much as in March, and the interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets closed without notice. 
Nevertheless, our strategy should be the motto of Caesar's wife: "now is not only the existence, but also of bogus." 
Only the courage that we create.
