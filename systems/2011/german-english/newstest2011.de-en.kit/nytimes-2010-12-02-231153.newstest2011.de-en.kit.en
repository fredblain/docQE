Prosecutor will not accuse Senator Ensign 
Prosecutors in the Justice Department have Senator John Ensign acquitted of the charges, after his dossier with a former Wahlhelferin and his attempt to give her husband a lobbying against him, the lawyers gave the senator announced on Wednesday. 
That decision ended the most serious legal charges against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada, up to the scandal, the nationwide for headlines and his career dealt a setback, he was seen as a possible presidential candidate the Republicans for 2012. 
As Senator Ensigns office announced that he was pleased with the verdict after the year-long investigation into "high." 
The ethics committee of the Senate, however, could still impose a Disziplarstrafe. 
According to the Ensigns lawyers they were hired by the Justice Department informed that the investigations against Senator Ensign and that no further charges in this matter. 
The Justice Ministry did not comment on the case. 
The judgment was for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice a surprise; they argue that there was sufficient evidence that Ensign has disregarded the lobbying ban. 
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, which were made public for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times, gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election agent, gave lucrative contracts to buy his silence about a dossier with Hamptons wife Cynthia. 
Cynthia Hampton was during an election campaign Ensigns as treasurer. 
Ensign was in contact with some political friends, in order to give Hampton work, according to the documents and interrogation he took over for them after the Hamptons attitude lobbying. 
Since Hampton recently was Ensigns election team, it was he was allowed to take a year not lobbying for his former employer, or the entire Senate. 
According to a statement by ethics experts breached the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton were chummy in the dossier against the so-called ban on the revolving door lobby Eurocracy. 
According to the published evidence "is apparently a consultation and the violation of the revolving door-statutes," Stanley fire, a Washington lawyer who specialises in defending clients who are in the sights of the government. 
While the Ministry of Justice has officially rejected the reasons for the decision in the Ensign-known case, said Mr. fire and other ethics lawyers, the department seem very careful in rather political charges after a large number of defeats by the media have been followed with great interest, including the decision last year that the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens because of misconduct by the prosecutor to drop. 
Prosecutors " are obviously scared, " said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the Association of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington " (an organisation which aims to combat corruption in parliament and government circles in the United States), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr. Ensign has brought before the courts. 
"In principle, this means that high-profile government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added. 
Paul Coggins, the main defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had on Monday received a telephone call to a prosecutor and another the next day, where he has been informed that the ministry will be no complaints against his clients. 
Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with prosecutors in order to convince them that the senator, as his office in a statement on Wednesday once again repeated, "acted in accordance with the law." 
Mr. Coggins refused, the legal arguments that he had made with prosecutors to explain in greater detail. 
"I am not likely to go into the details between the Ministry of Justice and me; it is only so much must be said: we believe the right decision," he said. 
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to discontinue the investigation because of a separate complaint with the ethics group, after the payment of $96.58000 of Mr. Ensigns parents to the Hamptons have violated federal election law. 
The Election Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift. 
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which for a long time the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton, thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyists work. 
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that, after the company Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist has brought Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he, the Interior Ministry for a cause, "anklopfe." 
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and other customers from Nevada, Allegiant Air, agreed to lunch and asked the transport minister to agree to a meeting in the name of the airline, after this Mr. Hampton had stopped for lobbying. 
Last year, for the first time information to the public on this affair came to apologize for Mr. Ensign to his constituents and his position was in the Senate, where he was in the ranking of the Republicans in fourth place. 
After many months, not more, Mr. Ensign told two weeks ago, reporters that he seek a third term in the Senate. 
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign can no longer be the target of police investigations, said his press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, hope the senator that the Ethics Commission to quickly follow the example of the Justice Department and einstelle his investigation. 
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
