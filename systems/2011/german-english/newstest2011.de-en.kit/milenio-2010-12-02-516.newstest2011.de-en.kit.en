The santistische strategist reached the first final as a coach in the ' Torneo Apertura 2002 when del Morelia had the reins in the hand with which he against Toluca 4-2 was a great defeat; later, in the ' Clausura 2003 ' he lost the crucial match, which he also with 3-1 against Rayados. 
Already, with Santos Laguna in the Torneo Bicentenario 2010 ', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had a setback, because the game at 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play was undecided, but the penalty he came with a 3-1 ahead and got two options, losing his title, but ultimately missed three of his players, 11, and the game on a 4-3. 
Rubén already had two Endspiele with the Diablos Rojos, one with Monterrey, his big rivals lost, so he would not be prosecuted again by the accident and free themselves from the evil magic, for the first time to celebrate a title, although he confirmed that for him the most important thing is the game itself.

To know that this series decided by a penalty shoot-out could be concerned about him, because he trusts his players: "you never want to shoot, we would like to finish in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is no alternative, and we must be prepared in the previous Tour we were prepared, but unfortunately we were the fate of a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the intense desire to keep title already in the hands of the left us something for this final, and we hope that this time it will not happen." 
It is in Romanso power, not only to his second champion and the first time to the glory of the title.
