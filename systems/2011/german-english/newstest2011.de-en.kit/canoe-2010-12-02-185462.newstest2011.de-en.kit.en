The new unit will be no unanimity 
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new, the unity in the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers are still calling for the creation of a public inquiry on the issue. 
Robert Dutil, minister of public security, claiming that this idea come not from yesterday: Quebec had already last January, the New York Department of Investigation consulted on this issue. 
The metropolis has for more than an 1870 unity against corruption. 
Nevertheless, the announcement by Wednesday, more than just a surprise. 
You have to say that this measure at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebecer police service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils has not been discussed in the slightest. 
There was also no doubt that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and a member of the Parti Québécois, this announcement in terms of public security as "out of the hat gezaubertes rabbit" and "on a deal will gebastelte qualified solution." 
Minister Dutil had in turn appealed to those who fear that the political power too much influence on the question of future unity. 
"You will see the result, when we will announce it," contesting it. 
"We are aware of this problem." 
According to Réjean Parenthood, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace conduct a public opinion poll. 
"The more M. Charest insists that we want to prevent the formation of this committee, the more people will like you and I think that he has something to hide," he said. 
"The only way to form a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," for its part, said Yves Boisvert, a senior lecturer in ethics and political systems in the ENA (staatl. High school to train senior administrative officer). 
In order to come out of this impasse, it proposes the Quebec, to give the financial audit control a specific mandate so that it can on corruption and collusion appropriate inquiries. 
"You should be able to extend the mandate of the auditing controls," he decided. 
He also believes that the Quebec could audit control the same power as commissioners, which would also allow people to commit to the statement. 
The formation of the unity is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government. 
The Quebec will also ask Ottawa to amend the criminal law, in order to be better suited to this type of crime. 
The demand comes from the public prosecutor of Operation Marteau, the justice minister, Jean-Marc Fournier has informed that the case law in the prosecution of this kind is not clear. 
Vic Toews, Minister of State for public safety, for its part, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, currently with certain amendments relating to this matter. 
During the operation Printemps in 2001, the groups of motorcycle police, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal law has not been revived. 
Ottawa has pushed through as a result, the law against gansterism.
