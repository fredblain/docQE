Euro, the ECB is forced to keep their purchases of government securities 
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB last year should be an opportunity for opportunities to show how we will come out of the crisis, or at least the orders of a large number of unconventional measures of monetary policy to announce the end of the year to its conclusion. 
The crisis of European government debt, the Central Bank in Frankfurt cannot afford without a doubt, even today, more than to be part of the tense situation in the European bond markets, so as not to cause the deterioration. 
The political cost would be far too high. 
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde had yesterday during a press conference the stance taken by the ECB, active role for the solution to the state budget welcomed Europe's debt. 
It has not dared to say whether it was of the opinion that the central bank could do even more, for example, by boosting its program purchases of government bonds. 
"I reserve my reasons for my European trade partners (...)." 
Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the ECB had the previous day in Brussels during his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament would not be very much an eloquent about his projects shown, but much more content to point out that the programme of purchases of government securities on the secondary market "continue" and that we will see in the Assembly on Thursday, "as the decisions." 
Only certainty: the ECB will leave its main interest rate unchanged at 1 percent, the lowest level since May 2009. 
In practice, have doubled the bond purchases the treasure chamber of the ECB last week at about 1.35 billion euros. 
And according to some traders leaks should have made them yesterday new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government securities. 
Overall, the central banks of the euro system since May 2010 purchases totalling 67 billion euros. 
Among the dealers is the anticipation of a further implementing the purchase rate never doubted (see page 29). 
The economists expect no remarkable change of course. 
If the bond transactions of more than three months ago have disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter in the unrestricted funds to create reserves to freigiebige type, and over a period of a week of up to three months. 
The economists are already prepared for the fact that this measure will extend for a couple of months. 
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will amend its programme on essential nature." 
"Otherwise, they would run the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," Michael Schubert suspects, economist of Commerzbank. 
"A progressive withdrawal for the course of the first quarter of 2011 provided for, it seems to me likely," anticipated, for its part, Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal. 
Oppenheim. 
In the field maintain their intervention in the market for government debt, "the ECB should such a purchase volume of bonds, which stimulate the sluggish market," Norbert Bräms adds. 
In view of the relevance of the exposure of European banks on the markets of the national debt in the euro zone, the central bank has no choice but to maintain their presence in the market. 
"They must take action at any cost to the Steller's lack of investors in the market and so, in order to prevent the premature enthusiasm on the most vulnerable states paid returns," bezeugte yesterday an important bonds holders. 
Because if interest rates start to soaring, the states would be even more prevented to reduce their debt, or even to stabilise. 
This is the price to protect the euro.
