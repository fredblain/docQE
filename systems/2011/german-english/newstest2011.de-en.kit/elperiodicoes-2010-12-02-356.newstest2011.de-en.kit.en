Sport and rule circumvention 
Tricks like the show inventiveness of Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax, but not the desire to avoid a sanction. 
The supposedly of two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) launched exclusion in the game on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League meant that much ink has been spilled, whether it is a unsportliche action or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA. 
As is well known, the two players lost a couple of minutes to go (her team had already won clearly) time and played several fouls, now that the referee they showed the second yellow card. 
In this way, and as the Real Madrid meet his group would be the two players the mandatory sanction in the next league game against Auxerre and without cards in the next game phase. 
Finally, punished the disciplinary Kommitee UEFA's coach of the club, Jose Mourinho, with two games and the players with different amounts of money. 
The provocation of a yellow card in these or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football. 
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in the sport following rules. 
Part of that have arisen debate is about the described case due to the fact that a team from the football club Real Madrid (in his anthem Edelmut claims and honour and on other occasions, his players had punished for similar incidents) played the main role, and to the drama by Mourinho, the more an episode on his long history as a theatralischer and provocative technician has added. 
In any case, the debate is a question of whether this is not explicitly banned by the statutes behavior contradicts the principle of sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a rule circumvention; in fact, this approach will abide by the statutes of the sport, but it would seem to make sense. 
In this matter should be investigated to the sporting spirit damage caused. 
The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that has not been compromised by this action, because it was not an aggressive game. 
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid offending players an unjustified will benefit from the opposing team, which did not happen. 
The paradox of the plot of the players of Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally do deceit or rule circumvention, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly, in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as striking as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. 
The players waited and taking the penalty. 
Another question is what kind of advantage the offender from the deliberate Fouls. 
Here, it should be stressed that the rival was either in a disadvantageous position still benefits for the erheischt feigned game, because the obvious result of this action was that their team had to continue to play with fewer players. 
It is not a useful strategy for the next game, because then the club does not have these players. 
The advantage is obvious, is that the players the game next phase of the Champions League without cards, which could threaten their participation in a future game. 
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree of uncertain advantage, because at some point, the team could also leave; it gives the players with this approach, a sanction and go in the second on cards cycle, in which they retire because of card accumulation with a card less than in the first round. 
So it is not clear whether it is really an advantage. 
In the end these are directed not against the spirit of sport, which also include strategic decisions in order to derive maximum benefit from the legislation. 
In this case, the players wanted to avoid any sanction (which actually would be a clear case of rule circumvention), they wanted to elect more when they go through this. 
They took a strategic decision to avoid without a penalty or to flee before her. 
Although the line is blurred between inventiveness and environment, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness. 
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the way the rule provoked transmission. 
The damage inflicted on the principles of the sport by these actions is less ethical than aesthetic Article
