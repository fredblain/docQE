The elderly home confirmed that the deaths are not due to "lack of action" 
The owners of the old house in Olot does not preclude their carers on eleven elderly people killed 
The leaders of the La Caritat elderly home in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which they had pointed out the damage the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurses, who during his work at least eleven elderly people, for which he was responsible, killed - had inflicted on the body. 
The head of the elderly home, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced that "la Caritat want to prosecute those responsible (for the deaths)," but "the law and to accept our liability are forcing us to the process and civil liability." 
The institution must not only accept a social prestige lost, because they are not in good time the criminal acts of the Pflegers had stated, but also now pay high compensation, which will be calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the victims. 
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime goes back to August 2009, and that since then, he was murdered. 
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the elderly at home - because he suspected that no doctor personally investigated the deceased, but the paperwork because of their age and illness have been conducted by telephone. 
The head of La verneinte Caritat flatly this point and declared that "lack of action has never been the cause of the incidents could be." 
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "there is no evidence in the legal dispute for negligent acts were a different person than the accused." 
The already as "angel of death" Getaufte confessed the other day 11 killings and declared that the first crimes committed on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later, the second to have murdered old lady. 
In this case he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime, in which he had a mixture of various sedatives. 
The head of La Caritat said that the access of staff to the drugs was difficult to control. 
The insulin syringes and the sedative cocktail of nurses in six of nine committed a crime in order to liberate the patients with the death of their suffering. 
But the results of laboratory tests to see whether Vila is lying and, in fact, for his first victims chose a less cruel death or whether he ausbrannte from within, by offering them verabreichte Bleichlauge, as he, according to the confession on three women he murdered between 12 and 17 October. 
In La Caritat listens to the testimony of the Pflegers no faith, not even as the number of gestandenen murders, which could be more, this attitude is justified, that very different statements Vila had made in court and that it makes no sense, his approach after eight successful murders to suddenly change. 
They say they did it for that reason, and to clarify the scope of these incidents of the judiciary.
