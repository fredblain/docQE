Bond for the takeover of eXcentris 
The Quebecer government, which has been invited by the Société Angus, as well as the company Parallèle to contribute financially to the takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris, explains with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive bond. 
The developers society Angus, as well as the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture for the adoption of the Daniel Langlois covered cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent this back to his normal cineastischen function, apparently did not receive what they have requested. 
The government has agreed to get involved in this matter, but on their own terms. 
Instead of the expected donation the Quebecer government offers a bond in less than initially expected, which could be a viable solution to advantageous conditions, at least according to the opinion from the state entnehmbaren rumour mill sources. 
An initial action plan and a request for a 12.8 million had already been last spring by the Quebec rejected the Bittgesuch since again overall, revised downwards. 
A proposal together with an action plan has already been the President of the "Société de développement of entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, Minister sent St-Pierre, who chairs the acts eXcentris. 
Several days ago he had provided her with a final report. 
The counter-proposal to the cabinet was sent to the SODEC, however, on Wednesday. 
Parallèle and Angus have until 31 December time to respond to this. 
In any event seems to be the premise of public donation really pushed aside. 
Let us remember that the Quebecer owners of cinema community and cinema complex against a direct government investment to support the takeover of eXcentris had revolted by made the argument that the Culture Minister have no financial support for real estate projects, which he does not have other cinemas. 
Several of the other participants in the market segment called, however, in contrast, substantial economic assistance. 
Cinema chief Daniel Langlois had reported after the self-financed construction of the cinema over ten years, with great difficulty, the authors of cinema in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exception from the treasury. 
The lack of cinemas showing independent films, in Montreal, more than obvious, and eXcentris knew his client on board. 
Société Angus, as well as the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, for its part, a privately financed Campagne, of which it is a total 700000 $ hope to boost the acquisition. 
Since the spring of 2009, only a single canvas continues to show films in eXcentris, Le Parallèle. 
The aim is to future purchasers, the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the demonstration of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois of "hommes et des dieux" to re-open. 
But Christian Yaccarini has not removed, the newspaper "Le Devoir" and ignored what he and his group of the revised downwards proposals that they have made.
