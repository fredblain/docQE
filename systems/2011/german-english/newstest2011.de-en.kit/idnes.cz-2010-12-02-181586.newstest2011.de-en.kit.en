More and more parents want human-monitoring equipment in order to have the kids under control 
There is growing fear for their own children and consider more and more parents to monitor them via GPS. 
The system, which was originally invented to searching for cars that can just as easily locate their people, which would be helpful in such cases, such as recently in spurlosen disappearance of the nine-year Anička Janatková. 
The device is currently about the same size as a packet of cigarettes, but soon it will be no bigger than a wristwatch. 
Many people, the case of the missing Anička into a funk and so they find ways of looking to protect their children. 
For the price of a deterioration of their privacy. 
"We are trying to say that this is by no means Herums pioneers, but an effective means to reduce the likelihood that it is a tragedy," Petr Pilin leads by society Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market. 
"I admit that it can come in individual cases to the abuse of such equipment, for example, if you are someone who is in the pocket, without knowing about it, but so far we have had no such case." 
"Most customers buy it really for reasons of safety," adds Pilin. 
In his opinion, the child should always know what purpose does the "box" and how they are used in an emergency. 
Child psychologist Dana Bočková points out, however, that a child, if there is such a thing may not wear it simply abandoned. 
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to certain things deliberately lose if they do not want to be controlled." 
"The mobile phones initially, awoke in the parents ' high expectations, but they can be just as easy to shut down, as this new surveillance equipment," says Mrs Bočková. 
In their view, is also questionable whether such a body in the event of an attack actually helps. 
"Planned kidnapping of kidnappers controlled virtually always, whether the child has any electronics, with which it could be located." 
"Today it is the cell phone." 
"If such monitoring devices were wider use, they would also seek them, since their sale certainly would be accompanied by massive advertising." 
"In these cases, the perpetrators are the police always one step ahead," says the psychologist. 
However, it acknowledges that similar devices in a sudden attack by a paedophile, can be very helpful. 
Roberta Čech society RC monitoring, according to the tracking services for both cars, as well as for offering people can help the existence of such an appliance when it immediately after the attack. 
"The device itself so that it is reclaiming the position at certain intervals." 
"Even if it were to be immediately destroyed, at least, is the last position of the person concerned." 
"With more expensive equipment is even a Neigungs integrated knife, that is, if you hinfällt and bewegungslos breaks down, the machine immediately sends a warning in the position," Mr Čech claims. 
In his view, similar services could also carry out smart phones with navigation, one need only einzuspielen special software. 
The problem with the current positioning equipment is that it either equipment in matchbox-size, similar to the supporters or smaller mobile phones. 
There is always the risk that they will lose. 
Mr Pilin by the Macro Weil, according to testing in the present devices that look like ordinary digital clocks. 
" This has the advantage of the possible attackers do not have to recognize that there is a monitoring and tracking equipment. 
"And he notes that only after a certain time in what the police have a head start," he adds. 
Regardless of the direction in which the development, to Armbändern or trailers, always used the same technology, such as the vehicle tracking. 
The combination of tracking function using the GPS system (as well as in Ms in the car) and the function of a mobile phone, which the current position.
