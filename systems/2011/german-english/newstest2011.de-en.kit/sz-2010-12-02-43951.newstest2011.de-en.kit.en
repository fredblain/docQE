Mysterious Erdarbeiten 
The International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria. 
But the country refuses to comment, still leaves it controls. 
About midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 1 fighter aircraft, a mysteriöses, cube shaped building in Syria. 
It is on the banks of the Euphrates, the next major city, 30 miles away, Dair el-Saur. 
Her name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, which Syria allegedly built with help from North Korea in the Quader, hidden in a valley, the lack of electricity. 
According to a briefing by the US secret overseas CIA service by the end of April 2008, which would also be under the name of the nearby town of el-normal Kibar reactor have been well-suited to produce plutonium, from which to build nuclear weapons. 
For others, it uses the technique is hardly out of the fifties. 
The CIA conducted a video presentation with blurred satellite images. 
They ignored by Computeranimation, where the components of the reactor should be before the destruction of a verkleinerte copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyong nuclear center. 
They also presented photographs, which show the building from the vicinity, or even the interior space. 
The reactor was briefly stood before the operation, it said, but has not yet been drawn up with fuel. 
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more than at the time, the mystery has been rather larger over time. 
Former US President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack was quite sure that Syria in el-Kibar was a nuclear reactor built, but little evidence that it was in the country, "an active nuclear weapons program." 
Some intelligence officers in Europe are rather more cautious and only speak of a ' alleged reactor, " even if the CIA's presentation of " plausible ." 
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. 
Asked how he was certain to have a nuclear reactor, said a senior UN diplomat only flat in the summer, the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions." 
The rubble of the alleged "unused military building" the Syrians eager to one side and the terrain planierten thoroughly. 
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium had been produced by people. 
In addition, the IAEA was likely to be a Member State satellite images of commercial providers from the period immediately after the attack, the more meaningful than those presented by the CIA. 
However, these recordings are not on the market, because of the unknown client, perhaps Israel, it has bought exclusively. 
The IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity. 
Syria has always claimed that never pursued a secret nuclear program or to build a reactor. 
The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, Damascus said. 
But the IAEA has after analysis of the particles back as unlikely. 
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss it, as well as on the satellite images. 
It also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the wreckage of the bombed-out building. 
But Israel also stony silence. 
"We never comment on that," recently reaffirmed the incumbent at the time of the attack, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position. 
It has been dragging on the investigation of the case in vain since June 2008 and "increasingly is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority," a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, admits there is, after all, a serious breach of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the IAEA. 
As a key to progress in the investigation, the IAEA appears to be three other facilities "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor still exist, and other than this. 
The inspectors have not revealed what plants are, or what they are or what they appear to be suspicious. 
According to the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, they will be called the IAEA internally as Marj el-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn, are derived from nearby towns. 
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and on satellite images of a building complex located in Masyaf, which is most likely to be one of the suspicious objects. 
It is probably in or next to a military base, this is precisely what justification, Syria denied the IAEA access to the three places. 
In Vienna, it is feared the Syrians a fishing expedition, the IAEA vorgeschickt by the United States will auszuspähen military installations. 
Because of the nuclear detectives were carefully through a tip of the US intelligence services to the facilities. 
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the Quader on Euphrates material and was moved. 
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "in connection with the fuel production." 
There is, however, "no evidence of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes that are necessary to build nuclear weapons. 
The type of reactor is enriched with uranium, which is not. 
But where the uranium could have come from and where it later separated the plutonium for the bomb should be on these key issues, there are plausible assumptions. 
It is also unclear whether the debris that could pose a valuable clues to the three places were stored. 
As if the hundreds of truck loads of disappeared, no one wants to have information about where the debris. 
Only a few kilometers from el-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates located al-Tibni salt mine, which has looked into Syria in 1998 on their suitability as storage for radioactive waste, the IAEA is regarded as unlikely. 
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had it in a recent analysis of satellite images for the venerable magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor. 
Recordings from the orbit, however, that Syria had requested the three suspicious places Erdarbeiten carried and large containers, after the IAEA access. 
This may be coincidence, but it has hardly helped to dispel the suspicion. 
Moreover, they say in diplomatic circles, the IAEA have spent many months, a plan to develop for inspections there, it should allow Syria to maintain any military secrets alone, the tape shows how great is the interest of the inspectors. 
Meanwhile, Damascus also bügelte this proposal. 
Had reassured Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, therefore there is no high urgency, for instance, US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a couple of months ago, so-called special inspections into the game, one of the harshest means the Vienna nuclear authority to impose controls. 
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, would have to propose these inspections, has been "an option for which I am open in the future," but he hesitates. 
It is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it needs for a majority of the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented are anything but eager for an escalation. 
On the other hand, as a diplomat to bear in mind: "what if they find in the end nothing?"
