China has maintained its goals to reduce greenhouse gases 
The Chinese representative said at the COP16, his country had made huge efforts to reduce carbon footprints and it would maintain its offer, by 2020, 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases. 
China keeps its offer the emission of greenhouse gases by 2020 to reduce by 40-45 percent, assured Su Wei, the representative of this country on the COP16. 
In his first public appearance at the 16th World of the United Nations climate summit (§C§O§P§1§6§) Su Wei said that his country had made huge efforts to reduce carbon footprints and the conversion of its industry. 
He said that in the last four years his country $245 million was invested in order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. 
On the other hand, he said that China would not change its targets, but to cooperate with the international community on this issue. 
He said that China's strategy on climate change in unterteile four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support of pilot programs. 
In all aspects, we have made progress, including the adoption of a new energy bill last year that the targets for the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases, he said. 
On the other hand, he pointed out that the authorities in China, the states with those of the central government and the local authorities had worked together in order to achieve the targets for saving energy, effective use of energy and the reduction of emissions. 
In addition, he said, have already been some multi-year plans launched or completed, both those who were funded by the Chinese government, as well as those who received money from other countries. 
For example, he referred to the program to Wirksamen use of energy, which was introduced in the last five years, and investment of the United Nations (UN), the government had received and from private hands. 
It also runs a project at the provincial level to climate change, another for the exchange of traditional incandescent light bulbs by Energiesparbirnen and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said. 
Martin Krol, scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts were much greater than commonly believed. 
It showed that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China six plenary tonnes per person, while in the United States were 100 tonnes, China is on a nine per cent overall contribution to environmental pollution. 
It also makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use, and the energy efficiency has increased by 20 percent in the last five years, and by the year 2020 would be a further, he said.
