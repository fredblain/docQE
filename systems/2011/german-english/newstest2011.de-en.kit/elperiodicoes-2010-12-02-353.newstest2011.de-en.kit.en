Zapatero and the red line of Germany 
Berlin has opted for keeping the euro, but at the same time set up conditions for the whole of the European Union. 
The tension on the markets have triggered a dual response from the government. 
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero presented new adaptation measures, starting with the tax reductions for small- and micro-enterprises, regulation of the firms or the lifting of the 426 euro assistance for the unemployed, no unemployment benefits, to the privatisation of 49 percent from AENA, the management of the Barajas airport and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery. 
On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez was the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible, the current crisis. 
As these events are to understand? 
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their public relations. 
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro. 
In Germany, is a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future with the maintenance of the ancient traditions of most of its partners. 
Given the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis spekuliern. 
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area. 
The second: the re-introduction of the German mark - although that is currently more sounds like science fiction, supported by a large section of public opinion, around 50 percent of the population. 
The third: a review of the euro in accordance with German proposals, which means: more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries that are invading the targets; möglichereweise the default of some countries, as well as the extension of the potential costs of adaptation measures in the private sector. 
The German position is clear and it is been going on for some time, so now there are no excuses. 
Start by 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government is a constitutional reform drew from the English in order to prevent this from 2016. 
It was the first signs of the drifting between what Germany is necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. 
The second sign of the Central European country, as Merkel postponed the decision to save Greece's painful. 
At the time was heavily criticised, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely opposed to a rescue of Greece. 
Finally, Merkel in the last few days of October anew with a clear position, it calls for a reform of the European Union's agreement to allow for the rescue of a country and at the same time, private lenders to commit to a share of the costs. 
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as the Irish crisis and following. 
But their proposal, if a little sweetened, was adopted in the next few months we will be in the reform of the European Union, which should allow these measures from 2013. 
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross. 
It says all that - even if unpopular measures must now be taken, there will be as of that date, the old workings of the euro. 
In 2013, will be the birth year of a new monetary area, in which the offending countries will be severely punished, can be forced to declare default and in this case, the private sector must shoulder some of the costs. 
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard path of growth, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improve productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances. 
The alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it was led by Spain in boom times, simply will not be tolerated. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would do a bad thing, not to understand it. 
It is not just a question of the government deficit to three percent by the year 2013 runterzufahren. 
The demands are much harder. 
And the worst thing we could do under these circumstances, is to cheat. 
I hope that the current turbulence in more calm. 
And that we take advantage of the opportunities offered by the spring of 2013. 
It seems that Zapatero has taken this so well, and its dual announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that, despite the criticism of Merkel's idea to build his own house in order in the their way. 
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not seem that it would change anything. 
Among the gestopften euro area left contemplating possibilities is that we are with little serious countries should not be ruled out. 
In this case, Germany could still tell us, we have been warned.
