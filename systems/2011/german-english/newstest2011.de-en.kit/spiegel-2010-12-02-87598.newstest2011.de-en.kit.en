Hell, warriors. 
Splatter fits on the art of cinema? 
The director Nicolas Winding Refn is testing with his fighter's epic poem "Valhalla over there Rising" old genre-borders. 
In what audience may have thought the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn, when he "Valhalla over there has turned Rising"? 
A captured Vikings-warriors with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) are exempt from its Peinigern and sets with almost superhuman forces his opponents ranks way, sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero like rough killing methods and its enemies into the Gedärme snaps from the vibrant limb, if he has bad-tempered. 
On the other hand, Einauge says, as he will, in fact, the whole film about a word, and the other characters are no more than about one or two sentences or a few agonizing death scream. 
Otherwise, keep quiet and in the gruselig beautiful hill geschwelgt landscape of Scotland, the Vikings world of about a thousand years, provides the backdrop. 
Ideal for more adult Cineasten with interest for Existentialismus and very calm camera journeys. 
Fine, if a film has several target groups, it is a shame, if they are mutually exclusive. 
Director Winding Refn for his wild and gestylten drug dealers-trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but refuses stoically, his works with a little more humor to the mainstream, or a little less accessible brutality the Arthouse. 
Most of the art of cinema-friends will be deterred from around spritzenden brain mass and the Gedärmen. 
The action-fans at the latest, then die from boredom, if Einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem; and an eternity in doldrums and fog, before the team arrives in America and there is silent. 
No wonder, then, that "Valhalla over there Rising" in Germany has found no cinema-distribution and now only has appeared on DVD. 
This is particularly due to the magnificent images of a shame, but also because the unpretentious until blood turgid facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves attention. 
In this film is not about dialogue or a stringent action, it is all atmosphere, a film had fever dream. 
And there is no escape for the viewer. 
Refn takes him barely a moment of relaxation and undertakes him with his icy images and the dark Trance-type (Sound Track very slowly to the cut, but especially with the incredible hatred of him from the hearts of the characters. 
Only a small boy blonder, faithful to the Einauge is preserved something like innocence, everyone else will be driven by anger. 
Most of all the einäugige hero, whose motives are never explained, but for enemies and temporary allies will at some point the warriors from hell, perhaps even to the ambassadors of the devil. 
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the already Verdorbenen. 
"Valhalla over there Rising" is a puzzling film that you can hate and admire the Ärgern, Aufregen and astonishment. 
An experience.
