The army has so many Zündschnüre that the Czech Republic could umwickeln but you only have two years 
The Czech army has bought Zündschnüre 445 kilometers, setting off explosives. 
Earlier in the year, the Ministry of Defence had powder 224 km string delivered to the army camp. 
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have ausgesorgt for 225 years. 
The only problem is the durability of the Zündschnüre - two of them, but no more than four years. 
The army bought the Zündschnüre by the Company STV Group a.s., for a mere 40 million kroner. 
In his justification for the purchase of this huge amount of ammunition string said the General Staff MF DNES, the soldiers would be a year of a powder 60 kilometres consume string. 
According to the research of Armeepyrotechnikern MF DNES raised on shows from this indication that the whole army should each year, a very intensive pyrotechnic training course, from all the generals and officers of the army commandos, to the secretaries and cleaners. 
Defence minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded. 
Only then could the remarkable annual consumption of spirits 60 kilometres put together reasonably justified. 
The length is, incidentally, 25000 Detonationen. 
But even so this army would be enough stocks for more than ten years. 
But if the old rule of experts is that each new professional training soldiers ammunition two metres string is quite sufficient, then the army has also this Neueinkäufe, from the point of view of the increased needs of a pioneering special units, soothing supply for 225 years already mentioned. 
It complained of the soldiers Schnelleinsatzbrigade recently when Defence Minister Vondra, they had almost no cartridges for more small arms, so that register the lack of resources are severely restricted. 
The lack of wearing. 
"I am not a why they are such huge Zündschnüre buy from us." 
But it is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need it. " 
"For us, the army is a good customer, we would like as dealers as far as possible," says marketing manager of STV Group Děcký Jan. 
Jan Pejšek, Department of Defense spokesman justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of powder string so that the army would have been so for at least 10 years with this "ammunition." 
Jan Děcký of STV Group, however, is only a four-year use of the term Zündschnüre and police and Armeepyrotechniker only two years. 
"With perfect storage are probably also mentioned four years possible," one of them, but wants to remain nameless, not as a soldier accused of criticism of the army. 
The utility long after any ammunition must be tested thoroughly, whether it is reliable and not endanger the lives of the soldiers. 
These tests are not in vain, but cost more money. 
Another argument of the Defense Department is the volume discount for a powder 445 kilometres of string. 
"They cost 60 percent less than last year's supply of 244 miles," says spokesman Pejšek the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence. 
Only by way of comparison, the annual consumption of spirits from the Pyrotechnikern police, the shells from World War II or the Soviet liquidate brother army, already exceeds some years barely 1500 metres. 
And the police only such quantities of the ammunition they use before the end of the use of the long term. 
The security because of the Pyrotechniker, also considers the possibility of more modern flexible purchases and therefore more reliable Zündschnüre open. 
The Ministry of Defence has already huge problems with the winding-up of tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the 222-member thousand Czechoslovak People's army was preparing its campaign on the Rhine. 
According to the Pyrotechnikern, which has bought MF DNES raised the Czech armed forces in a few years ago, the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old Zündschnüre today as "favourable."
