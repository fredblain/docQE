Dupont partly comforting 
The Quebecer radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered before the Canadian board for broadcasting standards (CCNR) because of his controversial statements on social welfare and Haitians as well as because of his ausfälligen way of talking about a partial setback. 
The CCNR believes, M. Dupont and CHOI 98.1 FM team would have the right to their own opinion, but certain statements "inaccurate information about the social welfare and unjustified negative depictions of the Haitians, and also contain such a ungehobelte speech, which is not appropriate for the daytime broadcast programmes." 
The board also had schlußgefolgert that a discussion about suicide, which includes the dissemination of the names of two people who have committed suicide, violates the code of the radio transmission. 
The CCNR had several complaints relating to the comments made during the period between 2008 and 2010 broadcast programmes. 
The first injunction was filed as a result of a complaint of "front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Quebec." 
The activist organization had complained that the amounts listed in the program are imprecise. 
The hosts should have much more solid than give misleading information. 
On the issue of suicide Limbaugh Stéphane Dupont had said that the suicide was an expression of cowardice. 
The majority of the supervisory board members had concluded that the message conveyed is that suicide is not be seen as a solution of life crises. 
"The majority of the supervisory board takes into account the fact that the consequences of the" Dupont le midi "a delicate issue in families had touched on fair and appropriate way." 
So it was with no censure against his person. 
The last sticking point was the statements, which are related to the earthquake in Haiti. 
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had a media provided effective argument, that a lot of reactions. 
The CHOI-Limbaugh had not been donated for the benefit of the Haiti-aid, because we did not know with certainty whether the truly needy would receive the money donations. 
The board is of the opinion that these comments were not abusive nature, their cumulative effect, however, presenting an unjustified negative portrayal of the Haitians. 
"I already have my three-day Suspendierungs abgebüßt sentence in this matter." 
"My file is jungfräulich for one and a half years," the presenter said. 
In denounces all decisions of the board of the spread of a ungehobelten language. 
In all cases the CHOI-FM radio announcer "beyond its obligations." 
The consequences for the radio stations, among other things, to give its decisions unique during prime time viewing within a period of three days, are slightly.
