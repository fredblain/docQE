Métro Grand Paris: first financial vignettes 
Since the debate about the modernization of transport to the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it is raining billion. 
At least in the discussions. 
You call this, in particular the 23 billion for the metro Grand Paris in memory, to be built by the Société du Grand Paris. 
At the start of construction of the SGP MEPs to launch, has declared the state a capital $4 billion. 
In the theoretical scheme that is the sum that would allow the SGP MEPs then to give the markets a portion of the financial sum on her two-fold. 
Today it is finally come to first projections. 
The supplementary budget by 2010, looked through this morning by the Finance Commission of the National Assembly, which includes measures to raise the first part of this money. 
There is two ways: the creation of a special tax to Erschließund and higher taxation of the offices on the Ile de France. 
The former, one person's Article 15 of the draft law, "to the benefit of the public-service channel Société du Grand Paris." 
This is a figure: "the product of this tax amounting to 117 million euros per year." 
Zweitere is an overhaul of the existing corporate tax: "in order to upgrade them, in order to increase its resulting product and to entrust this increase of Société du Grand Paris." 
How much that would bring? 
A mystery. 
This amount is not in the text. 
Of the 4 billion is far away. 
"It is said that the fiscal resources to the 4 billion euros of capital allocation, which will be paid by the state and the Société du Grand to Paris and to be done on the project," according to the explanatory statement. 
The SGP MEPs will take place this system not offensive. 
"Since the moment in which it recorded revenue (the two taxes, d.R.), we can design over three years, and only then will draw from the 4 billion," will said. 
"This will be noted in the budget and gradually withdrawn." 
The SGP MEPs to note that 2013 started will be 4 billion for the budget in 2014. 
This measure, the 4 billion promised they will be looking for a long time yet, runs the risk of a very troubled, parliamentary debate. 
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
