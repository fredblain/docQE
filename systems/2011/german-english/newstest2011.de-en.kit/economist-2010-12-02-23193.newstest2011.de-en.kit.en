An electoral defeat 
No one had expected that the elections in Haiti on 28 November would be perfect. 
But the facts, the fears of election workers who rushed to the troubled country to help. 
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast, ballot papers in the Rinnstein, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problem. 
Polling stations opened with long hours late. 
Many Haitians, many of them by the earthquake in January had become homeless, sailed off in search of a choice. 
Some were finally on. 
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged tops, required because of alleged fraud, the lifting of the election results. 
Across the country, there was part of violent protests. 
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, the election as "quite good in many ways." 
According to a cautious statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "these irregularities, so serious they may be, the process does not necessarily invalid." 
In other words, the show goes on. 
The electoral authority, which is supposedly the unpopular outgoing president René Préval and his candidate, Jew Célestin, is obliged to announce the preliminary results on 7 December. 
The expected runoff is scheduled for January. 
There is still hope in the election. 
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Mart Elly and the former First Lady-Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial annulling a complaint. 
If Célestin Jew, with voters have little or no support from the Wahlberhörde declared the winner of the runoff, it could lead to problems. 
Because of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the victims of the earthquake was still living in tents, fearing a low turnout. 
On election day, many Haitians hindered by a lack of organisation of the vote. 
Shortly before the election the beginning were approximately 250000 cards, which are needed for the election, has not yet distributed. 
There is a lot at stake. 
The donor countries consider a legitimate government is recognized as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti. 
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
