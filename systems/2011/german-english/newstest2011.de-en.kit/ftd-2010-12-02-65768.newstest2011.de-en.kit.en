Ogoniland is torched 
The water in the rivers is ölbraun, it looks very much as at the pump: billions of litres of crude oil spills have destroyed nature in Ogoniland in Nigeria. 
The people live by theft, corruption and illegal Ölkochen. 
Celestine Akpobari thinks it is a good thing. 
"Haunts you," the Ökoaktivist reassured journalists: "you will still have enough oily slime before the lens." 
The 37-year-old Nigerian has been following the attempt, a watenden boys until the breast in the water with the abzulichten Schlieren surround him: in the regenbogenfarbenen water glamour the scene almost pretty. 
Under the surface brown crude oil clears system, is not to be seen. 
Previously, they have collected buckets, shrimp, Esther told Badom on the shores of Bodo-Jetty River. 
In the meantime, the lazy river waters was completely dead. 
Five years ago, poured from a geborstenen pipeline tons of crude oil in the vast wetland. 
Fishermen from the nearby city Bodo now to row six hours to get into fish containing waters: in the heart of the Niger Delta remote Ogoniland is regarded as one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world. 
On the trip by the criss-crossed by along mangrove swamps is due the full extent of the devastation. 
Instead of shedding water wühlt brown the motor boat was on, who is his hand into the water, ölige finger. 
The roots of the mangrove grown stand out as black Lakritzstangen out of the ground, sometimes sad their Wedel alienation from palm trees. 
Bird flocks, as usual in wetlands are meted out: as soon as the foreign Border remains silent, is spreading in the as a former riechenden petrol station gespenstische rest from paradise. 
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari gloomy: "we live in constant danger to health." 
The war is appropriate comparison. 
The settlement of the Ogoni region is a disputed battlefield for decades: here were more than 60 years ago, the first Explorateure from a Europe that is organized in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, the first resistance here of the Shell company had to stop its production in 1993, because it is too dangerous for its Ölarbeiter. 
Even today, the company has refused to return to Ogoniland, while across the delta region of the three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5000 drilling sources and pipelines 7000 miles every day, more than two million barrels of black gold will be pumped to the oil fields are bare in Ogoniland, is too unstable to the company. 
Every few hundred metres stählerne stand out Gestelle as fanciful sculptures from the water: "Christian grown" to be called the heads of the boreholes far too zärtlich. 
They are up to 50 years old, most of korrodiert to the core. 
Again and again, such a breche drilling head, says Akpobari, then rinne a constant flow of crude oil into the water. 
More than two billion litres, according to estimates by experts in 50 years has flowed into the ecosystem of the Delta: year after year, the amount of oil in the shipwreck of the super-tanker, "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago entered into the sea off Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind. 
Who is going for the ongoing eco-MCA is to blame, arguing about. 
While the Shell company sabotage and organized Öldiebstahl for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see berstende drilling heads and lecke pipelines as the main culprit. 
Shell in Nigeria attach much lower safety standards than usual in the world, accused the US scientists Richard Steiner, the corporation before 2008: the rate of defects in the pipes was "many times higher than elsewhere." 
In a place that looks from a distance as an abandoned, ölverschmierte workshop in the open air, are appearing from the mangrove characters: they are naked cluster and up to the neck ölverschmiert. 
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly with tubes, partly arbitrary scattered on the site to identify future has come a fire: an illegal small refinery. 
The barrels of crude oil on the fire several hours of heated, Michael said, the head of the group. 
First petrol through the pipes in the reception pot, then spits at the end of the leadership of kerosene and diesel, finally. 
So Michael and produce four staff on a daily basis up to four barrels of diesel à 300 litres, "brings us the 34000 Naira," around 22 dollars. 
The delta residents use the chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil country in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Nigeria only has a single refinery. 
The ridiculously low price of diesel oil with barely 40 euro cents per litre can undercut the illegal Kocher: because their commodity getting it for free. 
He comes from, "Bunkerern" that tap into the pipeline network across Ogoniland: in this way, go to the country, according to experts in the entire Niger Delta at least 16 million litres per day of crude oil. 
Only a tiny part of the provisional between stored raw material, however, veredelt illegally: fill the lion's share of organised criminal networks, which also includes politicians and senior military officers in tankers and bestow gifts on the world market. 
The debate, whether the environmental disaster is more of the activities of the population or the lax production methods, the activist Akpobari for purely academic. 
"The oil companies were not as invaders and they would have destroyed the livelihoods of fishermen not so thoroughly, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries." 
Now is the relationship of the Ogoni people, above all, however, to Shell destroyed so that only a withdrawal of the group in question would be: "perhaps yes, other nationalities as the Chinese as better." 
Because Michael is nervous. 
"High time that it disappears," says the muskulöse Ölmann. 
"Every minute, the soldiers." 
The illegal Ölveredler caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they could not arrest, but a painful slush money. 
The soldiers, mainly coming from the country's north, as all Nigerians, benefit from the commodity. 
"This damn stuff has brought our country in every respect to the dog," says Akpobari.
