An opinion poll, the cleaning up nonsensical rules 
The opinion poll at the absurdity of the Year ' is the fourth time part of the business competition. 
Some nonsensical rules managed to create in the world. 
The dubious winners of next year's round of the poll "avancierte absurdity of the year," the duty to create documents to authorities, the online are available. 
For instance, more than a third of not quite four thousand votes emitting entrepreneurs. 
The Social Security administration demanded a paper extract from the trade register, even if the officials would have access by two mouse clicks. 
Thanks to the opinion poll, this has changed. 
"The Czech social security administration will in future be in control of social insurance payers no more extracts from the commercial register demand," the spokeswoman of ČSSZ Jana Buraňová. 
The purpose of the opinion poll ' absurdity of the year, ' it is, all the rules and orders under the microscope, to meet the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and lift the nonsensical. 
This is already this year, for the fourth time part of a business competition, which will be hosted by the tsch. Economic newspaper (HN) and in the growing public popularity. 
If last year to the three thousand people involved in the vote, there were four in this millennium. 
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations, which only serve to hamper business activity. 
"What, for example, the number of income tax forms, we will take a front rank in the world," said Karel Havlíček by the association of small and medium-size companies and businesspeople in the Czech Republic. 
The simplification of business activity in the last few years the proclaimed goal of all governments. 
Compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic but hardly improved. 
According to the World Bank is the Czech Republic in relation to the company's 74. Conditions, compared with the previous year, a worse placement for eight seats. 
The competition of the year absurdity was first declared in years and plays every year after the same scenario. 
Everyone from April until the drafting of the final competition at the end of September, administrative and bureaucratic nonsense. 
To register the website address www.firmaroku.cz. after seeking the organisers of the competition, seven candidates for the "anti-price" and the public Internet websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz vote. 
It is the triumph of absurdity that gets the most votes. 
For this year's poll has already been more than a hundred, or more precisely 105 registered senseless rules and orders. 
The clues are not only of entrepreneurs, but also by professional associations and journalists. 
Among the nominated "Fina lists" of competition, for example, have provisions that maintenance vehicles on highways and expressways tolls to pay or that entrepreneurs with 20 staff, two offices and two toilets vorrichten every two years. 
The list of this year's "seven" is published in the pages of the competition. 
The designation of each competition at the beginning of November on the Prague Wenzels place is part of a Happenings, which regularly also figures in the political and public life. 
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-size companies and businesspeople of Tsch. Republic and Petr Kužel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce Tsch. Republic at the height of the competition with the game. 
"Where the state employers stifling, there can be no real economic recovery, so it is my goal, to lift every year at least 30 paragraphs, which today are the entrepreneurs unnecessarily complicate their ventures," said Martin Kocourek, the minister for industry and trade. 
The efforts to create nonsensical orders from the world, show effect. 
In 2007 the rankled people most of the entrepreneurs imposed duty to notify the Gewerbeamt at the place of its permanent factory three days in advance, the notion of an exhibition to an exhibition or Kirmes. 
This requirement has been lifted by a series of commercial law. 
The duty of 2007, the second largest number of votes received, the obligation to notify the state missions by workers in up to 30 days - has been abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card." 
And all good things come in threes. 
The absurdity of 2009 was elected to the regulation, which it imposed physiotherapists, speaking a bedroom mirror, a refrigerator and two people to have scales. 
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year, the refrigerator duty fell away.
