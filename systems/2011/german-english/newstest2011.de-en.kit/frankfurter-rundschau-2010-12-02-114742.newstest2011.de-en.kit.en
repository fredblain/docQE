Controllers in the twilight zone 
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa was infiltrated by the Genpflanzen experimental industry. 
Now this accusation the biotechnology group of experts test as the independent Institute for understands the impact of biotechnology. 
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have been well documented," said biotech chief test Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich. 
The head of the Efsa-group of experts on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert had for years, the lobbyists ' association Ilsi under contract. 
The is paid by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer. 
Kuiper was instrumental in the Efsa-test requirements for Genpflanzen worked and in a clear conflict of interest, Then criticized. 
The Efsa rules are equal sales, with the Ilsi position papers and thus are the hallmark of the industry, which is to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma. 
It was the second time that test a biotechnology interest bem√§ngle collision. 
It is a high-level Efsa manager recently without conditions or transitional period for the Swiss agricultural company Syngenta, and thus have changed sides. 
The German Central radio (MDR) had recently personal links between kontrollierender unveiled EU authority and industrial lobby, which has made the environment Office as well as EU parliamentarians sit up and take notice. 
The Efsa can, however, see no conflict of interest. 
We will take every serious data back to the industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, it says in a statement. 
The experts who work for Efsa, we do not demand that they do not have any contacts with the industry. 
They would have to disclose this, however. 
Kuiper gives his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States. 
This describes himself as a neutral forum for experts from academia, industry and politics, among other things, the risk assessment for biotechnology without lobby. 
In the case of independent experts like Then that genetically modified crops currently be allowed without any feeding of animals and the reaction of Genpflanzen shall not tested to environmental influences. 
"We want to know what is, for example, genetically-modified maize on the field," said Then. 
Current practice, it is just an isolated proteins, but not the whole Genpflanze to test what am now providing no reliable results. 
"If you are not the risks of addiction, how will they find?" Asks Then and point an accusing finger. 
It also provides for Angelika Hilbeck. 
The research scientist since 1994 in the engineering and is currently at the Technical University of Zurich. 
Try the industry in this area, as in the United States now in Europe is becoming more and more critical to influence or to discredit scientists. 
There is so little researchers who were not with corporations. 
For business-critical studies would not usually published. 
"The industry controls the security research," Hilbeck said.
