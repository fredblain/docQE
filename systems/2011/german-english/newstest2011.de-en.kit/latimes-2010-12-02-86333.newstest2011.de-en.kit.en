Arsenic-resistant microbe could enable new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere 
The discovery of an alien variety of bacteria, which can live on arsenic, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere. 
Although scientists here this unusual bacterium discovered on Earth, in their view, it is a sign that a life without so far as vital elements deemed possible. 
"This organism has two options." 
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." 
"It makes for a very particular reason, although it is almost a kind of ' foreign ' way of life," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science. 
So far, there have been six main elements as vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous and sulphur. 
But as the researchers found that the bacterium is growing in the Californian mono Lake even further when it replaced phosphorus by arsenic. 
"One wonders what else is possible," said the co-author of the report, Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University. 
The discovery is an important step in the search for au√üerirdischem lives, since scientists must recognize life and forms, Anbar. 
The study deals with microbes that have been found on Earth. 
The announcement of a press conference in which no details were made known to the discovery, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report of the discovery could no irdischen life. 
This is not the case. 
The discovery "shows that in other planet systems organisms with the help of other elements of biochemical processes can set in motion, and that the ' standard ' elements that we think are absolutely vital, not necessarily," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute held University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. 
Cockel was not part of the research teams. 
"This work is a first, because it shows that in fundamental biochemical processes and structures an element can be replaced by another," added Cockell. 
This discovery was not accidental. 
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA Astrobiologischen Institute, who led the study, chose the mono Lake because of high arsenic content. 
Because arsenic and phosphorus chemically identical, they thought that microbes are exposed to both, might be able to replace an element from the other. 
"The toxicity of the Arsens is based largely on the fact that it is chemically similar to phosphorus." 
"It is difficult for the organisms to distinguish one element from the other." 
"But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It in our biochemisches system, where almost everything covered," said Anbar. 
The researchers, the bacterium GFAJ-1 rising from arsenic concentration; it fit in and grew up. 
The microbe is growing more phosphorus, but it can also survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based life form can happen, of course, either on the Earth or another planet or moon, on the arsenic occurs more frequently. 
According to Jamie S. Foster, Dozentin for micro-biology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new, but so far there was no functioning example. 
Arsenic was more common in the early Erdjahren, she says, is why science is the assumption that early life forms have been used. 
"It is reason to believe that life may have developed differently than in the early geologically important period," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team. 
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National health authorities.
