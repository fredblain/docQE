Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9 
With the results of 28 November could be the PP in the cities Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona play a crucial role 
After the major voices and Members of growth in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking forward to the parliamentary elections - or not, their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes, the party in these elections, normally is twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia. 
It was the Catalan Popular Party 610473 votes in the parliamentary elections of 2008, while the paragraph in the regional elections in 2006, only 316222. 
Last Sunday, the PPC 384091 votes. 
If this rising trend - the result of the diversion of the voices of the PSC share and the capture of the PP electorate - should continue, analysts forecast the PP, in the parliamentary elections, the PPC 8 could rise to 12 members of Congress, while also CiU four (it now has 10) to win and the PSC would at least 9 Members (25). 
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.

Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC, the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona in which the Socialists reach a majority either on its traditional allies (ERC and ICV) can lose. 
After the Republican debacle, it is not absurd that this party will lose its representation on the town council is Barcelona, in which she 5% of the votes ought to be. 
The PP, however, recorded an increase in their votes in the four provincial capitals and the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona. 
The nationalists are convinced that the key role to play in Tarragonas swing to where they were before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP government. 
En Lérida the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC, the mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign, they met several times. 
In other key locations, such as in Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party has seen a significant increase.
