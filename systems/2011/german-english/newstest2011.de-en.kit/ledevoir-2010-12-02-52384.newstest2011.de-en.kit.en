450 million in contracts without a tender 
Hydro-Quebec has approved by mutual agreement project planning firms 450 million dollars in contracts for the hydropower project East Main-1 A-Sarcelle-Rupert. 
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium made up of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important part: the project led to a total of 295 million dollars without a tender. 
The consortium, known as "Énergie gérance," 2004 was a corollary of the decision by hydro-Quebec, the private sector of their responsibility to this important hydroelectric project to the tune of a sum of 5 billion dollars. 
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium ergatterte "Énergie gérance" the lucrative contract, without a public tender. 
For the Parti Québécois is resorting to business consortiums constitute a serious ethical problem that evokes the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung, as well as an increase in prices. 
"This is a new way to a conspiracy and refuted the competition." 
"This means that instead of conventional games instead of secret way now in an open way," said yesterday Sylvain Simard, a member of the PQ, at the press conference. 
Early in the morning had Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems hard to understand how the public's interest in this way can be served. 
Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau had acted in the afternoon responded by vehemently deny that this treaty is a stitch-up. 
"I remain faithful to my line," she lashed out by reinforced the PQ was "dishonest" and "their lack of toughness." 
She said that it was "the least" that the PQ will apologize. 
The model of the consortium is standard practice in the world. 
It is usually a time of such temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to combine their expertise on a requirement in a tender for a complex project. 
The project is "East Main," a high level Komplexitäts relating to its work on a scale. 
The construction techniques is under way and should be established by 2012. 
However, the contract was awarded without competition had taken place; it had already been negotiations. 
Moreover, the model of the consortium in Quebec, with relatively simple projects no longer an exception. 
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, which is in the field of applied model, a civil engineer and advisory services to the consortium the subject of government investigations. 
A brief overflying the Quebecer company registry, it allows us to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be more consistent length. 
In this way, for example, the Dessau company in partnership with the majority of its key competitors, including CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult count. 
Any link, and there are several dozen, at one and the same legal person back to Dessau. 
With regard to the consortium "Énergie gérance," Minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special labor dynamics and hydro-Quebec this fact since the 1970s, in a special account pays." 
Réal Laporte, the major employer of Société d énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ) has issued a statement that the nose has rümpfen on the fact that the Treaty on the project management after agreement has been approved. 
"If you make a call for tenders and there are very few applicants, your prices will soar." 
"You have two options: either you nimmst people who find themselves in this Mart, saying: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price." 
"The idea is, however, that is not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," Laporte confirmed. 
The consortium "gérance" Énergie approved contract is part of a long list of contracts on more than 50000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois. 
The treaties have been either from the hydro-Quebec or the SEBJ for the project East Main-1 A-Sarcelle-approved Rupert. 
After review was one of the newspaper "Le Devoir" more than 100 engineer and consultant contracts, the companies or their branches, including in particular resources laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010. 
SNC-Lavalin had killed 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not counting here whose participation in "Énergie gérance." 
All of these agreements have been negotiated. 
It is estimated the total at 449783 $344, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" on 295131 $564. 
Sylvain Simard had indicated that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) "libéral Parti du Quebec well known." 
Minister Normandeau had let slip that the PQ was also linked to the companies, which was "sponsored" before they clarified that it is much more about their leaders.
