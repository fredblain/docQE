Tech Toys holds your gifts budget in balance 
This year's favourite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console and both games can be a considerable hole in your budget gifts. 
A iPad costing as much as five BMX-wheels for $99, while the price of a Kinect game about 10 classic rush Springs, or about play-Doh 48 cans. 
But you can protect your gifts. 
I recently went in search of three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, Toys "R" us and a BJ's Wholesale Club. 
I was immediately clear that Moore's law was in force this year, the technology toys more efficient and cost slightly less than last year. 
And while fewer new toys with its own Web site, will take place on the best-known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, a wider range. 
There are always more button-cell-powered toys on the market, and many contain again aufladbare batteries. 
Here are a few recommendations. 
(If not otherwise specified, all prices are Toys "R" us.) 
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for children 3 years) are Plüschfiguren, as big as guinea pig who sing a note, if one puts pressure on its belly. 
Even push corresponds to a note by mehrmaliges flick you can play a song. 
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony. 
Warning: if you have started with the flick, you can no longer stop. 
For a combination of Gesand and dancing is the Dance star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60 for children from 2) is the best choice. 
On the basis of animatronische doll last year developed Elmo Live technology offers the recantations as ' Simon says, and thanks to the new hinge feet with Radblockierung dominated the Moon Walk. 
Children who use the device testeten, Mickey as a dance teacher, and their parents, however, complained about the lack of Lautstärke scheme. 
If you are a child of the 1980s, you must remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys. 
Now he is back (Hasbro/play Kool, $40 for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards, a car can be an hour's training with a preached with auto-correction function as a teacher. 
If your child, you would not want to entrust your Smartphone, here are three independent alternatives. 
MobiGo of VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty-keyboard. The games contained, however, are not as instructive as the first major revision in the Leapster Explorer ($70 for children 3-12) after Leapfrogs the Leapster-series is equipped with a new, brighter screen. 
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes. 
IXL from Fisher-Price ($90 for children 3-7) used for the Games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD-Kartenlaufwerks family photographs to be seen. 
Last but not least, there is still a Scrabble Flash ($30 by Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen. 
In the game, it is a question of the blocks together words, before the time is running out and it is great for an improvised Buchstabierwettbewerb. 
More and more toys have a kind of online connection. 
If you alone after the supply in the toy shops, Webkinz and Club Penguin, the most important. 
So your child an online animal to the Club Penguin, you can buy, for example, a Disney Club Penguin 2 " mix ' n match figures package ($5 for children 6-12), which contains a coin with a secret code. 
If you receive the code online keying in your child enough Club Penguin ten bill for a further two parts. 
The roll of shoes or a Puffle-fuel animal. 
The latest head-cell-powered micro-robot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not bigger than the head of your toothbrush. 
The Käfer moves quickly to 12 vibrierenden silicone feet in any direction. 
It is fun to send him through a maze of Klötzen. 
And he thinks a lot. 
We came down from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the foot of our dog.
