Cheshire-appeal makes attention on Twitter 
A half-dozen of them tippten in the riots in the courtroom. 
In the minutes verschickten stroke their reports on Twitter on grausige witness statements. 
In the end, the defense, there were more than 140000 Twitter messages about the process for rape and gekettete beds children in a house, the flare. 
On Thursday, the closely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was indicted, three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, have been killed, an official at the end, if the ruling on the death sentence, the jury has ruled. 
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already filed in court, explain the reasons for an appeal and the courts for years. 
One of the provozierendsten reasons is that the intense coverage of the trial - also through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporter - to a "circus atmosphere" and such a widespread, swift penetration was a rebel details, so that the jury improperly influenced by the public outrage. 
This objection could prompt the Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules are necessary in the courtroom. 
"As I have seen during this process, I think that it really is a danger, if the arrival of new technologies in the courtroom every individual's right to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes main defender. 
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue by the supreme court court last week rejected the applications by ruling succinct and, when he said that the new media "will be carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions. 
But it was certainly not the last word on this matter. 
For decades, have established legal objections that the reporting on notorious cases to doubts about the fairness of the process. 
In its historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States, the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, is said to have killed his wife, and said in his ruling that there had been due to the New Media, "a carnival atmosphere in the courtroom." 
Some people believe that the television series and the movie "on the run" is based on this crime. 
Some lawyers say court appeals, which Mr. Hayes condemnation of half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary in order to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom at the time of the case, Dr. Sheppard still were unimaginable. 
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the impact of the new media in trials by the general public are persecuted," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who has investigated the death penalty in Connecticut, his report states that they will be imposed arbitrarily. 
Professor Donohue said, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction a prompt communication out of the courtroom could make the process fairer. 
The Twitter matter is only one of many that the lawyers for Mr. Hayes to discuss for years and thus delaying a condemnation. 
The defenders claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes had already explanation might have been as judge Blue not to allow them to test the reactions of potential judges, giving them during the grausige judges selected scene photos showed. 
Some of the judges said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and their TÃ¼chter, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years, they would have met with disgust. 
The defenders say that they were also the constitutionality of the death penalty, constitution, and argue that the judge wrongly have exchanged a jury, which has been a critic of the public prosecutor's office, and that he improperly put pressure on the ruling, as he had made the unusual decision, the panel released over the weekend. 
The judges were not isolated. 
But their arguments about the impact of the extensive coverage of the process, perhaps the greatest interest. 
In a judgment challenge they have submitted last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American Senate, was discussed by the candidates. 
They argued that the new media constantly the flames of emotions would have reopened the case. 
"Such a day-to-day crush of media Piepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "has been previously in New Haven, and perhaps even across the country have not yet seen." 
Its focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial. 
In interviews, said a number of journalists that the claim that these are direct news rabble-rousing but the reports, which are slower, an anti-technology is a view that the coverage of future trials verarme. 
But some lawyers said, would Appelationsgerichte often faced with the argument that need social and technical changes to the Adaptation through the courts. 
Mr. Hayers lawyers step up this claim. 
In their appeal, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, in which the conviction of Dr. Sheppard was lifted because of the reporting and made it clear that the new media require new rules. 
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21 century."
