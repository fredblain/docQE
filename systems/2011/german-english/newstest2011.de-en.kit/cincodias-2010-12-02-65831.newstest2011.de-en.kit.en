CECA fills a second wave of mergers of savings banks from

Olavarrieta declared, "there were a series of step opinions without any ambiguity about the slowness of the process, the Unseriösität and foreshortened revealed" because, "Banco de España exhorted us to complete on time before the end of the year." 
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured that Spain was one of the rigorosesten financial systems in Europe and "perhaps" around the world and added that those who would do the anzweifeltenn this "without deeper knowledge." 
The executives said, that we are in the current economic recovery "not worried" about the situation of financial institutions and the savings banks must make a "very significant" concentration process have been through, "as soon as possible." 
He also recalled that the Spanish banks are the stress tests, which the ECB in July, had a very good.
