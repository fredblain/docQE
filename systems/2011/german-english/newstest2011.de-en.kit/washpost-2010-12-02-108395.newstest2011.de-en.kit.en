Belarus agrees to accumulate weapons-grade uranium 
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to global nuclear material security, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it no longer will gather highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. 
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Council. 
The US government had for years sought to convince Belarus, not to collect more highly enriched uranium and last spring seemed to have achieved a hurdle. 
But officials of the US government told the Washington Post that in the last two months, two secret agreements were made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research. 
This was the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material, according to an official staff, because of the sensitivity of the matter remains anonymous, approximately 500 pounds. 
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear security summit of 47 nations" from April to be ruled out of Belarus. 
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic for the next summit in 2012. 
"I was really excited by the fact that they want a seat on the Nuklearen security summit (in 2012)." 
"This is proof that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the partnership Globaler security, a group promoting nuclear safety. 
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant and important step" of Belarus. 
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009, within four years, everything possible to secure vulnerable nuclear material. 
Since then, the US government has helped six countries going on its highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus will be the seventh. 
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush. 
At the time of Obama's Nuklearem Security Summit, the White Russian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up their uranium. 
"How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons capable, and less-enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time. 
"That is our commodity... We will not make dirty bombs and we will sell it to anyone." 
"We use it solely for research purposes, that is all." 
Belarus, however, a few months ago in the United States, as it anzeigte interest in meeting an agreement. 
The first attempt to remove the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was easy verstrahlt, officials say. 
It was loaded into a Spezialzug, more than 1300 miles at a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say. 
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the officials by plane. 
The US government will pay for this effort $14 million, with a large part of the money in the Belarussian research with low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons. 
"This has been extremely cautious in a coordinated and agreed to build confidence" to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, which operates the Global risk reduction. 
The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende study estimates that Belarus had this year, at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus wants to dissolve under the joint agreement camp until 2012. 
Relations between Belarus and the United States were long tense years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh suppression of human rights. 
But the statement Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement. 
"The progress of this global security issues to heißend, the United States of America and Belarus announced that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
