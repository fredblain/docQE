Obama to stop new oil drilling 
Off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the next few years. 
Such a ban, the government has enacted in Washington, and finally their previous plans. 
Stay off the Atlantic coast for new drilling. 
It said Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday. 
The trigger for the strict ban, which is at least for the next five years, the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April. 
Before the accident, which had 11 workers claimed the lives and the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama under pressure from the opposition and the industry signaled its willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico. 
The supporters want to reduce the dependence of the United States of oil supplies from abroad. 
Who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf is not finally resolved until today. 
There is at the heart of the criticism of the British energy company BP, which is faced with billions of demands. 
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama in the course of December 2008 to present their results. 
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban imposed after the explosion. 
After several oil companies had immediately made requests for new drilling projects. 
With tighter controls and more stringent safety rules Obama and Salazar want to rule out a further disaster. 
At present, the relevant supervisory authority, which has radically reformed after numerous corruption charges will be brought into disrepute. 
In parallel, Obama has announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and Gaskonzerne. 
The industry warns now publicly that the level of production in the Gulf by a much tighter regulation would be smaller than in the past. 
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a recent industry survey by consultant BDO, even before the drilling ban on Wednesday. 
The American Energy Alliance also complained about the uncertainty in the industry: "nobody knows what exactly will change with the regulation." 
Investment in new projects would be postponed until further notice, at the expense of growth.
