Saba Dell wants to steal his rivals in three years, a million customers ' ' 
The caretaker board member of Banco Saba Dell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers, he believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but first rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war debts. 
Nevertheless, he sees a drop in interest margins, which the banks are trying to increase the fees and prices for loans. 
Saba expects Dell, in three years, a million private customers - a still-standing. 
Saba Dell has found the way to use the next three years, and to survive in a very difficult economic environment. 
In 2011, the bank will introduce a new three-yearly master plan. 
The goal is not only to survive without increasing the public aid from the FROB to use, but also the market share of about a million private customers - 700000 when the customers, the bank will lose - and that is the great challenge facing the bank, because until now it has its business customers more attention than their retail customers. 
This year it has received 250000 private customers and 50000 businesses. 
Their market share in retail is 3.5 percent, while the business customers account for more than 10 percent. 
Another principle of 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, austerity, reducing costs and the challenges facing the bank, they will be together with year-end report. 
Only a few cars banks find themselves in these difficult times, targets and to publish, as a result of the financial crisis worldwide, all the plans for the banks. 
Saba Dell will complete this year its four years ago established guiding plan Optima. This was initially interpreted to three years, but as a result of the market, it has been extended by a year of business. 
The customers who will leave the savings banks, are the main objective of the bank. 
At a breakfast organized by the APIE Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with a longer range." 
The manager believes that Spain would only "slowly" out of the crisis. 
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to create in two or three years ' work ' - essential for the survival of the banks. 
Even if he assumes that the war for the liabilities - punished the interest rate margins will abate - the risk premia, banks and savings banks for their emissions will have to pay for the maintenance of liquidity, as compensation for the sagging profit margins already passed on to the price of loans. 
"The liquidity and funding issues are of a structural nature and they will put pressure on the loans." 
"We do not have the tap tap off, but the Zinsdifferenziale are very high," admitted Guardiola. 
Banesto was already on Thursday the orders from their Filialnetz to restrict the granting of long-term loans and to increase the Zinsdifferenziale (cf. Cinco DÃ­az on 22 and 27 November). 
The manager also acknowledged that the banks are currently pursuing the Stategie, "to increase the fees," but "within a competitive framework." 
Saba Dells master plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not rule out corporate transactions. 
Not for nothing that he assured us that in Spain, "bigger companies are necessary." 
"In the coming year will change everything," he assured. 
He stressed that the need for capital is currently "huge increase" and does not rule out that some of the Spanish financial institutions are slipping into red figures. 
He is of the opinion that the FROB could replace Kaptitalaufstockungen the money market. 
After being assured that Saba Dell also could survive a temporary closure of the markets, he refuted the argument of some bankers already predict a new liquidity crisis. 
He stressed that nothing can be put into circulation, but in contrast to the events in June, you can get short-term funding on repo transactions and intercept the crisis.
