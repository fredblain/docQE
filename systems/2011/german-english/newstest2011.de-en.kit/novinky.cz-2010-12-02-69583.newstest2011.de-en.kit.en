Two aircraft training L-159 for the first time in foreign hands, in Spain 
Two easy warplanes L-159 out of a total of five, the Czech Defense Ministry against the transport aircraft Casa C-295M exchanged has flown on Tuesday in the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturers take up residence Casa, EADS. 
It is the first time that aircraft of this type are in possession of a foreign army. 
Abroad, they were so far only in exercises or flight to see how. 
It is a viable air Zweisitzerversion L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army. 
The other three aircraft are einsitzige L-159. 
They are still einkonserviert in aerodynamics Vodochody, the facilitator of this business, the company Omnipol, has taken over last week. 
When they are physically the aircraft from expediert Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, not yet known. 
The einsitzigen fighter plane L-159, in turn, have been singled out for long-term stored aircraft and without further deposits and investments on the part of the portfolio of the Ministry. 
"The doppelsitzigen L-159T1 were exchanged in the current situation and appearance," said Pejšek of Právo newspaper. 
He added that the army will not have to live without zweisitzige fighter planes, as the Ministry of Defence in May 2009 with aerodynamics Vodochody signed a 200-million contract on the conversion of four unnecessary L-159 to zweisitzigen version. 
A new aircraft, the army in July, the second she wants to play until the end of this year. 
According to Pejšek EADS has committed itself to enforce the warplanes in equipment, one of the NATO countries. 
" The treaty is very clear that the company EADS aircraft customers L-159 and that the training of pilots to serve in the NATO countries. 
"It is therefore up to the Abnehmers how he realized the thing," Pejšek led. 
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159. 
The barter of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of more planes for 3.5 billion kronor, was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek. 
The Ministry of Defence had at the time to buy a tender put out to tender, but spoke directly to EADS. 
The office of then-defence argued that the exchange will be the future export of L-159 support abroad. 
The Czech army bought 72 aerodynamics machines, which they used only 24, they wanted to sell the rest. 
The purchase of the Casa aircraft may also have a legal process. 
The European Commission sued the Czech Defense Ministry at the European Court of Justice because it would have to choose the aircraft because of a very European tender and certainly not by raising a single manufacturer. 
The army has already taken over Casa three planes, the last to land within 14 days at the Airport Kbely.
