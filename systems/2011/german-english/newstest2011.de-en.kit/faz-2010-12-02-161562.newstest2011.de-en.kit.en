Amazon's server blocks, threats against Assange 
Wikileaks is increasingly in trouble. 
The Internet service provider Amazon has banished the investigative platform from its servers. 
There is perhaps political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic diplomatic. 
Wikileaks founder Assange is supposedly in England. 
The investigative platform Wikileaks is becoming more and more in the United States under fire. 
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now seeking an Internet home in Europe. 
The prominent Senator Joe Lieberman, however, called on other countries and companies to boycott of Wikileaks. 
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the wanted lists of Interpol, to stop after a newspaper report in Britain. 
"Wikileaks from Amazon's server." 
"Free speech in the land of the Free," the investigative activists shared by short-messaging service Twitter on Wednesday (local time). 
Shortly before the Internet company had the Wikileaks documents Amazon banished from its servers. 
The Internet activists had used in the publication of the secret diplomatic diplomatic on Amazon's Web service (AWS), so that it can cope with the high level of access numbers on the documents. 
Via Twitter Wikileaks said the step further: "fine, our dollars are spent to employ people in Europe." 
If Amazon have such problems with freedom of speech, "they should stop to sell books." 
Amazon have halted the use of its servers by Wikileaks after staff of Senator Joe Lieberman investigation, told the CNN television, citing the Liebermans office. 
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security was Amazon's threatened a boycott, told the British Guardian newspaper. 
"I would have liked that Amazon is taking this measure previously classified information in light of the previous publications by Wikileaks," the senator said. 
Lieberman, meanwhile, called on the platform in other countries to deny the use servers. 
"Wikileaks ' illegal, hideous and ruthless approach to our national security at risk and threatened around the world lives," it was analysed in an announcement by the parteilosen senator. 
"No responsible companies, whether American or foreign-, Wikileaks should help in his efforts to disseminate stolen material." 
Wikileaks founder Assange, because of the rape suspect sought by the authorities in Sweden, is wanted by Interpol. 
According to a report by the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain, the exact location is known to Scotland Yard. 
The Internet activist has described the investigation in Sweden as intrigue of his opponents. 
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats. 
"There were even calls for murder of Julian Assange." 
That is why fear Assange bearings for its security, said Hrafnsson. 
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to keep hidden. 
Hrafnsson apparently reacted to comments from North America. 
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations for treason and executed. 
In Canada, said an aide to leader Stephen Harper, seems ironic, on television, Assange should be killed ', " and Obama could " make use of a drone. " 
Between the White House and Assange, meanwhile, a tennis match. 
The spokesman for the American president, Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had demanded, if it is responsible for recent known espionage-invitations to diplomats. 
"I am not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a type with a Web site," says Gibbs. 
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than his a website." 
The American government is the protection of their data banks fully to the test. 
As a special envoy was appointed the vice-director of the Centre for anti-terrorism measures, Russell Travers, the White House said. 
Travers had become responsible for "the necessary structural reforms" to develop after the disclosure of the embassy reports by Wikileaks were needed. 
The White House also wants to review the way, as the entire government spread information and protects. 
The US government also announced that for the safety of dissidents and Aktivsten, they should by the Wikileaks publication in jeopardy. 
"We have done everything to come in contact with them," said Au√üenamts spokesman Philip Crowley. 
"We are ready to protect them, if necessary."
