Secretly in the middle of 
In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband told Argentina's President Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy that pushed their raise by 20 points to more than 50%. This is the highest value since its election in 2007. 
Whether it is, however, next year to a re-election, depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández further compromises as her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner. 
The signs are not clear. 
Néstor Kirchner, even after the election of his wife drew the economic policy, often at the budget plans, which take into account the tax revenues, economic growth and inflation. 
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra revenue as they see fit. 
On paper the Fernández-government lost last year, the majority in Congress. 
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further Zerwürfnissen. 
Some critics of the regime were from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten behind Cristina Fernández. 
But after chaotic meetings (in which accused a parliamentarian, another in the face, and others, the government of bribery) managed to Congress not to approve the budget for 2011. 
"I am not going to discuss it," the President. 
The 2010 budget now goes for the next year, which the President has more opportunity to spend money as they see fit. 
The economy is overheating: it is likely this year to grow up to 9%. 
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the unions, the value to almost 30%. 
Kirchner, who took over in 2003, the office, when Argentina was beset by economic crises, said growth and poverty reduction to its key objectives, and not the inflation reduction. 
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, the private sector has singled out for bullying and säuberte the National Institute for Statistics and census INDEC, which then schönte official inflation statistics. 
Fernández can now take a more modest way? 
It has called on the private sector and the trade union leaders for talks. 
And, according to official statements should be limited wage increases next year to 18%. 
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost. 
But the inflation undermined the growth spurt by a large devaluation in 2002. 
Perhaps would join Cristina Fernández why Argentina financial economically back to the rest of the world. 
At the beginning of this year, the government of an agreement with shareholders, who had rejected an earlier restructuring of the country in 2001. 
Now it seems Fernández on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club to push those around $6.7 billion owed to it. 
The Kirchners had rejected a review by the IMF, as elsewhere, normal. 
But last month, the national consumer price index "technical support economic Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund in drawing up a new will." It looks as if this is the first step to clean up the INDEC. 
It is not known whether Fernández after leaving office without the support of her husband will be politically active. 
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which is largely fed by Kirchnerism. 
If the Argentines in March to return from their summer holidays, will be the wave of Sympatie, which was abgeebbt. 
If they want to win another election, they must decide whether to lift many political decisions her husband quietly.
