Khmer Rouge veterans forced into confrontation with the past 
In a poorly lit, betonierten schoolroom with dirty and abbl채tternden walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School to the man who built it, to the subsequent Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok. 
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok." 
"He was a good leader and he has thought about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years. 
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, known as "the butchers," the commander remains in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in the north-west Cambodia's popular, where he built hospitals and bridges, the infrastructure has developed and where thousands of former soldiers still live. 
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, long-time supporters in Anlong Veng. 
In April, allowed a local victims Truth and Reconciliation Forum public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime. 
In June, the government distributed a school book that for the first time a former child soldier tells the story of the Khmer Rouge. 
And in July, a Community tribunal of the United Nations and Cambodia for the first time a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it convicted the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison. 
With each of these developments, the fear among the Alnlong Khmer Rouge veterans Vengs, hindered their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia. 
"There is still disagreement and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime. 
"It was the glorious life under the Khmer Rouge, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." 
"It even divides families." 
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people executed or died of disease, overwork or starvation. 
When the Vietnamese invaded in 1979 and the Pol Pot-Ied government, fled the remnants of the regime and its military to the Cambodian border with Thailand. 
They are widely used by December 1998, when the last movement surrendered. 
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from its base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok, the next generation in Anlong Veng. 
But in the mid-1990's, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement in 1993, led the first democratic elections in the country, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, to cross the government, which has led to the Kapitulationen of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998. 
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not yielded, was arrested in 1999 by government forces in the Dangrek those who live. 
He died in prison in 2006 of Phnom Penh, where he was awaiting his trial. 
As their patrons they no longer protected, most fled former Khmer Rouge fighters in the exhausting poverty of rural Cambodia and kept many of the movement in nostalgic memory. 
Even if a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts, because they laid down their weapons, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, illiterate farmers. 
"These people have very little benefit from the capitulation," said Sok Leang by the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng, public forums 
"They are enshrined in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime." 
"They grew without any professional know." 
Sor Lim, 55, had joined in 1974 as a teenager, the Rhmer Rouge, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng, before he was down in 1998, in order to lead a life as a poor rice farmer. 
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said. 
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat." 
"But now life is difficult, because we need to look at ourselves." 
The current Khmer Rouge tribunal has also caused concern. 
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to ensure that Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge ministers, in court. 
The mandate of the court, it is the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities are to be condemned, but it has not said whether it will follow on these four cases further action. 
This has done little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng. 
Recent media speculation on In Chaem, 64 years concentrated during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's district leader in the province had been Manteay Meanchey. 
In 2007 it was representative of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, told that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced labourers probably died. 
On a hot evening came In Chaem from work in the fields to their wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng. 
As the sun cast a long shadow over the desiccated grass rejected In Chaem refuses to discuss her past with the Khmer Rouge. 
The court should vorladen them, so they would refuse to go, she said. 
"Cambodia is living in peace and stability," she said. 
"There would be no more persecution would be war." 
Prime Minister Hun Sen, the 1878 fled from the Khmer Rouge, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be unsafe, the court would prosecute suspects, although experts and historians to discuss it. 
"Cambodia should dig a hole and bury the past," he said. 
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to be able to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center. 
"Reconciliation means with the Rouge-time compiling the broken pieces," he said. 
"It is our duty to set the broken parts together, so how can understand everything." 
The center created the first school book approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, which 75seitige ' history of Democratic Kampuchea. " 
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history books for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which is less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge. 
As is often the case in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng, little about the Khmer Rouge, in spite of the town of links to the regime. 
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students to understand an important part of their history. 
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it. 
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said. 
"They are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people will be sentenced by the court." 
Such a resistance makes the reconciliation process is complex and complicated, Sok Leang said. 
But the public forums, the school book and the court and influence, " he said. 
Still, the Khmer Rouge has a powerful attraction. 
The top in the Dangrek mountains of Str채uchern 체berwucherter and plastic waste verdreckter path to a Rechteck of black soot, covered with a rostigen tin roof. 
Pol Pot's body was burned after his death in 1998 at a tyre bunch. 
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a mobile phone Verk채uferin at the roadside, said she did not know much about the man who had been burned. 
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here to go to him in order to pray," she said. 
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later on the day she wanted to Pol Pot's final resting place, where they will give a bush mature banana - in the hope that it will bring her good luck.
