NASA announces the discovery of extra-irdischen life 
The North American Space Agency convened a press conference tomorrow will have a fund vorzustelle, the impact on the search for living in space. 
The National Air and Space Agency (NASA) of the United States tomorrow, Thursday announced a astrobiologische discovery, which could confirm the theory of the existence of extra-irdischen life. 
The Fund will tomorrow at a press conference at 1.00 p.m. in NASA headquarters in Washington presented by experts from the Astrobiologie. This is a science, the origin, development, distribution and examined the future of life in the universe. 
In convening the press conference, NASA has given assurances that they will be "a high supervisory Fund for the search for au√üerirdischem imagine life," triggering speculation in experts from other countries. 
The discovery could prove the theory that it can exist in hostile environments, which so far for unbwohnbar, human-like creatures, it raised the hypothesis that this intelligent creatures - could transform how people - when their improved living conditions. 
Apparently it is a microbe that has been found at the bottom of the mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where she lives in an environment that was thought to be too toxic to all possible forms of life, because the sea is strong but contain arsenic. 
Used in any way the Mikrobie the arsenic than survival resource., taking into account the ability to increase the chances that there could be other planets, which do not have our protective atmosphere, similar to life. 
If these organisms that verstoffwechseln arsenic, according to the Astrobiologen demonstrated that "there is really a different way of life, a second form of life, from the well-known distinguishes us." 
The space agency is tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference the actual scope of their funds. 
At the conference the Geobiologin Pamela Conrad, which investigated the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, the titan (the largest moon Saturns) under the question of whether its chemical composition similar to that of the Earth, studied.
