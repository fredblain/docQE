A global plan to renew the lighting 
The UN has yesterday in Cancun a plan for renewal of the lighting of budgets, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas proposed (CFCs), nearly a third of the additional reductions, which will have to be carried out in order to stabilize the earth's climate by 2020. 
This ambitious plan takes his position in the steps of a specific major projects to implement the UN in Cancun hopes to compensate for the absence of compelling reduction commitments by industrialized countries. 
After yesterday's plan would replace the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) because of the lighting on the earth's CFCs be avoided if the white glowing pears, which has a monopoly of 50-70% of the market, by fluoreszierende or, better still, by light-emitting diodes (LED). 
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions. 
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the world's vehicle fleet. 
In Copenhagen, had last year, the big exhaust gas emitters like the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans should the global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt downsized. 
From this review should be deducted from 5 Gt in order to stabilise today by 2020 climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius, in order to prevent this spiral out of control. 
In the know are like glowing pears 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light. 
With the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75 percent, with the new LED bulbs reduced these energy needs once again to the two-fold. 
The Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen, on average, between 6000 to 10000 hours. 
The new LED bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips has brought this week on the market, the company has taken to the UN study, have a life expectancy of 25000 hours and consume 80 percent less energy than a knows ardent pear, which is a suggestion of the Auswechselungs savings plan, which is to be applied in 100 countries. 
In addition to the fact that iese entirely new light bulbs very little heat, they can also work with a real resistance. 
And they do not contain any mercury. 
Several specialists have shown that Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves, because they contain mercury, and that is why they have to dispose of hazardous waste, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except the producers are an adoption Centre. 
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet does not, however, according to the report, the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal-fired power plants that emit far more mercury in wasted by the white glowing pears to generate electricity. 
In the United States alone, these are coal-fired power stations 25000 tonnes of mercury per year. 
The report sets out in detail the profits, which each country would generate thanks to this international programme. 
Indonesia would, for example, $1 billion a year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which would mean the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose Erbauung Indonesia 2.5 billion cost.
