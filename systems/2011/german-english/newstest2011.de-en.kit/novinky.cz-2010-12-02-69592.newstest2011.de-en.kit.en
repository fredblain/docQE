American soldiers have a new "smart" weapon. 
American troops have deployed in Afghanistan for the first time a new "smart" weapon, which is known only by its code name XM-25. 
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon influenced the conflict with the Taliban and shift the balance in their favour. 
The new weapon is such a thing as a super-precise walnut. 
Their projectiles by lasers with an accuracy of just a few metres into the goal. 
The special shells of mould 25 mm, which have been developed for this gun and contain dangerous explosive function as small grenades. 
The shells can be programmed, that they do not explode only on impact on the target, but on any point of their ballistic. 
This means that they can use against an enemy that is behind a barrier - a wall or in a trench. 
From above, it is usually not protected, the murderous Stahlsplitterregen from above, it can easily take out. 
According to Richard Audett, in the development of the XM-25 involved, the new campaign is the first infantry rifle weapon, the "smart" technology to harness. 
" The soldier is basically so: he is seeking the goal and sends out a laser beam, which determines the distance, he wins a precise target, after which he corrected the Erhöhungs corner, then he needs only abzudrücken. 
"We say, it has measured 543 metres." 
" If you abdrückt, invites the weapon and shooting the missile on the 543-metre distance plus or minus one, two or three metres.
