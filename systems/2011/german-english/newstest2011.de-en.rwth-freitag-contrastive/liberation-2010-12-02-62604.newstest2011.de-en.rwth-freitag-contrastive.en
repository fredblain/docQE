Climate: France as its financial promises amount 
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to comply with the quickly resolved financing promises (also known as "fast start" funding or premature), which were carried out by the developing countries. 
And the rough French blandishments. 
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed $30 billion between 2010 and 2012. 
The EU has pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France 1.26 billion EUR (420 million) per year. 
At the opening of the COP16, the EU out all the stops to convince their partners of their commitment to the fast start funding: detailgetreuer report of its Member States, press conference, great side events, distribution of brochures. 
The operation transparency is remarkable and I feel valued for their actual value: the developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries do the same thing at the same level of precision. 
The EU announced, released in 2010 2.2 billion EUR, what they are on the right path to Respektbezollung its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012. 
If you look in the detail, things are a little more complicated. 
This money should, according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new and additional" to ensure that has been tabled an additional commitment, without having to the detriment of public development aid. 
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means. 
While the EU Commission had proposed a harmonisation, certain members states, including france, blocked the procedure. 
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark, which he believes is best. 
The EU Commission has chosen, for example, a benchmark for the year 2009: the international financing will be retained, and within the framework of the "fast start" funding over three years to 150 million. 
Other countries have similar standards, either on or about conditions at the level of public development aid. 
In return, France was of the opinion that the financing of new projects, "2010" new and additional ". 
In other words, there are no benchmarks In the spending of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid. 
In practical terms, the total amount of French support for developing countries remain stable (or decrease) - France, his commitment to the "new and additional" funding. 
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. 
There is still no rule, and each elects its calculation method. 
Some, such as France, 1 Euro borrowed the equivalent of 1 Euro donated. 
This is hardly defensible: the trouble is not comparable. 
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to the emission reduction projects, which are based on maximum technology) can be justified, it is wrong to present the EUR, the captured as equivalent to a donated EUR. They should be counted only the cost of borrowing for capital commitment (i. e. the equivalent of an interest rate). 
But France has nothing other than the following observation: "respected" its commitment of EUR 420 million, 91.5% of loans (389.8 million) and donates 8.5%) 36.1 million EUR) - see also the EU document, in order to convince themselves. 
France is the only country in the EU that loans to a great extent. 
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among others) to 100% with donations. 
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union In 1 Euroto fulfil their obligations, France just 10 cents and means, a comparable effort. 
Beautiful hocus-pocus. 
All in All, France in his fast start funding with a double deception: part with a Weiterentwicklkung the action over time and partly with the reality of financial support. 
France will succeed, believe that there are 420 million "new and additional" has spent millions in accordance with its promises and save 36.1 million EUR. 
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it appears that it was Bercy, who carried out the arbitrage) could be a double negative effect; once the EU (why the other member states with the donations, if there is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries are not completely fooled. 
The chapter on premature, only a small issue on relatively short time compared to the entirety of discussions on the climate. 
But it could be the straw too much in the vast machinery of the UNFCCC. 
We hope that this will not be the case. 
Whatever the truth of the matter, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year premature funding. 
Primarily France could announce a change in its accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, and in a spirit of respect for his commitments and the redistributive justice with the other countries of the European Union. 
Above all it could bring the discussions on the subject of long-term financing forward (another, decisive and currently topic): you can escape the question of "Verrechenbarkeit" or the recording its loans. 
France could change its position, in order to be in the same way progressive issues, as it is in other areas. 
The hope is based on the new environment minister Kosciusko Morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun. 
A surprising announcement on the fast start of France and his vision of "Verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loans would inherently increase the international trust, which is necessary for further discussions.
