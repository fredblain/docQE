Running here 
This evening is finally back right around for the Irish. 
No trace of sadness.

"Bierpong" to the bizarre spectacle, there are 500 victory premium plus tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championships in January. 
Cian Tanner is a calmer type; this shrill drinking game and the low-key IT professionals, not really fit together. 
And yet tries to amuse the 26 Jährige, distracting from the nagging question of what the future will bring. 
His plan is not fun game in Las Vegas, he will hold talks in January in New Zealand. 
"I have an uneasy feeling" he says. 
"It is so far away from home and I have no work." 
After all: his girlfriend waiting in Auckland at him - "they had ruck, zuck their desire job as event manager, perhaps a good sign" says the young man and smiles. 
Because of poor prospects at home have found two of Tanners three sibling sought their fortunes abroad.

The boys: How the Tanners looks on the island in many families. 
100.000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, say experts of the Economic and Social Research Institute ESRI in Dublin. 
By 2015, they even with 200.000 emigrants. 
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, a big loss. 
The predictions come true, a wave of emigration comparable to those suffered by Ireland in the eighties. 
After a decade of recovery for the Irish prosperity, is now draws to a close. 
The uncertain economic crisis, especially the young, well-educated irish, for which there is only going up. 
Jobverlust and social decline appeared in the boom years. 
Everyone was needed, money there in abundance. 
But now, three out of ten women and men under thirty without work. 
In the Irish Times abound reader letters young emigrants who complain: "Everything is in Ireland the edge." 
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, and our country will lose a whole generation." 
"The last of the light." 
Law student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish students union, raise a bleak future, because the government only window dressing, and offer young people no longer prospects.

The message is clear: The work is not a Galeerendienst, but also freedom and fun. 
How it feels to build something else, Mr O Donovan for half a year. 
Because it is the 29 - year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany. 
In Gelsenkirchen took just a fashion house. 
In January it goes after Hanover or Berlin, the next project. 
His home is O Donovan now only rarely, since it makes extra classes, in order to be able to the credit for his house at home. 
"The situation is a little crazy" he says, as he comes after a long time for the first time on the threshold of his house. 
"I should have money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I am almost never again." 
He laughs, and goes through ausgekühlte spaces. 
The small house is in a residential area with fine leafy front gardens, in the park harbours large, expensive cars. 
Together with a sister, O Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380.000 EUR - credit-financed 100 percent. 
"It was crazy times, it was easy money without many questions" he says. 
He fears that it could go wrong with the credit? 
O Donovan thought for a while, pours hot tea and says: "I have no children, I have to feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch." 
The engineer may not, but at the moment he often hears. 
"No one should go hungry - our situation is not nearly as dramatic as in previous times here on the island" he says. 
"A while working abroad, this is not the worst thing that can happen - perhaps we feel it only when Irish." 
He laughs and tells of his father, who in the last major economic crisis to England. 
"After seven years, he was back and life in Ireland, was quite simple." 
Cian Tanner like this idea. 
The future and see how it goes with The life elsewhere. 
A few years of work in London, he has also been behind them and why should it not in New Zealand are also good for him and his girlfriend? 
One thing is, however, the troubled him in recent days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin. 
He fears that it could turn into a farewell Party. 
"Not too many emotions" he says, and drink a big a bite of his beer. 
"Goodbye, this sounds pretty scary." 
"We call it a Weggehparty, simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
