World Cup 2018 - 2022: FIFA appoints the host country 
In a corruption suspect appoints the executive committee of FIFA on Thursday the host countries in the world championships in 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice, in which the Rangeln for influence and threaten to push the lobbying the technical criteria in the background. 
One thing is certain: the 2018 edition of the grasp of the FIFA will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold, (the 4 candidates: England, russia, spain, Portugal, Netherlands, belgium). 
The 2022 edition will be something exotic; hopes the International Football Federation, after the premiere on the African continent in 2010 new countries (Australia, Qatar) win for himself, or its subsidiary in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to pursue. 
The list of personalities, the delegation of (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Prime Minister, Zidane, Beck ham, Cruyff) is the degree of economic and political use of the World cup. 
The machinations behind the scenes are threatening to stop until the last minute. 
Otherwise difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates. 
After the evaluation report of FIFA, the English, Spanish, Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts bessseren arguments than their competitors. 
But these considerations will not be for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees the election so important. 
The Sunday Times, with the establishment of the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, might as well as opportunities for their own country, cradle of football, can ruin, which only once the World Cup, in 1966. 
The BBC asked the breeding ground again on Monday, a documentary broadcast report, the three senior members of the Kommitees, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under fire. 
Reason enough to upset the FIFA and the English authorities, which had operated primarily with David Cameron in the last few weeks of intensive lobbying. 
The government hopes for a repeat of his predecessor Tony Blair successful chess train, which was made in 2005 for London, the organisation of the Olympic Games in 2012. 
This would be sufficient intensive use, in order to enhance the image of England before the Committee again? 
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain Portugal does not lack assets with its already finished stadiums, his expertise (82 World Cup in Spain, the Olympic Games in Barcelona in 92, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and his football culture. 
But the economic and financial dark side of the two countries could dampen their ambitions. 
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, the chances of russia, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become the weighty outsiders, increase. 
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided, however, the unumwundenen hint at the Bezichtigungen the English press "unfair competition in the run-up to the vote" denounced by the Committee members. 
"They bewirft with dirt, trying to embarrass them" Putin lashed out. 
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seem to be the logical favourites. 
First world economic power, FIFA headquarters of the main sponsors, the country seems a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have drawn up a very good project. 
But these new nominations seem premature for two countries that had co-organised the competitions in 2002. 
Another threat: the FIFA long-expected awarding the 2026 World Cup in China, the Asian opportunities to 2022 lapses. 
With Australia and Qatar, With the leaders futuristischer stadiums had pulled out all the stops, FIFA to pursue its expansion into new areas, however, these two countries a greater risk because certainty. 
Australia might as well as Japan and South Korea among the European countries akquittierten weakness of television rights (due to the time difference), the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
