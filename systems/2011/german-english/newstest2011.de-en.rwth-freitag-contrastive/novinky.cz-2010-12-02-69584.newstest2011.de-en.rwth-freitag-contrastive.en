A long finger ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer 
Men, whose finger is long, as the ring finger, apparently a lower risk of prostate cancer. 
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer. 
This is connected with the levels of the male hormone testosterone. 
"Our results show that can serve the relative length of the finger as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer and, in particular to sixty" said the co-author of the study, as Eeles, a professor at the cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick. 
The finger could help to determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health problems, Mrs Eeles added. 
In the period from 1994 - 2009 with their counterparts in Britain, more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3000 healthy men. 
More than half of the participants in the study was the finger of the right hand is shorter than the ring finger. 
For these men had the same probability of prostate cancer, such as For 19 percent of those men whose ring and finger the same time. 
In men, whose finger longer than the ring finger, this risk, however, fell by 33 percent, among men and about 87 percent. 
The relationship between the length of the two fingers, mentioned the prenatal age, apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones, which was exposed to the baby in the womb. 
Less testosterone is a long finger. 
Previous research found that testosterone is accelerating the growth of prostate cancer. 
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticists and former chairman of the National Academy of Sciences, said ČTK, he knows that this study on the run, but he believe the relationship between the finger length and the risk of cancer for "proved completely".
