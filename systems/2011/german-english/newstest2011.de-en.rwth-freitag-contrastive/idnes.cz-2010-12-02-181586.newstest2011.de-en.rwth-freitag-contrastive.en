More and more parents want people controls, in order to have the kids under control 
The fear for their own children grow and so are more and more parents to supervise them via GPS. 
The system, which was originally invented to search cars, people, as well, which would also be helpful in such cases, such as Janatková recently, in whatever the nine-year Anička. 
The device is about as big as a packet of cigarettes but soon may not be greater than a wristwatch. 
Many people in the case of the missing Anička and so they consider ways and means looking to protect their children. 
For the price of one of their privacy. 
"We are trying to say that it is by no means Herumspionieren, but an effective way to reduce the likelihood that there will be a tragedy" Petr Pilin Macro by society Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market. 
"I admit that it can come in individual cases of abuse of such devices, for example, if there is someone in the pocket, without that he knows, but we have had no such case." 
"Most customers buy it for security reasons" adds Pilin added. 
In his opinion, should know the child should always, what purpose the "box" and how they are used in an emergency. 
The child psychologist Dana Bočková notes, however, that a child, if it is not such a thing, it is easy to. 
"Even very young children show great creativity, when it comes to certain things deliberately to lose if they do not want to be controlled." 
"The mobile phones set initially high expectations among parents, but they can just as easily, as these new controls" said Mrs Bočková. 
Their view is also questionable whether such a body in the event of an attack. 
"The planned kidnappings controlled the kidnappers controls virtually always whether the child has any electronics, which could be located." 
"Today it is the mobile phone." 
"If such controls wider use, they also, as their sale would be accompanied by massive advertising." 
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always one step ahead" said psychologist. 
It acknowledges that similar devices in a sudden attack by a paedophile very helpful. 
Roberta Čech by society RC monitoring, according to the tracking services for both cars, as well as for people who can help the existence of such equipment, even if it will be destroyed immediately after the attack. 
"The machine is so that it is the position in certain intervals." 
"Even if it were to be destroyed immediately, at least the final position of the person concerned." 
"The more expensive equipment is even a knife, in other words, if you hinfällt and motionless in immediately, the device sends a warning to the position" said Mr Čech. 
In his opinion, may have similar services also smart phones with navigation, you need einzuspielen only a special software. 
The problem with the current positioning devices is that it is either equipment in matchbox size, the trailers or smaller mobile phones. 
There is always the risk that they will lose. 
Mr Pilin of the Macro Weil, testing it in the present devices that look like ordinary digital clocks. 
"This has the advantage that it must recognize the potential attackers at all that there is a surveillance and tracking equipment. 
"Only after a certain time, or he can see what the police a head start" he added. 
No matter what the direction of development - to Armbändern or supporters, always use the same technology, such as the vehicle tracking. 
The combination of positioning function with the GPS system (as in Ms in the car) and the role of a mobile phone, which the current position.
