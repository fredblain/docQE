Bond for the takeover of eXcentris 
The Quebecer government, the Société Angus and the Parallèle companies to participate financially in the eXcentris cinema complex, with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive loan. 
The developers society Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of about seven million $s by the Ministry of Culture Daniel Langlois, eXcentris cinema complex on the Boulevard Saint Laurent, to get these back its cineastischen function, not what they have demanded. 
The government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, but on their own conditions. 
Instead of the expected donation offers the Quebecer government bond in lower than initially expected, which could create a viable solution to advantageous conditions, at least according to the state of the scaremongers entnehmbaren sources. 
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected last spring from Quebec, the Bittgesuch has been corrected since the revised downwards. 
A proposal, together with an action plan were already by the President of the "Société de développement entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, sent to the St Pierre, the acts eXcentris. 
Several days ago, he had a final technical report. 
The proposal of the cabinet was sent to the SODEC, on Wednesday. 
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December to respond to this. 
In any case, the premise of the Heads of State donation really seems to have been pushed aside. 
Let us remember that had made the Quebecer owners community of cinemas and cinema complexes against a direct government investment to support the adoption of eXcentris by made the argument that the Culture Ministers have to provide financial aid for real estate projects, which also have other cinema. 
Several other market participants segment, however, by contrast, substantial economic assistance. 
Kinochef Daniel Langlois had after the self-financed cinemas over ten years with great difficulty, the authors cinema in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exception from the treasury. 
The lack of cinema, the independent films in Montreal, is more than obvious, and eXcentris knew to keep its clientele. 
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, a privately financed campaign in which they hoped for a sum of $700 000, in order to boost the acquisition. 
Since the spring of 2009, only one screen to show films in eXcentris, Le Parallèle. 
The aim of the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the demonstration of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "hommes et des dieux'to reopen. 
Christian Yaccarini but has the newspaper "Le Devoir", and it ignores what he and his group of the enviable proposals, which has made them.
