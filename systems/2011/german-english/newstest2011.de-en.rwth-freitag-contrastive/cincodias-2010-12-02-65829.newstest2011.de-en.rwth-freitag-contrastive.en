The executive board member of Banco Saba Dell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but first rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war. 
Nevertheless, he sees a drop in interest rate spreads, which the banks with increases in fees and try to balance the prices for loans. 
Sabadell expected in three years, a million private customers - and still too. 
Sabadell has found a way to use the next three years, and to survive in a very difficult economic environment. 
The bank will introduce a new Dreijahresleitplan in 2011. 
The goal is to not only survive without public aid from the FROB, but also the market share of about a million private customers - 700 000, if you exclude the customers who will lose the bank - to increase.

This year it has 250 000 retail and 50 000 companies. 
Its market share in retail is 3.5 percent, while the business customers more than 10 percent.

Even if he assumes that the war for liabilities - punished the interest margins - will abate, the risk premia, the need to pay banks and savings banks for their emissions to obtain liquidity, to offset sagging profit margins are already on the price of loans. 
"The liquidity and funding issues are of a structural nature and they will put pressure on the loans." 
"We have turned the tap, but the Zinsdifferenziale are very high" Guardiola. 
Banesto on Thursday ordering their Filialnetz, the provision of long-term loans and to increase the Zinsdifferenziale (cf. Cinco DÃ­az between 22 and 27 November). 
The managers also acknowledged that the banks have now Stategie, "to increase the fees" but "within a competitive framework". 
Sabadells master plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group does not exclude, as always, corporate business.
