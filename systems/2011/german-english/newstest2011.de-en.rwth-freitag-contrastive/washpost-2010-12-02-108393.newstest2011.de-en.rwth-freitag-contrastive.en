Khmer Rouge forced veterans to confrontation with the past 
In a weak illuminated, betonierten class room with dirty and abblätternden walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School to the man who has built, the Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok. 
"Everyone loves Ta Mok." 
"He was a good leader and he cared about his people" said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years. 
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butchers', the commander in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in the north-west Cambodia's popular, where he built hospitals and bridges, has developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live. 
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, will be challenged longstanding supporters in Anlong Veng. 
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum victims public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime. 
In June the government a school book that tells for the first time a former child soldiers In the history of the Khmer Rouge. 
And in July, a Community Court of the u. n. and Cambodia for the first time a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, sentenced to 35 years in prison. 
With each of these developments, the fear among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, making their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia. 
"There are still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything" said Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime. 
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." 
"It divides families." 
During the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, were executed an estimated 1.7 million people, or died of disease, starvation or overwork. 
When the Vietnamese invaded and toppled Pol Pot Ied government, fled the remnants of the regime and its military to the Cambodian border to Thailand. 
Here, they surrendered until December 1998, when the last movement. 
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary's guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok, the next generation in Anlong Veng. 
But in the mid-1990 s, when an UN-sponsored peace agreement in 1993 to the first democratic elections in the country, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, joining the government, which led to the Kapitulationen of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998. 
Pol Pot died in 1998 of natural causes, and Ta Mok, who had not yielded, was arrested in 1999 by government forces in the Dangrek Mountain. 
He died in 2006 at the prison in Phnom Penh, where he was waiting for his trial. 
As their patrons they no longer protected, ran most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters from grinding poverty of rural Cambodia and many of the movement in nostalgic memories. 
Even if a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge their local government posts, because they laid down their arms, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, illiterate farmers. 
"These people have very little of the surrender" said Sok Leang by the Centre for justice and reconciliation, in Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng, public forums, 
"They are enshrined in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime." 
"They grew without any professional knowledge." 
Sor Lim, 55, who had joined in 1974 as a teenager, Rhmer Montrouge, fought in the jungle Anlang Veng, before he niederließ 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer. 
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good" he said. 
"TA Mok each has something to eat." 
"But now life is difficult, because we have to take care of itself." 
The current Khmer Rouge tribunal has also raised concerns here. 
At the beginning of next year, the court will try, Nuon Chea, Khieu samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge ministers. 
It is the task of the court, the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, to condemn, but it is not said whether it will pursue further beyond these four cases. 
This has done little to assuage the fears in Anlong Veng. 
Current media speculation have focused on the Chaem, 64 years, during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970 s district in the province Manteay Meanchey. 
In 2007, she had told representatives of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, In which the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project that killed thousands of forced labour probably died. 
On a hot night in Chaem from work in the fields of her wooden house On a dirty streets outside of Anlong Veng. 
As the sun long shadow over the desiccated grass, rejected the Chaem refuses to discuss about their past the Khmer Rouge. 
The court should call them, so they would refuse to go, she said. 
"Cambodia is living in peace and stability" she said. 
"There would be no prosecutions would be war." 
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has fled in 1878 by the Khmer Rouge, has also repeatedly warned that the situation is uncertain, would accuse the court more suspects, although experts and historians to discuss this. 
"Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past" he said. 
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to move forward, said Chhang Youk the Documentation Centre. 
"Reconciliation with the Rouge times means to bring together the broken pieces" he said. 
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together, so that we can understand everything." 
The centre has created the first approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75 page "history of Democratic Kampuchea". 
It's book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history books for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge. 
How often in Cambodia know the young people in Anlong Veng little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's links to the regime. 
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at the Anlong Veng High school, said that the new school book helps students to understand an important part of their history. 
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book with home to read it. 
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court" he said. 
"They are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people convicted by the court." 
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process is complex and complicated, said Sok Leang. 
But the public forums, the school books and the court, and influence, "he said. 
Still, the Khmer Rouge is a powerful attraction. 
High in the Dangrek mountains of shrubbery überwucherter and with plastic waste verdreckter rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof. 
Pol Pot's body was burnt on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998. 
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a mobile phone sales Rin roadside, said she does not know much about the man who had been burned here. 
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray" she said. 
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later in the day they wanted to go to Pol Pot's final resting place, where they will be a bush ripe bananas - in the hope that he will bring their luck.
