Belarus is, not weapons-grade uranium accumulate 
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide has announced the government of Belarus on Wednesday that will collect no longer highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. 
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting between the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Council. 
The U.S. government had tried for years to persuade Russia to collect The more highly enriched uranium and seemed achieved last spring a hurdle. 
But the U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that were taken in the past two months, two secret agreements with Belarus to remove about 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research Institute. 
This was the scene for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material, according to an official staff, which is due to the sensitivity of the issue of anonymously, about 500 pounds. 
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuklearem security summit of 47 nations" in April, the had ruled Belarus. 
And it was obviously well enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012. 
"I was really excited by the fact that they have a seat on the nuclear Security summit (2012)." 
"This proves that it works" said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Partnership, a group for the promotion of nuclear safety. 
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus. 
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, to secure within four years all vulnerable nuclear material. 
Since then, has helped the U.S. government six countries, to be its highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus will be the seventh. 
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George w. Bush. 
At the time of Obama's Nuklearem security summit, the White Russian President Alexander Lukashenko said that the nation will never give up its uranium. 
"How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally waffenfähig, and less enriched uranium" Lukashenko said at the time. 
"This is our commodity. We are not dirty bombs, and we will sell it to anyone." 
"We use it solely for research purposes, that is all." 
Belarus approached, however, a few months ago, the United States, when it signaled interest in meeting an agreement. 
The first attempt to remove the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly difficult because the material was easily contaminated by radiation, officials say. 
It was loaded into a Spezialzug load, the more than 1.300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal of, say officials. 
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the officials by plane. 
The U.S. government is paying for this $14 million, with much of the money flowing into the research with low-enriched uranium, which can be used for nuclear weapons. 
"This was a coordinated and, in order to build confidence" to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, which is working on the global threat reduction. 
The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende studies that Belarus this year at least £88 waffenfähhigen uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus wants to dissolve the joint agreement be camp until 2012. 
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights. 
But the statement Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement. 
"The progress of this global security issues, heißend, the United States of America and Belarus announced that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a key issue in the improvement of bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens" she said.
