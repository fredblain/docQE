Controllers in the twilight zone 
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa with Crops experimental industry. 
Now the group of experts test biotech formulated this accusation, which sees itself as an independent institute for the study of the impact of biotechnology. 
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well" said test biotech boss Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich. 
The head of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified crops, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert for years the lobbyists Ilsi under contract. 
The will of companies such as Monsanto, Bayer Nestle or paid. 
Kuiper contributed significantly to the Efsa testing requirements for Crops and worked in a clear conflict of interest, Then. 
The Efsa rules are absatzweise word for word, with the Ilsi position papers and had the hallmarks of the industry, which is controlled by the authority in Italian Parma. 
It was the second time that indication test biotech a conflict of interest. 
It should be a high-level Efsa manager recently without conditions or transitional period for the Swiss agricultural company Syngenta farm - and have changed sides. 
The German radio (MDR) had recently personal links between exercise and industry lobby, which has made the Federal Office, as well as suspicious. 
The Efsa can see no conflict of interest. 
We refer to all serious data, also in the industry, as long as they are of high quality, says in a statement. 
The experts who work for Efsa, we do not demand that they have no contact with the industry. 
But They have to disclose. 
Kuiper gives his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United states. 
This describes himself as a neutral forum for experts from academia, industry and policy - among other things, the risk assessment for biotechnology without lobby. 
In the case of criticising independent experts as Then that genetically modified Crops currently without any attempt to feed animals and shall not tested the response of Crops environmental influences. 
"We want to know, for example, genetically modified maize on the field" says Then. 
Current practice, only isolated proteins to test but not the whole Genpflanze what am no reliable results. 
"If it is not the risks, how do you find them?", asks Then accusing. 
It also provides Angelika Hilbeck. 
The research scientist since 1994 in the engineering and is currently at the Technical University of Zurich. 
The industry is trying in this area, as in the United States in Europe more and more to influence critical scientists or discredit. 
There was therefore hardly researchers who are intertwined with corporations. 
For business critical studies were published in the rule. 
"The industry controls the security research" said Hilbeck.
