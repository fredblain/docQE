In september, he said a Russian television, when he was asked about an article, which suggests that he is corrupt: "it is crazy, it is bad, it is dirty." 
Take The believe an incredibly large number of Russians that their corrupt society. The surveys showed. 
But it is unusual that, as happened in the report of the ambassador, individuals, and it is unheard of that happening by a diplomat from a foreign country.

The report also says that the FSB money from the largest firms and arrested by the police small businessmen. 
A source, is, "said that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to the protection of the FSB and MVD (and not by organised crime), because they are not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law." 
"This is why not ask the protection by criminal gangs as before."
