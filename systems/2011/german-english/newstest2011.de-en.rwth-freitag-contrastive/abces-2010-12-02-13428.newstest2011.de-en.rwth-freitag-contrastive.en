No objections to the Spanish Government against CIA flights 
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners on Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as a telegram from the U.S. a. Ambassador in Madrid. 
This reflects the Wikileaks enhüllten and the daily newspaper "El País" (via cable) the documents. It adds that the former deputy leader María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, the Spanish Government should be informed, "to show that foreign aircraft flying over Spain, are monitored properly." 
In June 2006, after the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the aid to human rights practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, was indicted, discussed the former American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega. 
The deputy leader admitted that the report of the Council, "Zapatero met on the sidelines" and Spain have nothing to hide in this matter. 
"De la Vega, Spain have no objection to the secret flights via Spanish territory." 
"They want to be informed simply", not "unprepared to be surprised" said Aguirre via cable. 
The former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the ambassador pointed out that the Spanish government "did not want to pay great attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, since these are in the hands of the judges." 
The prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez was in January 2007 the message that the judicial initiative, the declassification of documents from the Spanish intelligence headquarters (CNI) and to request would not block the defence minister on the CIA flights. 
"These reports contain no burdensome or sensitive information" said the ambassador after a meeting with the prosecutor. 
Nevertheless, the United States was on the "apparent coordination between the Spanish and German prosecutors' more than on the deklassifizierte information of the CNI and Department of Defense. 
"This coordination between independent Untersuchern will complicate our efforts to discreet handling between governments" bemoaned Aguirre. 
At a lunch in March 2007, attended the ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, commented that "although the Spanish judges incredibly heavily on their independence and do what they think is appropriate" he gave his staff instructions, "sexed up" to avoid rhetorical comments to abate the tension. " 
The ambassador also expressed his concern about the way the PP in this matter. 
"Despite their generally pro-American stance our experience teaches us that will no doubt the PP, a sign that the government's actions of the United States, which could be interpreted as a possible human rights violations, have deliberately ignored or tolerated, will propose capital, even if these revelations could have a negative effect on the government of the United States" he says.
