Affair even Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediating role for Syria 
In more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of even Reiss, a young French researcher who in Iran for "espionage" was detained, the French public gasping for breath, the diplomacy in alert and focused the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran. 
All this under the attentive eyes of diplomats from the United States. 
The WikiLeaks and obtained by the newspaper Le Monde durchgesehenen American documents give some background to this crisis. 
They describe how the Elysée the Americans his strategy, which went as far as this advice for dealing with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of Wanderern). 
They show how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young Frenchwoman the release of Majid Kakavand, have an in France, and by the American justice due to trade with material in favor of the Iranian nuclear program Iraners wanted to Gegeleistung. 
Finally, it is the way in which the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media to make this the idea that the Syrian President Bashar Al Assad have played a central role in the liberation of even husk rice, in a harsh light. 
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard. 
An on 12 August 2009 in Paris redigiertes diplomatic telegram entitled "iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hijackings." 
François Richier, Elysée adviser strategy, accompanied by reason Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone. 
They said the French method. 
The advised The Americans to do everything from sending their own nationals who were forcibly detained in Iran. 
"Noise", they said, "is loud and clear" the words' basic human rights, "innocence", "immediate release" in the media. 
This is necessary in order to bring the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image. 
"This is all the more so, since you ask the Iranians not to do so." 
Because "silence solves nothing" over the discussion about attempts to unauffälligem routes, the Iranians are "masters in time-wasting tactics". 
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners a "normal" Iranian tactic: "hostage to political blackmail". 
He announced the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (on 16 August, on the day they take refuge in the French Embassy) "demand the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians' (230.000 EUR bail). 
And he said, the Elysée am anticipating further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will become even more acute." 
The Iranians could "in the near future, another of the roughly 1.800 French citizens who live in Iran" he said.

Even Reiss is twelve days ago, will continue to have been released from prison in Iran. 
The information was circulated: the Iranians Majid Kakavand, whose extradition to the United States due to illegal trade in empfindlichem electronics materials to Iran, has been sacked after the decision of a judge in Paris. 
The American Embassy, like many other observers, questions on this disturbing coincidence. 
For Washington, the illegal Iranian networks of the nuclear programme material, the release of Majid Khakavand bad news. 
France has taken a horse-trading? 
The liberation of the Iraners against the French? 
During a meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assured that this is not the case. 
The Elysée, he says, not only was "completely surprised by the decision of the judge", but have also tried, guts. 
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision" he says. 
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remain under "strict" supervision of the French secret service. 
The Elysée adviser chooses a telephone number, then informed the American diplomat, the Iranians "are currently in the chair of the Iranian embassy buildings in Paris." 
While not without damaging the detention of even Reiss in Iran spares the Elysée his efforts, through statements and by the media, "flight testing" believe that the Syrian President Bashar Al Assad playing a "significant" and "influential intermediary role". 
The Americans are watching this activity is not without irony and that the manipulation, as several press articles in the official French version. 
A 25th of August 2009 datierendes telegram "the media, the French authorities'. 
Why there was so much "expression of thanks to Mr Assad, the Paris embassy. 
"Despite their declarations of Lobpreis, the French authorities that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians". 
The document also deals with the reasons that have brought the Elysée to indulge this fiction. 
The intensive communication efforts "aims to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria" he analysed. 
A 2008 policy, which was "was perceived by many critics votes in France and abroad as premature and undeserved." 
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" Paris "to Syria, can achieve what we laud by playing a constructive role in the region". 
The aim is also to "discord between Syria and Iran." 
The American Embassy know from good source. 
On 11 August, François Richier her, "of course we do not know whether the Syrians whatever". 
"But we have with them." 
"This should at least confusion on the part of the Iranians".
