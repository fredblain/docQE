Rachsüchtige hackers and is spies 
The affair WikiLeaks has a double meaning. 
On one side, it turns out the obvious scandal, a scandal, which is simply a scandal in Sinner hypocrisy, the Beziehunge between states, the public and the press. 
On the other hand, it has announced major changes at international level, and is a foretaste of the regression, future. 
But we are moving in the right order. 
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each of the intelligence produced acts (x) exclusively from any nation Zeitungsausschnitten. 
For months, American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi's "extraordinary" nothing more than what we read in each x Journal (except for those whose owners Berlusconi), and the appalling karikaturierte profile Gaddafi's Kabarettkünstlern already for a long time for their skits. 
The rule, not the secret files from previous news, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century. 
If you go into a library dedicated esotherischen publications, you will see that each station (via the Grail, the mystery of Rennes le Chateau, the Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) repeated exactly what has been written in previous works. 
This is not, therefore, that wants to publish the author occult texts (no research yet that he did not know where news about exist), but because those who dedicate themselves to the Okkultismus, nothing else than to believe what they already know and what they have learned. 
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown. 
As the secret files. 
The informant is lazy, lazy (or limited mental) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise could be, for example, editor of Libération), the only by what he considered a true. 
The Top Secret information on Berlusconi, who had sent the U.S. embassy in Rome, Staatsdezernat, were the same as those who had published Newsweek published the week before. 
So why was such a fuss about the revelations of this dossier? 
On one side are those that know any educated person knows, and that the messages - can call at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the Government each other or take a plane, in order to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small tasks, have turned into espionage centres. 
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that pretend to ignore it. 
Nevertheless, the fact that to repeat it publicly, the task of hypocrisy and serves the American diplomacy in a bad light. 
Second: the idea that can tap a x any hackers geheimsten the secrets of the most powerful country in the world, poses a significant blow to the prestige of the Staatsdezernats. 
In addition, the scandal less victims, rather than the "executioner". 
But we are giving the profound nature of what happened. 
Formerly, to Orwell's time, all power as a Big Brother, every gesture of his subjects are controlled. 
Orwell's prophecy could prove as absolutely right, where every movement, thanks to the telephone, each made transaction, visited the hotel, the elected motorway and so on; the citizens would become the victims of the eye of power. 
But if you consider what is happening today that can escape the secret Krypten power over the control of a Hackers, listening to the control of, unilaterally and will zirkelförmig. 
The power controlled every citizen, every citizen, or at least the hackers - chosen as an avenger of the citizen - can bring the secrets of power. 
How can a power that is no longer able to maintain their own secrets? 
It is true, Georg Simmel said that is a real mystery a hollow secret (and an open secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's basically a secret free of Geheimis, because it exposes the public sphere; in the styles of Wiki Leaks openly that the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty secrets, to deprive them of power. 
WikiLeaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wronged, but Clinton and Obama. 
What will be the consequences of this grievance, which has caused a huge power? 
It is obvious that the Member States in future no longer reserved information online - which would amount to angeklebten posting on the street corner. 
But it is also clear that the current technologies is to be able to keep confidential reports on telephone. 
Nothing is easier than figuring out whether and when a head of state in a plane and has contacted one of his colleagues. 
How could be maintained in future private and only for certain ears relations? 
I know very well that my prediction on science fiction and romanhaft sounds at the moment, but I am compelled me to imagine the government agents, on secret way actively to uncontrollable march routes moving their communications than anywhere else in the mere memory in order, and the few written information that they, in the footwear (verbergend. 
The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically the espionage attempt by Watergate had less success, as wikileaks. 
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is like a cancer, namely backwards. 
A century after the Telegraph wireless communications, reconstructed the Internet with A Telegrafen (telephone) wire. 
The (analogue) video cassettes had the film, a film for auszukundschaften enabled researchers spulen and reveal all the secrets of the assembly, while the (digital) CDs nowadays nothing other than to jump from chapter to chapter, macro portions. 
With the high-speed trains within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this requires by plane, including switching three and a half hours. 
It is not unusual that return policy and communications technology on car and horse. 
One final observation. 
In earlier times tried to understand the press, which have been forged between the embassies were forged. 
Currently, there are the messages, the confidential information from the press.
