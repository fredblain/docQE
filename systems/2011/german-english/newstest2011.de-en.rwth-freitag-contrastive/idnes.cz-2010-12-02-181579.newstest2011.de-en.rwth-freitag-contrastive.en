The right mattress and right beds rust? Women have other desires than men 
The tollste bed frame, but the quality of the deck area - the good bed mattress and rust. 
These must complement each other, in order to meet the wishes of the specific user. 
In choosing to play a role - the weight, size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the Schläfers. 
Equally important is the Interieur, mattress and rust. 
Typical example? 
In a weekend house In which are not regularly, are not Latex mattresses, because they need much longer, "hot". 
In addition, they are much more difficult than usual Polyurethan mattresses. 
And, they should be changed regularly. 
If they do not have enough Entlüftungskanälchen at its core, and on a hard disk, moisture movement: it is not excluded that tape from it. 
Of course, also plays a role in the election, which is used to. 
Anyone who has been a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with Weichschicht, will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with hard surface. 
"All ice hockey players who have returned from the NHL, have complained to me that they cannot sleep properly." 
"For their abgeschundenen shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a Weichschicht from Visco sparkling (memory Foam - a form of memory Polymer)." 
"I recommend including diabetic people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, causing the" information "from the ligaments and skin badly" said Sylva Hadamcziková who specialised in padded furniture. 
That is why I have many years ago ice hockey players, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco sparkling (Memory foam). 
"Today, it is no longer a problem, because such mattresses provide the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico." 
And we must not necessarily be a famous ice hockey players, the benefits of the Visco surfactants, to learn. 
This "miracle" actually works quite simple. 
The sparkling optimalisiert his toughness and form the heat absorbed, in other words, he schmiegt by a warm body. 
Nowhere is there, in the night shifts are not around, after a major battle. 
It is simply sleeping much better. 
The viskoelastische sparkling also offers protection against Dekubitus (advising). 
In the election of the mattress size should add to body size is still the length of the foot soles, or some 21 to 34 cm. 
Man and woman who are in the 180 cm tall, need a 210 to 220 cm bed. 
Each of the sleepers should be at least 90 cm space available, 180 cm. 
In separate beds, for example, In singles, 120 to 140 cm. 
The comfort, and also for any visitors. 
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb for the ideal bed width: "if you on the back, should be enough room for the easy angewinkelten arms" advises every Helena Prokopová, the guild of the Polsterer and Raumausstatter, which for many years the issue of healthy makes and the ergonomics of furniture and at specialist schools. 
In a double bed everybody needs its own rust and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are also high. 
Otherwise, there is nothing for it, as the Roste in differing degrees to fit and it is not possible for each bed. 
Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with the skeleton 15 cm, should account for at least three centimetres in the form of class and fine cushion. 
"With the hand or placing may feel the feathers in any case" warns Helen Prokopová. 
Any mattress requires a special type of rust. 
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document as union of Siam twins have to be found in the bedroom. 
These mattresses are not and cannot wash, which is already common practice today. 
And since you lose in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 litres of sweat, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years, becoming a huge (And congested sieve). 
Experts also reject advertising slogans, the mattress with a lifespan of up to 25 years, and even a lifetime guarantee. 
Every case has its ifs and buts. 
And it is therefore a practical advice from dealers: mattress of 120 or 140 cm width should the hygiene of waschbaren, not abziehbaren salary, however, it is recommended to use a Matratzenschoner, and wash it easily. 
Even if Rundumreißverschluss usually mattresses salary with Rundumreißverschluss, so you get after the opening two halves (immensely important for the washing process and the washing machines size!), is the manipulation with larger mattresses, above all, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. 
They are in bed instead of a Rostes a record? 
Get Out! 
Or, for a bed for undesirable guests and for a single night. 
So should the disk with ventilation holes (if not included) use and mattresses with the skeleton and 15 cm minimum level with the Taschenfederkern and fine cushion. 
Polyurethan mattresses are not in such a document. 
For not verstellbare Roste setting with 14 to 18 (Lamellen) are Latex or sandwich mattresses (also combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay Roste with a larger number of standards, from 28 and more to do with Lordosenstütze in Lendenwirbelbereich and the ability to regulate the tough standards. 
On verstellbare Lamellen Roste no mattresses with the skeleton, because they do not respond to the workplace ergonomics disguise. 
In addition to the suspension of the Steife will be offered special flexible shoulder modules. 
This is about a specific fastening the services that makes it possible einzudrücken the pen, or to verwinkeln so that they allow the specific Einsinken the shoulder of the Schläfers. 
Especially for men with broad shoulders, an important matter. 
There are even mattress manufacturers, which have started, "gentlemen mattresses" Weichzonen for the shoulder area. 
The ladies - is intended to give these Weichzonen in the Hüftgegend. 
For ambitious customers are punktelastische Flügelfedersysteme (Lattoflex) or Roste with punktelastischen Pads contact with the Multitorsionsfederung. 
The pressure will be distributed at several points, thus reducing the tension. 
But - if the right mattress and rust a bad (too large and fülliges) used pillow, spent most of the benefits. 
Here, too, a rule of thumb: the pillow to prop up the head, his top should extend only to the shoulders, so that the back muscles relax. 
Ideal is therefore a 50 x 60 cm deep cushions, as it may, for example, the Scandinavians. 
In the pages of the pillow (along with the Schulterentlastungszone in rust or the Weichzone in the mattress) make up the back. 
Some of our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (but) straw bags with hay. 
Modern companies increasingly use natural materials, or at least their mixtures. 
Also in mattresses says the new magic word "organic". 
Instead of oil raw materials used in the manufacture of Polyurethan foaming having increasingly naturelle oils - for example, Rizinus and soya oil. 
Soya is used well known by all manufacturers. 
"Organic mattresses, which says its nuclear materials is purely natural" said Petr Vašíček by the company Tropico Plus. 
Naturstoffe but also to be used in the manufacture of mattresses - one of the first was Aloe Vera. 
But one can also micro capsules, which spread the sleeping fresh forest or Lavendelduft. 
Here is a difference between a man and a woman. 
While the men "kühlender" plant extracts from birch leaves, so that the mattress to absorb the heat and cool the body can have the salary for women "wärmende" effect. 
Extracts from red Paprikaschoten stimulate the blood circulation, the weaker sex when the sleeping wohlig warm. 
And today's favorite? 
Mattresses from Kaltschaum (he has greater Poren with destroyed cell structure and is therefore atmungsaktiver than standard Polyurethan and much more flexible). 
Through the combination of the various Steife (severity) of Kaltschäumen and Visco foaming having additional zones mattresses, who know exactly where to head, hip and heels. 
For a quality mattress, though, has to fork out 7000 kroner and more. 
Gesundheitsmatratzen but usually with lower value added tax, since they apply as medical device. 
The first Czech companies was Gumotex this advantage. 
You see, the mattress and not to save the rust is so easily. 
And there are special offers from manufacturers and retailers who offer two mattresses for the price of one. 
The brand Magniflex the mattress Duofreeze with in relation verstepptem Visco sparkling Memory for 11.990 CZK. 
The second you get free. 
It was the Tempur material that launched the era of viskoelastischen sparkling substances with open cell structure and high density in almost kosmischem pace. 
No wonder, when they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to the launch of enormous excessive impositions. 
Tempur will heat in soft, entrenched in a cool environment it again. 
So it suits the human body and distributed in an optimal manner the pressure. 
It is therefore not only an ideal to prevent fire, but generally increased sleep comfort. 
Viskoelastische sparkling substances are not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as the, in particular Fußpolstern, allowing the legs and the factors that facilitate. 
Domestic manufacturers, for example, the sparkling substances Eucatherm C, Twin KiwiSaver or similar products.
