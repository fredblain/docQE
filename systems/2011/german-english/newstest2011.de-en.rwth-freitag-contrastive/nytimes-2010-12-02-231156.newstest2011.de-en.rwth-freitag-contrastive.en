Cheshire appeal draws attention to Twitter 
Half a dozen of them tippten in the riots in the courtroom. 
In the minutes verschickten on Twitter their reports on grausige testimonies. 
In the end, the defence, there were more than 140.000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and beds gekettete children in a house that go up in flames. 
On Thursday, the process closely followed by Steven j. Hayes, who was indicted, three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to find an official end, if the ruling on the death sentence, the jury. 
But mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted applications to court, the reasons for an appeal and will employ the courts for years. 
One of the provozierendsten reasons is that it through the intense coverage of the process - through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporter - to a "circus atmosphere" and such a widespread, swift penetration rebel details, so that the jury had been illegally by the public outrage. 
This objection could lead the Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules in the courtroom is necessary. 
"As I have seen during this process, I believe that there is a real danger that if the arrival of new technologies in the courtroom to each individual's right to a fair trial" said Thomas j. Ullman, mr. Hayes' main defender. 
The presiding judge, Jon c. Blue chamber of the Supreme Court last week the applications by decision succinctly when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion. 
But it was certainly not the last word in this matter. 
For decades, the appeals court noted that the reporting of famous notorious cases doubts about the fairness of the process. 
In his historic 1966 decision, the Supreme Court of the United States the ruling against Dr Sam Sheppard, osteopaths from Cleveland, which is to have killed his wife, lifted and said in its ruling that because of the new Media "a carnival atmosphere in the courtroom". 
Some believe that the television series and the movie "on the run" based on this crime. 
Some say lawyers, court appeals, which mr. Hayes condemnation for half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary, the channels of communication from the courtroom, which is currently the case of Dr. Sheppard still inconceivable. 
"There is a good reason, on the impact of new media in processes, which will be followed by a public concern" said John j. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut. His report, they is imposed arbitrarily. 
Professor said Donohue, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of instant communications from the courtroom, could make the process fairer. 
The Twitter is just one of many that The lawyers of mr. Hayes to discuss for years and delay a condemnation. 
The defenders claim, for example, that mr. Hayes already explanation, as judges Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential judges, by giving them during the almost-certain selection grausige scene photos. 
Some of the judges said that photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke Petit, 48 years, and their TÃ¼chter, Hayley, 17 years, and thanking, 11 years, they would have with disgust. 
The defenders say that they would also call into question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judges have exchanged a jury, a critic of the prosecutor's office, and that he had improperly exerted pressure on the ruling, as he had made the unusual decision to ask the jury over on the weekend. 
The judges were not isolated. 
But their arguments about the influence of the extensive coverage of the process is perhaps the greatest interest. 
In a judgment, which they have submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American Senate candidate. 
They argued that the new media continually the flames of emotion on the case. 
"Such a crush of media Scandinavia, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom" wrote the lawyers, "has seen it before in New Haven, and perhaps not even nationwide." 
Focusing on Twitter's reporting is controversial. 
In interviews, some journalists that the assertion that these are rabble-rousing than direct news reports, the slower, a technikfeindlicher, the verarme reporting about future processes verarme. 
But some lawyers, Appelationsgerichte would often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes need the Adaptation through the courts. 
Mr. Hayers lawyers reinforce this claim. 
In their appeal to the Supreme Court's decision of 1966, In which the condemnation of Dr Sheppard due to the reporting and made it clear that the new media, new rules. 
"This case" they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
