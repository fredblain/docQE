An electoral defeat 
Nobody had expected that the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect. 
But the facts, the fears of election workers, who rushed to help the war-torn country. 
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast in the Rinnstein, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problems. 
Polling stations opened with watching late. 
Many Haitians, many of whom were displaced by the earthquake in January, homeless roamed around in search of a choice. 
Some were then. 
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged, on the basis of an alleged fraud in the election results. 
Across the country, sometimes violent protests. 
Nevertheless, Edmund Mulet, the head of the u. n. mission in Haiti, the election as "quite good in many respects". 
According to a cautious statement of observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "these irregularities, so serious they may be, not necessarily the process invalid." 
In other words, the show goes on. 
The election authority, the supposedly the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jew Célestin, is obliged, the preliminary results on 7 December. 
The expected run-off is scheduled for January. 
There is still hope in the election. 
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel, Elly and the former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial marriage annulment proceedings. 
If Jew Célestin, with voters have little or no support from the Wahlberhörde declared the winner of the run-off, this could lead to problems. 
Because of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of earthquake victims still living in tents, fear a low turnout. 
On election day, many Haitians were prevented by lack of organisation of the vote. 
Shortly before the start of the election were approximately 250.000 cards, which are needed, not yet. 
There is a lot at stake. 
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognized as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti. 
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
