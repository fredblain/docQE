Métro Grand Paris: first financial vignettes 
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy on the Ile de France is in full swing, it rains billion. 
At least in the discussions. 
Recall, in particular, the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro, which should be built by the Société du Grand Paris. 
In order to guide the construction of the SGP, has declared the state of $4 billion. 
In theory, this is the amount that would allow the SGP and to on the part of the financial markets to their Zweifachen. 
Today it is finally to first projections. 
The supplementary budget for 2010, looked at this morning by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly, which contains the measures, the first part of this money. 
There are two measures: the creation of a special tax to Erschließund and higher taxation of office on the Ile de France. 
The former, remove Article 15 of the draft law, "to the benefit of the public service broadcaster Société du Grand Paris". 
This is: "the product of this tax amounts to EUR 117 million per year." 
Zweitere is an overhaul of existing corporate taxation: "to modernise it, in order to increase the product resulting from it, and this increase the Société du Grand Paris". 
How much would it? 
A mystery. 
This amount is calculated not in the text. 
Of the 4 billion is far away. 
"It states that the fiscal resources to the 4 billion EUR capital allocation, which will be paid by the state and the Société du Grand Paris for the project" says the explanatory statement. 
The SGP is not this system at all offensive. 
"Since the moment when we recorded revenue (the two taxes, that r.), the design over three years and then from the 4 billion" he said. 
"This will be noted in the budget and gradually withdrawn". 
The SGP estimated that will be launched in 2013, taking 4 billion for the 2014 budget. 
This measure, which will be able to seek 4 billion promised, is in danger, a very turbulent, parliamentary debate. 
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
