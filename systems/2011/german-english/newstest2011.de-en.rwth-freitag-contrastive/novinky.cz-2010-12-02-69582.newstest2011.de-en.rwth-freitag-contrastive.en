Czech children get drunk with'and rum, beer is out - it is simply too slow 
', rum and vodka, for once, a good whisky, has stolen the father of the house from the bar. 
These are the drinks, must be drunk Czech teenager under fifteen most frequently. 
No exceptions are Children, who must ausschlafen their hangover repeatedly in the hospital. 
This comes from the experience of doctors who are faced with similar cases in the inclusion of children's departments of clinics. 
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion, because it takes too long to be drunk." 
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol" said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the chief doctor of the children's department in the mittelböhmischen clinic Hořovice. 
"A bottle of Whisky, if it is successful, the father of the House bar, and if not, then at least'or vodka. 
"Vodka has the advantage that it can interfere with juice, then it is not so much" said the chief doctor. 
The speaker of the hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him right. 
"Most often refers to Branca or rum." 
"This is the current trend of alcohol, particularly in primary schools." 
"It was also about slivovice, you take from home", Mrs Jurinová. 
Chefarzt Pelikán according to thirteen or -year drinkers in the hospital receiving no exception. 
Before the clinic in Hořovice, from which he has been working for this year, he was ten years in the paediatric ward of the hospital, where the Motol ambulances angetrunkene pupils from local and long distance. 
"A girl had to be hospitalisiert four times." 
"Their career began with 12 years ago, when they first with 3.5 mg of alcohol in the blood and in combination with" Extase "was taken" the doctor describing a particularly severe case. 
"It was in the exhibition site in Holešovice on any dance party." 
"The interesting thing was that it was not their mother, strange that their daughter home 48 hours" the chief doctor. 
The lack of interest to parents or their incredible tolerance toasts with their own Sprösslingen is regarded as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism by children. 
A real dependence in the true sense of the word is not, according to experts in children. 
"Alcoholism is a longstanding chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomenon and that is not the case in these children." 
Among those who repeatedly alcohol, is mostly a negative family social Background characteristic, "said chief doctor Pelikán. 
The Speaker of the hospital Motol, Mrs Jurinová, were trained by mid-November approximately forty drunken children in the abandonment of children and youth. 
However, only the cases with severe alcohol poisoning, which made a hospital stay is required, in the statistics. 
Drunken children who are taken to ambulatory care from parents or, if necessary, by the police, are not registered. 
Apart from the cases in which children just as a bottle of spirits in the school austrinken there are of the opinion of Mr Pelikán three jahreszeitliche Amplituden, which is totally unreliable: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year. 
"The latter for two reasons - either from distress because of the bad certificate or joy at the holidays." 
"In the Walpurgisnacht I have experienced in the opening seven drunken children at once" said Dr Pelikán. 
A betrunkenes child who spend the night under medical supervision, paradoxically, is better off than a child, the next day, with a nasty hangover. 
The headaches in the morning, can result from dehydration and lack of glucose, is in hospital with a flüssigkeitsspendenden infusion of glucose and nutrients, the organism. 
"They are clearly better off, because after the" beautiful "experience in the evening, with good humour, without doing anything to hurt." 
"They are just confused about where they are" admits a doctorate Pelikán, although it is polluting the patients at least sometimes the good humour, by listing them the costs that they will cost the treatment. 
Because the transport with the ambulances and the night in an Akutbett well and to a few tens of thousand kronor. 
"I have used it as an educational tool, if I have calculated directly to children during the visit, which took their drunkenness and that it may well happen that they must work in the whole holiday on to earn the money for a single such Fete" added Dr Pelikán added. 
In his view, the health insurance but not procedures, the demand for the trunkenen children any costs incurred by the parents.
