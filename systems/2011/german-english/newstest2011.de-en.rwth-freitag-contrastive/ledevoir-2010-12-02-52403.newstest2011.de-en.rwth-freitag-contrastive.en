The secret of komplexgeschüttelten Canada lifted 
The new, American diplomats, which have been disseminated by wikileaks, reveal the mystery about what the United Nations under the Minderwertigkeitskomplex the Canadians to the Americans, but at the same time the latter to Canada. 
Consequently, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters to the ballot kanadisch American relations, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government to enforce its budget by 2009. 
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, the public were told yesterday, offer more juicy details of the substantive content, a very bad. 
One of 22 September 2008 carved, i. e. in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage in full swing, reported, which do not join the United Nations more of their political leaders. 
The great surprise of David Wilkins, in Ottawa, the American ambassador. 
Mr Wilkins offers various channels this situation. 
"The Canadians almost economic slowdown Minderwertigkeitskomplex led the Canadian, political leaders have much to talk about the issues of everyday life, as the United States in this election the buck (as happened during the 1988 campaign on free trade)" he says. 
The United Nations, he concludes, is "The proverbial Goliath this election: omnipresent, but potentially threatening to speak of him". 
The ambassador understands the "deafening silence" the less, since the two countries have close political and economic relations. 
"Logically", he said, "should be the ability of a candidate, party and much more of a party leaders to run such a vital relationship, which has the voters at the polls as a key factor in the sense." 
The other, this sense of importance is in on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, broadcast communication, to prepare the President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa. 
"Their trip will help the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, which will give Canada its first deficit after more than a decade, on the basis of a recovery program in the $30 to $40 billion" Breese. 
Nowhere he had mentioned that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas, in order to ensure that Parliament would throw the coalition of opposition parties and would have an impact on the quality of the proposed recovery programme. 
Further, in January 2008 and carved from the ambassador Wilkins written communication Washington from the increasingly negative image that the broadcast on CBC, dramatic series in the United States. 
The ambassador is concerned about how Border, calls Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" can watch or payments for the purposes of Muskelprotze of CIA interrogations. 
Yet another communication reported at length about how Hillary Clinton with her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting on whether Europe is prepared to accept some detainees from Guantanamo. 
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question, however, on the basis of an individual "case-by-case" decision. 
Àm end of the meeting, described as ", he has given the state secretary a paper on Khadr Omar, a 15 - year-old Muslim Canadian origin." 
"The Secretary of State has pledged to look through the acts again." 
Finally, we note that the mood on the Web site WikiLeaks. 
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very closely related adviser on CBC, said that the person responsible for this massive leak "should be killed". 
He had talked to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
