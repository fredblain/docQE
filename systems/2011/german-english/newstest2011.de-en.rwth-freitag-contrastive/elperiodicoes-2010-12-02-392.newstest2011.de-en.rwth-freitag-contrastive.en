In the pursuit of Wikileaks chief 
Obama appoints a heavy responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new revelations. 
Interpol is a red warning and detect Assange. 
Everything with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, who is a complicated maze, in which to investigate the facts only difficult. 
Yesterday Interpol "red alert" to "detect and pursue" of Assange. 
But it is not a traditional orders to arrest. 
In addition, it is not new, it dates from 20 november. 
It has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the allegations of sexual abuse, which must face the Australians in Sweden. 
Also assured the lawyer of the founder of WikiLeaks, Mark Stephens, "the police know where and how they are in contact with Mr Assange." 
On 20, the international police agency based in Lyon (France) at the request of the order, but it was not until yesterday after receiving the power by the Swedish authorities. 
That is the case. The 188 Interpol countries need to identify and locate Assange, "in order to provisionally arrest and extradite him." 
Although Interpol arrest of a red warning affected individuals, many member countries according to the organization's red warning as a licence for an Arrestierung - must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreements, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange probably. 
The move outraged Assanges lawyers who yesterday published a letter in which they were informed that the 39 - year-old founder of Wikileaks prepared by video conference to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities. 
They also recall that Assange's exit from Sweden and requested by the prosecutor, with the sagenumwobenen Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the security chief of Stalin, "authorization. 
"This is like a hunting, not as a legal persecution", in the letter. 
While the world is looking for him - and his mother of Australia from the innocence of their son - Assange himself in an location, but not in silence. 
On Monday he was the head of Time magazine by Skype from an unspecified location for an interview. The conversation he requested the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the United states. 
"If it can be proved that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to the u. n. to spy on and did not breach of the United States signed international agreements, should resign" he said. 
His opinion was yesterday from the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, condemned the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd." 
"I am not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website" he told the CNN. 
Obama himself has a heavy responsibility for the fight against terrorism, Rusell Travers, tasked with preventing new documents revelations. 
The attempt by the spokesman of the Pr√§sidenden Barack Obama, Assange to pay less attention, contrary to the opinions, the conservative politicians and commentators in recent days. 
Congressman Peter king, the January chaired the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organisations, "in order to seize their money and everyone who supports or contributes to follow." 
Tom Flanagan, adviser to the Canadian Minister Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had his statement that Assange "murdered" revoked. 
"Obama should it into a target and not use a manned aircraft or what." 
Anyone who was not apologized, Mike Huckabee, baptistischer minister, a former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate. 
"Whoever it was, in the government information leaked, he is guilty of treason and everything that no execution, is eiine too lenient punishment" he told the broadcaster Fox.
