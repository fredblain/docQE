Zapatero and the red line of Germany 
Berlin has opted for the keeping the EUR, but at the same time, conditions for the whole of the European Union. 
The tension on the markets have triggered a two-fold response from the government. 
On the one hand, has produced José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and micro enterprises, the regulation of temporary work agencies or the lifting of the EUR 426 of support for the unemployed, not unemployment benefits, to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of airports and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery. 
On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible for the current crisis herausbeschwört. 
How to understand these events? 
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is no fault of their public relations. 
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the EUR. 
It is Germany a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future, with the maintenance of the old traditions of much of its partners. 
In the face of resistance in Europe begins to spekuliern in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis. 
The first, a strong EUR with Germany, austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south to leave the EUR area. 
Second: the reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - though it sounds like science fiction - supported by a majority of public opinion, approximately 50 percent of the population. 
The third: a restructuring of the EUR under German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict financial management; penalties for countries that exceed the targets; möglichereweise the default of certain countries, as well as the extension of the costs of potential measures to the private sector. 
The German position is clear and has been for some time. Therefore, there is now no excuses. 
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission incentives for deficits and the German government came up with a constitutional reform, in order to prevent this from 2016. 
It was the first signs of the polarisation between what Germany (strict fiscal plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. 
The second sign, the Central European country, as hinausschob Merkel's decision to rescue Greece. 
At that time was heavily criticised. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion totally opposed to a bailout of Greece. 
Finally, Merkel in recent days of October with a clear position. It calls for a reform of the European Union, in order to facilitate the rescue of a country and at the same time, the private lenders to pay a portion of the costs. 
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, since the Ireland crisis and everything. 
But their proposal, if somewhat sweetened, was adopted. In the coming months we will be in the reform of the European union, these measures from 2013 to participate. 
Germany has drawn a red line, not to exceed. 
It says all that - even if It must be taken now unpopular measures - there will be no of this date the functioning of the EUR. 
2013 will be the year of birth of a new monetary area, in which the offending countries be severely punished, may be forced to declare itself insolvent and, in this case, the private sector must play a part of the costs. 
Germany shows us that we must take a strong growth rate, high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances. 
The alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as she was led by Spain in boom times, will not be tolerated. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would do poorly, not to understand it. 
It is not only about runterzufahren the government deficit by the year 2013 to three percent. 
The demands are much tougher. 
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, is to cheat ourselves. 
I hope that the current turbulence in more calm. 
And the opportunities that will be offered, And will use the spring of 2013. 
It seems that Zapatero, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that, despite the criticism of Merkel's hypothesis, to their own house in order, had their way. 
But the Germany of red line is there, and it does not seem that would change. 
Among the possibilities is that we should leave the countries with little serious cramped EUR area, cannot be ruled out. 
In this case could say Germany still, it warned.
