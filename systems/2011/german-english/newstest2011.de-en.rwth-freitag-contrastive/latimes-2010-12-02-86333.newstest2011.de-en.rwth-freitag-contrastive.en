Arsenic resistant microbe could new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere 
The discovery of an alien species of bacteria, which can live of arsenic, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere. 
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is a sign that a life without the previously deemed as vital elements. 
"This organism has two options." 
"He needs to grow either phosphorus and arsenic." 
"This makes it to something very unusual, although it is almost a kind of'foreign' way of life" said c. w. Paul Davies of Arizona State University and Co author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science. 
So far, have been six main regarded as vital elements - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. 
But the scientists figured out how, the bacterium in mono Lake even further when it replaced phosphorus, arsenic. 
"One wonders what else is possible" said the report's Co author Ariel d. Anbar of Arizona State University. 
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, we must recognize scientists and his life forms, Anbar. 
The study deals with microbes, which have been found on Earth. 
The announcement of a press conference in which no details were given to the discovery of known, led to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report by the discovery au√üerirdischen life. 
This is not the case. 
The discovery "shows that can put in other Planetary systems, with the help of other elements biochemical processes and that the standard elements that are absolutely essential in our opinion, are not necessarily clear" said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. 
Cockel was not part of the research teams. 
"This work is a new, because it shows that can be replaced in fundamental biochemical processes and structures an element of another" said Cockell added. 
This discovery was not accidental. 
Felisa Wolfe Simon from Astro Biological Institute of NASA, who led the study, chose the mono Lake due to the high arsenic content. 
As arsenic and phosphorus chemically identical, they assumed that microbes, which are both, can replace may be an element of the other. 
"The toxicity of the Arsens based mainly on the fact that it is chemically similar to how phosphorus." 
"This is the organisms are difficult to distinguish one from the other." 
"But the difference is so large that arsenic acts differently than phosphorus. It in our biochemisches system, where it covered almost everything" said Anbar. 
The researchers, the bacterium GFAJ- 1 arsenic concentration. It suited and grew. 
The microbe grows in phosphorus better, but that they can survive in arsenic, shows that the way of life, of course, either on the ground or on another planet or moon, on the arsenic. 
According to Jamie s. Foster, President of microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that can be replaced phosphorus, arsenic, not new. but so far there has been no functioning example. 
Arsenic came in the early Erdjahren more frequently, it says, so the science that early life forms that have been used. 
"There is reason to believe that life can also have developed differently than in the early period" Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe Simon's research team. 
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National health authorities.
