Tech toys keeps your gifts budget in balance 
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console ole. Both games can be a big hole in your gifts budget. 
An iPad costing as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price of a Kinect game about 10 classic Spring meets ropes or approximately 48 doses play Doh. 
But you can protect your gifts budget. 
I recently visited in search of three electronic toys under $80 three national toy merchants - a Walmart, a toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale club. 
I was immediately clear that Moore's Law entered into force. This year, the technology toys more efficient and cost less than last year. 
And although fewer new toys with its own website, the best-known of this kind, Webkinz and club Penguin, improved supply. 
There are more and more button cells toys on the market, and many of wiederaufladbare batteries. 
Here are a few recommendations. 
(unless otherwise stated, all prices of toys "R" Us.) 
Piper a ma jigs (Mattel, $13 for children 3 years) are Plüschfiguren, as big as guinea pig who sing a note when decided on its belly. 
It is a note, hassled by squeezing can play a song. 
Several sing a ma jigs sing in harmony. 
Warning: If you have started with the flick, can stop you. 
For a combination of Gesand and dancing is the Dance star Mickey (Fisher Price $60 for children from 2) is the best choice. 
On the basis of last year, Elmo Live technology offers the animatronische doll recantations as Simon says, and thanks to the new interface with Radblockierung dominated the Moon Walk. 
Children who have tested the device, Mickey as a dance teacher. Their parents complained about the lack of volume. 
If you are a child of the 80 s, you will remember, Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys. 
Now he is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for children from 3), with a whole bunch of cards, which can be a car journey to a lesson, with a preached with car correction function as a teacher. 
If you want to entrust your child, your smart phone, here are three independent alternatives. 
Mobi Go of VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and benutzerfreundlichste solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. The Games, however, are not as useful as the Leapster Explorer ($70 for children from 3 to 12), the following Leapfrogs first major revision of the Leapster series with a new, brighter screen. 
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes. 
Ixl of Fisher Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) used for the Games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the Kartenlaufwerks nrg4SD can also be seen family photos. 
Finally, there is still Scrabble Flash ($30 Hasbro, for children from 8). the five blocks are no bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen. 
At stake is about merging the blocks to words, before the time. It is great for an improvised Buchstabierwettbewerb. 
More and more toys have a kind of online. 
If you go alone after the offer in the toy shops, Webkinz and club Penguin. 
In order to give your child an online Penguin animal in the club Penguin, you can be a Disney club Penguin 2'mix' n match figures package ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code. 
If you type in the code online, your child to the club Penguin Store enough bill for two other parts. 
This can be wheelchair shoes or a Puffle animal. 
The latest head cells of micro robot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not bigger than the head of your toothbrush. 
The beetle is moving quickly to 12 vibrierenden silicone legs in any direction. 
It is fun to send him through a maze of Klötzen. 
And he thinks a lot. 
Our fell from the kitchen table and survived even some time in the foot of the dog.
