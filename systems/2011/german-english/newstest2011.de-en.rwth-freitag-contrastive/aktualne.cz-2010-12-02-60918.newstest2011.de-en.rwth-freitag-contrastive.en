What they do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague, Voldemort neither know nor the'culinary'. 
The new Council of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will have to overcome language barriers, it appears that some of their old new colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and to be able to understand in the town of representation. 
The newspaper aktuálně. Cz members of the new Council of the ČSSD a little "cut off", as they dominate the notorious slang that has become popular in recent years, in which the current coalition partners in Prague at the helm. 
The encoded vocabulary, which was introduced in the verflossenen era of Mayor Pavel Bém Prague by the political elite, some of the best-known actors, borrowed from situations and Causae. 
Surprisingly, it turns out that the new councils in relation to these new terminology. 
The claim, at least. 
"Anyone who is Voldemort?" 
"No idea." 
"I am a newcomer in the Prague policy", Lukáš Kaucký, the new councillor for Culture, the test of the "Godfather vocabulary." 
But also the Council, Mr Karel Březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar way. 
For example, the term'golf hole ". 
"This is the only expression of those who put me here, I use now and then." 
"I do not think much of slang." 
From the vocabulary, which was published in aktuálně. Cz days in this year's June before the election of the ODS, the editorial pickte six concepts, particularly those that are associated with the notoriously Prague magistrate. 
The Social Democrats, the term "Voldemort ',' biggest Prague golf hole" in the culinary, "bull neck" treason "and" verblechen ". 
Three Prague gentlemen of the Council approved the test, the fourth - Mr Weinert, the head of the Prague education - promised to begin his participation in the conversation, but not even the handset. 
The council, Mr Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset. 
"I don't care about these things are, and how the Civic Democrats, I do not." 
"For me, it is how we understand ourselves in our programmes" he responded. 
As indicated, Lukáš Kaucký in the abovementioned headline allegedly failed to recognize that the influential entrepreneurs and friend of the former Lord Mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek. 
The term "Voldemort" Kaucky says nothing and the only one that he erriet correctly, the test was "the biggest Prague golf hole". 
"This is the Blanka tunnels" says Kaucký, added to safety but added: "but I know this from the newspaper." 
And jokingly: "i will have to show a language course." 
"Golf hole" will not only of matador Karel Březina deciphered, but also by the Council, Commissioner for the Environment Lukáš Plachý right as a tunnel Blanka deciphered. 
Both Democrats also know, however, for whom the term Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý knows even when this figure is and what it means to "go into the Konditorei". 
", that is, I believe in some kind of Prague catering operation", Plachý is quite close to the conundrum solution, when we know that this is the headquarters of Janoušeks firms. 
In line with Březina claimed, however, this knowledge acquired from the newspaper, rather than this vocabulary. 
The test participants, there seems to be under the Social Democrats actually no similar naturalisations slang. 
"I have asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing for us." 
"We call upon us, and we also use words or nicknamed", says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - from his party comrades colloquially "Hulda". 
"At school I was Bříza (birch), but I do not know whether my colleagues" tells us Karel Březina his nickname. 
The newspaper Deník aktuálně. Cz has tried and behold - he works. 
Councillor Weinert is for the party of the "grandfather" or the "old", the Representative Miroslav Poche machinations, before the elections, the party's sponsorship attention to some of my colleagues, "Igráček" (Czech Lego figure). 
Nicknames are the only one that allow the Social Democrats, whose language. 
Hulínský may not claim, "Hulda", but Deník aktuálně. Cz registered another nickname of Prague. 
His nickname "Doctor of rubber truncheons rights" has to do with the fact that allegedly acquired Petr Hulínský his title Doctor juris in the Bratislaver police academy.
