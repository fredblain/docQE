Weak applause for China 
Taiwan's voters are slowly nearing a close link to the mainland. 
What Taiwan from his big brother across the Straits? 
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all eligible voters in the city's five districts to elect mayors and city councils. This will be seen as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying jeou. 
By building cutting-edge business relations, einschl. A partial free trade agreement, Ma is itself a symbol for relations with the mainland. Its policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mainland for the first time since 1949. 
Ma has passed the test, but only just. 
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT), three of the five mayors, they received a majority of votes. 
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the vote, the KMT was 45%. 
In a presidential election would mean for Ma problems. 
Since his election two years ago was the vote of his party by around 8%. 
For the first time, together with the KMT, the DPP even in town councils. 
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as convoys of lorries with rioters, flags schwenkende mass parades and only scantily clad dancers. 
There were even compulsory, mysterious assassination attempt. 
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, on the eve of the election in a speech to a KMT candidate. 
As a man from the crowd in the face. LIEN was wounded and killed an umstehender viewers. 
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter Lien kill or wanted to settle a dispute with the candidates. 
Regardless of the attack, according to Tsai every whom, the leader of the DPP, the election and the DPP in a bad light, which has brought the KMT more votes. 
China was perhaps the biggest winners in the campaign. 
It was not the relations with the mainland. 
Instead, the candidates have plans for social housing and job creation of jobs. 
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat. 
For this reason, the KMT their relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground. 
But this time, the DPP, the Chinese feelings too much. 
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China. 
Ma, for its part, would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese its China policy. 
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy to attract Taiwan with economic incentives in the community. 
China sent a negotiator in Taipei, for a summit to investment security and medical cooperation. 
Certainly wants a political integration. But first things first. 
It is therefore prefer until after the presidential elections in 2012. 
The DPP has reinvented itself now. 
Two years ago, it was weakened sharply: the former party leader Chen Shui bian sat in jail for corruption. 
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008 he stood for the complete independence. 
But under Tais reign, a new generation gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the professionals and the youth. 
Tsai was adopted as the DPP's presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng chang under Chen. 
Their party is doing everything to show that they, too, is in a position to build close relations with Beijing. 
Tsai is planning a tank as a contact point between the DPP and China. However, this requires broad discussions. 
Tsai stated publicly that their party a "credible alternative" to Mas • rapprochement with China. 
Chen seems very angry about this change. 
From his cell, he said, the candidate of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence. 
He urged the pragmatists Su even to renounce the presidential candidacy. 
Even without interference, the DPP to choose their possible candidates. 
The KMT will have to undergo its own introspection. 
Ma's values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidate wanted to campaign without him. 
The main reason for his unpopularity seem unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor. 
According to a KMT spokesman will transform his cabinet and the local institutions. 
The strong performance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan a rapprochement only limited. 
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese economic cooperation with China as inevitable. 
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no return".
