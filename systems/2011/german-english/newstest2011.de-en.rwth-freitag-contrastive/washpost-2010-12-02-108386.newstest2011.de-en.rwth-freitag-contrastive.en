Can combine courtesy that which divides us? 
After a campaign of dirty words and negativity has erupted this week little civility in Washington. 
It is the sign of a real Zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion, before returning to the struggle of the parties in the capital? 
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and Congressional produced no breakthrough in the big issues, during the so-called "lame duck" session, the meeting at the end of a government, in which no decisions had to be. 
After all, what we hear, it was neither to govern a polite discussion between two sides of a consideration of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partisan collection points. 
The public meeting of the deficit commission's president on Wednesday was very civilised, despite the political differences between the members. 
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months a mutual respect obtained of the ideological divide that separates the members. 
This is hardly enough to claim that it has entered a new era of cooperation. 
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise, while trying to weigh up the limits of public opinion and the voters' patience following a new parties warfare. 
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants at a minimum requirements or accusations. 
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep for a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, might have been expected. 
Whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or benefits, the two sides are miles apart. 
Last but not least, the November election, at least for a short time mild. 
"No question, the tone has changed" said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, which is now for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center" works. 
"This is inevitable after elections. 
Elections give partisan passions. 
And that is a good thing. " 
In some areas, particularly In those who are on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. " 
Bush's tax cuts end up at the end of the year, and no one advocates. 
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, either temporarily or permanently. 
It is expected to reach a compromise over the increased unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that supported the idea of tax cuts for the rich, while denying them unemployed workers. 
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House has increased optimism that these issues during the "lame duck" session and at the time to ratify the new START treaty. 
But warns William glass tone of the Brookings Insitution that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation between the parties, if the new 112th Congress convened in January. 
Instead, he says, is a period of Nicht√ºbereinstimmens likely, perhaps even inevitable. 
"After the things that need to be done, done, will turn this short-term psychology in confrontation" he said. 
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - the courtesy to gain their cooperation. 
"I do not see much of what happens between now and 2012, when preliminaries, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012" he said. 
The reasons have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Teeparty voters who were their education. 
As the Republican leaders may be concerned that they vie too high, they know that they must try to their promise to cut government spending and to repeal the health care reform. 
This party lines are already in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include a tax reform and raising some taxes and raising the retirement age and reduce government spending. 
The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have assumed that one of the toughest jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, so that the deficit issue on the public agenda that can be ignored no longer. 
But they need within the Commission in 14 of 18 votes, in order to make its plan to official recommendation and they are struggling to come even close to this figure. 
The biggest opposition in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters, today at least, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises. 
Galton says two phases in the battle between the White House and Republicans in Congress. 
The first battle will be held next year in the form of party clashes, if the Obama Republicans in the state budget, defying the taxes and the health system, then followed by a phase of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation. 
What will this change? 
The public opinion. 
It is shown that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties together. 
If confrontation in a cul-de-sac, as happened in 1995, both parties must have a careful look at the public reaction. 
Whoever is doomed to lose, will change the course and must seek compromise. 
This may indeed be an optimistic view. 
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than in the mid-1990 s, and they seem more ideological divide between Obama and congressional Republicans than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. 
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a much broader election in 2012. 
So it may be that the courtesy which will be taken this week, will be welcomed by many americans. 
But it will require both sides very much more difficult to find a common denominator in the issues that divide the two still.
