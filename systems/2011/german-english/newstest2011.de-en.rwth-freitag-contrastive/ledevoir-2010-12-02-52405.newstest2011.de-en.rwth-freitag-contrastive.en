A Global plan to renew the lighting 
The u. n. yesterday in Cancún a plan to renew the lighting of households, Trade and Industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (CFCs) nearly a third of the additional reduction, which must be implemented, in order to stabilise the earth's climate by 2020. 
This ambitious plan adopted its position in the steps of major projects, which hopes to implement the u. n. in Cancun, in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by developed countries. 
After yesterday's plan would be the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the lighting of the earth, CFCs, if the weißglühenden pears, which has a monopoly of between 50 to 70% of the market, by fluoreszierende or, better still, replaced by light-emitting diodes (LED). 
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. 
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of global vehicle fleets. 
In Copenhagen last year, the big emitters like the United States, china, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans, which should lower the global CFC emissions from 53 to 49 Gt. 
This review should, however, still 5 Gt to stabilize from today until 2020 climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius, in order to prevent this out of control. 
In the weißglühenden pears are like 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light. 
With the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, with the new LED bulbs this reduced energy demand once again. 
The Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen keep on average between 6000 to 10.000 hours. 
The new LED bulbs, such as those expressed by the manufacturer Philips this week on the market, the company has also participated in the u. n. study - have a life expectancy of 25.000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a weißglühende pear, a suggestion the savings of the replacement plan, which should be applied in 100 countries. 
In addition to the fact that iese completely new light bulbs very little heat, they can work with a set of resistance. 
And they do not contain any mercury. 
Several experts have pointed out that Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves, because they contain mercury, and that they must dispose of it as a hazardous waste dump, which is not always possible in the developing world, except the producers are an adoption agency. 
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit more mercury to produce the weißglühenden pears wasted electricity. 
In the United States alone, these coal plants 25.000 tons of mercury annually. 
The report sets out in detail the profits, which each country thanks to this international program. 
Indonesia, for example, a billion $s a year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose edification Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
