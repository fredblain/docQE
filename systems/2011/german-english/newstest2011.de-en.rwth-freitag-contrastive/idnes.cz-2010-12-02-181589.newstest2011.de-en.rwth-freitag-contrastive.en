The army has so many detonators that could umwickeln, the Czech Republic, but only two years 
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometres detonators, with bombs. 
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence, 224 kilometres but because of the army camp. 
It is reassuring to know that ausgesorgt the armed forces for 225 years. 
The problem is the durability of the detonators - two, but no more than four years. 
The army bought the detonators of the Company STV group, for example, mere 40 million kroner. 
In his explanatory statement for the purchase of this huge amount but because of the General Staff MF DNES, the soldiers would consume annually, but because the 60 kilometres. 
The research by army Pyrotechnikern, according to the MF DNES out, from the fact that the whole army an intensive pyrotechnic education - all generals and officers of the army commandos, to the secretaries and women. 
The defense minister Alexandr Vondra and army General Vlastimil Picek. 
The only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres Zündschnüren halfway. 
This length is 25.000 Detonationen. 
But it also would extend this army stocks for more than ten years. 
But if the old rule of experts that educating each new professional soldiers two metres but because completely, then the army by these Neueinkäufe - in the view of the increased needs of pioneering and units - created a reassuring stock for the already mentioned in 225 years. 
It complained of Schnelleinsatzbrigade recently when Defense Minister Vondra, they had almost no cartridges for small arms, so register are severely restricted because of the lack of resources. 
The underpants deficiencies. 
"I am not a, why they buy from such detonators." 
But it is ultimately her decision, they will know to what they need. " 
"For us, the army is a good customer, we want to get as much as possible" says the manager of the STV Group Děcký Jan. 
Jan Pejšek, the Department of Defense spokesman justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres but because the army would have been so for at least ten years with this "ammunition" heckle him. 
Jan Děcký from the STV Group, but only by a four-year duration of the detonators and police and army Pyrotechniker only two years. 
"The perfect storage are also mentioned in the four years possible", one of them, who wants to remain unnamed, but not as a soldier accused of criticism of the army. 
After the duration of use must be tested thoroughly any ammunition, whether they are reliable and does not threaten the lives of soldiers. 
These tests are not in vain, but cost more money. 
Another argument of the Defense Department is the amount of rebate for the 445 km but because. 
"It cost us sixty percent less than the successful delivery of 244 kilometres" says spokesman Pejšek the position of the buyers of the Ministry of defence. 
Only by way of comparison, the annual consumption of Zündschnüren of Pyrotechnikern police, liquidate the munitions from the Second World War or the Soviet army, some years barely 1.500 metres. 
And the police are always such quantities of ammunition, which they can use before the end of the period. 
The safety of Pyrotechniker, also consider the possibility of flexible purchases more modern and reliable detonators. 
The Ministry of Defence has huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, when preparing the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak People's Army on its campaign on the Rhine. 
The Pyrotechnikern, according to the MF DNES, expects the Czech armed forces in a few years, the same problem with the killing of hundreds of kilometres of old detonators, which today is "good" has bought.
