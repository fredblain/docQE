Ladies in times of war 
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer with the work on her debut has begun, there is anger. 
The script has written it himself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man. 
We do not know - but it is much more. 
There is a persistent rumour that the woman, a muslim, verliebe during the Yugoslav wars in their Serb rapist. 
Bosnian women's associations have protested immediately, and some in Sarajevo, in the short term to Hungary. 
Meanwhile, the film in Hungary and in the post production, but it will still protested in Bosnia. 
Bakira Hasecic by the female victims wrote about the u. n. Refugee agency UNHCR of Jolie and demanded a meeting with the spectacles Rin, has reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is ambassador to the u. n. Refugee Relief and Works agency. 
It is not - it has offered the women, weeks before a meeting in Hungary, which rejected the but. 
The meeting should be held in Bosnia, Hasecic. 
Liebesgeschichten in rape camps have not happened, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims of their enough about the script. 
Her organization has recommended that the u. n. refugee agency, according to dismiss Jolie as ambassador, told the Guardian. 
But what exactly has written Jolie for scenes? 
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, to read the script, gave after some to-ing and fro-ing a hub for Sarajevo - it is not clear why did not then Jolie. 
The young car Rin themselves, they had no political intentions with her film, have worked with a lot of trouble in the Yugoslav conflict, the terrible consequences of war and give all interested parties a voice. 
The content remains vague. 
The idea of a second Synopsis to film in the network, which is then quite differently: the lovers knew it before war broke out and meet again, as they are, a Bosnian muslim, was kidnapped in a Serbian Camp, where he worked as a guard. 
What is considerably different than the sounds of "rape victims in verknallt torturer." 
That Jolie film actually begins even before the war - is. 
The pressure on them, Jolie, is "unfair and is based on misinformation." 
Now can be only the hackers from Hollywood peace: by the script, as so many before it, illegally.
