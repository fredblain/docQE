Pilsner soil Fund - arrests of police in a public tender 
In the building of the land fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police arrests in recent days. 
It was the European media entrepreneurs and real estate brokers Luboš g. of the Detektiven in handcuffs. 
This had allegedly tried to manipulate a public competition to Restitutionsansprüchen so that the competition offered land a specific interests. 
This should have paid Luboš g. for half a million. 
"At this stage, I can only confirm that the police a person for the offence of fraudulent practices in a public competition" said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner prosecutor of the newspaper Právo ", further details could provide them with regard to the ongoing investigation. 
24 hours later was released the 46 - year-old entrepreneur from the police. 
How he was able to manipulate the public competition, we can speculate about the lack of official information. 
The speaker of the land fund Lubomír Černá led to the question of Právo, the police have made in the Pilsner soil and this fund actually arrests during a public competition. 
"It was a client and nothing to do with one of our staff" she became apparent. 
The public competition had Mrs Černá according to the correct name'call for tenders of claims on the transfer of land in accordance with the law "and would take place in cases where bezeigen several applicants offered interest in the land. 
"These people value their offer, within the framework of the through the transfer disbursement Restitutionsansprüche, as the in the land value." 
"In accordance with the requirements of the order of the potential acquirer, then gives the fund the land to the person with the highest offer" said the spokeswoman. 
Luboš g. were apparently information available, who had filed the request and because he was reasonable person, because he had bought a number of Restitutionsansprüchen, he offered a land interests that he is withdrawing from the competition. 
Obviously against a fat compensation. 
It would also be a sufficient explanation as to why he had such a large amount of money. 
Luboš g. had in the past too good contacts with the Pilsner soil fund. 
So he played in the issue of the former head of the land fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted because he failed to substitute restitution of properties, which have been passed already location decisions. 
At the time Luboš g. acquired the land fund, for example, land intended to build public roads, where was the construction of the access to the area Borské pole was planned. 
Later he exchanged this very well with the government against a house directly in the historic centre of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land. 
The local authority had to Kleinbeigeben was with a heavy heart, in order not to jeopardise the works by blocking the land.
