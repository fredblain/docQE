The trail of stones 
Uli Gsell has also worried, around 400 kilograms. 
On Monday night he was from Stuttgart, the Tuba station On the back. 
It was Demo. 
It snowed heavily. 
The story is well known: In September, the dredging angerückt and had begun to break off a large chunk of the northern wing. 
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the of the station. 
When it came to freeze, a large part of the wing in ruins. 
In 6000, 7000. 
Crailsheimer shell, a soft gross stein, between 1914 and 1920. 
Gsell is sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old. 
He has secured a couple of stones. 
"These stones are relics." 
"They must not disappear." 
He fantasise: "a cheaper and poor, simple and erdenhaft." 
When he aufsägte, cigarette smoke a rat. 
He does not know What he will do with the headache. 
Stones have time. 
Uli Gsell. 
The trail of Stuttgart stones in a forest in Tübingen, a former ammunition depot in The French army, which has built a stone Manuel Rongen empire. 
The 44 Jährige with old stones. 
He has bought all the demolition in Stuttgart fell. 
"It would be a shame, it would be Schotter milling or disappear in the landfill" he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen, which was once a cab. 
Insulted and threatened him, he is telling, as in September in the newspapers that he bought the remnants of the northern wing of demolition. 
But he has with the S- 21 opponents, for days. 
And he has told them that he absolutely nothing for the demolition. 
And if it is, then it is the most sensible, if used the stones. 
Approximately 200 S- 21 opponents took an average of 80 kg, with serious Quader price of 6.50 to 14 EUR. 
As memory, but also in the hope to be able to return him to a reconstruction. 
500 tonnes had bought Rongen, 25 large lorry loads. 
About half is still in the forest, the rest is sold. 
Gartenbesitzer, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer. 
They come from everywhere, and had weggeschleppt what boot and supporters. 
The Stuttgart stumbling stones have been in "Mäuerle" or The limits of Kräuterbeeten. 
"This is nothing new" says Rongen. 
"It would not be the political component." 
In his SUV, a tour through his 20 empire. 
He has studied Law and, later, biology, then he is interested in computers and finally traders. 
And lovers. 
40000 tonnes of stones. 
From all over Germany karrt his treasures. 
He says that he is the biggest Altsteinhändler the Republic. 
He put the brakes on. 
In the snow skilful behauene sand stones. 
"They were Dresdner Marienbrücke" he said. 
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he fantasise. 
"My favourite stone." 
It is the path through the forest. 
It shows a bunch: red sand quarry, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station. 
And further. 
"Beautiful Travertin." 
Once the Quader gallery of Stuttgart Neckarstadions. 
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from Stuttgart police headquarters, rötlicher granite from the cathedral, St. Blasien, Tuff Heilbronner hospital. 
The work, effort, the sweat. 
If Rongen, think about how to beat the stones by hand and with simple bottles and ox carts, will he be reverential. 
"It would be a scandal if schreddern something." 
He is not Rich, very Rich. 
But 14 people employed by the stone traders today, also have high in the forest Steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, established a Glasbläser and horticulturalists settled. 
"We are working hard, but it is a good one" says the remnants scrap-yard.
