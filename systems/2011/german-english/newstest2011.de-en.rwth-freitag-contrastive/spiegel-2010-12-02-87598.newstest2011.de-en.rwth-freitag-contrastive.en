To hell, warrior! 
Splatter fits the art cinema? 
The director Nicolas Winding Refn testing with his fighters epic "Valhalla Rising" old genre borders. 
In the audience may have thought the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn, as he "Valhalla Rising"? 
A captured Vikings warriors with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) freed himself from his tormentors and with almost superhuman forces multitudes of his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody Action, precisely because our hero like rough killing methods and his enemies the Gedärme from the vibrant, if he has a bad mood. 
On the other hand, says Einauge, as it is, in fact, is not a word throughout the film, and the other characters at times to one or two sentences or a few painful death cries of. 
Otherwise silent and feasted on the hill gruselig beautiful landscape of Scotland, the Vikings world of about a thousand years ago the scene. 
Ideal for adult Cineasten with interest for Existenzialismus and very calm camera. 
Well, if a film has several target groups, it is a shame, if they are mutually exclusive. 
Director Winding Refn since his wild and gestylten drug dealers trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, refuses to stoically, his works with more humor the mainstream or something less brutality, Arthouse accessible. 
Most art cinema friends may be deterred from around the spritzenden brain mass and the Gedärmen. 
The latest action fans die before boredom, if Einauge from freely suspensive reasons with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and an eternity in doldrums and fog, before the team apparently in America and silent. 
No wonder, then, that "Valhalla Rising" has been found in Germany No cinema distribution and appeared only on DVD. 
This is particularly the magnificent images of a hangover, but also because hiding behind the unpretentious and blood-stained unpretentious and sometimes exciting piece of cinema, which deserves some attention. 
In this film is not about dialogues or a stringent action, it is all atmosphere, a filmgewordener fever dream. 
And there is no room for the viewer. 
Refn give him barely a moment of relaxation and puts him with his icy images and the dark trance of Sound Track very slowly, but above all with the unspeakable hatred of him from the heart of the characters. 
Only a small blonder boy, the Einauge faithful to one side, something like innocence, all others are driven by anger. 
Most of the einäugige hero, whose motives are never explained, but for enemies and allies temporarily at some point the warriors from hell, perhaps the ambassadors of the devil himself. 
But it also means destruction, perhaps only for the Verdorbenen anyway. 
"Valhalla Rising" is a puzzling, the film can hate and admire, Ärgern, Aufregen and laughable. 
An experience.
