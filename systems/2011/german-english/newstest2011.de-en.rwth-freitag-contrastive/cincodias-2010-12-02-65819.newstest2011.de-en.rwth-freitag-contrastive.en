From the European Central Bank (ECB) 
Investors reacted sharply yesterday on the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our response." 
The risk premium of EUR Peripheriländer have risen dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%. 
But we should be the possibility that can fool the ECB and the EUR has appreciated at points, leading to concern, not underestimate. 
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, to the extent that he collapses, recovered, however, as a result of the closure and highly speculative positions. 
The institutional investors will lose not far from his fear. 
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank, to make our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen, according to which the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably many times in the future, must make. 
The Bundesbank called for the lifting of the plan to buy government debt, since these are ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. It should be maintained only an einwöchiger permanent access. 
After the Irish crisis, we expect that the current liquidity measures "until at least March" extended and maintain the quarterly contracts with unlimited access to the quarter to provide liquidity until at least June. 
We also expect that to continue the program to purchase bonds and will spend a means of signal. 
If it does not meet the expectations created, discarded the reaction of the markets yesterday and thrown back if halstarrig insists that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us! 
As with the ECB meeting in May, when the bank, the purchase of state debt securities not to and the markets collapsed, this history could repeat tomorrow. 
The ECB must be credible and consistent. 
In May, the teeth and on Wednesday said they bought a lot to do, provoking a new collapse of the market. 
Yesterday was the auction of one-year government bonds in Portugal was rather weak. 
The government's asset management were only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction. 
Nevertheless, interest rates by 30 basis points in Portugal in the curve and reflected a perceptual changes in the markets after Trichet's words. 
In Ireland were published the figures of the debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland. 
The sum is estimated at around 10 000 million in the short term and possible further 15 000. it is time to February, in order to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized. 
Although Ireland has lost its credibility, the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures under the rescue plan acceptable and help to reduce the uncertainty. 
However, the government next Tuesday's parliamentary approval for his new budget, since they do not have the sufficient support, Ireland is also a source of uncertainty. 
Angela Merkel has a discourse on the summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December. More moderate. There is political unity needed to show that we share the same score. 
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries of Beethoven's ninth symphony. 
The Spanish government President, yesterday's action plan, which will be adopted Friday by the Council of Ministers. 
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reducing the deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures, in the ears of investors as Vivaldis four seasons. 
The dual effect of Zapatero and Trichet, why has appreciated the Spanish stock market at 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges. 
Compared to February was the reaction of the government and the Bank of Spain quickly and convincingly, and we will benefit from the surprise result. 
Today there is a crucial auction a three-year bond, which will benefit from Trichet effect. Therefore, we have a strong demand, which will remove all doubt about our ability to refinance. 
For Spain would be the application of an aid plan a self-sacrifice. 
We would receive liquidity, which we do not need. The Treasury has EUR 40 billion, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to The markets would notice closed. 
Nevertheless, in line with our strategy the Caesar's wife: "now is not only the existence, but also the licence." 
Only courage, we create!
