450 million in contracts without tender 
Hydro Quebec has approved by mutual agreement project planning firms $450 million in contracts for the hydroelectric project Eastmain- 1 A Sarcelle Rupert. 
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consisting of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, the most important, namely the management of the project, has received a total of $295 million without tender. 
The consortium, called "gérance Énergie", was 2004 as a corollary of the decision of Hydro Quebec, the private sector accountability, this important to entrust hydroelectric project amounting to a sum of $5 billion, formed. 
In early 2005, earned the consortium "gérance Énergie" the lucrative contract, without a public tender. 
For the Parti Québécois is resorting to business consortia a serious ethical problem, raising the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung and a price increase. 
"This is a new way to a conspiracy and refuted the competition." 
"This means that instead fixes rather than on the way to open in form" said yesterday Sylvain Simard, member of the PQ, at the press conference. 
Early in the morning Simard had raised the issue before the National Assembly, because it seems hard to understand how the public's interest in this way. 
Ressourcenministerin Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon, when they vehemently deny that this treaty is a stitch-up. 
"I remain faithful to my line" lashed out, they confirmed that the PQ "dishonest" and "lack of rigour". 
She said that it was "the least" that the PQ apologize. 
The model of the consortium is common practice. 
It is usually a time such temporary alliance, which allows two or more companies to pool their expertise on a requirement on a tender for a complex project. 
The project "East Main" has a high level of complexity with regard to his work. 
The construction is under way and should be drawn up until 2012. 
However, was awarded the contract without a competition could take place; it had already negotiations. 
Furthermore, the model of the consortium in Quebec, with relatively simple projects no longer an exception. 
As the newspaper Le Devoir "last week has pointed out, is the model used in the field of civil engineer and advisory services of the consortium of government investigations. 
A brief overflying the Quebecer company register allows more than 200 consortia, which appear to be some of steady. 
In this way, for example, the company Dessau in partnership with the majority of its key competitors, including CIMA +, Génivar, SNC lava Lin or include Roche and Tecsult, together. 
Any link, and there are several dozen, at one and the same legal person, namely Dessau. 
What the consortium "gérance Énergie", Minister Normandeau that "is subject to the territory of the Baie James a special workforce dynamics and that Hydro Quebec this fact since the 70 s in a particular way '. 
Réal Laporte, the major employers of the Société d énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement, which has be turning up their nose on the fact that the Treaty on the project after agreement was approved. 
"If you are an invitation to tender, and there are few candidates, will your prices soar." 
"You have two options: either you do the people who find themselves in this, and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price." 
"The idea is that the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people" said Laporte. 
The consortium "Énergie gérance" approved contract is part of a long list of more than 50.000 of the Parti Québécois received $. 
The contracts were either approved by the Hydro Quebec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain- 1 A Sarcelle Rupert. 
After reviewing the newspaper "Le Devoir" more than 100 engineering and consultancy contracts, the companies or their branches, including in particular resources granted to laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010. 
SNC lava Lin had tightened up 22 contracts per se, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without the participation of "Énergie gérance" counting. 
All these contracts are negotiated. 
They amount in total to 449 783, including the contract with "gérance Énergie" over 295 131 $564. 
Sylvain Simard had indicated that the four firms, which make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) the "libéral Parti du Quebec well known". 
Minister Normandeau had let it be known that the PQ is also associated with the firms that they "funded" before they clarified that it was their executives.
