China has maintained its targets to reduce greenhouse gases, 
The representative of China stated on the COP16, his country has made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and it would maintain its offer to 2020 40 to 45 percent of greenhouse gases. 
China considers his offer to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases by 2020 to 40 to 45 percent, Su Wei, the representative of the country on the COP16. 
In his first public appearance at the 16th world climate summit COP16 (United Nations), Su Wei, his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon traces and convert its industry.
