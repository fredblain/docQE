The new unit will take place no unanimity 
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new unit, the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry on the subject. 
Robert Dutil, minister of public security, said that this idea come not from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted last january, the New York Department of Investigation on this issue. 
The metropolis has since 1870 on a stand-alone unit against corruption. 
However, the announcement Wednesday has surprised more than just one. 
It must be said that this measure at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebecer police service was discussed on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils. 
It was not that Stéphane mountains Ron, critics and member of the Parti Québécois, this announcement in terms of public safety, "gezaubertes rabbits from the hat" and'will gebastelte solution "qualified. 
Ministers Dutil had turned in turn to those who fear that the political power too much influence on the future of unity. 
"You will see the result, if we are announcing" confined to confirm it. 
"We are aware of this problem." 
According to Réjean'parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public opinion poll. 
"The more m. Charest insisted, to prevent the formation of this Committee of inquiry, the more the people like you and I think that he has something to hide" he said. 
"The only way to be able to form a committee of inquiry, the resignation of Mr Charest" said Yves Bois Mad, lecturer in ethics and policy systems at the ENA (staatl. 'training high administrative officer). 
In order to escape from this impasse, he proposes to Quebec, the audit control a specific mandate, so that we can make this about corruption and collusion appropriate. 
"We should be able to extend the mandate of the audit control" he decided. 
He takes the view that could give the Quebec of audit control the same power as Commissioners, which would allow people to testify. 
The formation of an unity is not the only project in the drawers of the government Charest. 
The Quebec will replace in Ottawa, the criminal law, in order to be better adjusted to this type of crime. 
The Operation, this demand comes from the eau, the Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier has informed that the case in this type of criminal prosecution is unclear. 
Vic Toews, Minister of State for public safety, for its part, his colleague from the Justice, Rob Nicholson, currently with certain amendments relating to this dossier. 
During the operation Printemps 2001, which groups the motorcycle police, 131 people have been arrested, although the criminal law has not been amended. 
Ottawa has won as a result, the law against crime.
