The Erdarbeiten 
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria. 
The country, however, to comment on - nor does it controls. 
At midnight on 5 and 6 September 2007 are at least four Israeli F- 15 I fighter planes a mystery, würfelförmiges buildings in Syria. 
It is on the banks of the Euphrates, the next major city, 30 kilometres, is Dair as Saur. 
Her name appeared in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, built with Syria allegedly with help from North Korea in the Quader, hidden in a valley, the electricity. 
According to a briefing of the U.S. foreign intelligence agency CIA at the end of April 2008, also under the name of the near town el Kibar normal reactor to produce plutonium - from which to build nuclear weapons. 
For other purposes against the technology from the fifties. 
The CIA has produced a video presentation with blurred satellite images. 
By Computeranimation it, where the components of the reactor fell before the destruction, the copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear centre. 
In addition, the show photographs of the building from the vicinity show or even the atrium. 
The reactor was just before the operation, it said, but not yet with fuel prongs peppers. 
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more than it was then known, the mystery of the time. 
The former U.S. President George w. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack was quite sure that Syria in el Kibar built a reactor, but hardly points of reference to ensure that the country, "an active nuclear weapons program." 
Some intelligence officers in Europe are still cautious and speak only of a "alleged reactor" even if the CIA presentation for "plausible". 
You lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. 
Asked how he was sure to have a reactor, a senior u. n. diplomat in the summer only briefly, the IAEA "enough material to ask questions." 
The rubble of the alleged "unused military building", the Syrians eager and planierten thoroughly premises. 
Nevertheless, took place in June 2008 an IAEA team under former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el Kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people. 
Also received the IAEA on a Member State satellite images of commercial providers from the period immediately after the attack, the more meaningful than the CIA. 
However, to get these recordings on the market, because of the purchaser - perhaps Israel - she has bought exclusively. 
The IAEA could not verify their authenticity. 
Syria has always claimed that has never been a secret nuclear program or built a nuclear reactor. 
The uranium came from The Israeli weapons, said Damascus. 
But the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely. 
Since then, refuses to Damascus to discuss - as well as on the satellite images. 
The inspectors also denied a second inspection in el Kibar and access to the wreckage of the bombed-out building. 
But Israel maintains an iron. 
"We will never comment on" said recently at the time of the attack, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position. 
As the investigation of the case has dragged on since June 2008 fruitless and "becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority" a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - after all, is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is monitored the IAEA. 
As a key to progress in the investigation, the IAEA apparently three other facilities, the "functional link" with the alleged reactor - and differently than this. 
The inspectors have so far not openly what it is, or what they are or what they seem suspicious. 
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally as Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived from nearby towns. 
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and on satellite images of a building complex in Masyaf, which is probably one of the suspects are objects. 
It is probably in or adjacent to a military base - with this justification, Syria, the IAEA access to the three locations. 
The IAEA In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that will be sent on ahead of the United States, military installations, foiling. 
Since the nuclear detectives were turned off by the U.S. secret services to the facilities. 
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos that was transported between the three locations and the Quader the Euphrates material. 
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna, could at least one of the plants' in connection with the fuel production ". 
But there was "no evidence of sensitive activities" uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes, which are necessary to build nuclear weapons. 
The type of reactor will not enriched uranium, which is. 
But where the uranium could have come from and where it should be separated from it later the plutonium for the bomb, on these key issues are there any plausible assumptions. 
It is also unclear whether debris that could involve the valuable traces, were stored in three places. 
As if the burden of hundreds of truckloads have disappeared, nobody wants information on the ground, where the rubble. 
Only a few kilometres from el Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, salt mine al Tibni, has studied the Syria 1998 on their suitability as a camp for radioactive waste, the IAEA as unlikely. 
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had it in a recent analysis of satellite images for the venerable magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor. 
Started from the orbiting show that Syria to the three places Erdarbeiten and large container, after the IAEA access. 
This may be a coincidence, but has little to dispel the suspicion. 
In addition, they say in diplomatic circles, have used the IAEA several months to develop a plan for inspections, which should allow Syria to maintain military secrets - shows the amount of how much interest the inspectors. 
Meanwhile, Damascus has smoothed this proposal. 
Had reassured Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, therefore no urgency, as U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months so-called special inspections, one of the harshest means that the Vienna nuclear authority to enforce controls. 
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, these inspections should suggest, has been "an option, for which I am in the future", but he is hesitant. 
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it needs a majority of the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries are anything but eager for an escalation. 
On the other hand, as a diplomat: "What if they end up with nothing?"
