Red Bull prevails in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens 
The car will be improved with a software in real time. 
Since the Red Bull in 2004 in the world of Formula 1, their history in this fine universe of the speed of surprises and successes. 
Initially, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his background rising sharply during the last few seasons, the sprint last November at the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso. 
Without the skills of the German pilots and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the performance of the engine of Renault, is the "secret weapon", the multinational Siemens Red Bull, and created a winning team, has become a legend. 
In reality, is a powerful software to simulate processes, the German company 2007 for purposes that have nothing to do with motor racing, on the market. 
This is PLM described as PLM computer programme for the development of fitting chains in factories around the world, energy plants and precise instruments used. 
It is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process, before this will actually be built, in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs. 
Plm has the development of the cameras, Canon, the aircraft acquisitions and the most famous of Nissan vehicles. 
Siegfried Rus worm, head of the industrial department of Siemens, said that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 - factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements, which are found in the race and the tests can. 
In the Russwurm contends that 1992 from an average of ten technicians who could bring in a season at most three or four improvements. 
In Red's team are now employs 180 highly qualified young people. With powerful computer equipment they analyses and all sorts of changes to the cars. 
The Siemens managers said that the PLM software is able to analyse all components of the cars of Red Bull and to improve, with the exception of the engine, for the Renault. 
The materials, the fuel, the reason dynamism and security elements. 
The changes can be transmitted through advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclave in less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of the Simulators into reality. 
The only border, this crazy is technical perfectionism, the $40 million, a formula 1 - must spend team for his race in a season. 
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its cars in a place 50 miles from London. 
There are two buildings, where visits - particularly of journalists - are limited. 
Everything that is happening is Top Secret. 
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber. 
But Red's true Formula 1 - zweifelslos hero is the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell. 
Behind the huge technological resources, which represents the energy drink manufacturers in the service of his participation at the latest, further protagonists, whose support is priceless and whose reputation is zero. 
The Technologichef the plant, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago to say that the progress in the field of R & D for cars with 50 percent for victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest. 
Today have changed the share values. The technology accounts for 85 percent of success, while the contribution of the pilots estimated at 15 percent. 
Nevey recognizes that can be replaced Vettel and Webber never by computer, because they "are not voraussagbare gladiators'.
