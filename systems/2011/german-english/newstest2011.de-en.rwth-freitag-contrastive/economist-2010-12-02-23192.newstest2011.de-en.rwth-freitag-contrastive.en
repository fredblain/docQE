Two facts in this year's poll in September and october, particularly in's eye. 
First, the good mood in Latin America 
And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions. 
In many countries of the South Pacific coast has increased the democratic movement here (Table 1). 
In Peru, for example, where the economy is growing at an annual rate of around 6% since 2002, the number of democracy advocates from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. 
In Mexico, where the economy since the sharp fall In the last year, is such a trend. 
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the world's two most populous countries in the region, which, the regional average (. graph 2). 
Approximately 44% of respondents said that they will be with the country's democratic practice. As many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3).

In Mexico and Central America, where the recession mount was increased violence and crime, this is less the case.

Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can bring their country progress, compared with 47% last year. 
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela this view (and 80% are maintained for a private sector), although their leftist President, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private companies. 
Brazil has had 19% of respondents (18% last year), the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year).
