<seg id="1"> What should they do the SSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "Konditorei." </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new Ratsherrs of capital from the ranks of the SSD will obviously need to overcome certain language barriers to their alt-neu colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and the city representation even able to understand. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The newspaper Aktuáln.Cz members of the new Council from the SSD times a little "abgeklopft," as they dominate the notorious slang that has become common practice in recent years, in which the current coalition partners have been at the helm in Prague. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The encoded vocabulary in the elapsed era of Mayor Pavel Bém was introduced by the Prague political elite, some of the best-known actors, situations and Causae. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Surprisingly, showed that the new councils in relation to these new notions somewhat in the dark. </seg>
<seg id="6"> They claim that at least. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Who is Voldemort?" </seg>
<seg id="8"> "No idea." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am more a newcomer in the Prague policy," responded Luká Kaucký, the new town councillor for culture, on the test of "Paten-Wortschatzes." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But the town councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran, responded in a similar way. </seg>
<seg id="11"> As an example of the term "golf hole." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "This is the only expression of which you present me here, I occasionally use." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Otherwise, I do not think much of slang." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> For the vocabulary, the daily newspaper Aktuáln.Cz in this year's June had published before the election Congress of the ODS, pickte editors six concepts, it turned out, especially those notoriously associated with the Prague government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Social Democrats should the terms "Voldemort," "greatest Prague golf hole ',' go in the Konditorei ',' bull nacken ',' betrayal of the capital" and "verblechen" define. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Three Prague Ratsherrs agreed the test on the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - first promised his participation at the meeting, then less than the listeners. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, the test was rejected from the outset. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "These things are not mind and how the Civic Democrats talk among themselves about it, I am not passing judgement." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "For me is important, as we understand in the context of our programmes," he countered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> As indicated, would have been Luká Kaucký in the abovementioned headline allegedly not realised that the influential businessman and friend of the Ex-Oberbürgermeister Bém, Roman Janouek of the speech. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The term "Voldemort," Kaucky says nothing at all and the only word that he was at the test correctly, erriet "the greatest Prague golf hole." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, to safety but added: "But I know that more from the newspaper." </seg>
<seg id="23"> And jokingly: "I will probably need to show a language course." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The "golf hole" will not only of matador Karel Březina, but also from the town councillor for the Environment Luká Plachý right as a tunnel Blanka entziffert. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Both Social Democrats also know for whom the term Voldemort and Luká Plachý idea even where to find this figure and thereby also what it means, "to go in the Konditorei." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "I think it is to go into any Prague catering industry" is pretty Plachý close to the solution to the problem, if you know that this is the seat of Janoueks firms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> In accordance with Březina but he claimed that this knowledge to have drawn from the newspaper rather than for him this vocabulary would own. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> According to the Testteilnehmern judging by, it seems really under the Social Democrats no similar popular slang. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I asked my colleagues, but obviously there is something we are really not." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "We call upon us by name, occasionally we use acronym or colorful names," says the chairman of the Prague SSD Petr Hulínský - from his party peers casual 'Hulda'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "I was in the school Bíza (Birke) mentioned, but I do not know whether my colleagues so call" tells us Karel Březina his nickname of. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The newspaper Deník Aktuáln.Cz has tried out the name and behold, it works. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Weinert councillor for the party peers friendly "one's grandfather" or less friendly to the "old" Representative Miroslav Poche before the elections by machinations in the party sponsorship drew attention from some colleagues "Igráek" (famous Czech do figure) mentioned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Colorful names are the only the Social Democrats in the intra-Party parlance permit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Hulínský, it may not be alleged if it "Hulda," but Deník Aktuáln.Cz registered yet another nickname of the Prague chairman. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> His nickname of "doctor Gummiknüppel-Rechte" was supposed to do that Petr Hulínský its title Doctor juris has acquired in the Bratislaver police academy. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="7"> "But what - signed and I," he says upset half and half resigned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Citizens' Association BytyOKD.Cz, the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral" advises the tenants, the new contracts are not easy to sign and until 7 December to wait, in which it intends to publish a guidebook, as it fights against such contracts. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But the man is dismissive. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "One says this, the other," he makes a grim face. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The region of Ostrava is so great "deregulation laboratory." </seg>
<seg id="12"> After the New Year is this deregulation most rental housing in the Czech Republic before, whose tenants pay has not yet been a market-based rent. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Aktuáln.Cz therefore decided this "laboratory" personal visit. </seg>
</p>

<p>
<seg id="20"> A little later enters an older couple waiting period, in order to ask for the rent, but the onslaught in the waiting area is apparently not the new rent. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Most people are here to solve the usual problems - Reparaturanträge, Versicherungsangelegenheiten and similar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> From the middle of November fly in the region Ostrava Kuverts with the new leases most tenants of a total of 44.000 homes of the portfolio of RPG in the mailboxes. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="24"> The specific date for the new rent in the client centre is opened since 18 November. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "The action runs a little over a week, which means that is only the beginning" answer the ladies behind the counter for a moment of hesitation, as the "client" emerging as a journalist. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The deregulation and Bakalas former Bergarbeiterwohnungen are a sensitive issue. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before the elections had Parliament's Vice-President originating from Ostrava Lubomír Zaorálek of the SSD quite loudly taken up this issue, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> "Twenty years, I want a new floor by them." </seg>
<seg id="29"> "It is not times ne besch. WC-Brille they could change" makes the aforementioned man air. </seg>

<seg id="30"> Until now, according to the staff face all pensioners on the counter in order to convince themselves whether they really get the promised tenants' moderation, which promises them RPG if they have the specific requirement to sign in time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In the enjoyment of a half reduced February miete should come the other tenants, the new lease sign until 15 December. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> RPG offers both on their websites, as well as Wandtafeln individual rental agreements where necessary. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> "The existing level of rent is not enough times to the maintenance of the housing funds from" argues Pavel Klime, the director of the Wohnungs-Portfolios society RPG Byty and - just the angry tenants criticise neglect of the housing fund, according to the homeowners of the main reason for the rent hike. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> While RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010 from one's rent four billion could be invested in the houses in the four years from 2011 until 2014, it should be 5.2 billion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> In the broadsheet LCD-Display on the ceiling of the polster sessels in the waiting area of Havíov in the meantime, there are always a few red shining information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> "The rental increases by 15% in 2011 and less concern 31.200 homes, which means more than 90% of the homes of RPG." </seg>
<seg id="47"> "Time and means that no more than 7,50 CZK per square metre and month" is to read on the LCD-Monitor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> Only 400 homes from the portfolio of RPG increased the rent by 38 percent. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "In these cases is increasing extreme lower rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG. </seg>
<seg id="50"> In 2600 housing remains the rent at the same level in the next year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> RPG Byty promises that the deregulation rents not erratic drives up, but staged within four and eight years. </seg>
<seg id="52"> What is more, the company another obligation: all revenue from the rental increase (see graph) wants to keep putting the company back into the homes, especially in Wärmeersparnisse - in new windows and insulation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> However, this should primarily benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent hike. </seg>

<seg id="1"> A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. If you look at the Interieure of Gaudi </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The roof is like a prehistoric Echse, the back stairs, such as the vertebral column of dinosaurs and behind Fischmäuler. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This is the Casa Batlló by the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="4"> From the local residents got the house with his organic forms the nickname of "bone house." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Organ forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, Kachelsplittern and Mosaiks, which covered posture facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of the youth style of Antonio Gaudi. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The facade of the house plays with fantastically lines, lack paints and Texturen remind the nature and creatures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> It was only on closer inspection, we noticed that everything will be dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order. </seg>
<seg id="8"> During the night, the whole facade still of plastic, dramatic and the special Anleuchtung reinforced the glory of the paint still. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The same energetic lines and tortuous forms dominate the interior of the house. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wave type of shaped wood copied the window frames, support, Zierelemente doors, even Gucklöcher and. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The House Batlló in the quarter Eixample in the busy shopping road Passeig de Grácia No 43 was created by the refurbishment of a house from the year 1877, the architects Emilio Sala Cortese said. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reconstruction two years took and completed 1906. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The investor, the wealthy industrialists, Josep Batlló, originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but he ultimately voted Gaudís the idea of an unusual and even cheaper restructuring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The rental house Casa Batlló was an architect, Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone. </seg>
<seg id="15"> He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol together. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Dekorations created for the representative apartment on which ruler of the Realitätenbesitzers and the use of Mosaiks in the facade was his idea. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> At the design of the facade but also many other Bildner and artists. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The joint work on the drafts of the Casa Batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá in Güell Park, where other works are by Antoni Gaudí. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Not long after its completion was the home of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the nicknames for "bone house." </seg>
<seg id="21"> Others called it the special window opening mechanism for the "yawning home." </seg>
<seg id="22"> It also says the top of the building is the sword of sacred Georg, presented the Patron of Catalonia. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But also other bildhauer elements symbolize hidden religious motives. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Gaudí was an architect of the House a unique central heating system for the time with Entlüftungskanälen and typical Kamins. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Something bizarre is its 45 degrees inclination already. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> In his creation Gaudí consistently ignored all former building codes and in no way anyone could be led astray by these. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before start, he was one of the city proper permission but he made claims about the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers in the completion of two years later were so appalled by the result that they remedy demanded. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The Ratsherrs were also among other things, that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk. </seg>
<seg id="29"> With regard to changes, however, there was no longer quite the opposite - just 15 days after the relevant invitation of urban neighbourhoods asked Josep Batlló a request for approval of the property of the two maximum situated floors of the House - and it has given him promptly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The homeowners themselves pulled into the lower floors one. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In the gallery on the 2nd floor was a company showroom, on the third floor were the bedroom and private rooms of the apartment. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The ground floor has been leased to a juwelier business. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The entire sechsstöckig building undergoes a ladder up to the dachte race. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> The basic elements of the restructuring were all right corner and just lines removed and replaced by bent and waved walls. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Gaudí also worked with a modern approach to the mutual combination of spaces. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The social part is quite connect through the opening of the Salontüren and so could comfortably chatting, without a larger society in vertraulich more talks will have to give up on a certain intimacy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The House received by Gaudís conversion except a new facade is also a rather unusual roof and two other floors. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It is also impressive Gaudís game with the light and the blue and white glasiert Kachels with which the courtyard is dressed and Lichthofs. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The game of those two colours gives all floors of the House a maximum amount of light. </seg>
<seg id="40"> In doing so he became simply the principle to turn that white light reflects better than dark colors, the sunlight on the contrary to absorb. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> The House Casa Batlló, the 2005 was included in the welterbe list of Unesco, everyone can now visit. </seg>
<seg id="42"> In the first floor is accessible to the public geräumigste and prächtigste home. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The right mattress and the right bed rost? Women have other aspirations than men </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It is not the tollste bed frame, but the quality of the surface - mattress and make good bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, this must complement each other in harmony, in order to meet the wishes of the specific user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Many things during the selection play a role - the weight, size, health and not least the sex of the Schläfer. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Equally important is the Interieur, in which mattress and belittle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> A typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a weekend house in which will not be heated on a regular basis, Latexmatratzen are not good, because they need a lot longer, "warm." </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition, they are clearly more difficult than usual Polyurethan-Matratzen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Finally, they should be turned on a regular basis. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If they do not have enough Entlüftungskanälchen in the core and still lie on a solid record humidity, the movement: it is not excluded that stems from its mold. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the election, of course, also plays a role in which it is used. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Anyone who takes longer time abroad, where very high Matratzes with soft layer are normal, hard to get used to a low mattress with hard surfaces can. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "Benefit all ice-hockey player returned from the NHL have complained to me that they cannot sleep more right here." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "For their abgeschundenen shoulders, they simply need Fersen and Hüften a soft layer of Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam, a Formgedächtnis-Polymer)." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I commend this including sugar sick people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they" information "from the joints and the skin can receive bad," said Sylva Hadamcziková, which specialises in polster möbel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> That is why I have years ago many ice-hockey players, but also other customers this Matratzes with Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam) concerned. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Today, this is not a problem any more, because such Matratzes offer, among other things the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian firm Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And we should not necessarily be a famous ice-hockey player, in order to appreciate the benefits of the Visco-Schaums. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" works really quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The foam optimalisiert his toughness and form in accordance with the absorbed heat, or in other words, he is downright schmiegt on warm body. </seg>
<seg id="21"> There's nowhere in the night shifts are not around, such as after a heavy battle. </seg>
<seg id="22"> We simply sleeping much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The viskoelastische foam also provides protection against Dekubitus (fire). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In the election of the matratze size to body size, we should still include the length of the football sohles, i.e. approximately 21 to 34 inches. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Men like Mrs of the 180 cm wide, need a 210 to 220 cm long bed. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Each of the Schläfer should at least 90 cm width available together then 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In single beds, for example, in Singles, 120 to 140 cm are appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="28"> I comfort side and also for any visitors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise the following thumb for the ideal bed band: "If it is on the back, should still enough room for the easy angewinkelt poor," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the zunft model of Polsterer and Raumausstatter, who for many years the issue of healthy sleep and devotes the ergonomics of furniture and this issue presents technical schools. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Everyone needs a separate in a double bed and his own mattress, but be careful with the purchase, so that the Matratzes are equally high. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Other than that, nothing else other than the Rosts assembling in different levels, and that is long impossible in each bed frame. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with stroke skelett 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should cover the formal class and the fine cushion. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "In the hand or in the Hinsetzen you can feel the feathers in any case," warns Helena Prokopová. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Every mattress requires a special Rosttyp. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document how together increased Siamzwillinge in the bedroom to find nothing. </seg>
<seg id="36"> These Matratzes are not strip and you cannot wash the reference, which is already commonplace. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And since we are in a single night between 0.2 to 0,75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years slowly to a huge (and clogged sieve). </seg>
<seg id="38"> This is also why experts Werbeslogans reject Matratzes a lifespan of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee promise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Every cause has its if and buts. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And so a practical advice from the dealers: in Matratzes of 120 or 140 cm diameter should be the hygiene of the waschbar, not shy away from abziehbaren salary, nevertheless, it is recommended to use a Matratzenschoner, you can easily drain and wash. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Although today are produced in the rule with Rundumreißverschluss, Matratzenbezüge so that you get two sides after the opening (immensely important for the washing process and the waschmaschine size!) seems the manipulation with larger Matratzes, especially alone said, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> Do they in bed instead of a Rostes a solid record? </seg>
<seg id="43"> So! </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or, at most for a bed for unpopular guests and for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Even so, they should install the record would rather Lüftungslöchern (if already not included) and mattresses with stroke skelett and 15 cm minimum level with so-called pocket stroke nucleus and fine cushion use. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethan-Matratzen belong on such a document is not. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For not verstellbar latte rosts with 14 to 18 stroke play (Lamellen) Latex or sand emphasis mattresses suitable (possibly combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay Roste with a major latte number, then 28 and more stroke play, with Lordosenstütze in the lende vertebral area and the ability to regulate the latte härte. </seg>
<seg id="48"> At verstellbar Lamellenroste does not include Matratzes with relevant skelett, because they do not respond to the ergonomische pretexts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> In addition to the suspension of the Steife stroke play will be offered special flexible shoulder modules. </seg>
<seg id="50"> This is a particular stroke play, enabling the stroke play einzudrücken or even verwinkeln so that they allow the occasional Einsinken of the shoulder of the Schläfer. </seg>
<seg id="51"> For men with broad shoulders an important matter. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There are even matratze manufacturers, which have started with "Beatles' mattresses" soft zones to use for the shoulder area. </seg>
<seg id="53"> It is thought also to the ladies - they might these soft zones in the Hüftgegend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For demanding customers are scoring burden large guidance systems (Lattoflex) or Roste with scoring burden Kontakt-Pads with so-called Multitorsionsfederung certain. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure will be distributed at several points, which reduces the tension. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> However, if you're on the right mattress and correct a bad (too big and fülliges) head bed used to get the most benefits will be lost. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Here too a thumb: the head bed should be based on the head, its leaders should only go to the shoulders, so that the Schultermuskeln can relax. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Ideal seems a 50 x 60 cm big cushions, as for example the Scandinavians may. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In the situation should head bed (along with the shoulder discharge zone in or the soft zone in the mattress) offset the shoulder level. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Something our modern Matratzes with the former (with hay filled) Strohsäcken but common. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern manufacturers increasingly use natural materials, or at least their mixtures. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Even Matratzes is the new magic word 'bio'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of Erdölrohstoffen used for the manufacture of Polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturell oils - for example Rizinus and soya oil. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soy is used by all the well-known manufacturers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> "Bio says in Matratzes, her heart is pure natural materials," said Petr Vaíek of the company Tropico Plus. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Naturstoffe but are also used in the manufacture of Matratzenbezügen, was one of the first Aloe Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We can but also kapseln, spreading fresh wood or Lavendelduft in the sleep, Mr. President. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Here too it makes a difference between man and woman. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While the men a "cooling in the existing" plant extract from birke sheets will be used so that the matratze relationship can absorb the heat and cool the body, the salary for women "current mend" impact. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Extracts from Red Paprikaschotes blood circulation suggest the weaker sex is wohlig hot during the sleep, Mr. President. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> And the current favorites? </seg>
<seg id="72"> Mattresses from cold foam may (he has more Pores with devastated cell structure and is therefore breathing more active than normal Polyurethan and much more flexible). </seg>
<seg id="73"> The combination of the various Steife (toughness) arise from Kaltschäumen and Visco-Schäumen Mehr-Zonen-Matratzen who know exactly where located head, hip and Fersen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> For a quality mattress, but 7.000 Crowns and more to fork out £3.3bn. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Health mattresses but are usually burdened with lower value-added tax, because they are considered to be medical aid. </seg>
<seg id="76"> As the first Czech companies this advantage Gumotex has been given. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> You can see on the bed and on to save is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Every now and again there are special offers from manufacturers and distributors, the two mattresses on the price of an offer. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Indeed, the brand offers the mattress Duofreeze Magniflex verstepptem Visco-Schaum Memory for 11.990 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="80"> The second will get one free. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the material Tempur, the era of viskoelastischen foam with open cell structure and high density began in almost cosmic speed. </seg>
<seg id="82"> Small wonder, then, they have been developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed at the landing huge excess loads. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83"> Tempur is in heat soft, cool milieu entrenched it again. </seg>
<seg id="84"> It fits perfectly in the human body and distributed in an optimal manner the physical pressure. </seg>
<seg id="85"> It is therefore not only ideal for the prevention of printing brandy, but increased general sleeping comfort. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86"> Viskoelastische foam but not only Matratzes but also in other health products, such as special Fußpolstern used to facilitate give the legs and the equipment. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Local manufacturers use, for example, the foam Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The army has so many Zündschnurs that you could umwickeln the whole Czech Republic keep you but only two years </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Czech army has 445 kilometers Zündschnüre bought with weapons. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the year before, the Defense Ministry had 224 kilometers Zündschnur supplied to the army camp. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have ausgesorgt for 225 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The problem is just the durability of the Zündschnur - two, at most, but four years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The army bought the Zündschnur from the company STV Group, others for paltry 40 million kronor. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In his justification for the purchase of these huge amount Zündschnur said the General Staff MF DNES, the soldiers would annually consume about 60 kilometres Zündschnur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to the research of Armeepyrotechnikern, according to the MF DNES emerges from this indication that the whole army annual an extremely intensive pyrotechnical training should, by all the generals and officers of the army command, to the Sekretärins and cleaning women. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Only in this way could be considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometres Zündschnüren reasonably justified. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This length corresponds 25.000 Detonationen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> But even this army stocks would be sufficient for more than ten years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But if the old rule of experts is still, for training every new professional soldier two meters Zündschnur quite sufficient, then the army by these Neueinkaufs, also from the point of view of the increased demand of pioneer and special teams - a reassuring stockpile for the above-mentioned created 225 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> It complained soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade recently in the Defence Minister Vondra, they would have almost no look for hand-held weapons more so that Schießübungen the lack of resources are limited due to strong. </seg>
<seg id="15"> From the same shortage demure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "I am not a why they are buying such huge Zündschnüre." </seg>
<seg id="17"> But it is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "For us, the army is a good customer, we as traders want concessions to as much as possible," says the sales manager of STV Group Jan Dcký. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Jan Pejek, the spokesman of the defence ministry justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres Zündschnur, so that the army would, at least for ten years with this "ammunition" rangers covers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Jan Dcký of the STV Group, however, only talks about a four-year span of the Zündschnur and the police and Armeepyrotechniker even just two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "With perfect storage are probably also the four mentioned years possible," admits one of them, but wants to remain unnamed, as a soldier not accused the criticism of the army. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the expiry of the utility of validity any ammunition must be tested thoroughly, whether it is reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="23"> However, these tests are not in vain, but costs further money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Another argument of the Defense Department is the quantitative rebate for 445 kilometers Zündschnur. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "It cost us 60% less than any year's supply of 244 miles," Pejek spokesman us shares the position of the buyers of the defence ministry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Only for comparison: the annual consumption of Zündschnüren of Pyrotechnikern of the police, the ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Army, liquidate exceeds some years barely 1.500 metres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> And the police always ordered such quantities of these weapons, which they still can consume before the expiry of the period of utility. </seg>
<seg id="28"> It is wonderful for the safety of the Pyrotechniker, is also keeping the possibility to flexible purchases more advanced and therefore reliable Zündschnurs open. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The Defense Ministry has already huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, as the two hundred thousand members Czechoslovak People's Army on its campaign was on the Rhine. </seg>
<seg id="30"> According to the Pyrotechnikern, MF DNES, expects the Czech armed forces in a few years, the same problem in the killing of hundreds of kilometres of old Zündschnurs, which they now so has bought "favourable." </seg>

<seg id="15"> Obviously against a fat compensation. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It would also be a sufficient explanation for why he his arrest such a large sum was. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="17"> Lubo G. was already in the past too good contacts with the Pilsner land fund. </seg>
<seg id="18"> For example, he also played in the issue of the former head of the land fund Vaclav Sankota a role, which was prosecuted because he issued in Ersatzrestitutionen land, which already location decisions had been taken to construction. </seg>
<seg id="19"> At the time Lubo G. acquired the land fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, to the point where the construction of the magistrale pole Borské for the industrial area was planned. </seg>

<seg id="11"> He added that the army will not have to manage without zweisitzige fighter aircraft as the Defense Department in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody a 200 million contract on the conversion of four superfluous L-159 on two-seats version signed. </seg>

<seg id="8"> The prominent Senator Joe Lieberman called, however, other countries and companies to boycott of Wikileaks. </seg>
<seg id="9"> And Wikileaks-Gründer Julian Assange, who is on the wanted list of Interpol, will reside after a newspaper report in Britain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> "Wikileaks supplanted by amazon server." </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Free speech in the land of the free" shared the Enthüllungs-Aktivisten per short messaging service Twitter on Wednesday (local time). </seg>
<seg id="12"> Shortly before the Internet companies Amazon had banned the Wikileaks-Dokumente from its servers. </seg>

<seg id="15"> If Amazon have such problem with the freedom of speech, "they should stop to sell books." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Amazon have halted the use of its servers by Wikileaks after staff employed by Senator Joe Lieberman enquiries had told the television channel CNN, citing the office Liebermans. </seg>

<seg id="19"> Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari told the participants initially the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The key is not only good taste, but also the seidig fluidity and good consistency. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Luciano forgets his training but not the icing on the cake of national and even südländischen superstructure: ' By Gelato is simply the best - and then is still plenty of romanticism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first step towards the manufacture seems quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Luciano repeals the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a large Mixgerät with an electronic programme everything at 85 degrees heated and then immediately to four degrees cooler. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Then he turns on the machine a Hahn, and a white basic lotions, it became clear basis for all milk eiss varieties. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Bestürmt as the teacher with questions: can you ice cream only produce with natural substances without stabilizer? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How can you own experimental free course? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Luciano warns the Zeitgeist mislead. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Who of ice cream "only" speech from natural ingredients, has possibly yet stabilisers used - usually a natural product, such as Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Of course you can ice also produce without stabilizer, it should only be sold within a day, otherwise sackt together, and the client bites on loud Eiskörnchen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Certain variations on the basic chips are allowed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It will be more exciting with the flavours. </seg>

<seg id="36"> Either in the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruit. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Or just on the ice cream from the white basic chips with eggs on the yellow cream and cocoa powder on the basis for all potential Schokoladen-Verführungen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Now we can change players in the Eismaschines. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano leaves them each four different types of vanille, chocolate, Mokka and Haselnuss-Eis produce - with or without eggs in the basic material, with more or less whatsoever aroma or other natural additives. </seg>
<seg id="40"> According to the same experiment will be subjected to the fruit eiss varieties. </seg>
<seg id="41"> More flavourings, more fruit puree, taste is not necessarily better. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Haselnuss-Eis tastes not necessarily nut palm, if it contains more hazelnuts. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The most popular Kiwi-Eis is the working group, and used more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Only a balanced mix will highlight the taste of a Gelato clear from says Luciano. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: if used peach puree with a lot of sugar, the sugar share must be reduced in the basic recipe. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For Zitroneneis an extra oats sugar is needed. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano prefers a device chaplain, with whom he the sugar content of fruit varieties certain (winemakers measure so that the Oechsle grape must). </seg>
<seg id="48"> Fortunately facilitate charts the calculation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Ice requires no longer so much physical use as before. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is not only helps the device for the automatic production of basic chips. </seg>
<seg id="51"> There is also a device in which the finished Eis-Mischung at the same time cremig will be beaten and chilled to freezing temperatures. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Before the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The government in Washington has enacted a ban - and thus their previous plans finally revoked. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Also new drilling off the Atlantic coast remain banned for the time being. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This told Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The trigger for the strict ban, at least to apply for the next five years, is the explosion of the Bohrplattform "Deepwater Horizon" in April. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Before the accident, the 11 workers dead and resulted in the US major environmental disaster, President Barack Obama on pressure from the opposition and the industry signaled its readiness, new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico should be permitted. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Advocates want to ensure that the US dependency on oil supplies from abroad. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Who bears the responsibility for the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf, is still not finalised. </seg>
<seg id="10"> At the heart of the criticism of the British energy company BP is faced with billions in claims. </seg>
<seg id="11"> A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama should present their results in the course of the December. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In October of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the Bohrstopp imposed after the explosion. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In the end had various oil companies immediately applications for new Bohrvorhaben. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> With tighter controls and stricter safety regulations, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a fresh disaster. </seg>
<seg id="15"> At the moment the competent control authority after numerous corruption charges was in disrepute, fundamentally reformed. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At the same time, Obama announced lucrative tax schlupflochs to close for the oil and Gaskonzerne. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The industry now publicly warns that the output in the Gulf by a tighter regulation would be significantly lower than previously. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "The government's plans are the biggest obstacle for the growth of the oil and gas industry" is the result of a recent industry survey by the consultancy firm BDO - even before the Bohrverbot on Wednesday. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The country does, however, to comment - still leaves it controls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As an antidote to midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007 will jump at least four Israeli F-15 i warplanes a mysterious, würfelförmiges building in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is on the shores of the Tigris; the next major city, 30 miles away, is Dair as-Saur. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Your name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, which Syria allegedly with help from North Korea has built in the Quader, hidden in a valley of the stream. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing of the US-Auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA by the end of April 2008 would be under the name of the near village el-Kibar familiar reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium, which could be employed to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes hardly worth the technology from the fifties. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA has led a video presentation with vague satellite imagery. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Per computer they ignored a animation where the components of the reactor should be have been before the destruction of a smaller copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyong nuclear center is. </seg>
<seg id="11"> They also presented photographs showing the building from the vicinity or even the interior space. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor was briefly stood before the operation, it was said, but not yet been drawn up with fuel rods. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more well-known than then, were the mystery even wider with the passage of time. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Former US President George W. Bush has recently unveiled in his memoir that the CIA was fairly safe before the attack that Syria has built a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly evidence saw that in the country, "an active nuclear weapons program" existed. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some intelligence officers in Europe are still prefer more cautious and speak only of a "alleged reactor," even if they CIA-Präsentation find "plausible." </seg>
<seg id="16"> You lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> What is needed, how safe it is to have a reactor, replied only bland a high UN-Diplomat in the summer, the IAEA was "enough material to ask questions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> According to the rubble of the alleged "ungenutzten Militärgebäudes" the Syrians eager to one side and thoroughly planierten the terrain. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, there was an IAEA team in June 2008 under the former chief inspector Olli hein in el-Kibar traces of uranium had been produced by people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The IAEA also received commercial providers on a Member State satellite images directly from the time after the attack, which should be more meaningful than the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, these recordings do not have to get on the market because of the unknown purchaser - perhaps Israel - she has bought exclusive. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify their authenticity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always declared, never pursued a secret nuclear program or a reactor built. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But it rejected the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely back. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss - as on the satellite imagery. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In addition, it denied the inspectors access to a second inspection in el-Kibar and the rubble of the bombed-out buildings. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But Israel says iron. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We will never comment on the ', recently reiterated to the time of the attack incumbent Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, the official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The investigation of the case thus dragging on since June 2008 inconclusive, "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority," as a senior Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna - after all, a serious breach of the NPT in the area, about which the IAEA monitoring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA appears to be three more bodies, "functional contact with the alleged reactor" should - and unlike those still exist. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In this context, the inspectors have not revealed what the assets are, nor what role they have or what they can appear to be suspicious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they will be on the IAEA internal as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah called, in turn, derived from nearby towns. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and at satellite images tracked down a building complex in Masyaf, where it is most likely is one of the suspicious objects. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It is probably in or adjacent to a military base - exactly with this justification denied Syria the IAEA access to the three places. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In Vienna, it says, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be vorgeschickt by the United States, auszuspähen at military installations. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Because the Nukleardetektive were carefully through a tip from the US on the facilities have become. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the Quader on the Euphrates material out and was transported. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could "in connection with the fuel production." </seg>
<seg id="40"> But there is "no evidence of sensitive activities," i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes which are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The type of reactor is operated with uranium is not enriched. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But where the uranium could have come from and where we draw from this later should be separated plutonium for the bomb on these central issues if anything, there are plausible assumptions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> It is also unclear whether debris that could pose a valuable clues in the three places were stored. </seg>
<seg id="44"> When would the hundreds Lastwagenladungen disappeared from the ground, nobody wants to have information about where the rubble remained. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The only a few kilometres from el-Kibar located on the other side of the Tigris al-Tibni salt mine, which Syria in 1998 on their suitability as a camp has investigated for radioactive waste, the IAEA is unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley she was recently in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor in mid-afternoon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Photographs from orbit show, however, that Syria to the three suspicious places Erdarbeiten and large containers removed after the IAEA access had requested. </seg>
<seg id="48"> This cannot be coincidence, but has hardly helped to dispel the suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> In addition, it says in diplomatic circles, the IAEA have spent many months to develop a plan for inspections there, Syria should allow to maintain any military secrets - just the tape shows how great is the interest of the inspectors. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte this proposal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Although Western diplomats in Vienna soothed even a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, so the matter did not have any urgency, brings about US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months ago so-called special inspections into the game, one of the harshest means that has the Vienna nuclear authority to enforce controls. </seg>
<seg id="52"> IAEA chief Yukiya Amano should propose these inspections, has already " an option for which I am open in the future ', even though he hesitates. </seg>
<seg id="53"> There is a high risk in this way: first, it needs for a majority in the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented are anything but eager for an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Secondly, as a diplomat to consider: "What if they find nothing in the end?" </seg>

<seg id="7"> In the meantime, the film marginalised in Hungary and in the postal production, but it is still protested in Bosnia. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerk UNHCR, Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has reported a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is even ambassador of UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerk. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is not Diplomatisch - she has the women weeks before a meeting in Hungary offered what but refused. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The meeting should take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But what exactly Jolie wrote for scenes? </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Bosnian Culture Ministry, which was to read their script, after some to-ing and fro-ing issued a permit for Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie then not yet came. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The young author even claimed to have no political intentions with their film was incorporated into the Yugoslav conflict with much difficulty, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all interested parties. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As for the content, however, it remains vague. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Still, a second Synopsis has been circulating for film in the network, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew before war broke out and meet again, a Bosnian Muslim woman when she is kidnapped at a Serb camp, where he works as a guard. </seg>
<seg id="18"> What sounds considerably different than the variant "rape victims verknallt torturer." </seg>
<seg id="19"> The fact that Jolie film actually starts before the war - so much is safe. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The demokatrische routine </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The democracy movement in Latin America will be stronger, such as the support of private companies. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil larger than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="5"> These results came the Latinobarómetro-Umfrage, which conducted in 18 countries and exclusive was published in The Economist. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Since 1995, this survey will be carried out on a regular basis and demonstrates the freedom of change in this region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two facts fall in this year's survey in September and October particularly in's eye. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First, the good mood in Latin America </seg>
<seg id="9"> And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In many countries, the democratic movement in the South American Pacific coast has increased sharply (Table 1). </seg>
<seg id="11"> In Peru, for example, where the economy since 2002 is growing by approximately 6% per year, increased the number of democracy activists by 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Even in Mexico, where the economy since the sharp fall in the last year recovered, is to see such a trend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the world's two most populous countries in the region are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (graph 2). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Approximately 44% of respondents said that they are satisfied with the democratic practices of their country. That as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3). </seg>
<seg id="15"> Approximately 34% trust the Congress of its country and 45% of their government. Both values are equivalent to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Before a decade undermined Latin America's economic crises efforts for more democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> It also continued during the global economic crisis is probably due to the fact that the Latin American countries experienced only a brief recession, and have recovered quickly. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, the poor were absorbed by a stronger social network. </seg>
<seg id="19">  (According to reports by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week rose in 2009, the poverty rate in Latin America only slightly and has again fallen by 32% this year.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But from country to country there are strong Stimmungsunterschiede (graph 4). </seg>
<seg id="21"> Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread progress thinking reflect that. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> It was only the second time since polling began to see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country a greater problem than unemployment (graph 5). </seg>
<seg id="24"> Approximately 31% say that either themselves or a family member in the past year victim of a crime was. But compared to 38% last year fell the values and thus achieve the lowest since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The rising economic performance is reflected in the greater support from the private sector and the market economy is mirroring: approximately 71% of respondents trans-regional that the private sector is essential for the development in 2007, there were 56% (graph 6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared with 47% last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly, 62% of respondents maintain this view in Venezuela (and 80% are for a private sector), even though her leftist president, Hugo Chávez, many private companies nationalized. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil has loudly 19% of respondents (18% last year) the greatest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year). </seg>
<seg id="29"> The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, however, see the most influential country in the US, and this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua from Venezuela. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband told Argentina's President Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, their popularity rate by 20 points to more than 50% upwards. This is the highest value since her election in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Whether her this, however, carries a re-election next year depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández kompromissbereiter than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Nestor Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The signs are not clear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Nestor Kirchner, who also directed the economic policy after the election of his wife, often budgets on tax revenues, the economic growth and inflation are not fully incorporated. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This allowed the presidential couple, the extra revenue to spend as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In the paper last year Mr. government lost the majority in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further clashes. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some dissidents from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten rallying behind Cristina Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But after chaotic meetings (in which a parliamentarian another hit in the face and others lying to the government of corruption), the Congress failed to adopt the budget for 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I will not discuss" the President. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The budget for 2010 now also applies to the next year, which the President has more opportunity to spend as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy runs hot: it is likely this year to grow up to 9%. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official inflation rate is for Z. at 11,1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the unions - drive the value of almost 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was racked by economic crises, said its main objectives for growth and poverty reduction, and not the inflation reduction. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He refused to cooperate with the IMF, schikanierte the private sector and the national institute for statistics and census säuberte INDEC, then schönte the official inflation statistics. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Fernandez can now follow a path? </seg>
<seg id="18"> It has the private economy and trade union leaders called for talks. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And, according to official statements are supposed to wage increases next year will be limited to 18%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the inflation undermined the growth spurt by a great devaluation in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Perhaps would like to Cristina Fernández for this reason Argentina financial back to join the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="23"> At the beginning of this year, the government took an agreement with the former restructuring of the country had rejected in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Fernandez seems now to an agreement with the lenders to push from the Paris Club, which it owes approximately 6,7 Dollar billion. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Kirchners had a review by the IMF, as elsewhere usual always rejected. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But in the last month, the economy minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund in the preparation of a new national consumer price index "technical assistance" it looks as this would be the first step towards the cleansing of the INDEC. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not known whether Fernandez after their term even without the support from her husband will be politically active. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of Kirchnerism. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the Argentinians in March to return from their summer holidays, the wave of Sympatie, it has been shown to be fizzled. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If they want to win another election, they must decide whether they many political decisions to lift her husband's quietly. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Taiwan's voters are coming slowly to a closer connection to the mainland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> What is stopping Taiwan from his big brother across the Straits? </seg>
<seg id="4"> On 27 November made more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all voters in the five Stadtbezirken to elect mayors and councillors. This is as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou welcomed. </seg>
<seg id="5"> By building cutting-edge business relations, einschl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma even a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland. His policy has the relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949 sustainable change. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Ma insisted the test, but only barely. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) three of the five mayors, they did not receive a majority of votes. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Instead, received the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates a greater independence of Taiwan, almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In a presidential election would have meant this for Ma problems. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Since his election two years ago, the share of his party has fallen by approximately 8%. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For the first time the DPP even pulled together with the KMT in the councillors a. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as Lastwagenkonvois with Flaggen-schwenkende Massenumzüge and rarely are. </seg>
<seg id="13"> There was even the obligatory mysterious assassination attempt. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT felt on the eve of the election with a speech at a KMT-Kandidaten </seg>
<seg id="15"> When he shot a man from the crowd face. Lien was wounded and killed a umstehend spectator. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Most bizarre wiser is not clear whether the shooter Lien kill or wanted to settle a dispute with the candidate. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Regardless of the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, affected the election and the DPP in a bad light brought what the KMT has brought more votes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> China was perhaps the biggest winner of the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Remarkably, the relationship has not been addressed to the mainland. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Instead, the candidates discussed here plans to social housing and the creation of jobs. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This is why the KMT its relations with the government in Beijing is not like in the foreground. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But this time the DPP, the anti-Chinese sentiments to stir up too. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy can not survive without China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Ma, in turn, would confirm that the majority of Taiwanese supported its China policy. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy, Taiwan attract with economic incentives in the community. </seg>
<seg id="27"> China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei for a summit to prepare investment security and medical cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="28"> It also wants to see the political integration. But first things first. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It therefore prefer waiting until after the 2012 presidential election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The DPP has now reinvented. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Before two years ago it was severely weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was convicted of corruption in the prison. </seg>
<seg id="32"> During his presidency from 2000 until 2008 he vehemently for the absolute independence a. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But under Tais reign has developed a new generation of gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of professionals and young people. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Tsai was held as a presidential candidate of the DPP great approval, as Su Tseng-chang under Chen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Your party does everything in order to show that it is capable of building close relations with Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Tsai is planning a of think tank as a contact point between the DPP and China, but this requires an unbiased discussions ahead. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Tsai said publicly that their party will offer a "trustworthy alternative" to Ma's hasty rapprochement with China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Chen seems very angry about this change. </seg>
<seg id="39"> From his cell, he said, the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan independence. </seg>
<seg id="40"> He urged the pragmatists Su even to renounce the presidential candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even without Chen's interference does the DPP difficult to choose their potential candidate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The KMT will undergo must own self-analysis. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Ma's values are poor, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT-Kandidaten wanted to conduct their campaigns without him. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The main reasons for his unpopularity seem unemployment and the increasing gap between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="45"> According to testimony, he will be a KMT-Sprechers cabinet and revamp the local facilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan supports only limited a rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="47"> At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese see the economic cooperation with China as inevitable. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "One wonders what else is possible," said the report's Co-Autor Ariel D. of Anbar of Arizona State University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is an important step in the search for outside earthly life, since scientists life and must recognize its forms of Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study addresses microbes have been found on the planet. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were announced about the discovery was cause for widespread speculation on the Internet that the report of the discovery could act außerirdischen life. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "shows that in other Planetensystemen organisms with the help of other elements biochemical processes can set in motion, and that the 'Standardelemente ', which, in our view, are absolutely vital, are not necessarily fixed prescribed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University in the United Kingdom from Milton Keynes. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockel was not part of the research team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "This work is a new thing, because it shows that in an element of fundamental biochemical processes and structures can be replaced by another," added Cockell to add. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> This discovery was not accidental. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the Astrobiologischen Institute of NASA, who led the study, chose the mono Lake because of the high Arsengehalts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Since arsenic and phosphorus chemical equal, they thought that microbes that are both suspended, possibly an element can be replaced by the other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "The toxicity of the Arsens above all is that it is chemically similar phosphorus." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "It is difficult, the organisms to distinguish an element from the other." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "But the difference is so great that arsenic pans unlike phosphorus. It ends up in our biochemisches system, where there have been virtually everything verschmiert ', said of Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers used the bacterium GFAJ-1 rising arsenic concentration. It wanted and grew. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The microbe grows in phosphorus better, but that they also can survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic standard form can happen, of course, either on earth or another planet or moon on the arsenic occurs more frequently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> According to Jamie S. Foster, believe in microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new; but so far there was no functioning example. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Arsenic came more frequently in the early Erdjahren, she says, so the science assumed that early life forms have used it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> "The reason for the assumption that life may have developed differently than in the early geologically important," so Forster not sat in Wolfe-Simons research team. </seg>

<seg id="28"> The research were from NASA, the Energy Department and supported the national health authorities. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The plan, in accordance with the statements Thursday met the requirements of the US-Konkursrecht, so that the relaunch of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass entertainment, nothing more stands in the way. Barber and Birnbaum are the slightly slimmed-down studio headed as CEO. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The staff numbers by more than 400 to around 320 reduced. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For MGM tramples Chapter 11 actually first in force when JPMorgan Chase a planned loan of 500 Dollar million to finance the new MGM-Produktionen has been completed. </seg>
<seg id="7"> At the moment is leading a consortium of investment bank, even 75 Dollar million of revenue, the company. The funding should be until the middle of December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with a mandate to the investment bank Moelis & CO, management, with interest payments in the amount of output of 300 Dollar billion--an Mio/ year struggled to help in solving its financial problems. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In August was the manager Harry Sloan replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, through his work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts was known. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The efforts of Moelis & Cooper MGMs to resolve the financial concerns and the more than 140 Gläuber of Studio auszubezahlen, lasted longer than expected. </seg>
<seg id="11"> After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009, to offer to buy the company. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But the auction drew only a few bidders and nobody wanted to pay the $2 billion requested by the creditors. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In the spring of this year started everything from scratch, as the MGM-Team began with the restructuring plan after months of debate and infighting at the end of October was finally signed by the creditors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> If MGM formally in the next few weeks the bankruptcy has survived, preserved Moelis and Cooper for her work a bonus amounting to several millions of dollars. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The proportion of Moelis & company, which is already 1,2 Dollar million received amounts to 9,5 Dollar million </seg>
<seg id="16"> Cooper, who are paid a monthly 375.000 Dollar for the leadership of the company has received a "success bonus" of $4 million </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM, and this year brought only a movie, it turned out the studio and produced an annual plan with seven or eight movies, beginning in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="18"> They also plan two films after " the small Hobbit ' in Co-Produktion with Warner Bros. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The studio needs a separate bond between 265 Dollar million to 275 Dollar million for its financial share in these two films, under the aegis of Peter Jackson should arise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The investor Carl Icahn, who has funded approximately 18% of the MGM-Darlehens sought a merger of the studio with Lions Gate entertainment, he is its largest shareholder. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> But you can protect your gift budget. </seg>
<seg id="5"> I recently visited on the search for three electronic toys under 80 Dollar three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys 'r' and a BJ's whole sale club. </seg>
<seg id="6"> I was immediately clear that Moore's Law in force, and this year the technological toys are more efficient and costs at the same time a little less than last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> And although appear less new toys with their own website, is the best-known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, a broader supply. </seg>
<seg id="8"> There are more Knopfzellen-betriebene toys on the market, and many include rehabilitation and aufladbare batteries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Here are a few recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="10">  (If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys 'r'.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 Dollar for children 3 years) are Plüschfiguren as big as marine pigs sing a note if it depresses her belly. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The first push corresponds to a note by repeated pressure can play a song. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Respect: if you have begun with the pressure, you can no longer stop. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> For a combination of Gesand and dance the dance star Mickey (fisher price 60 Dollar for children from 2) the best choice. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Based on the Elmo developed in the past year broadcasting technology offers the animatronische doll exchange games such as 'Simon says ', and they dominated with Radblockierung Scharnierfüße, thanks to the innovative Moon-Walk. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Children who test the equipment, use Mickey as a dance teacher, but your parents complained about the lack of vocal starch system. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="18"> If you have a child of the 1980s, you must remember Alphie, one of the first computerised validation system foreseen learning toys. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> If you your child does not want to entrust your Smartphone, here are three independent alternatives. </seg>
<seg id="21"> MobiGo VTech (60 Dollar for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most solution, equipped with a qwerty-Tastatur, and included games are not as instructive as the Leapster Explorer (70 Dollar for children 3 to 12) after Leapfrogs first major revision of the Leapster-Reihe equipped with a new, brighter screen. </seg>
<seg id="22"> None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="23"> IXL of fisher price (90 Dollar for children from 3 to 7) used for the Games and eBooks a system similar iTunes, and thanks to the SD-Kartenlaufwerks can also family photo to be seen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Finally there is Scrabble Flash (30 Dollar from Hasbro for children from 8). The five blocks are no bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED-Bildschirm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The game is about to merge the blocs to words, before the time is running out. It is great for an impromptu Buchstabierwettbewerb. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> More and more toys have a kind of online link. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If you alone after the supply in the toy stores, Webkinz and Club Penguin the most important. </seg>

<seg id="18"> Paul Coggins, principal defenders of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview, on Monday, he received a telephone call from a prosecutor and another at the next day, in which he was told that no complaints against his client, the ministry will impose. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Cheshire Twitter draws attention </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A half-dozen of them tippten in the riots in the courtroom. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The last-minute verschickten them on Twitter their reports on gruesome testimonies. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the end, the defense, there were more than 140.000 Twitter-Meldungen on trial for rape and beds gekettete children in a house, the flare-up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Thursday the closely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was indicted, three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, killed an official end to find if the judgment on the death sentence, the jury pronounced falls. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already enquires in court, explain the reasons for an appeal and employing the courts for years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> One of the provozierend most reasons is that it through the intensive reporting on the process, including through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporter - a "circus atmosphere" and a widespread immediately penetration aufrührerischer details came, so that the jury in an improper manner had been influenced by the public outrage. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This objection could lead the Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question whether the new technologies will need new rules in the courtroom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "As I have seen during this process, I believe that it is really a danger, if the arrival of the new technologies, the right of every individual in the courtroom influenced to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes main defenders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue from the Supreme Chamber Court, rejected the requests last week by ruling succinct back when he said that the New Media "carefully controlled" would, and that there is no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But it was certainly not the last word in this matter. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For decades Gerichtseinsprüche have noted that the reporting on notorious cases doubt on the fairness of a trial. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States the ruling against Dr Sam Sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, which is supposed to have killed his wife, lifted and said in his ruling that because the new media a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" would have been. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some people believes that the TV show and the movie "on the run" based on this crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some lawyers say, Gerichtseinsprüche, which Mr. Hayes conviction be seen half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary for the channels from the courtroom at the time of the case, Dr Sheppard were unimaginable to regulate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "There is a good reason, about the impact of new media in processes, which will be followed by a broad public to be concerned," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut, but his report, they arbitrarily imposed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor Donohue said, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction immediately communications from the courtroom, it turned out, could make the processes of fair play. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Twitter affair is just one of many who set out by Mr. Hayes lawyers to discuss for years and thus delay a condemnation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> For example, the defenders also say that Mr. Hayes could be already have been vorverurteilt as a judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential Jurors by giving them showed gruesome Tatortfotos during the juror selection. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some have said the Jurors photographs of the victims, Jennifer hawke petit 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, they would have met with disgust. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defenders say that they were also questioning the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judges had mistakenly exchanged a jury, which has been a critic of the prosecutor, and that he had exerted undue pressure on the ruling, as he had taken the unusual decision to ask the jury free over the weekend. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The Jurors were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But their arguments about the impact of the detailed reporting about the process prefers perhaps the greatest interest. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In a judgment anfechtung have submitted it last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and was discussed by the candidates for the US Senate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They argued that the New Media continually had rekindled the flames of the emotions on the case. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "Such a daily crush of media piepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," wrote the lawyers, "it has been previously in New Haven and perhaps even not seen nationwide." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Your emphasis on reporting by Twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Some journalists have said in interviews that the assertion that these direct messages are rabble-rousing but as reports, which will be reimbursed at a slower rate, a technikfeindlicher look is the verarme reporting on future processes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> But some lawyers said, Appelationsgerichte would often faced with the argument, social and technological changes requires the Adaptation through the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr. Hayers lawyers reinforce this assertion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In her appeal, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the condemnation of Dr Sheppard was lifted because the reporting and made it clear that the New Media new rules require. </seg>
<seg id="32"> "This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Civility can connect the division? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> After a campaign of dirty words and negativity this week erupted little civility in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It is the sign of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion, before quickly returning to fight the parties in the capital? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and Congressional leaders brought no breakthrough on the big issues during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government session, in which no decisions will be taken more had to employ. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After all, what we hear, it was not a polite debate between two different parties to govern even a consideration of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partisan Punktesammelns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meeting of the deficit commission the president on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences that still exist between the members. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months arise leaves a mutual respect, the ideological gulf separating the members still veiled. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> This is hardly enough to claim that it is a new era of cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Both sides are now in a testing phase, in which a voice from the other signs of cooperation and compromise, while even tried the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters weigh after a renewed partisan warfare. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This was why the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants limited to a minimum of demands or accusations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep, and that a rapid change in the atmosphere which prevailed in the past two years, could be expected. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Whether it involves taxes, donations, health or Anwartschaften, the two sides are miles apart. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Lastly, the November election Washington, at least for a short time bribed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, now for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center" works. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "It is inevitable after elections. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elections appear partisan passions die again. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And that is good." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the "lame duck session" Republicans and Democrats hardly any other choice than to find a solution. " </seg>
<seg id="19"> Bush's tax cuts end up at the end of the year, and no one advocates. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way to some or even all receive, whether temporarily or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is also necessary to expect a compromise on the increased unemployment money, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that it believes the preferred tax cuts for the rich, while unemployed workers refuse a support. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House has increased the optimism that these issues during the "lame duck session" to reach an agreement and at the same time the new Start treaty can be ratified. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame duck session " not compelling must lead to a lasting cooperation between the parties, if the new 112. Congress will convene in January. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead, he says, is a phase of failure for huge likely, perhaps even inevitable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "After the things that need to be done, done, will turn these short-term psychology in confrontation," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Wehner is also sceptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - the politeness leads to real cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "I see many things from now on until 2012 happens, as Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event from 2012," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons for this have a lot with the presentation of the new Republican majority to do in the White House and with the Teeparty-Wählern were conducive to their education. </seg>
<seg id="29"> As the Republican leaders also expressed concern may be that they vie to high, they know that they must try to reduce their promises, the expenditure of the government and the health care reform to set aside to adhere to. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> This party lines are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the deficit commission clearly what a tax reform and the state of some taxes and raising the retirement age and include the planting of government spending. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The stellvertretends chairman Alan Simpson and Bowles Erskine an inherited the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, so pressed to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes in order to make its plan for the official recommendation, and they are fighting very well to come only in the proximity of this figure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The biggest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters, at least today, little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Galston says two stages in the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress ahead. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The first fight next year will take place in the form of Parteizusammenstößen, when the Republicans Obama on the state budget, taxes and challenging the health care system, then followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will lead to this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> The public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It is shown that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties to work together. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If confrontation in a blind alley, as happened in 1995, then we must respect both parties carefully on the public reaction. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Whoever is doomed to lose, will change the course and must seek compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> This may in fact be an optimistic view. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Partisanship and polarization are now greater than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem to have a greater ideological divide between Obama and the Kongress-Republikanern to be at the same time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At the same time see the activists of both parties in 2010 as a mere prelude to a consequence far broader election in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> So it may be the courtesy display this week will be welcomed by many Americans. </seg>
<seg id="45"> But on both sides, it will require much more effort to find a common denominator in the issues that the two still separated. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge towards the government, are longtime supporters challenged in Anlong Veng. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In April a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In June, the government circulated a school book for the first time children of former soldiers told the story of the Khmer Rouge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And in July condemned a Community Tribunal of the United Nations and Cambodia for the first time a former member of the Khmer Rouge, as the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, was sentenced to 35 years in prison. </seg>

<seg id="11"> "There is still disagreement and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "It was the life under the Khmer Rouge glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "It is dividing even families." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> During the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or they died from disease, overwork or starvation. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When the Vietnamese invaded and 1979 overthrew the Pol Pot-Ied government, fled the remnants of the regime and its military to the border of Cambodia to Thailand. </seg>

<seg id="21"> When their benefactors they no longer protected, fled most former Khmer Rouge fighters in the grinding poverty of the rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Even if a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts, because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers. </seg>

<seg id="29"> "But now, life is difficult, because we have to care for ourselves." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The current Khmer Rouge tribunal has also fomenting here concerns. </seg>
<seg id="31"> At the beginning of next year, the court will try, Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge ministers to put before the courts. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The mandate of the court, the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities to condemn, but it has not said whether it over these four cases will pursue further action. </seg>
<seg id="33"> This has contributed little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Recent media speculation on the Chaem, 64 years concentrated during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's, district chief in the province of Manteay Meanchey have been. </seg>
<seg id="35"> In 2007, it was representative of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia told they have the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms led a project in which thousands of forced labourers probably died. </seg>

<seg id="38"> If the court vorladen them, so they would refuse to go, she said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> "Cambodia is living in peace and stability," she said. </seg>
<seg id="40"> "If there were no prosecutions more is war." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> Prime Minister Hun Sen, in 1878 fled from the Khmer Rouge, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, would accuse the court more suspects, although experts and historians discuss. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Belarus agrees not continue to collect weapons-grade uranium </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to global security of nuclear material, the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it no longer will collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The deal has been in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarussian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov announced in an additional article of the Sicherheitsgipfels. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The US government had been trying for years to persuade Belarus, not to collect more highly enriched uranium and appeared last spring reached a hurdle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But officials of the US government told the Washington Post, that in the last two months, two secret agreements have been reached with Belarus, 187 pounds weapons-grade uranium to remove from a White Russian research centre. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This was the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material, according to an official staff, which remains anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue, approximately 500 pounds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The agreement seems one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear security summit of 47 nations" to be in April ruled Belarus. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And it was obviously good enough at the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012 to secure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I was thrilled by the fact that they have a seat in the nuclear security summit (from 2012) want." </seg>
<seg id="10"> "This proves that it works for me," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership Global Security, a group for the promotion of nuclear safety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Clinton called the agreement " a very significant, important step ' of Belarus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Obama promised in Prague in April 2009, within four years to secure all vulnerable nuclear material. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since then, the US government helped six countries, its highly enriched uranium to disappear. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Belarus will be the seventh. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At the time of Obama's Nuklearem security summit, the Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up their uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamental weapons-grade, and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko at the time. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "This is our raw material... we will not make it a dirty bombs and we will sell it to anyone." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We use it solely for research purposes, that is all." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Belarus still approached a few months ago the United States than interest anzeigte meeting an agreement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The first attempt to remove the uranium in Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was irradiated, perhaps, say officials. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It was loaded in a Spezialzug of more than 1.300 miles on a Russian factory for storage and disposal, say officials. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the officials by plane. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The US government will pay for these travails dollars 14 million, with a large part of the money in the Belarussian research goes with low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "This was very carefully coordinated and concerted confidence" to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton led, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Energy Department, which operates in the global risk reduction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende Studies estimates that Belarus this year at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Belarus wants, according to the joint agreement dissolve his camp until 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The relations between Belarus and the United States were strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harschen disregard for human rights. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But the statement on Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> "According to the progress of this global security issues welcome liable to cancel out the United States of America and Belarus know that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she says. </seg>

</p>

<seg id="14"> The ambassador also expressed its concern about the approach of the PP in this matter. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "Despite their generally proamerikanischen attitude our experience shows that the PP will not doubt from an indication that the government of the United States Zapatero's acts as a possible human rights violations could be interpreted, tolerated or have deliberately ignored capital, even if these revelations will have a negative impact on the government of the United States could," he stresses. </seg>

<seg id="7"> Today, the European Central Bank demanded a month on us to reverse our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen, according to which the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably still many times in the future, must make a U-turn. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The Bundesbank called for the lifting of the plan for the purchase of government debt, because they are ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures - only a week's indefinite access, it should be maintained. </seg>
<seg id="9"> After the Ireland crisis, we expect that the current liquidity measures "at least until March" extended and the quarterly tenders with unlimited access on quarterly of the year in order to guarantee the liquidity will be maintained until at least June. </seg>
<seg id="10"> We also expect that the programme for the purchase of bonds continued and will spend a reinforcing signal. </seg>
<seg id="11"> If the managed expectations are not met, the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday back and if halstarrig insistence that we withdraw our liquidity measures, can only God help us! </seg>
<seg id="12"> As with the EZB-Sitzung in May, in which the bank confirmed the purchase of government debt securities not to take into account and then collapsed, the markets could repeat this history tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The ECB must be credible and tenacious. </seg>

<seg id="15"> Yesterday was the auction of one-year government permits in Portugal pretty weak. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The state asset management were only 500 million at 5,28%, compared with 750 million 4,81% in the previous auction. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Nevertheless, fell 30 basis points interest rates in Portugal in the whole curve and thus reflected a perceptual change the markets after the words Trichet's reflect that. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In Ireland were the figures of the debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland published. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The amount is approximately 10.000 million short-term and possible further 15.000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after failing to recognize the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures are acceptable in the context of the rescue plan and help to reduce the uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, the government Tuesday must receive parliamentary approval for his new budget, but the fact that they still do not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Angela Merkel has its discourse in relation to the summit of Heads of State and the government of moderate shaped on 14 December where it needed political unity in order to show that we shared the same score to play. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries which Beethoven's ninth symphony. </seg>

<seg id="24"> The Spanish government minister hovered above yesterday's action plan should be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reduction of the deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures in the ears of investors such as Vivaldis sound four seasons. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The dual effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4,5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Compared to February was the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank quickly and convincingly, and we benefit from the surprise result. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Today there is an authoritative auction of a three-year bond will reap the benefits from the trichet effect; that is why we put on a strong demand, which remove all doubt about our debt-restructuring capacity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> For Spain would be the application of an aid plan a self-sacrifice. </seg>
<seg id="30"> We get liquidity, which we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion available, three times as much as in March. the interest rates are very expensive and would get access to the markets closed. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The caretaker board member of Banco saba dell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers; he believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but a new liquidity crisis initially rejects and predicts the end of the Schuldenkriegs. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Nevertheless, he sees a collapse of the banks with interest margins ahead to offset increases the fees and prices for loans to try. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Saba dell expected in three years a million retail customers - a remaining specialist. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="5"> Saba dell has found the way to exploit the next three years, and so in a very difficult economic environment to survive. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In 2011, the bank will introduce a new three-year flagship plan. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The goal is not only to survive without public aid to claim from the FROB, but also the market share for a million retail customers - 700.000 if the customers, the bank will lose - to increase. This is the great challenge facing this bank, because until now it has its business customers more attention than their private customer. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This year it has 250.000 private customers and 50.000 companies extract. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Your market share in retail is at 3.5 percent, while the business customers constitute more than 10 percent. </seg>

<seg id="10"> Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase of productivity, i.e. Austerität cost reductions. The challenges faced by the bank so that, they will present along with annual Summary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Only a few banks dare in these difficult times set targets and to publish as a result of the financial crisis worldwide all plans of the banks are disrupted. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Saba dell this year its guiding plan established four years ago Optima conclude. This was designed initially for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended for a business year. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The customers will leave the savings banks are the main objective of the bank. </seg>

<seg id="15"> The manager expects Spain would only "slow" out of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In addition, it would be "very difficult" in two or three years "work to create" - essential for the survival of the banks. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Even if he assumes that the war for liabilities - the interest margins punished - will wane, raise risk premia, banks and thrifts must pay for their emissions to the maintenance of liquidity, as compensation for declining profit margins already shifted to the price for loans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "The issues liquidity and funding are structural in nature and they will exert pressure on the loans." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We have not marginalised Hahn, but the Zinsdifferenziale are very high," Guardiola admitted. </seg>

<seg id="23"> It is not for nothing that he assured that in Spain "larger companies are necessary." </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin has opted for the of, keeping the euro, but at the same time conditions set for the entire European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tension on the markets have sparked a dual response of the government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation measures presented, ranging from tax rebates for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the lifting of the 426 million support for the unemployed, not unemployment benefits, referring to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand supports the Deputy Head, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former government Minister Felipe González criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible, evokes have to the current crisis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How are these events to understand? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is anticipated that Merkel's position no errors of their publicity. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It takes Germany a fundamental new perspective on the shape of our future, with the maintenance of the ancient traditions of a large part of its partners. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Given the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways to spekuliern from the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro area. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The second: the reintroduction of the German mark - although that is currently more sounds like science fiction - supported by a majority of the public opinion, around 50% of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The third point: a transformation of the euro, according to German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries which overstep the specifications; möglicher as the default of certain countries, as well as the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures on the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is clear and has been looming for some time; that is why there is now no excuses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First of all, 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission incentives for deficits and the German government is a constitutional reform drew from the sleeves in order to prevent this from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This was the first sign of the divergence between what Germany saw fit (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second signal suspended the Central European country, as Merkel the decision on the rescue of Greece by delaying painful. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It was then that the strong criticism; but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion were totally against a rescue of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Merkel is finally in the last Oktobertags again with a clear position; it calls for a reform of the agreements between the European Union in order to facilitate the rescue of a country and at the same time to commit the private lender to bear a part of the cost. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position was interpreted as anti-European because they Ireland crisis and propelled everything the following. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But her proposal, albeit slightly sweetened, has been adopted; in the next few months, we will be in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures from 2013 should participate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has drawn a red line, which is not to exceed it intends. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It says all that - even if now unpopular measures must be taken - from this date the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist. </seg>
<seg id="24"> 2013 will be the birth year of a new monetary area in which the offender countries be punished harshly, can be forced to declare itself insolvent and in this case the private sector must take a share of the cost. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows us that we must take a tough growth with high saving and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The other alternative on debt and construction based with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it from Spain was cited in boom times, will simply not be tolerated. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would do wrong to not understand it. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not just about the public deficit to three percent by the year 2013 runterzufahren. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much harder. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the worst, what we could do under these conditions is to cheat ourselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the current turmoil to move into more calm. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And that we have the opportunities that are available to us, until spring 2013 will use. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero has interpreted, and its dual announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) suggests that despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis to create order in your own home, is preparing its way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not seem that it would change anything. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Among the options taken into account is that the euro area packed with little serious countries would have to leave, not be ruled out. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In this case, Germany could still tell us, it warned us. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Sport and regulatory tax evasion </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tricks like Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax of show inventiveness, but not the desire to circumvent a sanction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The alleged by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) exclusion in the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League meant that has been shed a lot of ink about whether it is an unsporting act or not acted and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA. </seg>
<seg id="4"> As is well known, lost two players for a few minutes of the game of the year (her team had already clearly won) time and played several Fouls, so that the referee them showed the second yellow card. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way, and since the Real Madrid would cite his group, the two players the prescribed sanction against the Auxerre meet in the next league game and so without cards enter into the next room for phase. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Finally, the UEFA punished the disciplinary kommitee, José Mourinho, the coach of the club with two games and the participating players with different sums of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow card in this or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is so widespread that they form part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed rules in this sport -. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of the debate about the portrayed event is due to the fact that a team of the football club Real Madrid (the find and honor claims in its national anthem and on other occasions punished for similar incidents had his players) played the main role, and the drama by Mourinho an episode more on his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician has added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case revolves around the debate about whether this is not explicitly prohibited behaviour by the statutes contradicts the principles of the sport, which is to say, whether these actions constitute a regulatory evasion. Indeed, this approach will abide by the statutes of the sport, but seem to circumvent its meaning. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this matter should damage caused to the sporting spirit to be investigated. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect which was not jeopardized by these acts, because it was not an aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the offender players an unwarranted benefit from the team, and this did not happen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradox of the plot of the players of Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally understand under false game or regulatory evasion, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly completed in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as visible as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players waited and the sanction happily attended. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is what kind of advantage the offender from the deliberate Fouls. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This should be stressed that the rival neither was put in a disadvantageous position still benefits were erheischt for the played game, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue to play with a few players. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, then the club lacks these players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The benefit is obvious that the players the next ground phase of the Champions League without cards, which could threaten their participation in a future game begin. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a long-term, to a certain extent uncertain advantage, because the team could also leave at some point. Moreover received the players with this approach, a sanction and go in the second card cycle on where they are because card acquisition disappeared with a card less than in the first cycle. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In this way, it is not clear whether it is really an advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Ultimately, such practices are directed not against the sporting spirit, which includes strategic decisions, in order to derive from the rules a maximum benefit. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case, the players did not want any sanction deal (that would be really a clear case of regulatory evasion), they wanted to elect more when they undergo this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They met a strategic decision to duck without a penalty or to flee before her. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Although it is blurring the line between inventiveness and regulatory environment, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because it involved two Selbstausschlüsse and because of the nature of the provoked regulatory transfer. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The damage inflicted on the principles of sport through these actions was less ethical rather than aesthetic nature. </seg>

<seg id="6"> However, it is not a traditional orders to arrest. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In addition, it is not new, it comes from the 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States to do, but with the allegations of sexual abuse, which the Australians must face in Sweden. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It also assured the lawyer of the founder of WikiLeaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they contact with Mr. Assange could absorb." </seg>
</p>

<seg id="10"> As early as 20 gave the international police agency located in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden orders, but until yesterday after receipt of the power it has not been announced by the Swedish authorities. </seg>
<seg id="11"> That is how things stand. The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify Assange and, presumably, "to provisionally arrest him and hand them over." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Although Interpol for the arrest of a person hit by a red warning may not see many member countries according to the organisation of the red warning as a licence for a Arrestierung - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreements, as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange probably finds himself. </seg>

<seg id="18"> "If it can be proved that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the United Nations and therefore against the United States to sign international agreements infringed, they should resign," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> His opinion was yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, condemned the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> Rubén Omar Romano looks at three defeat in Endspiels back, he has Aufs and Abs experienced in his career, but he has three crucial games had, and he has so far kept well why this opportunity is of particular importance for him. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Argentines has played with the medal for the second champion, he has remained a step behind the victors and amazingly, he fought successive Endspiels with the same team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The santistische strategist reached the first final as a coach in the 'Torneo Apertura 2002 ' than del Morelia had the reins in the hand with which he against Toluca learned a great defeat with 4-2; later, in the 'Clausura 2003 ' he reached the decisive match, which he also lost against Rayados with 3-1. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Back in with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010 ', in which it against Los Diablos, played Rubén again had to share a setback because the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros equalised after 210 Spielminuten, but he came to the penalty kick with 3-1 forward and got two options, accepting his title, but ultimately missed three of his players and the game 11 steps on a 4-3. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Rubén already had two Endspiele with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, lost; that is why he would not again be pursued by the disaster and rid themselves of the bad attention in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirmed that the most important thing for him, the game itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I would like to be champion, I would like to break no statistics for a club, for my affection, I am hingebe, and therefore the title will come to me, but what previously happened, is the most important thing," commented the helmsman when they questioned him about the lost Endspiels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The last endgame he is still strong in the recall, he assured to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from this is that until the referee is not the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players, because the last time we were with two Elfmetern already prepared early, and I think that is a lesson until the game is not finished, there is no cause for celebration." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shoot-out, concerned him not because he trusted his players: "You never want to arrive at the penalty shoot-out, we would like to finish in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is no alternative, and we must be prepared, we were prepared in the previous Tournee, but unfortunately gave us the fate a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the fierce desire to keep the title already in the hands, which left us something for this endgame, and we hope that it will not happen this time." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The new American Diplomatenleitungen, which have been disseminated by WikiLeaks, reveal the mystery about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of Canadians feel toward the Americans; but they put the the latter superiority with the same blow against Canada open. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Consequently, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters to the ballot, not the kanadisch American relations in the spirit, and they believe that the visit by President Obama would have helped the Conservative government, their Budget of 2009 to enforce! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The four new communications between the US Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which have been disseminated yesterday publicly offer even more juicy details than the mere substantive content, in which it has a very bad outcome. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A previous link on 22 September 2008, i.e. in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage was in full swing, reported from what point the United Nations is not more of the operations involve discussed by their political bosses. </seg>
<seg id="6"> With regard to the great surprise of David Wilkins of Ottawa deployed American ambassador. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Mr. Wilkins offers various channels of this situation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "One of the Canadians almost inherent inferiority complex conditional leads possibly the Canadian political leaders far more on internal disputes of everyday life to talk as the United States in this election the buck (as in 1988, when the campaign on the free trade) ," as he describes. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The United Nations, he concludes, are thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially threatening to speak of him." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The ambassador understands these "deafening silence" especially since the two countries harbour intensive political and economic relations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Logically" excommunicated him, "should the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to drive such processes relationship of voters in the poll as a key factor in the sense." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The other expression of this sense of importance reads on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business sources in Ottawa, sent communication, President Barack Obama on his first visit in Ottawa to prepare. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Your trip will help the continuation of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget in early February to ensure, in the Canada its first deficit after more than a decade will announce the result of a recovery programme is created in the level of 30 to 40 billion dollars," describes Breese. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had the parliamentary session before Christmas must be postponed in order to prevent that Parliament would be toppled by the coalition and the conditional continuation of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed Belebungsprogramms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Another, from January 2008 dating of the year and written communication from the Wilkins ambassador in Washington agreed the race by the growing image that the dramatic series broadcast on development, spread by the United States. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The ambassador is worried about programmes such as Border, little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the 'No-Fly-List' or Abführungen for the purpose of interrogation analysis by the CIA Muskelprotze watch. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Yet another communication reported at length about how Hillary Clinton remarked in their French counterparts Bernard Kouchner during their first bilateral meeting asked whether Europe is ready to include certain prisoners from Guantanamo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Mr. Kouchner is expected to answer the question yes, but on the basis of an individual " case to Fall"-Entscheidung. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Àm at the end of the meeting, as described, "he has the Secretary of State distributed a paper in terms of Omar Khadr, a 15-year Muslims Canadian origin." </seg>
<seg id="20"> "The Secretary of State has promised the files again." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Do we finally that the sensibilities on the website WikiLeaks. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The UN has a plan yesterday in Cancún for the renewal of the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in terms of achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (CFC) proposed, almost a third of the additional reduction, which must be implemented in order to stabilise the Earth's climate until 2020. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This ambitious plan takes his position in the step of specific major projects a the UN hopes to implement in Cancun for the absence of compelling reduction commitments to compensate for the industrial countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> After the yesterday raised plan would be the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFCs emitted as a result of the lighting on the planet to be avoided, if the White fervent pears, which still has a monopoly of 50 to 70% of the market, by fluoreszierend or better still, by diodes (LED) would be replaced. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This equates to an equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In Copenhagen last year had the big exhaust emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada was committed to voluntary Reduktionsplänen, the global fckw emissions from 53 to 49 Gt downsized Gt should. </seg>
<seg id="8"> From this record, we should withdraw even 5 Gt, however, from now until the year 2020 climate increases to stabilize 2 degrees Celsius to prevent this control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the White fervent pears 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% to produce the light. </seg>
<seg id="10"> With the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, reduced with the new LED bulbs this energy once again twice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen hold on average between 6.000 to 10.000 hours. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The new LED bulbs, such as those which the manufacturer Philips has brought this week on the market - this society has participated in the study undertaken - have a life expectancy of 25.000 hours and 80% less energy than a weißglühende pear, which auswechselung plan gives a hint of the savings, which should be applied in 100 countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Apart from the fact that iese novel light bulbs only make very little heat, they can also work with a regulatory widerstand. </seg>
<seg id="14"> And they do not contain any mercury. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Several specialists have shown that Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves to run because they mercury and that they therefore need as a toxic waste dump, which is not always possible in the developing countries, a Bring Centre available except producers. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, according to the report, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit far more mercury, the electricity wasted by the White fiery oranges to produce. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Alone in the United States encounter these coal plants 25.000 tons of mercury annually. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The report sets out detailed the profits, which would generate each country thanks to this international programme. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Indonesia would, for example, a billion dollars a year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2 emissions, which means an equivalent of 3.5 Kohlekraftwerken, whose spiritual Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion. </seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg id="5"> On Tuesday at least had the gap with the German interest rates his record of 210 base points achieved, and the prices are the contracts to cover the Konkursrisikos has risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain Kopflosigkeit in Rome. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Silvio Berlusconi pointed out in his Council of Ministers that the discrepancy in Spain to the German interest rates is in the hands of 400 base points. </seg>
<seg id="7"> His right hand, Gianni Letta, was, however, as a "serious concern" of the "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland indicated. </seg>

<seg id="9"> "The bad news is that Italy, like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute. </seg>
<seg id="10"> To put it plainly, his problem is the shortage of economic growth and the concomitant anaemic tax eingangs the state in danger, no longer meet its funding needs to be able to. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="13"> Under these conditions, as calculated by the European Commission, the budget deficit next year will be 4,3% of GDP (contrary to the governments predicted 3,9%) and 3,5% in 2012 (instead of 2,7%). </seg>
<seg id="14"> That is why the uproar about a new budget collective after the holidays on a sum of EUR 7 billion could be used. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditors Olli Rehn. </seg>
<seg id="16"> On the hour, Italy receives the support of international institutions. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "The foundations of Italy economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, we repeat this for a very long time," Arrigo assured Sadun Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund at the IMF is charged with Italy. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "At the moment there are no problems, neither short-term nor long-term perspective, since from Italy, despite its high debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011, A. that R.) lower Stabilisationsfortschritte required than other countries" observed Pier Carlo Padoan, chief volkswirt of the OECD. </seg>
<seg id="19"> That leaves the question of political Unstetigkeit. </seg>
<seg id="20"> On 14 December Silvio Berlusconi a motion of censure facing the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the early elections at the end of March could be organised. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Métro Grand Paris: first financial spectacular </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Since the debate about the modernisation of the transport sector is in full swing on the Ile de France, rain billions. </seg>
<seg id="3"> At least in the discussions. </seg>
<seg id="4"> We appeal especially the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris in memory of the Société du Grand Paris is to be built. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In order to guide the start of the SGP in the ways that the state has a capital dotation declared by 4 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the theoretical system, this is the amount, which would then allow the SGP to the markets to their two times to give a part of the financial bill. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Today it is finally come to initial projections. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The supplementary budget from 2010, this morning seen by the financial committee of the National Assembly, contains the planned measures to raise the first part of this money. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is two measures: the creation of a special tax to Erschließund and a higher taxation of the offices at the Ile-de France. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The former, we remove Article 15 of the bill, "for the benefit of the public clinic Société du Grand Paris." </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is quantified: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Two more is an overhaul of the existing business taxation: "In order to modernise them in order to increase their resulting product and this increase of Société du Grand Paris to entrust." </seg>
<seg id="13"> How much would this bring? </seg>
<seg id="14"> A mystery. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This amount is not put in the text. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> From the 4 billion is far away. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "It is said that the fiscal resources to the 4 billion euros of capital dotation to be added to be raised by the state and the Société du Grand Paris after and to be done for the project," as is clear from the explanatory statement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In the case of the SGP will take place this system not objectionable. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "Since the moment in which revenue (the two taxes that R.), you can cover long studies over three years and then extract from the 4 billion," said. </seg>
<seg id="20"> "This is listed in the budget and gradually withdrawn." </seg>
<seg id="21"> The SGP estimated that it will be launched in 2013, the 4 billion to note for the budget in 2014. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> This measure, whose 4 promised billions we can look for a long time, risks a very turbulent provoking parliamentary debate. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The first public meeting will take place on 7 December instead. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Rachsüchtige hackers and industrious spies </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Affaire WikiLeaks has a dual significance. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On one side, it turns out as an obvious scandal, a scandal that only a scandal in the Sinner hypocrisy is the Beziehunge between states, ruled the public and the press. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level, and gives a taste of the future dominated by recession. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But we are taking the series. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of Wikileaks is the confirmation of the fact that each act produced by a secret service (an old nation) composed exclusively of newspaper cuttings. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits Berlusconi's throw anything further than what we have months anyway to read in any old journal received (except those whose owners Berlusconi) and the terrifying karikaturierte profile rebuffed offered Kabarettkünstlern for a very long time substance for their Sketchs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule, after which the secret dossiers should only consist of already well-known news is essential for the dynamic of the secret services, and not only in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go into a library devoted to esotherischen publications, you will see that each work (on the grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, Templer or Rosenkreuzler) repeated exactly what has been written in previous works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is not alone, therefore, that the author occult texts will publish any research (nor, therefore, that he is not knew where to find would be news to report on the non existierende), but because those who devote themselves to the Okkultismus, nothing else than to believe what they already know and confirms what they have already learned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the most mechanism of Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Similarly, the secret files. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informer is rotten and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (he could otherwise whatever it may be, for example, editor in Libération), the only considered true what he acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Top-Secret information on Berlusconi, the American Embassy in Rome was sent to the Staatsdezernat, were the same as those that Newsweek had published a week earlier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> So why such a fuss was made by the revelations of these files? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On one side they say what any educated person already knows, and that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the government leaders can call each other or can take a plane to take on the dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small classed have transformed into spy centres. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Every old viewers of investigative movies knows this very closely, and it does not happen from hypocrisy, that it is doing so to ignore this. </seg>
<seg id="18"> However: the fact to repeat it in public, violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put the American diplomacy in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Secondly: the idea that an ordinary hacker secret most secrets can become the most powerful country in the world, carries the significant blow to the prestige of the Staatsdezernats. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It also brings the scandal less victims, rather than the "executioner" in trouble. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we address the profound nature what happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Ehemals, Orwell's time, it was all power as a Big Brother pool, which controlled every gesture of his subjects. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwell's prophecy had since then as a completely right can point out where you can control every movement, thanks to the telephone, each site's transaction visited hotel, the elected motorway and so forth; the total victims of citizens would be the eye of power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> However, if you look in mind, what is happening today that even the secret Kryptas of power can no longer escape the control of a Hackers hears the control transition to be unilaterally directed and zirkelförmig. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - chosen as citizens - can discover the secrets of power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> How can stick but a power which is no longer able to protect their own secrets? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is true, Georg Simmel said that a real mystery is an empty secret (and an empty mystery can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the character Berlusconi's or Merkel's basically free of Geheimis is a mystery, because the public sphere price; but in the style of WikiLeaks to reveal the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty secrets were means to deprive them of any power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Wikileaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wronged, however, Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What are the consequences of this injury, which has caused such an enormous power? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the states no reserved information in future will face more Online - that would be tantamount to a posting added on the street corner. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is equally obvious that it is frustrated with the current technologies to hope confidential reports to be able to keep secret via telephone. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a Head of State move in a plane and one of his colleagues contacted. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could in future private and only for certain ears certain relationships? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know very well that my prediction at the moment for science fiction and Roma confinement sounds, but I am forced to imagine the government agents preoccupied on secret nature and moving to uncontrollable road routes, their messages anywhere else than in a mere memory key, and also the few written information they received in the shoe marketing verbergend. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Only copy the information would be stored in locked drawers: basically had the spy attempt of Watergate less success, as WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity to write that the technology nowadays like a cancer progresses, namely backwards. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A century after the wireless telecommunications had revolutionized communications, the Internet with (telephone) a Telegrafen Wire. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The (analog) Videokassetten had allowed the Filmforschern, auszukundschaften a film gang on gang, by one spulen from the back forward and was able to reveal all the secrets of Montags, whereas the (numerical) CDs allow nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter, in other words, Makroportionen. </seg>
<seg id="39"> With the high-speed trains travel within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this by plane, including the switching requires three and a half hours. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It is therefore not exceptional, policy and communications technology come back on car and horse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> One final observation. </seg>
<seg id="42"> In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At present, the messages demanding confidential information from the press. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Climate: as France is talking about his financial promises </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A year after the Copenhagen treaty, it is time the observance of the fast gelösten funding promises ("Fast Start" or premature funding mentioned) to investigate which have been implemented by the developing countries. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And already have revealed the rough French vulnerable to blandishments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With the Copenhagen Treaty have committed themselves to developing countries, 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012 will be set aside. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The EU has 7.2 billion euros over three years promised France 1,26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On the occasion of the opening of the COP16, the EU has taken all register their partners from the fact of their commitment to convince about the Fast-Start-Finanzierungen: accurate course report of its Member States, press conference, large side events, broschüre distribution. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The operation transparency is remarkable and appreciated for their actual value: the developing countries and civil society would look like if all developed countries the same made on the same precision levels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The EU announced, 2.2 billion euros in 2010 to have released what they are on the right path to Respektbezollung their commitment of 7.2 billion brings in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If one looks in detail but are things a little more complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should be according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional deployment was introduced to benefit, without detriment of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means. </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the European Commission had proposed a harmonisation, certain member states, including France, the procedure has been blocked. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today, everyone chooses the benchmark, which he considers to be the best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The European Commission, for example, as a benchmark for the person of the Year 2009: the international funding will be maintained, and in the context of "fast start" funding over three years of 150 million. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries have similar benchmarks, either on year or about conditions elected at the level of public development aid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In contrast, France has been of the opinion that the financing "of all new projects" of 2010 were "new and additional." </seg>
<seg id="17"> In other words: there is no benchmarks in the spending of the previous year or public development aid at a global level. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Specifically, the total amount of French support can remain stable developing countries (or decrease) - France gives its commitment with regard to the "new and additional" funding must be respected. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is still no rule, and everyone elects its calculation mode. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, like France, for example, 1 borrowed as equivalent with 1 donated. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Obviously, this is only serious reasonable: the effort is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loans for certain profitable investment (often projects tied to emission mitigation based on effektivster technology) can be justified, it is wrong to present the euro as the equivalent of a donated euro captured... let only the cost of loans for the capital donor country to be counted as commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France has nothing else in mind as the following thought: it "respected" his commitment of 420 million euros by 91,5% loans (389,8 million) resumes and 8,5%) 36,1 million euros) - see the EU documents to convince themselves. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only EU country uses in large measure that loans. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany urges 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) their commitments to 100% to follow up with donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union 1 spends to fulfil their obligations, France just 10 cents and meant a similar commitment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Schöner! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Everything operates in all France in his fast start with a double deception: a part with a Weiterentwicklkung of action over the period and partly with the reality of the financial commitment. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France will be able to believe that 420 million "new and additional" million has been spent in accordance with its promises, it will save 36,1 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it would appear that Bercy was carried out of the arbitrage) a double negative effect could entail; even internally (why continue with donations from the other member states if it is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries do not completely fooled... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter of the premature funding only a small issue in a relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions on the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it could drop too much in the huge machinery of the UNFCCC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Let us hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As it always is, it is essential to its lesson from this first year to learn verfrühter funding. </seg>
<seg id="36"> First and foremost, France could be a change in its Verbuchungsart parade for the years 2011 and 2012, and in the spirit of respect for its commitments and the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> France could but, above all, the discussions on the contentious subject of long-term financing forward (another crucial and current topic): you can escape the question of the "Verrechenbarkeit" or the Verbuchungsart of its loans are not. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could change its position, as advanced in terms of controversy, as it is in other things. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The hope is the new Minister for the Environment Kosciusko-Morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A surprising announcement on the fast start of France and its vision of the "Verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loans would increase by nature of the international trust needed for further discussions. </seg>
