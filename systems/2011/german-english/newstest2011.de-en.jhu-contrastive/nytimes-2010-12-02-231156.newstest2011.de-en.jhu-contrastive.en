Cheshire-berufung calls attention to Twitter 
Half a dozen of them tippten in the riots in the court path. 
In the minutentakt verschickten about Twitter their reports on grausige testimonies. 
At the end, so the defense, there have been more than 140, 000 twitter-meldungen about the process for rape and beds gekettete children in a house, the aufging on fire. 
On Thursday, the process of Steven J. hayes, closely following the cheshire was accused of three members of a family, connecticut to have killed, a formal end to find, if the richterspruch has spoken out about the death sentence, which the jury, to do it. 
But Mr hayes lawyers have already submitted requests in courts to explain the reasons for appeal and the courts will deal for years. 
One of the provozierendsten reasons is that as a result of the intensive coverage of the process, through the extensive use of twitter of durchschnittsreporter - a zirkusatmosphäre "and a" widespread, immediate penetration aufrührerischer details had come, so that the jury had been influenced by the public indignation in an improper manner. 
This appeal the appelationsgerichte could lead to deal with the question of whether the new rules in the court needed to be new technologies. 
"As I have seen it during this process, I believe, that there really is a danger if the entry of new technologies in the court each individual's right to a fair trial," said Thomas J. ullman influenced, Mr hayes hauptverteidiger. 
The presiding judge, jon C. blue by the Supreme kammergericht, rejected the applications last week by entscheid back In summary, when he said that the new media," would be carefully controlled," and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion. 
But that was with safety is not the last word in this matter. 
For decades, gerichtseinsprüche have ascertained that the coverage of famous cases can doubt on the fairness of the process. 
In its historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States the judgment against Dr Sam sheppard, a osteopathen from cleveland to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that lifted it because of the new media would have been a "karnevalsatmosphäre in the court,." 
Some people believe that the fernsehserie and the spielfilm "on the run" is based on this crime. 
Some lawyers say that gerichtseinsprüche what Mr hayes conviction could look at half a century later, followed by the argument that new rules are necessary, for the kommunikationswege from the Court at the time of the case Dr sheppard were still inconceivable to regulate. 
"There is a good reason for about the influence of the new media in processes that are pursued by the general public, to be concerned," said John J. donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School, according to the death penalty in connecticut has investigated. His report, it will arbitrarily imposed. 
Professor donohue said, some of appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction a prompt communications out of the court could make the processes fair. 
The twitter-angelegenheit is just one of many that the lawyers of Mr hayes explain to delay for years to discuss, and therefore a conviction. 
The defender, for example, claim that Mr hayes could already have been regarded with hostility under any circumstances, as a judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential juroren by granting them during the jurorenauswahl grausige tatortfotos showed. 
Some of the juroren said that photos of the victims, jennifer hawke-petit, 48 years, and their tüchter, hayley, 17 years, and michaela, 11 years, they have met with disgust. 
The defenders say they would call into question the Constitution verfassungsmäßigkeit the death penalty, and argue that the judges a false juror have exchanged views, which would have been a critic of the Public Prosecutor's office, and that it is an improper manner would have exerted pressure on the ruling, when he had made the unusual decision to ask the panel to decide free over the weekend. 
The juroren were not isolated. 
But their arguments about the influence of the detailed coverage of the process is attracting perhaps the biggest interest. 
In a urteilsanfechtung which they have submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in connecticut and during the election campaign for the position of governor and for the US Senate has been discussed by the candidates. 
They argued that the new media constantly had reopened the flames of the emotions on the case. 
"Such a equipped to cope daily surge of medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the gerichtssaals," the lawyers wrote, "it has been previously seen in New Haven and perhaps even Nationwide has not yet." 
Its focus to the reporting by Twitter is controversial. 
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct news are aufwieglerischer than reports, which are reimbursed, a technikfeindlicher look is slowing, the reporting about future trials verarme. 
But some lawyers said that appelationsgerichte would often faced with the argument, social and technical changes need the adaptation by the courts. 
Mr hayers lawyers reinforce this claim. 
In their appeal in relation to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the condemnation of Dr sheppard because of the reporting has been lifted and made it clear that the new rules require new media. 
"This case," they wrote, "represents sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
