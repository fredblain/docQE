Métro grand Paris: first financial skizzen 
On the ile-de-france for the debate on the modernization of the transport industry is in full swing, it rains billion. 
At least in the discussions. 
We call on referring in particular the 23 billion for the underground Grand Paris in memory, which the Société you grand Paris is being built. 
In order to guide the baubeginn of the sgp under way, the state has declared a kapitaldotation of 4 billion euros. 
In theoretical consideration, this is the amount of money, which would then allow the sgp, on a part of the finanzsumme on her double to give the markets. 
Today, it is first projections come trends, after all. 
The ergänzungshaushalt by 2010, this morning studied by the finanzkommission, contains the measures provided for the National Assembly, to raise the first part of this money. 
It is one of two measures: the creation of a special tariff to erschließund and a higher taxation of the offices at the ile-de France. 
The former, you remove Article 15 of the gesetzesentwurfes, goes in favour of the public broadcasting center Société du grand Paris'." 
Puts: 'This is the product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year." 
Zweitere is a renewal of existing corporate income tax: "in order to have this modernise, in order to increase the resulting from their product and the increase of the Société you to überantworten grand Paris." 
How much would bring the? 
A mystery. 
This amount is not quantified in the text. 
Far removed from the 4 billion is one. 
"It is said that the fiscal resources be added to the 4 billion euros of kapitaldotation, be found by the State and the Société du Grand Paris to be done for the project and after," is to come from the explanatory set out. 
In the sgp can you find this system does not offensive. 
"Since the moment in which they scored Revenue - The two taxes, that R. -, one can cover the projektierung on for three years and then only from the 4 billion, 'it will draw said. 
"This is going to be listed in the budget and deducted after." 
The sgp estimates that 2013, will be started to note the 4 billion for the budget in 2014. 
This measure, 4 promised billion of which one can still seek long will provoke, is in danger, a right, parliamentary debate. 
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
