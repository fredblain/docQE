World Cup 2018-2022: the FIFA will appoint the ausrichterland 
In bright excitement because of korruptionsverdacht will appoint the exekutivkomitee by FIFA on Thursday ausrichterländer of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice, in which the rangeln for influence and threaten to push it was lobbying the technical criteria in the background. 
But one thing is certain: the issue 2018 the königsdisziplin of the FIFA will take place in Europe, its traditional hochburg - the 4 candidates: England, Russia, spanien-portugal, the niederlande-belgien -. 
The issue then 2022 is something; the International Football Federation hopes to be exotic new territories after the premiere on the African continent in the year 2010 - Qatar, Australia - to be able to win, or its branch in the United States or in the far east - Japan and South Korea - to pursue. 
The list of figures, part of the delegation - David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Head of State, Zidane, beckham, the cruyff - is the degree of economic and political use of a World Cup. 
So the actions behind the scenes threaten stopping until the last minute. 
Otherwise difficult to set up a hierarchy of the candidates. 
After the evaluationsbericht by FIFA, provide the English, spanisch-portugiesische - 2018 - and American - 2022 - acts bessseren arguments than that of its competitors. 
But these considerations for the 22 members of the exekutifkommitees on the hour of the election will not be so important. 
The Sunday Times, which provoke the suspension of two members of the exekutifkommitees - reynald temarii and Amos Adamu - of the beginning of the revelations, and would have been just as well the opportunities for their own country can ruin, cradle of football, which was allowed to fight the World Cup only once, in 1966. 
The BBC had given the breeding ground again on Monday, saying it had a broadcast dokumentarbericht, the three senior members of the kommitees, Ricardo teixeira, Nicolas leoz and issa hayatou is under attack. 
Reason enough to irritate the FIFA and the English leaders in embarrassment to bring, in the first place, with David Cameron in these last few weeks had conducted an intensive was lobbying. 
The Head of Government hopes for a resumption of the successful schachzuges by his predecessor Tony Blair, which in 2005 had made the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games in London. 
This intensive use would be enough to enhance the image of England before the kommitee again? 
Nothing is less safe because the duo spanien-portugal there is no shortage of trümpfen with its already finished stages, his expertise - 82 in Spain in Barcelona Olympic Games 92, World Cup and Euro 2004 in Portugal - and its fußballkultur. 
But the two countries' economic and financial dark side could dampen their ambitions. 
The possible reprisals against the English, and the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal which make the opportunities of Russia, despite its shortcomings in the dossier - stadiums, hotels, transport - has become the important outsider rise. 
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to unumwundenen allusion to the bezichtigungen the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" on the part of the kommiteemitglieder denounced. 
"It bewirft them with dirt, you try to compromise," Putin lashed out. 
For 2022, the United States, bolstered by the experience of 1994, to be the logical favoriten. 
First economic world power, headquarters of the fifa-hauptsponsoren, the country yielded seems a long list of benefits to Japan and South Korea, which have drawn up a very beautiful project separately. 
But these new nominations seem premature for two countries which had the mitorganisiert competitions in 2002. 
Another threat, the FIFA's hot desired approval of the World Cup 2026 for China, the Asian opportunities in 2022 will lapse. 
With Australia and Qatar, the aufwartung futuristischer stadiums had drawn, the FIFA is all the stops, however, their expansion in the direction of new areas, that pose a risk, because these two countries certainty. 
Australia could as well as Japan and South Korea under the from the European countries - because of the zeitverschiebung - akquittierten weakness of television rights have to suffer the sensitive nerve of the FIFA.
