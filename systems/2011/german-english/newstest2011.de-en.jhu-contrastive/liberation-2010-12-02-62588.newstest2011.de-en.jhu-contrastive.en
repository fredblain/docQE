Rachsüchtige hackers and emsige spies 
The Wikileaks affaire has a double meaning. 
On one side, it has, a scandal, the emerging as obvious scandal is just a scandal in sinner hypocrisy, which ruled the beziehunge between the states, the people and the press. 
On the other hand, it has announced to extensive changes at international level, and is a taste of the dominated by recession future. 
But let us take one thing at a time. 
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file prepared by a Secret Service - of any nation - exclusively made up of zeitungsausschnitten. 
The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits Berlusconi's throw from no more than what you to read for months - in any case in any old journal had - except for those whose owner was Berlusconi - and the shocking karikaturierte face gaddafis offered kabarettkünstlern already substance for their sketche for a long time. 
The rule, after the secret files should only from, is already known news is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century. 
If you go to a library, which covers esotherischen publications, they will discover that every plant - about the grail, the mystery of rennes-le-chateau, the templer or the rosenkreuzler - exactly a repetition of what has already been written in previous works. 
This is therefore not alone, that the author will not publish research okkulter texts - yet, therefore, that he does not know where to find news on the nicht-existierende would be -, but because those who are the okkultismus to think of nothing different from what you already know, and confirmed what you already have learned. 
This is also the erfolgsmechanismus by Dan Brown. 
As the geheimakten. 
The informer is wrong, and lazy - or limited spirit - is also the head of the Secret Service - he could otherwise be whatever libération - editor, for example, the only deemed to be true what he recognizes. 
The top-secret information about Berlusconi, the American Embassy in Rome had sent the staatsdezernat were the same as those who newsweek already had published the week before. 
So why was such a fuss over the revelations that dossiers made? 
On one side, is this what each educated person already know, that the messages, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then, the government can take each other could appeal or an aircraft, in order to make up for the dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small repräsentationsaufgaben, have turned in spionagezentren. 
All of ermittlungsfilmen old viewers know this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that we should do to ignore this. 
Still, the fact that it publicly to repeat, violates the task of hypocrisy and is used to set the American diplomacy in a bad light. 
In second place: the idea that a x-beliebiger hackers can tap the geheimsten SECRETS OF THE most powerful country in the world, carries the significant blow to the prestige of the staatsdezernats. 
Furthermore, rather than the victims,, the scandal brings the "scharfrichter in trouble." 
But we are giving the deep nature of what has happened. 
Former to combine Orwell times, it was all power as a Big Brother, the every gesture of his subjects controlled. 
Orwell's prediction would be able to turn out to be quite right since then, where one can control every movement thanks to the telephone, each transaction made the hotel, visited the elected motorway and so on; the citizens would be in a total victims of auges of power. 
However, what if we introduce, what is going on today that even the secret krypten of power can no longer the control of a hackers escape, it is said to be directed the kontrollgang to unilaterally and will zirkelförmig. 
The power to monitor all citizens, but every citizen, or at least the hackers, erwählt than vindicator of the citizen - can bring the secrets of power in experience. 
But how can keep a power, which is no longer in a position to maintain their own secrets? 
It is true, Georg simmel said earlier that A real secret is an empty secret - and an open secret can never be reveals -; it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's, in fact, is free of geheimis a secret, since it reveal the public sphere; but the styles of WikiLeaks disclose that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, meant to deprive them of any power. 
WikiLeaks has done neither he nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama against it. 
What will be the consequences of this violation, such a huge power has been done? 
It is obvious that the States will make in future no reserved more online information - that would be a on the street corner angeklebten amount to aushang. 
But it is also clear that it with the latest technologies in vain is hoped to be able to keep confidential reports on telephone secret. 
Nothing is easier than moved to find out if and when a Head of State in a plane has contacted and one of his colleagues. 
How could be private and only for some ears certain relations in the future? 
I am well aware that my prediction after science fiction and romanhaft sounds, but at the moment I am compelled to present the regierungsagenten, in a secret way preoccupied to uncontrollable marschrouten moving, order with their communications anywhere else, than the mere memory, and also the few written information they have, in the schuhabsatz verbergend. 
The information would be stored in single copy in closed existence: In fact, the Watergate spionageversuch had less success has been made, as WikiLeaks. 
I had the opportunity to write the technology today as a cancer is moving ahead, namely backwards. 
A century after the wireless telegraf had revolutionized communications, a telegrafen reconstructed the Internet with - Telephone - draht. 
The - analogue - videokassetten had allowed the filmforschern, a film volume for volume auszukundschaften by one from behind forward spulen and was able to reveal all of the secrets of the montage while the - numerical - CDs today allow nothing other than to jump chapter by chapter, which is in makroportionen. 
With the fast trains going one within three hours by air from Rome to Milan, while this including the umsteigens requires three and a half hours. 
It is therefore not exceptional return to car and horse that politics and communication technology. 
A final observation. 
In ancient times, the press tried to understand what kind of secrets between the embassies were forged. 
At present, it is the messages, call for the confidential information provided by the press.
