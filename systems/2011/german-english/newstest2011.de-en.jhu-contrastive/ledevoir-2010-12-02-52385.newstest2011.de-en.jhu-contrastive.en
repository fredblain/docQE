Green, but am sceptical. 
The quebecer consumer has little confidence to the key players of the sustainable growth, however, nor to the brand names or the öko-kennzeichnungen, characterised the taxes to his election. 
Pity, although it in a media universe are where it of information for one of verantwortungsbewußteren consumption only as if, the barometer responsible consumption has led to a lack of credible information, a deficiency that the brakes on his commitment kenntlich power, as was the first reading, which was held yesterday. 
Although they the use of what is known as the socially responsible have pushed products in the year 2010, the quebecer seem however, those who are trying to sell it to give little credit.

A out other findings: half of the consumers, doubts the trustworthiness of the official to the supposedly fair products angefügten certificates, but also the credibility of the products and brands, which umweltbewußt declare, so the barometer. 
For equal patterns, the discourse of the politicians to this issue of just 14.6% of the quebecer people seriously. 
The information about responsible consumption appears, however, important to stimulation this konsumsegments, which currently out of approximately only a third of the quebecer crowded will consumers. 
In fact, dämpften empty and dubious character of the information the zeal of 46% of consumers. 
This is the second after the higher price of the products, from the barometer identified brake. 
Moreover, a third of the quebecer is of the performance of the green products and services, which one is trying to put you in the hand, with mistrust. 
According to a different communication had already over half of the consumers in the year 2010 changed their habits and predominantly changed the brand of one or more products, in order to give her conviction expression. 
According to barometers they were preferred to 61% purchases dealers of their stadtviertels and encourages the purchase of food crops cultivated in their region. 
Green and responsible. This year, the index had the umweltbewußten consumption in achieved a 100 64 of the maximalwertes - the homo consumus of Quebec loves it, to present itself as a king of the recycling, which is seeking to reduce its environment left traces, by he takes care of the welfare. 
But the social and environmental awareness seems yet to make just before his car, so the barometer, just 28% of the quebecer have stated, in 2010 or to have preferred the mitfahrzentrale used public transport, to demonstrate their ecological interest. 
The zufußgehen and the cycling have also been endorsed by 39,1% of the participants in this comprehensive verhaltensumfrage, the klischeevorstellungen sources.
