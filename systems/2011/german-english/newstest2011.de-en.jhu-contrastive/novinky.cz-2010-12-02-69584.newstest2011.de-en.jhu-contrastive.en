A longer finger, but instead ringfinger means a lower risk of contracting cancer 
Men, whose divided is long, when the ringfinger are obvious of contracting a lower risk of prostate cancer. 
It is the surprise result of a study, which was published by the British Journal of cancer on Wednesday. 
This is associated with the mirror of the male hormone testosteron. 
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer and the mitautorin this especially as men and 60," said the study, ros eeles, Professor in warwick on krebsforschungsinstitut at the university. 
The finger could help to determine what men is important to have a prostatakrebs-test should undergo, especially when there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as the family health burden, Mrs eeles added. 
In the period from 1994-2009 followed it with their colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time, 3,000 healthy men. 
In more than half of the participants of the study was the divided the right hand shorter than the ringfinger. 
For these men was the same likelihood of prostate cancer, as for 19 percent of those were men, whose ring- and divided equally long. 
For men, whose divided longer than the ringfinger was fell by 33 percent, however, the risk for men by sixty even by 87 percent. 
The ratio of the length of the two fingers, which has been mentioned in the prenatal old form, clearly reflects the different mirror of geschlechtshormonen, which has been under the child in the womb. 
Less testosteron is a longer divided. 
Earlier research showed that it is the testosteron speed up the growth of prostate cancer. 
Vaclav pačes leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said čtk that he was aware of these study fleeting, but he believe the relations between the fingerlänge and have not so far for the risk of cancer "is proven."
