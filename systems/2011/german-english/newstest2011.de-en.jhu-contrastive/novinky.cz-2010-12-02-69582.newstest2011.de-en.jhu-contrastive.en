Czech children betrinken with fernet and rum beer is out, it is simply too slow 
Fernet, rum and vodka, for time a good whisky, which was the father of stolen from the hausbar. 
These are the drinks, after which need to be drunk Czech teenagers under 15 most notbehandelt enjoy. 
No exception are children, their kater repeatedly in the hospital ausschlafen must. 
This is clear from the experience of doctors who are faced with similar cases in the opening of the kinderabteilungen of clinics. 
"beer or wine are completely out of fashion, because it is simply too long before you get drunk." 
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol," said právo luděk pelikán, the chefarzt kinderabteilung in the hořovice mittelböhmischen clinic. 
"whisky, if we are successful, the father of a bottle of entwenden from the hausbar and, if not, then at least fernet or vodka. 
"vodka has the advantage of that you can mix it with juice, then, it is not so strong," says the chefarzt. 
The speaker of the fakultätskrankenhauses motol Eva jurinová gives him right. 
"Most it is fernet or rum." 
"That is the alkoholtrend, notably in schools." Today 
"We also wanted to take on board slibowitz, it could be said that at home well," led Mrs jurinová. 
Chefarzt pelikán, according to dreizehn- or vierzehnjährige drinkers in the krankenhausaufnahme no ausnahmeerscheinung long ago. 
Before the clinic in hořovice, in which he works for this year, he was in the pädiatrie-abteilung in hospital motol for ten years, where the rettungswagen angetrunkene pupils from far and wide ablieferten. 
"A girl had to be four times hospitalisiert." 
"Your career started it with 12 years ago, when it the first time with 3.5 level of alcohol in the blood and still, it was taken in combination with" extase "was" a very serious case, described the doctor. 
"It was in the ausstellungsgelände in holešovice in some tanzparty." 
"The interesting is that it is not strange mentioned their mother that her daughter 48 hours was not home," is the chefarzt surprised. 
That lack of interest of the parents or the incredible tolerance at the start with their own sprösslingen is regarded as one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism for children. 
With a real interdependence in the true sense of the word is not in children, according to experts. 
"under Alcoholism is a longstanding chronic dependence on alcohol and to understand all related phenomenon, and that is not the case with these children." 
With those who enjoy repeatedly alcohol, is generally a negative familiär-sozialer background characteristic," says chefarzt pelikán. 
The speaker of the hospital motol, Mrs according to jurinová, by the middle of November around 40 drunken children were in the European Department of Child Care and jugendmedizin eingewiesen. 
Only the cases with severe alkoholvergiftung, however, which made a krankenhausaufenthalt needed to go in the statistics. 
Drunken children who, in ambulatory care of their parents or, if necessary, will be brought home not registered by the police. 
Except the cases in which children only times as a bottle of schnaps in the schulbank austrinken Mr pelikán believe that there are three jahreszeitliche amplituden the one hundred per cent is good,: walpurgisnacht being New Year's Eve and the end of the academic year. 
"the latter for two reasons, either from pain due to the poor zeugnisses or from joy on the holidays." 
"In the walpurgisnacht I have seen in the opening seven drunk children at once," said Dr pelikán. 
A betrunkenes child, paradoxically, spent the night under medical supervision, is better off as a child, the only has to contend with a unpleasant kater the next day. 
The headache in the morning, then that emanate from the dehydration and the glukosemangel, can you in the hospital with a flüssigkeitsspendenden infusion missing, which the organism, drive out with glukose and nutrients. 
"Clearly they are better off because after the 'beautiful' experience in the evening, raise it with good humour to hurts, without taking." 
"They are just a little confused as to where they are," Dr pelikán acknowledges, but at least it the patients Sometimes this good humour by it cost them the reality in it, which will cost them the treatment. 
Because the transportation with the rettungswagen and the night in a akutbett are well and to look at a few tens of thousands of kronor. 
"From time to time, I have used that as erziehungsmittel, if I have directly to the children in the trip vorgerechnet, which has cost their drunkenness well, and that it can happen that you ever have to work on the whole holidays in order to earn the money for such a single fete," Dr pelikán added. 
In his opinion, the krankenkassen not after regressverfahren, however, about the cost required to heal the trunkenen children of appeal for the parents.
