Zapatero and the Red Line Germany 
Berlin has opted for the beibehalt of the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the whole of the European Union. 
The tension in the markets have sparked a double response from the government. 
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero put forward new adaptation measures, starting with steuerermäßigungen for small and micro, the regulation of the zeitarbeitsunternehmen or the lifting of 426 euro support for the unemployed, no unemployment benefits concern, through to the privatization of 49 percent of aena, the management of airports barajas and El prat and 30 percent of the state lottery. 
On the other hand, supports the Deputy regierungschefin, Mrs salgado, with the help of the former regierungspräsidenten Felipe González criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible herausbeschwört have the current crisis. 
How are these events to understand? 
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their public relations. 
On the contrary, it is about a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro. 
It is Germany a fundamental new perspective to shape our future, the clashes with the maintenance of the old traditions of much of its partners. 
In the face of the opposition in Europe one begins in Germany to spekuliern about three possible ways out of the crisis. 
The first: a strong euro, with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro area. 
The second: the return of the German mark - although it sounds currently more to science fiction -, supported by a majority of the public opinion, around 50 percent of the population. 
The third: a transformation of the euro in accordance with German proposals. It means that more macroeconomic control and strict management; punishment of the countries that the targets; some countries möglichereweise zahlungseinstellung broken, and the extension of the cost of possible adjustments to the private sector. 
The German position is clear and saw the beginning of has for some time. This is why there are no excuses. 
First 2009, as both the IMF as well as the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German Government will come up with a constitutional reform, in order to prevent it from 2016. 
It was the first sign of the auseinanderdriften between what Germany for necessary - Strict steuerpläne and stable public finances - and the practices of its European partners, including France. 
The second sign, the Central European country, as Merkel the decision to rescue of Greece hinausschob painful. 
Back then, it was. But the fact is that severely criticized the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were totally opposed to the rescue of Greece. 
Finally, Merkel is in the last oktobertagen again with a clear position clear. It calls for a review of the agreement of the European Union, in order to allow for the rescue of a country and at the same time to hold private darlehensgeber On a bear part of the cost. 
This position has been interpreted as antieuropäisch, since they irlandkrise and the following on everything. 
But her proposal, if somewhat sweetened, has been approved. In the next few months, we will be on the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures as of 2013, participate. 
Germany has drawn a red line, the intends not to exceed it. 
Says it all that, even if unpopular measures must be taken now - from that date to the old functioning of the euro, there will be no more. 
2013 will be the geburtsjahr of a new currency zone, in which the zuwiderhandelnden countries will be severely punished, can be forced to do so, to explain to go bankrupt and in this case the private sector must play a part of the cost. 
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard wachstumskurs, with high savings and investitionsraten moderation of consumption, improving the productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive foreign trade salden. 
The other option, which is based on debt and construction industry with huge löchern in the balance of payments, as it has been mentioned by Spain in boom times, simply will not be tolerated. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would do bad, not to understand it. 
It is not just a question of the deficit by the year 2013 to three percent runterzufahren. 
The demands are much tougher. 
And the worst thing we could do is to deceive ourselves in these conditions. 
Move I hope that the current turmoil in more calm. 
And that we have the capability of the US will be offered, will use by the spring of 2013. 
It seems that Zapatero has taken this so well, and his double Announcement - The promised reforms, after the meeting, with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday - points out that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, to create order in our own house, their way has caused. 
But the Red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look so that would change anything in this. 
Among the damaged options is that we take into consideration the with little serious countries fully leave gestopften euro area that should not be ruled out. 
In this case, Germany still tell us, it could have warned us.
