Two trainingsflugzeuge l-159 in foreign hand - for the first time in Spain 
Two light fighter planes l-159 of a total of five, which the Czech Defense Ministry against the transportflugzeug Casa c-295m has replaced, on Tuesday went to the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish flugzeughersteller Casa - EADS siedelt. 
It is the first time that are aircraft of this type in possession of a foreign army. 
Abroad, they were so far only in manoeuvres or flugshows to see. 
This is the flugfähige zweisitzerversion l-159t1, which was conducted by the Czech army. 
The other three aircraft are einsitzige l-159. 
These are being einkonserviert at aero vodochody, the mediator of this involved - the company omnipol - has adopted last week. 
When the aircraft physically from vodochody expediert, Jan pejšek, according to the spokesman for the Defense Department, is still not known. 
The einsitzigen fighter plane l-159, in turn, were from eingelagerten aircraft singled out in the long term and that without more deposits and investments on the part of the Department of the Ministry. 
"The doppelsitzigen l-159t1 were in current state and be replaced," the paper pejšek právo said. 
He added that the army will not have to do without zweisitzige fighter planes, because the Defense Ministry in May 2009, with aero vodochody a 200-millionen-vertrag on the reorganization of the four unnecessary l-159 signed to the zweisitzigen version. 
A new aircraft, the army has taken over in July, the second wants to take it by the end of this year. 
According to pejšek, EADS has committed itself to enforce the fighter planes in the equipment of the NATO countries. 
"The Treaty is clearly expressed that the company EADS buyer of the aircraft is l-159 and that this should serve in the training of pilots of the NATO countries. 
"It is up to the abnehmers, therefore, in what way he realised the matter," led pejšek. 
The wirtschaftszeitung - hn - had previously reported that the Spanish Government has no interest in the l-159. 
The trading one thing for another five l-159 against a transportflugzeug Casa and the purchase of new aircraft for 3.5 billion kronor last year, was approved by the Government of Mirek Topolánek. 
The Defense Ministry was not tender at shopping at the time, but EADS spoke directly to put out to tender. 
The then verteidigungsamt argued that this exchange will support the future exports of the l-159 abroad. 
The Czech army bought aero 72 machines from, of which they used only 24, it wanted to sell the rest. 
The purchase of aircraft Casa also may still have a legal sequel. 
The European Commission, sued the Czech Defense Ministry at the European Court of Justice. The reason? It should have been the aircraft due to select a ganzeuropäischen tender and not by a single mention producers. 
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last to end up on the airport kbely within 14 days.
