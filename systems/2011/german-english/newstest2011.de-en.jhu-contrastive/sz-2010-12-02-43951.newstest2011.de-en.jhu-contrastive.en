Puzzling erdarbeiten 
The International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence on a secret nuclear programme in Syria. 
But the country, refuses to comment on that, nor does it controls. 
Launched against midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli f-15 I fighter planes of a mysteriöses würfelförmiges buildings in Syria. 
There lie is on the banks of the Euphrates; the next major city, 30 miles away, is dair as-saur. 
Its name comes up in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency - IAEA - when it comes to the reactor, the Syria said to have built with aid from North Korea in the quader, hidden in a valley, which the electricity does not have. 
According to a briefing of the us-auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA from 2008, would be the end of April, under the name of the Middle ortschaft el-kibar have been geläufige reactor is a good way to produce plutonium - from which could build nuclear weapons. 
Is the technology from the fifties are not against for other purposes. 
The CIA conducted a videopräsentation before with unscharfen satellitenbildern. 
By computeranimation blendete you, where the components of the reactor fell before the destruction due to be have been the copy of the North Korean model from the atomzentrum was yongbyon. 
Also, it presented photos that show the building from the vicinity, or even the innenraum. 
The reactor is just stood in front of the opening, it said, but still not have been with brennstäben apply. 
Now, more than three years after the bombing, is little more known as it was then, the mystery have been increasing rather in time. 
The former US President George W. Bush has recently in his memoirs, revealed that the CIA before the attack was quite sure that Syria is in el-kibar a reactor was built, but saw little evidence that there was "an active's nuclear weapons programme" in the country. 
Some geheimdienstler In Europe there is cautious and preferred to talk only of a "Alleged reactor," even if you believe the cia-präsentation for "plausible." 
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. 
Asked how safe it is to have a reactor in front of them, said a high un-diplomat only briefly in the summer, the IAEA have "enough material in order to ask questions." 
The rubble of supposed "lost militärgebäudes" created the Syrians in a hurry to one side and planierten the site thoroughly. 
However, iaea-team took place in June 2008 under the former chief inspector Olli heinonen in el-kibar trace amounts of uranium, which was made by people. 
Also received the IAEA on a Member State satellite commercial providers from the period immediately after the attack, which might be stronger than the presented by the CIA. 
To get these recordings on the market are not, however, because of the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - it has bought exclusively. 
The IAEA can therefore not independently verify their authenticity. 
Syria has always claimed that never operated a clandestine nuclear program or to have built a reactor. 
The uranium come by the Israeli weapons, Damascus declared. 
But the, the IAEA according to analysis of the particles as unlikely back. 
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it, just like on the satellite. 
Also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the ashes of the zerbombten building. 
But Israel, too, is adamant. 
"We will never comment on that," confirmed recently at the time of the attack acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert the official position. 
So the investigation of the case since June 2008 schleppt out fruitless and "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority," as a high Western diplomat on the IAEA headquarters in Vienna for - it is a serious violation of the NPT in the room, watching over the the IAEA. 
As a key to making progress on the information, the IAEA appears to be three more bodies, the need to be "in functional link" with the alleged reactor - and in a different way than this still exist. 
In doing so, the UN weapons inspectors have not yet disclosed to the facilities that are involved, or what role they have or what they are suspicious can. 
According to information provided by the süddeutschen newspaper they will be in the IAEA internally as marj as-sultan, masyaf and iskandariayah calls, in turn, derived from nearby cities. 
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington - isis - has identified these places and on satellitenbildern a gebäudekomplex in masyaf tracked down, where it is most probably is one of the suspicious objects. 
It is probably in or directly next to a base - just with Syria denied that argument the IAEA access to the three places. 
In Vienna, the Syrians who feared a fishing expedition, it states that the IAEA will vorgeschickt by the United States so as militäranlagen auszuspähen. 
Since the nukleardetektive were by a tipp of us-geheimdienste become aware of the institutions. 
The IAEA has evidence, including satellitenfotos that lie between the three places and the quader on Euphrates material back and was moved. 
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the sites "in connection with the brennstoffproduktion" could stand. 
But there was "no evidence of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes, which are needed to build nuclear weapons. 
The reaktortyp will be pursued with uranium that is not enriched. 
But where the uranium should have come from and where it will have on the plutonium for the bomb should be separated on these key issues, there are at most plausible conjecture. 
What is also unclear is whether pieces of debris that could be the valuable traces Mountains have been stored in the three places. 
As if the hundreds of lastwagenladungen disappear from the ground, no one wants to have any information as to where the remaining rubble. 
Which is only a few kilometres from el-kibar lie on the other side of the Euphrates to salzmine al-tibni, the Syria in 1998 on their competence as a camp for radioactive waste has investigated, the IAEA is regarded as unlikely. 
The former iaea-inspektor Robert kelley had it in a recent analysis of satellitenbildern for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review associated with the reactor. 
Recordings from the orbit but show that Syria is undertaking in the three suspects places erdarbeiten and large container distant, after the IAEA had requested access. 
This can be a coincidence, but has done little to dispel the suspicions. 
It is also in diplomatenkreisen, the IAEA have spent many months to develop a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to respect any militärgeheimnisse - alone shows how large the interest of the inspectors is the effort. 
Damascus, however, bügelte this proposal as well. 
Western diplomats in Vienna have had a year ago contained the reactor is destroyed, therefore have no high sense of urgency, brings about the matter us-botschafter Glyn Davies' sonder-inspektionen comes in for a few months, one of the strongest possible means, the Vienna atombehörde has to enforce controls. 
Iaea-chef yukiya amano that inspections should propose that has been of "an option, for which I am open in the future," but he still is spoken. 
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand it needs to ensure a majority in the gouverneursrat of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries are represented there anything other than keen on an escalation. 
On the other hand, as a diplomat to bear in mind: "What if they find nothing in the end?"
