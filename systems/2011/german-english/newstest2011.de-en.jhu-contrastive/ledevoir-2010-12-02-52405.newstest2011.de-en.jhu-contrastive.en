Global Plan for the renewal of the lighting 
The UN has a plan for the renewal of the lighting of households, yesterday in Cancun Trade and Industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in the treibhausgases - CFC - Proposed, which is nearly a third of the additional reduction, which must be carried out in order to stabilize the earth's climate by 2020. 
This ambitious plan takes his position in the steps of the specific implement big projects of the UN in Cancun hopes, in order to compensate for the absence of forced reduktionsverpflichtungen of developed countries. 
According to the plan expressed yesterday would - gt - the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes of because of the lighting of the Earth are cast be avoided if the weißglühenden pears, which has a monopoly on the market are from 50 to 70%, by fluoreszierende or better yet, would be replaced by leuchtdioden - led -. 
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions. 
This represents an equivalent of 70% of the smoke of the global fleets. 
In Copenhagen had last year the large abgasemittenten, like the United States, China, Europe and others, including those from Canada, was voluntary reduktionsplänen committed itself to ensuring that the global fckw-emissionen of 53 gt to 49 gt should herunterschrauben. 
Pull out of this assessment, it would, however, still 5 gt today by the year 2020, in order to stabilize the klimaanstieg by 2 degrees Celsius, in order to prevent this spiral out of control. 
In the weißglühenden pears entweicht 95% of energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light. 
With the kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption reduced by 75%, with the new led-glühbirnen to this once again in the double energy demand. 
The kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen keep on average between 6,000 and 10,000 hours. 
The new led-glühbirnen, such as those to the manufacturers Philips has put on the market this week, this society has also took part in the uno-studie - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume less energy than a weißglühende pears 80%, which is a suggestion ways to make the savings of auswechselungsplanes provides that should be applied in 100 countries. 
In addition to the fact that iese completely new incandescent light bulbs, they can also make very little heat with a regelwiderstand work. 
And they do not contain any mercury. 
Several experts have pointed out that kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves in, because they contain mercury and that they are so as to sondermüll dump what in the developing world is not always possible, except for the producers are available to bring centre. 
The main source of quecksilberemissionen on the planet, according to the report, however, does not represent the kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal plants that emit much more mercury, by the weißglühenden pears wasted to produce electricity. 
In the United States alone push this coal plants 25,000 tonnes of mercury from every year. 
The report sets out in detail the profits thanks to this international programmes, which each country would generate. 
Indonesia, this would, for example, a billion dollars a year for the purchase of electricity and save eight million tonnes of CO2 that means an equivalent of 3.5 kohlekraftwerken whose erbauung Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
