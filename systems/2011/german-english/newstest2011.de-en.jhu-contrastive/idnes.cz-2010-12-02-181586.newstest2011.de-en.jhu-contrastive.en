More and more parents want to menschen-überwachungsgeräte, in order to have the kids under control 
The fear for their own children is growing and consider more and more parents, you by GPs to monitor. 
The system, which was originally to fahndung after cars invented, can people places as well, which would be helpful in such cases, as the spurlosen disappearance of the neunjährigen recently anička janatková. 
The device is about the same size as a zigarettenschachtel but at the moment it should not be greater than a armbanduhr soon. 
Many people has appointed to the case of the missing anička in fear and terror, and so do you think, looking for ways to better protect their children. 
Also for the price of a impairment of their right to privacy. 
"What we are trying to all to say that it is not in any way herumspionieren, it is an effective means to reduce the likelihood that it will lead to the tragedy is," Petr pilin from the society macro because of one of the suppliers of gps-ortungsgeräten on the Czech market. 
"I have to admit that it can go to the abuse of such equipment in isolated cases, for example, if there is someone in the bag is, without He knows this, but so far we have had no such case has been made." 
"Most of the customers buy it really for security reasons," adds pilin. 
His opinion, should the child but always know what purpose the "kind would" serves and how they are being used in the event of an emergency. 
The kinderpsychologin dana bočková, however, points out that a child, when it emptied may not bear such a thing, it's easy. 
"Very small children show a great creativity, when it comes to certain things deliberately to lose if they do not want to be controlled." 
"Already the mobile phones set initially at the parents high expectations, but they can be as easy to shut down, as this new überwachungsgeräte," Mrs bočková says. 
In your opinion is also questionable whether such an institution in the event of an attack actually help. 
"At planned kidnappings, the kidnapper controls virtually always, whether the child any electronics in has, with which it could be located." 
"Today is the mobile phone." 
"if such were überwachungsgeräte broader use, they would find them too, as their sale would be certainly accompanied by massive advertising." 
"In these cases, the criminals are always a step ahead of the police," the psychologist says. 
It acknowledges, however, that similar equipment in a sudden attack by a paedophile can be extremely helpful. 
Roberta čech RC monitoring by the company, according to the ortungsdienstleistungen both for cars, as well as offers to people that can help the existence of such a gerätes then, if it is destroyed immediately after the attack. 
STOP "the machine can be so that it disclose the respective positions in certain intervals." 
"Even if it would immediately destroyed, at least the last position of the person concerned is available." 
"in more expensive equipment is even a neigungsmesser integrated, in other words, if you hinfällt and bewegungslos are the machine, sends an immediate warning remains below indication of the position," said Mr čech. 
His opinion, similar services could also do the smart mobile phones with navigation and it just needs a particular piece of software einzuspielen. 
The problem of the current ortungsgeräte is that it is either about equipment in streichholzschachtel-größe, similar to the supporters or smaller mobile phones. 
Always, so the risk that it down. 
Mr pilin according to the macro because it is in the present testing devices, the look like ordinary digitaluhren. 
"It has the advantage that the possible attackers does not to realise that this is a surveillance or ortungsgerät is. 
Only after a certain time," or he can see what the police is a zeitvorsprung," he adds. 
No matter what direction the development in - out to armbändern or supporters, always will be the same technology is used, such as the fahrzeugortung. 
So the combination of ortungsfunktion by means of the gps-systems - just as the navi in the car - and disclose the function of a mobile phone for which the current position.
