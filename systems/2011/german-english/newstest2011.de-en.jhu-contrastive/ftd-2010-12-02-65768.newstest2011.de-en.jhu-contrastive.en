Ogoniland is burned off 
The water in the rivers is ölbraun, it, in the tankstelle: billion litres of ausgelaufenes crude oil have nature in the Nigerian ogoniland destroyed. 
The people living on theft, corruption and illegal ölkochen. 
Celestine akpobari believes it is a good thing. 
"DO NOT BE has hit from," the ökoaktivist reassured the journalists: "You are still enough oil in the linse wars." 
The 37-jährige Nigerians has monitored the attempt, a watenden young in water to the chest with the schlieren around him abzulichten: in the regenbogenfarbenen wasserglanz is the scene of almost function. 
That Brown rohölschwaden tops under the surface, is not to be seen. 
Earlier have told you eimerweise shrimps gathered here, esther badom on the shores of the bodo-jetty-flusses. 
But now is the lazy fluid waters completely dead. 
Five years ago poured from a geborstenen rohrleitung quantities of crude oil in the huge river wetland. 
Fishermen from the nearby städtchen bodo must now six hours row, to get to fischhaltige waters: that at the heart of the nigerdeltas to ogoniland is regarded as one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world. 
On the trip by the flussläufen durchzogenen mangrovensümpfe is the full extent of the verheerung striking. 
Instead of helles water wühlt the motorboot Brown brühe, into the water, its hands of who ölige fingers of humanity. 
The roots of the mangrovenbäumchen stand out as black lakritzstangen out of the ground, they can occasionally involved palmen their wedel hanging. 
Vogelschwärme, as you are common in wetlands otherwise, is in vain: as soon as the außenborder remains silent is spreading in which, as a tankstelle sweep former paradise gespenstische calm. 
"What is happening here is environmental warfare," says celestine akpobari gloomy, "We are living in constant danger to the health." 
The kriegsvergleich is appropriate. 
The siedlungsgebiet of ogoni is a akin to disputed battlefield for decades: here, more than 60 years ago, the first explorateure from Europe, organized here in the 1980s with the later exekutierten writer Ken saro-wiwa the first resistance, the shell-konzern 1993 has had to cease its production here, because it was too dangerous for its ölarbeiter. 
Still denied today the company is the return to ogoniland, while from the whole of deltaregion Of the Triple size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 bohrquellen and 700 kilometres rohrleitungen pumped more than two million barrels a day of the black gold are the oil fields in the ogoniland, to the company have the situation is unstable. 
Every few hundred metres stand out stählerne gestelle as bizarre skulpturen out of the water," christbäumchen "are the heads of the bohrlöcher far too zärtlich mentioned. 
They are up to 50 years old, the most korrodiert to the core. 
Again and again breche such a bohrkopf apart, says akpobari, then rinne a constant flow of crude oil into the water. 
After more than two billion litres of are gone into the ecosystem of the delta expertenschätzungen in 50 years, like you, year after year the quantity of oil, in the accident of the supertankers "Exxon valdez '21 years ago into the sea before been Alaska drive - one of the biggest environmental disaster in the history of mankind. 
Who is to blame for were the continuing ultimate environmental catastrophe, that will be fought. 
During the shell-konzern sabotage and the organised öldiebstahl power, are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, berstende bohrköpfe and lecke pipelines as main causes. 
In Nigeria, shell develop far lower standards than usual else in the world, accused the us-wissenschaftler Richard, Steiner, the corporation in 2008: only the rate of defects in the pipes, was "to much higher than anywhere else." 
In a place of from a distance as an abandoned, ölverschmierte werkstatt looks in open air, there are from to make the mangroven: they are splitternackt and up to the neck ölverschmiert. 
In one of the many of the fässer partly linked to röhren, partly arbitrarily scattered around are on site to identify, flackert a fire: an illegal kleinraffinerie. 
In the barrels of HEATED FOR several hours, the crude oil on the fire, said Michael, the leader of the group. 
First insist petrol by the pipes in the auffangtopf, later tröpfelt issued at the end of the leadership finally, kerosene and diesel. 
So produce Michael and four employees up to four fässer daily à 300 litres of diesel: "This brings us 34.000 naira A" - around 22 dollars. 
The deltabewohner use the chronic treibstoffknappheit, in the biggest erdölstaat schwarzafrikas. 
Nigeria has a single refinery. 
The with less than 40 euro-cent per litre of ridiculous low dieselpreis the illegal kocher can undercut: because their raw material, they get free. 
It comes from "bunkerern," which are the pipelinenetz across ogoniland tap: this will leave the country, according to experts in the whole of the Niger Delta lost at least 16 million litres of crude oil every day. 
Only a very small part of the zwischengelagerten provisionally raw material will, however, illegal veredelt: to fill the lion's share organised criminal networks, including politicians and senior soldiers belong to tankers and verscherbeln him on the world market. 
The debate about whether the environmental disaster rather due to the umtrieben the population or lax production, considers that the activist akpobari for purely academic. 
"The oil companies would not perceived as invaders and they would have the life of the fishermen not so thoroughly destroyed, there would be no sabotage theft and illegal refineries." 
Now is the ratio of ogoni, above all, to shell and destroyed so that only a withdrawal of the group's question would be: 'may ask, of course, other nationalities as the Chinese as a better result." 
This is Michael nervous. 
"high time for her to disappear," says the muskulöse ölmann. 
"Every minute, may be the soldiers." 
Be caught the illegal ölveredler from the special forces, they are not arrest, but I think a painful schmiergeld. 
Also the soldiers want originating mainly from the North, as all Nigerians, of the benefit of raw material. 
"This downright stuff has brought our country in every respect to the dog," akpobari says.
