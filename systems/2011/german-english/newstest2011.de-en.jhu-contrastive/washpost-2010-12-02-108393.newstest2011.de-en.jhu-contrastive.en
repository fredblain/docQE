Khmer Rouge forced veterans to confrontation with the past 
In a weak illuminated betonierten klassenraum reminded with dirty and abblätternden walls, the director of the anlong veng high school to the man who has built it, to the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta mok. 
"Everyone loves TA mok here." 
"He was a good leader and he has been considering his people are," said sreng kor Ma, 42 years. 
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, known as "The schlachter ', then the commander in this remote former Rouge rouge-hochburg in northwest Cambodia's popular, where he built hospitals and bridges, which has developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still lives. 
But this year, 12 years after the defeat of the Khmer Rouge to the Government, long supporters in anlong challenged veng. 
In April a local truth and versöhnungsforum allowed the victims public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime. 
In June, the government a schulbuch, for the first time children of former soldiers told the story of the Khmer Rouge. 
And in July, a gemeinschaftstribunal the UN and Cambodia's for the first time a former member of the Khmer Rouge, as the former leader of the notorious Tuol are used sleng torture centres, kaing khek iev, better known as Duch, sentenced to 35 years in prison. 
With each of these developments, the anxiety among the Khmer Rouge veterans alnlong vengs overshadowed their efforts at reconciliation and Cambodia's reintegration into the society. 
"There are still reject and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said chhang youk, head of the dokumentationszentrums of Cambodia's, an independent organisation, which studied the regime. 
"For them, the Khmer Rouge's life was impressive, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." 
"It is dividing even families." 
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of diseases, revision or from hunger. 
When the Vietnamese, causing the pole pot-ied government in 1979, fled the remnant of the regime and its military, on the border of Cambodia to Thailand. 
Here widely used it to December 1998, when the last movement surrendered, unrest. 
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary strikes the guerrilla warfare by their base in the west of mountains and jungles of Cambodia, drew TA mok led the next generation in anlong veng approach. 
But in the 1990s, when a peace agreement promoted by the United Nations in 1993, led to the country's first democratic elections, large groups of Khmer Rouge militants began, the government joining what the kapitulationen of Ieng Sary and nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998, in 1996. 
Pol Pot died in 1998, and a natural death of TA mok, who had not given in, was in the dangrek by government forces in 1999 mountains arrested. 
He died in 2006 at the prison in Phnom Penh, where he was awaiting his trial. 
As their benefactors they no longer protected, fled the majority of rural Cambodia's former Khmer Rouge fighters in the zermürbende poverty and many held on to the movement in nostalgic memories. 
Even if a few elite official of the Khmer Rouge retained their local government posts, because they niederlegten their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, ignorant farmers. 
"These people have benefited only very little of the capitulation," said sok leang by the Center for justice and reconciliation, the throughout Cambodia, also in anlong veng, public forums, 
"They are enshrined in the utopian agrarideologie of the regime." 
"They grew without any berufswissen to." 
Sor Lim, 55 years, the 1974 had joined the rhmer Rouge as a teenager, fought in the jungle by anlang veng before he niederließ in 1998, to lead a life as poor reisbauer. 
"life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said. 
"ta mok has given any something to eat." 
"But life now is difficult, because we have to take care of ourselves." 
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal also has concerns wachgerufen here. 
At the beginning of next year, the Court will try Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, and Ieng thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister to put them on trial. 
It is the task of the Court, the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, condemning, but it is not said whether it will pursue further actions beyond the four cases. 
That has done little to the fears in anlong to alleviate veng. 
Current medienspekulationen have focused on in the chaem, 64 years, that during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s, distriktchefin in the province of manteay had been meanchey. 
In 2007, it was representative of the dokumentationszentrums of Cambodia told they have the construction of the trapeang thma damms director, a project in which thousands of zwangsarbeitern probably died. 
On a hot evening came on the chaem of the work in the fields to their holzhaus to a dirty streets outside of anlong veng back. 
As the sun casts long shadow over the desiccated grass raised more alien rejected in the chaem it, to talk about their past in the Khmer Rouge. 
Should the court it flows, so it would refuse to go, she said. 
"Cambodia live in peace and stability," she said. 
"There would be no more prosecutions, would be war." 
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has fled in 1878 by the Khmer Rouge, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, the Court would be more suspicious accusations, although experts and historians are discussing this. 
"A hole, Cambodia must dig and bury the past," he said. 
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to be able to move forward, said chhang youk from the dokumentationszentrum. 
"reconciliation with the khmer-zeiten collect means the broken pieces," he said. 
"It is our obligation to put these broken parts together, so that like Everything else can understand." 
The center created the first schulbuch approved by the Government on the Khmer Rouge, the Democratic 75seitige 'history of Cambodia." 
In June it distributed the book in anlong veng as the annex to the history book for the High School of bildungsministeriums, which contains less than four sides on the Khmer Rouge. 
As so often in Cambodia know the young people in anlong veng only little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's links to the regime. 
Touch valeak, 19 years, a student at the anlong veng High School, said that the new schulbuch students will help to understand an important part of its history. 
But his parents reacted sceptical when he brought home with the book, to read it. 
"My family rejected many parts of the book, and the court," he said. 
"They are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people are convicted by the court." 
Such a resistance that makes the process of reconciliation complex and difficult, said sok leang. 
But the public forums, the schulbuch and get the court to and to influence," he said. 
Still has the Khmer Rouge here a powerful attraction. 
Up in the dangrek mountains, a sträuchern überwucherter and with plastikmüll verdreckter route to a rechteck black soot, covered with a rostigen blechdach. 
Pol Pot's body was been burnt after his death in 1998 on a reifenhaufen here. 
Nuom sothea, 31 years, a handyverkäuferin on straßenrand, said she does not know a lot about the man, who had been burned here. 
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here, go to him in order to pray," she said. 
It was nuom sotheas birthday and later in the day, it wanted to go to Pol Pot's last ruhestätte, where it is Bush a mature bananas for, in the hope that it brings its luck.
