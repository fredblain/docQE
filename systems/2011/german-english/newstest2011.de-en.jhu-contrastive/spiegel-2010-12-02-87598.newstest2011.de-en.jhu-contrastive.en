To hell, warriors. 
Does splatter suit the kunstkino? 
The director Nicolas winding refn lotet to his kämpfer-epos walhalla rising "old genre-grenzen new." 
To which public May the Danish director Nicolas winding refn have thought that as he has "walhalla rising" films? 
A prisoner wikinger-krieger with only one eye - mads mikkelsen - freed themselves from his peinigern and sets with almost superhuman powers by the dozen of his opponents to - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero like to the gedärme rough and Its Enemies already tötungsmethoden served time from the living is breaking limb, if he has bad humour. 
On the other hand, einauge says as he actually is known, the whole film about not a word, and the other characters can be time to one or at most two sentences or a few painful todesschreien carried away. 
Otherwise, remained silent and in the gruselig fine hügellandschaft of Scotland geschwelgt, which offers the wikingerwelt of around a thousand years ago the scene. 
Ideal for adults cineasten with interest rather for existentialismus and very calm kamerafahrten. 
Nice if a film several target groups, it is a shame, if they are mutually exclusive. 
Director winding refn is since its wild and gestylten drogendealer-trilogie "pusher" as a kind of Danish version of quentin tarantino, but refuses stoisch is his works with a little more humor the mainstream, or a little less brutality available to make the arthouse. 
Most of the kunstkino-freunde should spritzenden around by the gehirnmasse and the gedärmen meant to deter them. 
The action-fans, at least we will die before boredom, if einauge free interpretierbaren reasons with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem, aufbricht trapped and an eternity in slump and fog, it seems, before the team arrives in America and there continue to remain silent. 
No wonder, then, that "walhalla rising" in Germany had not found a kino-verleih and is now only appeared on DVD. 
This is particularly because of the magnificent images jammer, but also because, hiding behind the prätentiösen until bluttriefenden facade, a sometimes exciting piece of cinema, one that deserves some attention. 
In this film is not about dialogues, or a stringent act, it is all feeling, a filmgewordener fiebertraum. 
And from which there is no escape for the spectators. 
Refn gönnt him very little in the moment of relaxation and undertakes him with its icy pictures and dark trance-artigen the throat to soundtrack very slowly, but above all with the incomprehensible hatred of him from the heart of the players runs. 
Only a small blonder young, the side of the faithful to einauge is such a thing as innocence, retains, all the others will be driven by anger. 
The vast majority of the einäugige hero, whose motives never said, but for the enemy and temporarily allies will at some point to the warriors from the hell is that it might be the Ambassador of the devil himself. 
It means spoil, but perhaps only for the verdorbenen anyway. 
"walhalla rising" is a more puzzling film, we hate and can admire, for upset, worked up and be surprised. 
An experience.
