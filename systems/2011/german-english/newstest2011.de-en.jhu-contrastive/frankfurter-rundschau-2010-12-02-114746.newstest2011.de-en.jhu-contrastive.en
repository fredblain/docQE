The hand of the stones 
Uli gsell has also What concerned, a total of around 400 kilos. 
It was on Monday night have stuttgarter station, the tuba on the back. 
It was demo. 
It schneite. 
It is the same old story: in September were the excavators angerückt and had started to break off a large chunk of the nordflügels. 
The stuttgarter world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against s21, having to inject billions tieferlegung of the bahnhofs. 
When it came to the Settlement Freeze, a large part of the wing was in ruins. 
Collapsed in 6,000, 700 pieces. 
Crailsheimer muschelkalk, a soft gross stone, between 1914 and 1920, verbaut. 
Gsell is bildhauer in ostfildern, 43 years old. 
He has secured a couple of slice. 
"These are reliquien stones." 
"They must not go away." 
He schwärmt: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and erdenhaft." 
As he had a aufsägte, after zigarettenqualm gerochen. 
What he will do with the slice, he knows not yet. 
Stones have time. 
Uli gsell. 
The hand of the stuttgarter leads in a forest in tübingen stones on the French army, where a former munitionsdepot Manuel rongen stein-reich has built. 
The 44-jährige acts with old stones. 
He has all the bought on the demolition in stuttgart fell. 
"It would be a shame, they would be schotter gemahlen or disappear in the landfill," he says in his office, a holzbüdchen that was once a wachhäuschen. 
Named and have been threatened, he told him, as it was in September in the newspapers that he had bought the remnants of the nordflügels of abbruchunternehmer. 
But he has been talking to the s-21-gegnern, for several days. 
And he has told them that he is now but could do nothing for these are the words about. 
And if there is once again was happening, then it is surely the most logical if the stones were used. 
About 200 s-21-gegner, was one of the serious quader with an average of 80 kilos, and stückpreis 6,50 and 14 euros. 
As a memory, but some also in the hope to be able to return him on a reconstruction. 
500 tonnes of rongen had bought, 25 major truckloads. 
About half the being stored in the forest, the rest is long sold. 
Gartenbesitzer, landschaftsgärtner, häuslebauer. 
From anywhere whether they come and weggeschleppt have what kofferraum and supporters have been able to bear. 
The stuttgarter stones of the initiation have long turned into "mäuerle" or in the limits of kräuterbeeten. 
"Actually is nothing special," says rongen this stone. 
"would not be a political Dimension." 
He is increasing in his SUV, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of great kingdom. 
Jura he has suspended and later studied biology, then he is interested in computers and is, after all, has become steinhändler. 
And steinliebhaber. 
He 40000 tonnes of stones being stored. 
From all over Germany, it karrt together his value. 
He says that he is the biggest altsteinhändler of the Republic. 
He put brakes on it. 
The snow are skilful behauene sandsteine. 
"They belonged to Dresden marienbrücke," he told. 
Elbsandstein, amber, that he schwärmt warm. 
"My lieblingsstein." 
It is the way high through the forest. 
He demonstrates a handful of: Red sandstein, used to be part of the karlsruher bahnhofs. 
And further. 
"Nice travertin." 
Once included the quader to the gallery of the stuttgarter neckarstadions. 
Throughout the snow stones and stories, cannstatter travertin from the stuttgarter polizeipräsidium, rötlicher St blasien granit from the cathedral, tuff of Heilbronner hospital. 
The kind of work, the effort, their sweat. 
If rongen consider how the stones used by hand gehauen and with simple flaschenzügen and ochsenkarren were quite ehrfürchtig, it will be moved forward. 
"It would be a scandal if we would schreddern such a thing." 
He does not become immensely rich certainly is not rich. 
But 14 people in the steinhändler today, also, up steinmetze in the forest, a bildhauer, a schmied, a glasbläser and a gartenbauer settled. 
"We are working very hard, but it is a good one," says the resteverwerter. 
Soon he needs to Cologne. 
There, too, there are obstacles to save.
