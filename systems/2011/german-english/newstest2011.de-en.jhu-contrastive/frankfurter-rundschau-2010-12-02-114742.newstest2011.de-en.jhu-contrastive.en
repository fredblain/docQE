Controllers in the zwielicht 
The European Food Safety Authority EFSA was among the with genpflanzen experimentierenden industry undermined. 
Now the group testbiotech formulated the accusation, the role as an independent Institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology. 
"It sounds like a verschwörungstheorie, but we have well documented," said testbiotech-chef Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich. 
The head of the efsa-expertengruppe for genetically modified plants, Harry kuiper, and another efsa-experte were also in the lobbyistenverband for years ilsi under contract. 
It is paid by companies like Monsanto, nestle or Bayer. 
Kuiper have contributed significantly to the efsa-prüfvorschriften for genpflanzen and stand with criticized in a clear conflict of interest, then. 
The efsa-vorschriften are absatzweise wortgleich with positionspapieren ilsi and deceive so that the hand of industry, which should be controlled by the Authority in the Italian Parma. 
It is the second time that testbiotech already a interessenskollision bemängle. 
So is a high level efsa-managerin recently without restrictions or transitional period to the Swiss agrarkonzern syngenta - and I have to ensure that the sides. 
Also the mitteldeutsche radio - mdr - had recently human links between kontrollierender EU agency and industry lobby, reveals what it has done umweltbundesamt as well as eu-parlamentarier suspicious. 
However, the EFSA can see no conflict of interest. 
We will take back to every serious data, also to the industry, such as long as they are of a high professional standards, it said in a statement. 
By the experts who work for EFSA, we do not want you have no contact with the industry. 
It but they would have to disclose. 
Kuiper gives his work for the International Life Sciences Institute - ilsi - in the United States. 
This described themselves as neutral forum for experts from science, industry and without lobbyauftrag policy, among other things, to risikoabschätzung in biotechnology. 
Criticise as then independent experts on the matter, that genetically modified plants at the moment without any fütterungsversuch in animals are registered and the response from genpflanzen to environmental factors will not be tested. 
"We want to know what, for example of genetically modified corn on the acker power," says then. 
Current practice is it, just isolated proteins, but not the whole genpflanze to test, what liefere no reliable results. 
"If it is seeking the risks not as they should find?" asks then anklagend. 
It also includes Angelika hilbeck. 
The scientist research since 1994 function in the Zurich direct genetic engineering and is currently in the Technical University. 
The industry attempts in this respect as now in the United States in Europe more and more critical scientists to influence or to discredit. 
There is so little researchers, not with corporations are interlinked. 
For companies critical studies published in the rule would not. 
Hilbeck "The industry controls the research," said.
