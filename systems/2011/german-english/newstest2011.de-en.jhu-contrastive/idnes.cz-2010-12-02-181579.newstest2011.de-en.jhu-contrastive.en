The right matratze and wish the right bettenrost? women are different than men 
Not the tollste bettrahmen, but the quality of the liegefläche - matratze and rost are the good bed. 
However, these must be harmonious complement, in order to meet the wishes of the specific user. 
In choosing a role - play many things the weight, the size of the health and, last but not least, the sex of the schläfers. 
The interieur, is just as important in the matratze and rost above. 
A typical example? 
In a wochenendhaus, in which not regularly heated, latexmatratzen are not good, because you need a much longer, in order to "warm." 
In addition, they are much more difficult than normal polyurethan-matratzen. 
And, they should be changed regularly. 
When they do not have enough at the heart of entlüftungskanälchen and even to be on a permanent record staut moisture in, so it is not ruled out that under its is built. 
, of course, also plays a role in the election, in which people are used. 
Who was for a prolonged period of time abroad, where very high matratzen with weichschicht are common, will be difficult can get used to a low matratze through hard surface. 
"Certainly all eishockeyspieler, from the nhl have returned, have complained to me that they can no longer right sleep here." 
"for their abgeschundenen shoulders, fersen and hüften they need just a weichschicht being solved from visco-schaum - Memory foam - a formgedächtnis-polymer -." 
"These among other things, I advise diabetics people who suffer from a disturbance of the nervous system, so that the" information "from the gelenken and skin can receive a bad thing," says Sylva hadamcziková, a reference to polstermöbel specific. 
That is why I have many years ago eishockeyspielern being solved, but also other customers this matratzen with visco-schaum - Memory foam - Concerned. 
"Today, it is no longer a problem, because such matratzen offer including manufacturers to tempur tropico to the Italian firm magniflex or the Czech producers." 
And we should not necessarily be a famous eishockeyspieler, learn to appreciate the benefits of the visco-schaums. 
This "miracle" actually works quite simply. 
The foam optimalisiert its severity and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, he schmiegt well and truly a warm body. 
Nowhere is it, during the night shifts as after a major fight around it is not. 
We sleep much better. 
The viskoelastische foam also provides protection against dekubitus - wundbrand -. 
In the choice of the matratzengröße it should contribute to height is still the length of the fußsohlen hinzurechnen, or some 21 to 34 cm. 
Men as women, who are in the 180 cm high, need this kind of 210 to 220 cm long bed. 
Each of the schläfer should at least 90 cm liegebreite available, so together 180 cm. 
In einzelbetten, for example in singles, are 120 to 140 cm appropriate. 
Be half of the komforts and also for any visitors. 
Otherwise the following faustregel applies to the ideal bettbreite: "If one is on the back, there should still be enough room for the easy angewinkelten poor," advises ing. helena prokopová, the zunftmeisterin of polsterer and raumausstatter, which has been for many years, the issue of healthy schlafes and covers the ergonomie of furniture and this matter on University has put forward. 
In a doppelbett, each with its own rost and his own matratze, but to watch the purchase by the matratzen are high in a moment. 
Otherwise have no alternative but to fit, than the roste at different levels and that is not in every bettrahmen possible long ago. 
Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, matratzen with federskelett 15 cm, of which should have at least three centimeters on the formschicht and the feinpolster rejected. 
"With the hand or to sit down, we can see the feathers in no way," helena warns prokopová. 
Any matratze requires a special rosttyp. 
Ganzgepolsterte beds with matratze and documents as zusammengewachsene siamzwillinge have no place in the bedroom. 
These matratzen cannot be drop and the relation cannot be washing, what today is already commonplace. 
And as you are in a single night between 0.2 and 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the matratze after five to seven years, is becoming a huge - and congested colander -. 
That is also why reject experts werbeslogans, the matratzen a life of up to 25 years, and even life guarantee promise. 
Every thing has its but if and. 
And that is why a practical COUNCIL OF THE dealers: in matratzen of 120 or 140 feet wide should not shy away from the hygiene of the waschbaren, abziehbaren salary, yet, it is recommended that a matratzenschoner, it's easy to use and washing can pull out. 
Even if today in the rule matratzenbezüge with rundumreißverschluss will be produced, so to get open after the two halves - immensely important for the waschvorgang and the waschmaschinengröße! -, the manipulation with greater matratzen, especially alone is carried out, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. 
You have a firm in bed rather than a rostes plate? 
Out with it. 
Or a maximum of for a bed for Cinderella guests and for a single night. 
Also the plate should be better to have lüftungslöchern oversight - if not in it are - and matratzen with federskelett and 15 cm minimum allocation with sog. taschenfederkern and feinpolster use. 
Polyurethan-matratzen do not belong to in such a documents. 
For not verstellbare lattenroste with 14 to 18 federleisten - lamellen - are latex- or - perhaps also combinations of latex and kokos - likely sandwichmatratzen, always pay is roste with an increased lattenanzahl, about 28 and more federleisten from, with lordosenstütze in lendenwirbelbereich, and the possibility to regulate the lattenhärte. 
On verstellbare lamellenroste not include matratzen with federskelett, since it is not on the ergonomische verstellung respond. 
In addition to the attitude of the stiff federleisten are being offered the Special flexible schultermodule. 
We are talking about a special federleisten Gaza, which will make it possible to implement the federleisten einzudrücken or even to verwinkeln, as it is the isolated einsinken allow the shoulder of the schläfers. 
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important matter. 
There are even matratzenhersteller, which have started to use in "herrenmatratzen" weichzonen for the schulterbereich. 
Is also to the ladies thought, you gönnt this weichzonen in the hüftgegend. 
For demanding consumers are punktelastische flügelfedersysteme - lattoflex - or roste with punktelastischen kontakt-pads with sog. multitorsionsfederung determined. 
The pressure on a number of points will be distributed, which the tension decreased. 
But, if it at the right matratze and right rost a bad - too much and fülliges - kopfkissen used, lost most of the benefits are off. 
Faustregel here, too: the kopfkissen is the head is based, Its leaders should only up to shoulder the rich, so that the schultermuskeln can ease. 
Ideal is therefore a 50 x 60 cm wide kissen, for example, as it may the Scandinavians. 
In the seitenlage should the kopfkissen - together with the schulterentlastungszone in rost or the weichzone in the matratze - compensate for the schulterhöhe. 
Have our modern matratzen have something in common with the former - with Hay so - strohsäcken but. 
More and more natural materials, or at least their mixtures use modern producers. 
Also in matratzen is the new magic formula "organic." 
Instead of erdölrohstoffen is used to produce polyurethanschäumen naturelle oils, for example, rizinus- and sojaöl becoming more common. 
Soya is likely to be used by all known manufacturers. 
"Organic is to say in matratzen, that your heart is composed of materials purely natural origin," said Petr vašíček tropico plus of the company. 
Naturstoffe but will also be used in the manufacture of matratzenbezügen - one of the first was aloe Vera. 
But we can also be mikrokapseln sleep on the fresh wald- or lavendelduft spread. 
Also here is there is a difference between men and women. 
While the men a "kühlender" pflanzenextrakt birkenblättern is used, so that the matratzenbezug can absorb the heat and cool the body, have the salary for women "wärmende" to be effective. 
Extrakte from red paprikaschoten rain the blutzirkulation to, the weaker sex to sleep so wohlig warm. 
And today's favoriten? 
Matratzen from kaltschaum - he has more poren with devastated zellstruktur and is therefore atmungsaktiver than standard - polyurethan and also much more flexible. 
Through the combination of the various stiff - tough - of kaltschäumen and visco-schäumen mehr-zonen-matratzen, create the know exactly where head, hip and fersen are. 
For a quality matratze has, however, to berappen 7000 kronor and more. 
Gesundheitsmatratzen but usually with lower VAT is, since they are considered medical tools. 
Receiving the first Czech companies have gumotex this advantage. 
You see, in the matratze and on to save rost is not as easy as it seems. 
From time to time there are sonderangebote of manufacturers and traders, the two matratzen offer for the price of one. 
So the brand magniflex provides the matratze duofreeze with in regard verstepptem being solved visco-schaum memory for 11.990 czk. 
The second we get free to do so. 
It was the material tempur that the era of viskoelastischen schaumstoffe launched with open zellstruktur and high density in almost kosmischem speed. 
No surprise, they have been developed for the NASA, because the astronauts are with the launch huge überbelastungen suspended. 
Tempur in heat soft, in a cool setting it, in turn, strengthens. 
So it is perfect to the human body and distributed on the körperdruck optimum way. 
It is, therefore, not only to prevent druckbrand ideal, but generally the schlafkomfort increased. 
Viskoelastische schaumstoffe but not only in matratzen, but also in other gesundheitsprodukten, for instance, used in particular fußpolstern to give the legs and the gefäßen relief. 
Local manufacturers use for example of the schaumstoffe eucatherm C, twinsaver or similar products.
