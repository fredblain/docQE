Can connect courtesy what divides us? 
After a campaign of schimpfwörtern and negativität is little civility erupted in Washington this week. 
It is the sign of a real zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion, before we quickly return to the fight of the parties in the capital? 
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress, no breakthrough in the big issues, with one during the the "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a Government's policy, in no decisions had to be taken to deal more. 
After all that is being said, it was not a polite debate between two different sides even a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan punktesammelns. 
The President's public meeting of the defizitkommission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that still exist between the members. 
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months, can give a mutual respect, the ideological divide, which remains the members of separating, of concealment. 
This is hardly enough to say that it was a new era of cooperation here. 
Both sides are now in a test phase - in of one of the other sign of cooperation and calls for spirit of compromise, and we even tried to the borders of the public opinion and the patience of the voters for a resumption of parteienkriegsführung arbitration. 
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday were itself, and its assessment limited by the participants on a minimum level of demands or accusations. 
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep, to be a rapid change in the atmosphere, which has dominated over the past two years, might hope. 
Regardless of whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or anwartschaften, the two sides are miles apart. 
At last, the novemberwahl Washington at least mild voted for a short time. 
"No question, the tone, a tone has changed," said pete wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, which is now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center." 
"This is inevitable after the elections. 
Elections give parteiliche passion, the die again. 
And that is a good thing." 
In some issues, particularly those who on the agenda of the "lame duck session" are Republicans and Democrats, no other choice than to find a solution. " 
Bush's tax cuts, at the end of the year, and no one supports the end. 
Both sides want to find a way to receive some, or even all, whether it is temporarily or permanently. 
A compromise on the increased arbeitslosengelder is also expected to, if only because the Republicans cannot afford it, that people think that supported the tax cuts for the rich, while they refuse to unemployed workers support. 
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House has increased the optimism that it is in these issues during the "lame duck session" can ratify some while, at the same time, the new START Treaty. 
But William glaston of the Brookings insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to a permanent cooperation between the parties must, if the new 112. Congress will convene in January. 
Instead, he says, is a phase of nichtübereinstimmens likely, perhaps even inevitable. 
"After the things that need to be done, are done, this short psychology will turn into confrontation," he said. 
Wehner is also skeptical, and this skepticism is shared by many, leads the courtesy to real cooperation. 
"I see a lot of things, what is happening as vorkampf from now on until 2012, or schattenboxen, for the hauptereignis by 2012," he said. 
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the teeparty-wählern, whose education were conducive. 
How worried the Republican leaders also may be that they pokern too high, they know that they have to try to reduce their promises, the government's expenditure and to put the gesundheitsreform out of power, to be respected. 
The parteilinien are already in The first reactions regarding the recommendations of the defizitkommission clearly what a tax reform and the raising of certain taxes and raising the retirement age and include the lowering of government spending. 
The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and erskine Bowles have one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have taken over, according to their own assessment, so much insisted, the defizitfrage to the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored. 
But they need 14 of the 18 vote within the Commission, in order to make its plan to official recommendation and they are fighting very, in order to come only in the vicinity of this number. 
The biggest opposition is in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters, at least today, only little room or little sympathy for compromise. 
Galston says two stages in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress is required. 
The first battle will take place in the form of parteizusammenstößen next year, when the Republican challenge Obama in terms of staatshaushalts, taxes and of the health system, then followed by a period of more zweiparteilicher cooperation. 
What will lead to this change? 
The public opinion. 
It has been proven that, despite the bias of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties are working together. 
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as it did in, then both sides must carefully to ensure the public reaction. 
Regardless of who is always doomed to lose, will have to change the course and try to find the compromise. 
This may, in fact, be an optimistic view. 
Partisanship and polarization is now greater than in the middle of the 1990's, and they seem to be a greater ideological divide between Obama and the kongress-republikanern than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time. 
At the same time the activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude for a 2012 in consequence of much larger election. 
From that point of view, may the courtesy, which this week about the display will be welcomed by many Americans. 
But it will take a lot more effort on both sides, to find a common denominator in the issues that the two still be separated.
