Affaire clotilde reiss: the elysée-palast exaggerates its mittlerfunktion for Syria 
In more than six months, from July 2009 by May 2010, held the fate of clotilde reiss, a young French forscherin, who was detained for 'spying' in Iran, the French public in breath, left the diplomacy in alarmbereitschaft and akzentuierte the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran. 
All this under the thoughtful look of the diplomats of the United States. 
The and received by WikiLeaks of the newspaper "Le Monde" durchgesehenen American documents be some price behind this crisis. 
They describe how the Elysée had declared his strategy which went as far as to the Americans, this advice to deal with their own crisis of 'taking of hostages' in Iran - a small group of wanderern - to give. 
They show on, such as the French players have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young französin not the release of Majid kakavand, one in France and held captive by the American justice system as a result of trade in materials in favour of the Iranian nuklearprogrammes iraners sought to have gegeleistung. 
After all, they are the way in which the French Bureau to manipulate the media to the purposes, has tried to make this the idea to credible, the Syrian president bachar al-Assad have a central role in the liberation of clotilde reiss played, in a harsh light. 
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard. 
A redigiertes in Paris on 12 August 2009 diplomatentelegramm is entitled "Iran: French comments about the way of dealing with the taking of hostages." 
François richier, had a elysée-berater in strategiefragen, is accompanied by patrice paoli, Director of the Quai d orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomatin kathleen allegrone. 
They declared her French method. 
The advised the Americans to do all we can to their own nationals rückzuführen, which would forcibly detained in Iran. 
"makes noise," they said, 'articulated loudly and clearly and without unterlass "the words" grundmenschenrechte, "" innocence, "" immediate release "in the media. 
This is necessary in order to bring the Iranian regime in a predicament, respects the very sensitive to his image. 
"This is all the more so because, as you ask the Iranians not to do that." 
Because the 'silence solves nothing," over the diskussionsversuche on on unauffälligem way, the Iranians are "masters in ausweichmanövern." 
Mr richier adds that the detention of foreigners was a "geläufige Iranian tactics": "taking hostages for the purposes of political blackmail." 
He has announced in, the release of clotilde reiss from the prison - the on 16 August should be reached on the days, in which it is in the French Embassy vanishes - "demand the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians' - 230,000 euro bail -. 
And he is telling state that the Elysée antizipiere Further taking of hostages, a phenomenon that "will get worse." 
The Iranians could "in the near future a different about arrest 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said. 
28 August 2009. 
Clotilde reiss is 12 days ago has been released from prison, however, is still held in Iran. 
An information has been in circulation. the Iranians Majid kakavand whose extradition to the United States because illegal trade in empfindlichem elektronikmaterial to Iran are calling for is to entscheid of a judge in Paris has been released from detention. 
The American message is, like many other observers, questions about this disturbing koinzidenz. 
For Washington, which the illegal Iranian networks of the purchases of the material is scheduled for the nuclear programme, represents the release of Majid khakavand bad news. 
France has taken a horse trading on board? 
The liberation of the iraners against the party of the französin? 
At a meeting with kathleen again allegrone on 4 September François richier assured me that this was not the case. 
The Elysée, he says, was "totally surprised by the decision of a judge," but I have also tried to aufzulehnen against this. 
"It has been a frequent exchanges between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" - now michèle alliot-marie -, but "the French Government cannot change the judicial decision," he said. 
Mr richier would also like to point out that Majid kakavand still under "strict" supervision of the French secret service. 
Of the elysée-berater adopted a telephone number, sets back on, then informed the American diplomatin, the Iranians "would have been, at present in the buildings led by the Iranian Embassy in Paris." 
During the gewahrsams clotilde reiss care not to use statements by the Elysée its efforts in Iran and organised by the media "to make fluchtversuche" Believe that the Syrian president bachar al-Assad games a "significant" and "important mittlerrolle." 
The Americans are watching this activity not without irony and say that the manipulation is bearing fruit as several articles reflect the official French version. 
A on 25 August 2009 datierendes telegramm invites "the medienblitz of the French authorities." 
What is based as much "dankesbezeugung" to Mr Assad asks the Paris message. 
"Despite their statements, the French authorities secretly to be full of lobpreis that they have only a vague idea of what the syrier actually have done." 
The document, then deal with the reasons that have led the Elysée that this fiction to collapse. 
The intensive kommunikationsbemühungen "aims to Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria to confirm," he analysis. 
A policy launched in 2008," at the time of many kritikerstimmen in France and abroad was perceived as premature and unverdient." 
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" Paris "Syria, to see the experiments to lead to what we can achieve belobigung by being plays a constructive role in the region." 
Goal, it is also "to sow discord between Syria and Iran." 
The American message knows this from good source. 
On 11 August, François richier had entrusted to her: "Of course, we do not know whether the syrier which have always done." 
"But we have in spite of everything, thanks for you." 
"This should at least cause confusion on the Iranians." 
Clotilde reiss go back to France on 16 May 2010. 
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Elysée. 
In a message he thanks to the President of Brazil, from Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the release of our compatriot."
