The United States changes the rules for the preservation of a visa 
The people must be present before their dialogue at the consulate in the dienstleistungsstellen on visumsbeantragung; costs will be waiting times as shortened. 
From the 10th January 2011 change the procedure for applying for a visa in the Embassy of the United States and the consulates. 
Most of the new procedure, the applicants before their meeting at the consulate in the dienstleistungsstellen to visumsbeantragung - asc, those anfangsbuchstaben in English - imagine. 
The staff of the asc adopted the biometric data of the applicant to, which will be reviewed by the consulate before the conversation. 
The new procedure has certain benefits for the aspiranten, these include: 
The total cost for the management of visa drop, because it is no longer needed the terminabsprache, the handling of the visumsantrags and the transportservice with which the document is being passed on to pay separately. 
The applicant is only a single payment, which covers the three services. 
The current price remains unchanged: the gegenwerit to 140 dollars for a touristenvisum, $150 for visas with motion - including visas for temporary workers - and 390 dollars for händer and investors. 
Those who want only prolong their visa, not a discussion at the consulate must lead, you only have the most likely asc see where you present your documents and their fingerprints taken away from them. 
Since the biometric data in the asc being collected, remain the applicants who need a second date for the meeting at the consulate, there's less time than it used to be.
