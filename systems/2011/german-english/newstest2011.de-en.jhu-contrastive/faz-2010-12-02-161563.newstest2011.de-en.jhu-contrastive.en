The eis-universität 
At the "gelato university" in Bologna eiskonditoren prepared for better seasons. 
The three grundkurs for future gelatieri has the biggest violence and visitors from all over the world. 
What is important is all the ice? 
The gelatiere and the gelataio. 
The gelatiere, something altertümlich the eiskonditor in German, the cream after all the rules of the Italian eismacherkunst since. 
The gelataio pulls the eiscreme with a spachtel from the kühltheke, delete them in the waffel and then sold them. 
In order to know this, you do not have to anzola Dell emilia drive in the province of Bologna. 
But anyone who wants to know more about ice, which is not yet in the "gelato-university" of the Italian company carpigiani over. 
The eis-universität, the manufacturers of eismaschinen in 2003 set up so that the eiscreme from its machines lived up to the high Italian ideals everywhere. 
The three grundkurs for future gelatieri has the biggest violence and visitors from around the world. 
But there are also mehrtägige spezialkurse around the schokoladeneis and work experience in the hauseigenen eisdiele. 
Some in the midlife-crisis dreams of a new career, other car simply time to downright hold their vague aspirations. 
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia. 
Jacky kunstlehrer in California, loves the slow-food-bewegung and wants to offer quality in the country, the industrial ice-cream a European future product. 
Anke from Berlin is unternehmensberaterin and wants to, after years in a nervenaufreibenden job a little eintüten of its own. 
Two young ägypterinnen dream of, in Cairo to start a eisdiele. 
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of eiscreme in their bars, and the Canadian housewife Yulia is because their children Italian eiscreme love. 
Maestro-gelatiere luciano Ferrari declared the participants first of all the ideal characteristics of perfect eiscreme. 
It is crucial not only good taste, but also the seidige geschmeidigkeit and the good consistency. 
Luciano does not forget in his training but also the icing on the cake of national and südländischen at all überbaus." Italian gelato is simply the best, and there is also a lot of romanticism to play." 
The first step to the production seems very simple. 
Luciano kippt the grundzutaten milk, put cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a huge mixgerät that all this with an electronic programme heated to 85 degrees and then immediately to four degrees slows. 
Then he is a Hahn, and out of the flight comes a pasteurisierte white basiscreme basis for all milcheissorten. 
Right now, the dozent with questions bestürmt: can we eiscreme produce only with natural substances without stabilisator? 
How can you let the own experimentierlust free course? 
Luciano warns to be lead by the spirit in the mistaken. 
Who eiscreme "only from natural ingredients" speech, has perhaps yet stabilizers is used, often a product of nature, such as guarkernmehl from the guarbohne. 
Of course you can also produce without stabilisator ice, but it must then be sold within a day, otherwise it sackt together, and the customer bite on eiskörnchen increase. 
Some variations in the grundmasse are allowed. 
With the flavourings, there will be more exciting. 
The ice for the taste is different maestro luciano between the ingredients, the people in the obst-abteilung or in the supermarktes buying sweets. 
Also, there are powder and pasten. 
"The suppliers are all try to anzudrehen dozens of aromatisierte additions them." 
"But they should have simply time to experiment." 
Either in the fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh früchten. 
Or just for the eiscreme from the White grundmasse, who with eggs on the yellow cream, with kakaopulver the basis for all sorts of schokoladen-verführungen. 
The kursteilnehmer to the eismaschinen must now. 
Luciano allows it to four different types of vanille-, schokolade-, mokka- and achieve haselnuss-eis, with or without eggs in the grundmasse, with more or less vanillearoma or other natural zusätzen. 
The same test will be subject to the fruchteissorten. 
More aromas which, more frucht-püree - more is not necessarily better. 
Haselnuss-eis is not necessarily nussiger if it contains more hazelnuts. 
The favorite kiwi-eis is the working party, since, the More fruits, less water and a little less stabilisator used. 
Only a balanced mix stress the taste of a gelato right, says luciano. 
Eisherstellung is a rechenaufgabe: will pfirsich-püree with high sugar used the zuckeranteil in the grundrezept must be reduced. 
For zitroneneis a extraportion sugar is needed. 
Luciano shows is a machine, with which he determined the sugar content of the fruchtsorten - wine producers are concerned so that the oechsle measure in the traubenmost -. 
Fortunately, the rechnerei facilitate tables. 
To make ice requires not more physical use as much as it used to be. 
Not only the machine for the automatic production of the grundmasse helps. 
There is also a device, in which the completed eis-mischung cremig beaten, and at the same time to minustemperaturen kept. 
In spite of all the automatisierung remain small accidents. 
The Brazilians gustavo bekleckert itself and its kurskollegen with fruchtpüree than it from top to bottom of the überdimensionale stabmixer spiral out of control. 
"In every direction," says maestro luciano, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens."
