Arsen-resistente mikrobe could allow new forms of life on the Earth or elsewhere 
The discovery of a foreign bakterienart, including of arsenic can live, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth, and elsewhere. 
Although this breakout bakterium here in the world's scientists discovered in their view, it is a sign that a life without the deemed vital elements is possible so far. 
"This body has two options." 
"Either phosphorus or arsenic he needs to grow." 
This makes it into something very special," even though it is almost a kind of 'alien' way of life," said Paul c.w. based Davies of the Arizona State University and co-autor of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online-ausgabe the journal Science. 
So far, there have been six main elements are seen as vital - carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. 
But as the scientists herausfanden, increases the bakterium in California mono lake then, too, even further when it has replaced by arsenic. 
"But as we wonder, what else is still possible," said the report's co-autor based Ariel that anbar from the Arizona State University. 
The discovery is an important step in the search for außerirdischem life, as scientists need to live and see its forms, anbar. 
The study is concerned with microbes that have been found in the world. 
The announcement of a press conference to the discovery, in which no details were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet, the report by the discovery of außerirdischen life might be. 
This is not the case. 
The discovery of "shows that in other planetensystemen organisms can set in motion with the help of other elements biochemical processes and that the 'standardelemente' that, in our opinion, are absolutely essential, do not necessarily see set," said Charles cockell, professor at the planetary and space sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. 
Cockel was not part of the teams of researchers. 
"This work is something new, because it shows that an element in basic biochemical processes and structures can be replaced by another," cockell added. 
The discovery was not accidental. 
Felisa wolfe-simon by the astrobiologischen Institute NASA, which led the study, chose the mono lake because of the high arsengehalts. 
As arsenic and phosphorus chemical same, he took them to that microbes, both are exposed to, possibly even can replace an element by the other. 
"The giftigkeit of arsens is first and foremost is that there is a chemically similar as phosphorus." 
"By the organisms are finding it hard to distinguish an element from the other." 
"But the difference is so great that arsenic is different than phosphorus. It comes in the biochemisches system, where it almost everything verschmiert," anbar says. 
The researchers, the bakterium gfaj-1 a rise in arsenkonzentration. It fit and grew. 
Phosphorus better, but that they are also the mikrobe is growing in arsenic can survive, shows that a arsen-basierte way of living can happen, of course, either in the earth or on a different planet or moon on the arsenic frequently occurs. 
According to Jamie S. Foster, dozentin for mikrobiologie at the University of Florida, the idea is that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new. but so far, there was still no functioning example. 
Arsenic came in the early erdjahren more frequently, she says, That is why the science to expected that early life have used it. 
"There is reason to believe that life also can have developed different than in the early erdzeitalter," forster, which is not a member in wolfe-simons was forschungsteam. 
The research were supported by the NASA, the energieministerium and the national health authorities.
