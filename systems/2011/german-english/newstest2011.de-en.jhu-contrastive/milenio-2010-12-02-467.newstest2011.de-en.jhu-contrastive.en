China maintains its aims to reduce greenhouse gases 
The representative of China said at the cop16 that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the kohlenstoffspuren and it would maintain his offer, 40 to 45 percent of its reduce greenhouse gases by 2020. 
China does his offer the emission of greenhouse gases in order to reduce 40 to 45 percent by the year 2020, assured Su Wei, the representative of the country on the cop16. 
In his first public appearance on the 16 - cop16 - assured the United Nations weltklimagipfel Su Wei, his country would have made enormous efforts to lower the kohlenstoffspuren and to convert its industry. 
He said that his country have invested $245 million in the last four years in order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. 
On the other hand, he said that China would not change its goals, but would work together with the international community in this matter. 
He said that the Chinese unterteile strategy on climate change in four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, construction of institutions and support of pilotprogrammen. 
We have made progress in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energiegesetzes in the last year, which delivers the targets for reduction of emissions of gases, he said. 
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the authorities of the States with those of zentralstaats and the communities would have worked together to the targets for the energy conservation, an efficient use of energy and the reduction of emissions. 
He also led are already a multiannual plans to begin or have been closed, both those who have been financed by the Chinese Government, as well as those which have received funds from other countries. 
For example, he was referring to the programme on the effective use of energy, which was introduced in the last five years and the United Nations - UN - investment, the government had received and from private hands. 
There is also a project revenue at provincial level on climate change, a further by energiesparbirnen on exchange of the traditional incandescent light bulbs and another to discourage and adjustment, he said. 
Martin krol, scientific regierungsberater on climate change in this country, confirmed that the efforts of China would be far greater than is commonly believed. 
He showed that the pro-kopf-emission six tons of greenhouse gases in China betrage per person, while there are 100 tonnes in the United States. China is responsible for a neunprozentigen envelope to pollution. 
Also will be unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. The energiewirksamkeit has been increased by 20 percent in the last five years and is another to be achieved by the year 2020, he said.
