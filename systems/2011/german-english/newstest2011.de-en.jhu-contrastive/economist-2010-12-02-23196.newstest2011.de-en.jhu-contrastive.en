Weak applause for China 
Taiwan's voters are coming to slow a closer link to the mainland. 
What is Taiwan from its big brother across the straits? 
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, which is 70% of all eligible on, in order to choose the five Kardzhali mayor and councillors. This will be seen as a broad assessment of the President Ma ying-jeou. 
Through the building groundbreaking business ties, einschl. of a partial free trade agreement, ma itself is a symbolfigur for the relations with the mainland. His policy, the relationship with the Chinese mainland for the first time since 1949 lasting changes. 
Ma has passed the tests, but only just. 
Even though his kuomintang-partei - KMT - three of the five mayor is, it received no majority of votes. 
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party - DPP -, which received a more supports independence of Taiwan, almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%. 
In a presidential election would mean that for MA problems. 
Since his election two years ago, the support of his party has fallen by about 8%. 
For the first time, the DPP even in the councillors together with the KMT. 
During the election, there was the usual events such as lastwagenkonvois with krawallmachern in Taiwan, flaggen-schwenkende massenumzüge and only sparsely clad tänzerinnen. 
There were even the compulsory, mysterious mordversuch. 
Sean lien, the son of lien Chan and ehrenvorsitzender the KMT made a speech to a kmt-kandidaten, on the eve of the election 
Lap when a man from the great deal of him in the eye. lien has been wounded and killed a umstehender spectators. 
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter lien killing or wanted to put an end to a dispute with the candidates. 
Regardless of the attack, according to tsai has ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the election affected and the DPP, which ended up in a bad light of the KMT has brought more votes. 
China was perhaps the biggest winners of the campaign. 
Remarkably, was not addressed the relations with the mainland. 
Instead, the candidates debated on plans to housing and the creation of jobs. 
The Taiwanese people love their de facto independence, and reject China's militärbedrohung. 
For this reason, the KMT its relations with the government in Beijing do not like to the fore. 
But this time also avoided the DPP, the anti-chinesischen feelings to stir up too much. 
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy without China cannot survive. 
Ma, for its part, wants to confirm, however, that the majority of the Taiwanese supported his policy towards China. 
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy, zurückzulocken Taiwan with economic incentives in the community. 
China sent immediately a negotiators to Taipei to prepare for a summit to investment and medical cooperation. 
Certainly it wants a political integration. But the most important thing first. 
It is so that better until after the presidential elections in 2012. 
The DPP has now reinvented. 
Two years ago it was greatly weakened, the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption. 
During his presidency from 2000 until 2008, he strongly for the complete independence. 
But under tais regentschaft has become a new generation gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the vote of working and the youth. 
Tsai took place as präsidentschaftskandidatin the DPP much support, as Su tseng-chang under Chen. 
Her party, now has done everything in order to show that they are in a position to do that, to establish close relations with Beijing. 
Tsai is planning a ideenschmiede as kontaktpunkt between the DPP and China. However, this requires vorurteilsfreie discussions. 
Tsai declared publicly that their party is a "trustworthy alternative" offer to Ma's vorschneller rapprochement with China. 
Chen seems very angry about this change. 
He said from his cell, the candidate of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence. 
He urged the pragmatists su even to give up on the präsidentschaftskandidatur. 
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is difficult to choose their potential candidates. 
The KMT will have to make a own selbstanalyse. 
Ma's values are poorly, despite the rapid economic growth, but the kmt-kandidaten wanted to lead their campaigns without him. 
The main reasons for his unbeliebtheit unemployment and the always seem to be further gap between rich and poor. 
According to testimony of a kmt-sprechers is he going to reshape his cabinet as well as the local institutions. 
A strong voice for the DPP supports Taiwan suggests that a rapprochement, if only restricted. 
At the same time, most of the Taiwanese see the economic cooperation with China, as inevitable. 
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent kolumnisten," there is no going back."
