Staatsanleihe for the takeover of excentris 
The quebecer Government, which has been called on by the parallèle Société angus, as well as the company, is financially in the takeover of the kinokomplexes to take part excentris, says with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive bond. 
The entwicklergesellschaft angus, as well as the company parallèle, a donation to the tune of 7 million dollars from the kultusministerium for the adoption of the kinokomplexes belonging Daniel langlois excentris on the boulevard saint-laurent had hoped to have this back to his normal cineastischen function, do not appear to überantworten given what they have asked. 
Although the government has accepted to involve in this matter, but on their own terms. 
Instead of the expected donation offers the quebecer government but a bond in less than the amount, initially hoped for the benefit of a viable solution to conditions to launch could, at least in the opinion from the gerüchteküche State entnehmbaren sources. 
A first action plan and a question after 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, the bittgesuch, since the revised downwards summenmäßig once again. 
A proposal, along with an action plan has been made by the President of the "Société de développement des Entreprises culturelles' - sodec - François macerola, st-pierre sent to Minister, who is leading the acts excentris. 
Several days ago, he had given her a last sachbericht. 
The gegenvorschlag of cabinet was sent to the sodec, however, on Wednesday. 
Parallèle and angus now have time to 31 December, to respond to this. 
In any case the premise of the staatsspende seems genuinely been pushed to the side. 
Let us remember that the quebecer eigentümergemeinschaft the cinema and kinokomplexe against a direct staatsinvestition in support of the takeover of excentris aufgelehnt had, by the argument on, the culture minister did not provide financial aid to immobilienprojekte there to send, which he does not have other kinosälen. 
Several other market participants of the segment, however, in contrast, substantial economic aid. 
Following the kinochef Daniel langlois had eigenfinanzierten cinema construction of the for more than ten years with great difficulties, the autorenkino presented in the premises of his kinokomplexes, which could justify the's unique position from the Treasury. 
The lack of kinosälen, the independent films show, is more than evident in Montreal, and excentris knew his clients want to keep on board. 
The Société angus and the company parallèle with Christian yaccarini at the top, taxes, for its part, a privately funded campagne, of which they hoped for a sum of 700 000$ to boost the acquisition. 
Since the spring of 2009 only a single screen so that continues to show films in excentris, namely Le parallèle. 
Aim of the future erwerber is, the three kinosäle on 27 February next year with the exhibition of the very successful film of Mr beauvois "of reopening of the dieux 'Hommes et. 
Christian yaccarini but the newspaper Le devoir 'has not removed, and you ignored what he and his group think of the proposals to the bottom respectively, which it has made them.
