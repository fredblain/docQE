Belarus is no more waffenfähiges uranium anzusammeln agree, 
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to global securing nuclear material has the Government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons. 
The deal was in a joint statement after a meeting of the Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton rodham with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei martynov in an additional articles of the sicherheitsgipfels made known. 
The US government had for years sought to convince, Belarus, not more highly enriched uranium to collect and seemed to have reached a barrier last spring. 
But the US administration official told the Washington Post that two geheimabkommen with Belarus have been taken in the last two months, to remove 187 pounds waffenfähiges uranium from a Belarusian forschungsanstalt. 
That was the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material, according to an official staff, because of the sensitivity of the issue remains anonymous, approximately 500 pounds. 
The agreement is one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear sicherheitsgipfel Of the 47 nations" had excluded from April to be that of Belarus. 
And it was obvious good enough to ensure the invitation for the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012. 
"I was really excited by the fact that they want a seat in the nuclear sicherheitsgipfel - by 2012 -." 
"That shows me that it works," said Ken luongo, President of the partnership of global security, a group to promote the nuclear safety. 
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant and important step" of Belarus. 
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009, over a period of four years to ensure all vulnerable nuclear material. 
Since then, the US government has six countries, helped to get rid of their highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus will be the seventh. 
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush. 
At the time of Obama's nuclear sicherheitsgipfel, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that the nation will never give up their uranium. 
"Keep as highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, what is essential waffenfähig, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time. 
"This is our raw material... we will not make it dirty bombs and we will not sell it." 
"We use it only for research purposes, that is all." 
Belarus 1, however, a few months ago the United States than it an agreement's interest in the meeting. 
The first attempt to remove the uranium of Belarus in October, was particularly complicated because the material easy was contaminated by radiation, official say. 
It was in a spezialzug load, the more than 1,500 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal on, say officials. 
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by air, according to the official. 
The US government will pay for this effort $14 million, with a large part of the money flows in the Belarussian research with depleted uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons. 
"This was very cautious, coordinated and to build confidence," the Agreement, which was signed by Clinton, led, said Andrew bieniawski, a representative of the energieministeriums, which is working on the global gefahrenreduzierung. 
The James Martin nichtweiterzugebende Studies Centre estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. 
Dissolve Belarus wants to be according to the common agreement camp by 2012. 
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, first of all because of lukashenkos harsh disregard for human rights. 
However, Wednesday's statement suggested a possible rapprochement. 
"The progress of these global security issues heißend welcome, the United States of America and Belarus know that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus, a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
