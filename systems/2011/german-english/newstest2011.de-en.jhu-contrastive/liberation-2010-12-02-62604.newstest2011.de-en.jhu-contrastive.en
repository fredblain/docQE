Climate: as France its finanzversprechen schönredet 
A year after the Copenhagen, it is time to compliance with the Treaty quickly dissolved finanzierungsversprechen - also known as "almost start" or premature Finance - to investigate the developing countries have been dealt with. 
And the rough French schönredereien are exposed. 
With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries have committed to allocate $30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012. 
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France - which is 420 million per year - 1.26 billion euros. 
At the opening of the cop16, the EU held all the stops in order to convince its partners from the fact their commitment with regard to the fast-start-finanzierungen: detailgetreuer, large nebenevents, broschürenverteilung vorgehensbericht of its Member States, press conference. 
The operation transparency is remarkable and extent of its real value estimated: the developing countries and the civil society would like to see all developed countries on the same präzisionsniveau made the same. 
The EU announced to have released 2.2 billion euros in the year 2010, what you are on the right way to respektbezollung brings its commitment of 7.2 billion in the year 2012. 
But if you looking into the details, things are a little more complicated. 
This money should be according to the Copenhagen treaty "new, and an additional," in order to ensure that an additional use has been tabled, without be to the detriment of the official development assistance. 
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what means "new and an additional." 
While the EU Commission had recommended a harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure. 
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark, which it regards as best. 
The EU Commission has, for example, a benchmark for those of the year 2009 for: the international finance are maintained, and is within the framework of the funding," fast-start "About 150 million for three years to do so. 
Other countries have similar guidelines, either in terms elected year or about conditions at the level of official development assistance. 
By contrast, France was of the opinion that the funding of 'new projects "in the year 2010 are" new and an additional." 
In other words, there are no guidelines on the spending of the previous year, or at the global level of official development assistance. 
In practical terms, the total value of the French support the developing countries can remain stable - or even decline - - France is pretending to comply with its commitment with regard to the "new and additional funding." 
Another key element is the breakdown in donations and loans. 
There is still not rule, and each elects its rechenmodus about it. 
Some, such as France, for example, are 1 lend _ as equivalent with 1 donated _. 
This is apparently only it is hard to support them: the effort is not comparable. 
If the use of loans for certain profitable investment - often projects that are based on effektivster technology - allied to the emissionseindämmung can be justified, it is misleading, to present the euro, and we as a word for a Euro donated... should also captured only the cost of loan for the kapitalgeberland than commitment - that is to say the equivalent of interest rate - to be counted. 
But France has nothing different in the sense than the following reasons: it '"respect its commitment of 420 million euros, making it 91,5% loans begin - 389,8 million euro - and 8.5% accorded - 36,1 million euro - -, see the EU documents in order to convince themselves. 
France is the only country of the EU that loans up on a large scale. 
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or the Slovakia - among other things - follow up their commitments to 100% with donations. 
In other words, the vast majority of the European Union 1 _ spends to meet their commitments, France just 10 cents and understands including a similar efforts. 
A hokuspokus. 
All in all, France in its fast-start-finanzierung operates with a double fraud: to be part of a weiterentwicklkung of the action at the time, and the other part with the reality of the financial contributions. 
France will be able to let it, believe that it 420 million "new and additional" has spent millions in accordance with its promise and saves it 36,1 million euros. 
The manipulation of Ministry of Finance - as it was in fact it seems that bercy to have carried out the arbitrage - could lead to a negative effect twice; even eu-intern - why the other Member States with the donations will continue, but if there is enough to lend? - and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries is not fully be fooled... 
The chapter of the premature finance only a small problem in a relatively short period of time in comparison to the whole of discussions on the climate. 
But it could be the drop too much in the scale of the unfccc machine. 
We hope that this will not be the case. 
As it always was, it is vital to its lesson to learn from this first year verfrühter finance. 
In the first place, France could announce a change in its verbuchungsart for the 2011 to 2012, and in a spirit of respect for its obligations and of the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union. 
But above all, France could make progress on the discussions on the long term streitgegenstand Finance - another, decisive and currently discussed subject -: you escapes the issue of "Not verrechenbarkeit" or the verbuchungsart of its loans. 
France could change its position, in order to be equally ahead of the curve on the disputes, as is the case for other things. 
So the hope is based on the new Environment Minister kosciusko-morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun. 
A surprising announcement on the fast-start of France and its vision of the "verrechenbarkeit" as well as the use of loans would naturally is necessary for The International Trust to raise the place for further discussion.
