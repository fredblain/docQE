Love in a time of war 
Since angelina jolie in the summer, with the work on her still nameless regiedeb端t has begun, there is trouble. 
The scenario has you have written, a liebesgeschichte between a woman from Bosnia and a Serb man. 
Not much more we know about, but even that will be enough for concern. 
The rumour persists, the woman, a Muslim, verliebe during the jugoslawien-krieges, in their Serbian rapists. 
Bosnian women's associations have protested immediately planned drehtage in Sarajevo, and some have been transferred to Hungary in the short term. 
The film marginalised in Hungary and has now, in the postproduktion, but there will still be protested in Bosnia. 
Bakira hasecic by the Organisation of female casualties on the un-fl端chtlingshilfswerk UNHCR wrote to jolie and was seeking a meeting with the actress, has now a Bosnian newspaper reported, jolie is even Ambassador of un-fl端chtlingshilfswerks. 
Diplomatic, it is not, it has offered the women only weeks before a meeting in Hungary, but what the rejected. 
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, hasecic. 
Liebesgeschichten in vergewaltigungscamps there have not been, and jolies attitude towards the victims will their enough about the scenario. 
According to the un-fl端chtlingshilfswerk, her organization has recommended that jolie as Ambassador to be released, The Guardian reported. 
What, exactly, but has jolie for scenes written? 
The Bosnian kulturministerium it scenario to read, after some up and has since granted a drehgenehmigung for Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why jolie then, nevertheless, was not. 
The jungautorin even claimed that they has no political intentions with your film, is said to be with a lot of trouble in the jugoslawien-konflikt incorporated, wanted to show the terrible consequences of war and all parties involved give a voice. 
But it is vague the content. 
So I have a second synopsis with film on the network, which then but rather different sounds: the loving knew that even before kriegsausbruch and meet again when they abducted, a Bosnian Muslim, in a Serbian camp will, in which he will work as a wake up. 
What "sounds YES but far different from the way victims of rape verknallt in folterknecht." 
That jolies film actually even before the war begins, that much is safe. 
The pressure on you, jolie, was "unfair and process is based on misinformation." 
Now she can only be nor the hackers of Hollywood peace: by the scenario, as has so many before they make, illegally put on the network.
