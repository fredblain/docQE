The army has so many zündschnüre, that it is the Czech Republic umwickeln they could keep but only two years 
The Czech Army be released 445 kilometres, purchased zündschnüre with explosives were used. 
In the year before the Defense Ministry had already 224 km zündschnur delivered to the armeelager. 
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have ausgesorgt for 225 years. 
The problem is only the span of the zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years. 
The army, bought the zündschnüre the company stv GROUP a. s. for läppische 40 million kronor. 
In his justification for the purchase of this huge amount of zündschnur said the General Staff issued mf dnes, the soldiers would each year from the 60 kilometres zündschnur use. 
According to the research of armeepyrotechnikern mf dnes point raised, it is clear from this indication that the whole army, would have a very intensive pyrotechnic training every year - all generals and officers of the armeekommandos, right up to the secretaries and putzfrauen. 
Defense Minister alexandr Vondra, and army general vlastimil picek not excluded. 
Only in this way could be significant annual consumption of 60 kilometres zündschnüren reasonably justified. 
This length calls for 25,000 detonationen. 
But even so they could armeebestände rich for more than ten years. 
But if nor the old rule of experts is that the training of any new military professionals two metres zündschnur is quite sufficient, then, by this, the army has neueinkäufe - from the point of view of the increased needs of the pionier- and special units - created a reassuring stockpile for the already mentioned, 225 years. 
However complained soldiers of the schnelleinsatzbrigade recently on Secretary of Defense Vondra, they had almost no patronen for small arms, so that schießübungen are severely restricted because of the lack of funds. 
Not to mention the unterhosenmangel. 
"Me, is also not, why they buy such quantities of zündschnüre from us." 
But this is your final decision, they are already know what they need to." 
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we, as traders largely contrary to want to come," says the vertriebsmanager stv group Jan děcký. 
Jan pejšek, the Defense Department spokesman justified the procurement of hundreds of kilometres of zündschnur so that the army has been so for at least ten years with this," eingedeckt ammunition." 
Jan děcký talks of the stv group but only by a four years of gebrauchsdauer zündschnüre and police and armeepyrotechniker even only in two years' time. 
The four mentioned years possible "with perfect storage are likely," puts one of them, but wants to remain ungenannt in order not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier. 
At the end of the gebrauchsdauer any weapons must be thoroughly tested, whether it is reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers. 
But these tests are not in vain, but cost more money. 
Another argument in the Defense Department is the mengenrabatt for the 445 kilometres zündschnur. 
"It cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 244 miles," the spokesman pejšek tells us the position of the einkäufer of the Defense Department. 
Only for comparison, the annual consumption of zündschnüren pyrotechnikern the police, the ammunition in the Second World War, or the Soviet bruderarmee withdraw, even for a number of years hardly exceeds 1500 metres. 
And the police only ever ordered such quantities of these weapons, which it before the end of the gebrauchsdauer can use. 
The security is already the pyrotechniker because of, it is also the opportunity to flexible purchases more advanced and therefore reliable zündschnüre open. 
The Defense Ministry has already massive problems for the liquidation tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition in times of the Warsaw treaty, when the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak prepared People's Army in its campaign on the Rhine. 
According to the pyrotechnikern mf dnes raised, expected the Czech armed forces in a few years, the same problem in the liquidierung of hundreds of kilometres of old zündschnüre, which she has purchased today as "good."
