450 million in treaties without tender 
In mutual agreement has hydro-québec projektplanungsfirmen 450 million dollars in contracts for the wasserkraftprojekt eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert approved. 
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 treaties a consortium, consisting of the firms, bpr Dessau, Groupe sm and axor, that the most important proportion, namely that of projektleitung, to a sum of $295 million without invitation to tender has received. 
This consortium, known as the 'énergie gérance', 2004 as a corollary of the decision of hydro-québec their responsibility, the private sector, this important, hydroelektrische project to the tune of a sum of $5 billion to future generations, is being set up. 
At the beginning of 2005 ergatterte the consortium 'énergie gérance "the lucrative treaty, without that there had been a public invitation to tender. 
For the Parti québécois is resorting to unternehmenskonsortien a serious ethical problem, the risk of wettbewerbsverdrändung and an increase in the making. 
"This is a new way of a conspiracy and refutes the competition." 
'This means that instead of conventional games rather than on secret way now in an open form is carrying out', said yesterday, a Member of the PQ Sylvain simard, at the press conference. 
In the early morning simard had raised the question before the French National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand him as the interest of the public in this way can be used. 
Ressourcenministerin Nathalie normandeau had reacted in the afternoon, by was vehemently deny that this Treaty is a stitch-up would have acted. 
"I am sticking to my line," they raged by you confirmed, the PQ was "dishonest 'and' an absence of rigour '. 
She said that it was the least 'that the PQ is sorry. 
The model of the consortium is the world standard practice. 
It is usually at a time of such temporary alliance that it two or more companies their expertise in terms of a requirement for a tender for a complex project. 
The project 'eastmain' has a high komplexitätsniveau with regard to his arbeitsausmaßes. 
The bauverfahren is in progress and is to be drawn up until 2012. 
However, the Treaty has been missed, without that had a competition can take place; it had already negotiations. 
Furthermore, the model of the consortium in Quebec, with relatively simple projects by no means an exception. 
As the newspaper 'Le devoir' last week has pointed out, is that in the area of bauingenieur- and beratungswesens applied model of the consortium subject of regierungsermittlungen. 
A brief overflying the quebecer unternehmensregisters allows, more than 200 consortia to nominate, some of which of consistent duration appear to be. 
In this way, for example, the company Dessau working in partnership with the majority of its kernkonkurrenten to which Cima +, génivar, snc-lavalin or Roche and tecsult count, together. 
Any link, and there are several dozen, leads to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau. 
What the consortium 'énergie gérance', that was Minister normandeau stresses that 'the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special arbeitskräftedynamik hydro-québec this fact and that since the 1970s, in a special way, however, take into account'. 
Réal laporte, the major employers of Société d 'énergie de la Baie James (sebj), has made a statement, the Fed has to be on the fact that the Treaty on the projektleitung after agreement was approved. 
'If you an invitation to tender power and it only a few candidates, there is your prices soar. " 
"You are, therefore, two possibilities: either you nimmst the people on this Mart and you are saying: it will be a satisfactory agreement on a good price negotiate." 
"the idea, however, is that not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," reaffirmed laporte. 
This the consortium 'énergie gérance' approved Treaty is part of a long list of contracts on more than 50,000 of the Parti québécois received dollar. 
The Treaties have been from either the hydro-québec or the sebj eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert approved for the project. 
After review was the newspaper 'Le devoir "more than 100 ingenieurs- and beraterverträge, the companies or their branches, including in particular ressourcenlabors, between 2002 and March 2010 have been granted. 
Snc-lavalin had 22 treaties in itself, gerafft génivar had received 14 and 16, tecsult Dessau 10, without their participation in this' énergie gérance 'counting. 
All these agreements have been negotiated. 
They amount in the entire on 449 783 344 $, including the Treaty with "énergie gérance" on 295 131 564 $. 
Sylvain simard had indicated that the four firms, which form the consortium (bpr, Dessau, Groupe sm and axor) of the "Parti libéral you Québec, well known." 
Minister normandeau, had the PQ is equally with the firms that they "financed ', before you specify that it is, in fact, its managers.
