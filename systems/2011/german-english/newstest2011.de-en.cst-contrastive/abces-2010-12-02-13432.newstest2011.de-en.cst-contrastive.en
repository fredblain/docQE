People's Party won seats in the Congress to 4 and PSC lost 9 
With the results of 28 November could the PP Lérida in the cities, Tarragona play a decisive role and Barcelona 
After the major stimmen- and abgeordnetenzuwachs in the recent regional elections is the PP their view already on the parliamentary - or not preferred. Their expectations are more than positive, because the votes, the this party in these elections, is normally twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia. 
So, the Catalan people's party 610.473 vote in the parliamentary elections of 2008, during this paragraph in the regional elections in 2006 only 316.222 fraud. 
Last Sunday the PPC reached 384.091 votes. 
If this rising trend - outcome of the diversion cut rich-country voting shares at the PSC and the pegging of the electorate of the PP - should continue, predict the analysts of the PP that in the parliamentary elections the PPC from 8 to 12 Members could rise, while also ciu four (it has now 10) before and the PSC at least 9 members (of 25) would lose. 
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE. 
According to the analysis of the People's Party would lose the ERC a Member - currently it has three - while icv their Members or a gain much could keep. 
However, the wahlkalender should be maintained, and the next deadline with the local elections in the May 2011. Also then can the People's Party (PP) the voice of the balance of the Socialist domination, in order to put an end, in four provinzhauptstädten and with its majority in the City Council emblematic, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euro for 2011. 
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree, the PSC the towns of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists neither a majority still on its traditional allies (ERC and icv) can make use, will lose. 
After the Republican debacle is it not absurd that this party their representation in the town council emblematic in which they should reach 5% of the vote, will lose. 
On the other hand, the PP recorded an increase in their stimmenanteils in the four provinzhauptstädten and could to the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona. 
The nationalists are convinced that the major role to play in tarragonas turnaround. There they had before the current mayor, Josep Félix ballesteros, together with the PP governed. 
En Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the recent election campaign you met several times. 
Also in other important areas, such as, for example, in badalona castelldefels or reus, the People's Party was a significant growth. 
Currently, the PP represented in 34 municipalities of Catalonia, and they are seeking the education of lists in so many places as possible.
