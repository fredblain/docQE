The Argentines with the coin has played up to the second champion, he is a step lagged behind the victors and, amazingly, he has fought with the same team consecutive endspiele. 
The santistische strategist, the first end game as coach in the 'torneo apertura 2002', as del morelia the reins in the hand, with which he had against toluca with 4-2 learned a great defeat; later, at the 'clausura 2003' he reached the crucial match that he also with 3-1 against rayados lost.
