The eis-universität 
In the 'gelato university' in Bologna eiskonditoren seasons, be better prepared. 
The three days grundkurs for future gelatieri has the biggest gain and visitors from around the world. 
What is actually the whole ice? 
The gelatiere and the gelataio. 
The gelatiere, a little old-fashioned the eiskonditor in German, is the cream after all the rules of the Italian eismacherkunst. 
The gelataio is catching up with a spachtel the ice cream from the kühltheke, it abolishes in the waffel and selling them then. 
In order to know, we must not after anzola Dell 'Emilia in the province of Bologna. 
But anyone who would like to know more about ice, which is not in the 'gelato-university' the Italian firm carpigiani over. 
The eis-universität, the manufacturers of eismaschinen set up in the year 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines everywhere the high Italian ideals. 
The three days grundkurs for future gelatieri has the biggest gain and visitors from around the world. 
But there are also mehrtägige spezialkurse around the schokoladeneis and internships in the hauseigenen eisdiele. 
Some in the midlife-crisis is dreaming of a new career, other venture simply time on the treacherous ice their vague aspirations. 
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries, from all continents - of Brazil on Hungary to Saudi Arabia. 
, Jacky kunstlehrer from California, loves the slow-food-bewegung and will in future in the country of the industrial ice-cream a European quality product. 
Anke from Berlin is unternehmensberaterin and wants after years in a nervenaufreibenden job a little own eintüten. 
Two young ägypterinnen dream in Cairo to open a eisdiele. 
A man from Malta and one from Brazil, the quality of the ice cream in their bars improve - and the Canadian housewife Yulia, because their children Italian ice cream love. 
Maestro-gelatiere Luciano Ferrari declared the first participants, the ideal characteristics of perfect ice cream. 
What is crucial is not only good taste, but also the seidige geschmeidigkeit and the good consistency. 
Luciano forgets in its training but also not the icing on the cake of the national and even südländischen überbaus: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still plenty of romanticism." 
The first step to manufacture seems quite simple. 
Luciano dump the grundzutaten milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilisers in a major mixgerät, with an electronic programme everything to 85 degree inflamed passions and then immediately to four degrees are cooling. 
Then he is of the machine a tap on, and out is a pasteurisierte White basiscreme, basis for all milcheissorten. 
Will the lecturer immediately with questions bestürmt ice cream: we can only with natural substances without stabiliser? 
How can we allow the own experimentierlust free? 
Luciano warns that spirit to be fooled. 
Those of ice cream 'only from natural ingredients' speech, has probably still stabilisers used - usually a natural product, for example from the guarbohne guarkernmehl. 
We cannot, of course, also without ice stabiliser, only it must then be sold within one day, otherwise it sackt in together, and the customer to bite eiskörnchen louder. 
Certain variations in the grundmasse are allowed. 
It will be more exciting with the flavourings. 
For the taste in the ice Maestro Luciano between the different ingredients, which you obst-abteilung or in the sweets of the supermarket are buying. 
Moreover, there are powder and pasten. 
"The suppliers are all try to foist onto you dozens of aromatised additions." 
"But you should simply time to experiment." 
Either in the fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruits. 
Or just in the ice cream from the White grundmasse, the with eggs to yellow flower will and with kakaopulver on the basis for all possible schokoladen-verführungen. 
Now the kursteilnehmer to the eismaschinen. 
Luciano leaves they each four different types of vanille-, schokolade-, mokka- and produce haselnuss-eis - with or without eggs in the grundmasse, with more or less vanillearoma or other natural additives. 
The same experiment will also be subject to the fruchteissorten. 
More flavourings, more frucht-püree -; it will not necessarily be better. 
Not necessarily nussiger haselnuss-eis tastes, if it contains more hazelnuts. 
The most popular kiwi-eis, the working group, which used more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser. 
Only a balanced mix will highlight the taste of a gelato clear says Luciano. 
Eisherstellung is a rechenaufgabe: will pfirsich-püree with much sugar used in the sugar grundrezept, must be reduced. 
For zitroneneis is a extraportion sugar necessary. 
Luciano prefers a device, with which he the sugar content of the determined fruchtsorten (wine growers measure so that the oechsle in grape musts). 
Fortunately, facilitate the rechnerei tables. 
To make ice requires not more so much physical use as before. 
Not only the equipment for the automatic manufacture the grundmasse helps. 
There is also a device, which at the same time the ready-made eis-mischung cremig beaten and on minustemperaturen kept cool. 
Despite all the computerized remain small breakdowns. 
The Brazilians Gustavo acquitted itself and its kurskollegen from top to bottom, with fruchtpüree than him the überdimensionale hand blenders spiral out of control. 
"in each course," says Maestro Luciano, 'it is only a matter of time before that happens. "
