What can you do, the čssd? the Czech social democrats in Prague know neither voldemort, nor the "konditorei." 
The new ratsherren the capital from the ranks of the čssd will obviously certain language barriers, have to overcome their alt-neuen colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and in the stadtvertretung able to understand at all. 
The newspaper has aktuálně.cz members of the new Council from the čssd time a little 'abgeklopft', as they dominate the notorious slang, over the past few years has become established, in which the current coalition partners in Prague at the helm. 
The encoded vocabulary, the in the verflossenen era of Lord Mayor Pavel bém of the Prague political elite was introduced, is some of the most prominent players, situations and causae entlehnt. 
Surprisingly, the new councils in relation to these new concepts of something in the dark. 
The claim they at least. 
"who is voldemort?" 
'No idea. " 
'I am a newcomer to the Prague policy', responded lukáš kaucký, the new ratsherr on culture, on the test of the "paten-wortschatzes." 
But also the ratsherr Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way. 
For example, on the concept of 'golfloch. " 
"That is the only expression of which, I am here to present to you, which I use and again." 
"otherwise, I believe that not much often infiltrated by slang." 
From the vocabulary of the tageblatt aktuálně.cz in this year's June before the wahlkongress the ODS had published, pickte the editors six concepts, especially those that are notoriously with the Prague Government. 
The Social Democrats should the terms' voldemort ',' greatest Prague golfloch ',' in the konditorei go ',' stiernacken, "" betrayal of capital 'and' verblechen "define. 
Three Prague ratsherren agreed to the test, the fourth - Mr weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised firstly of its participation in the discussion, but then not time the listeners. 
The fifth ratsherr, Petr dolínek, rejected the test in from the outset. 
I do not care 'these things are and how the Civic Democrats with each other, about judgments I not. " 
'What is important to me, as we understand our programmes, "he made. 
As has already been indicated, would have lukáš kaucký in the aforementioned headline allegedly not realised that the influential entrepreneurs and friend of the ex-oberbürgermeisters bém, Roman janoušek. 
The term 'voldemort kaucky "says absolutely nothing, and the only one that he was correct erriet on the test," the greatest Prague golfloch. " 
"That is the tunnel blanka," says kaucký, added to the security but still: 'but I know more in the newspaper'. 
And jokingly: "I will be a sprachkurs show must." 
The "golfloch" will then not only of matador Karel Březina, but also by the ratsherrn on the Environment lukáš plachý appropriate as a tunnel blanka entziffert. 
Both Social Democrats also know, however, for whom the term voldemort lukáš plachý senses and even, where this figure is to be found, and also, what it means is that "in the konditorei to go." 
"I believe, that is to say, in any Prague gastronomiebetrieb ', is to go plachý quite close to the conundrum hit solution, when we know that this is the seat of janoušeks firms. 
In line with Březina claimed it but, this knowledge in the papers drawn strength rather than to have him this vocabulary board would be. 
Judging by the testteilnehmern under the Social Democrats, it seems, in fact, no similar eingebürgerten slang. 
'I have also asked my colleagues, but obviously there are we really not. " 
"We call on us in the name and again we also use words or nicknamed ', says the chairman of the Prague čssd Petr hulínský - of his party colleague, casual" hulda'. 
'in the school was I bříza (birke) mentioned, but I do not know whether I am also my fellow Members call', tells us Karel Březina his nicknamed. 
The newspaper deník aktuálně.cz has tried and see as - he works. 
Ratsherr weinert is for the party colleague, enough of the "OPA 'or less friendly of the' old ', the representative Miroslav poche before the elections by activity in the partei-sponsoring vocal, some colleagues' igráček" (known Czech lego-figur). 
Nicknamed are as the only one that the Social Democrats in the whose language. 
It may not hulínský supposedly if it is "hulda ', but deník aktuálně.cz registered a other nicknamed the Prague chairman. 
His nickname 'doctor of the gummiknüppel-rechte supposedly "has to do with the fact that Petr hulínský its title doctor Juris to the bratislaver police college has acquired.
