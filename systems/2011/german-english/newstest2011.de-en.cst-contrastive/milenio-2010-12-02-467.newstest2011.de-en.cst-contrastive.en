China does its targets to reduce greenhouse gases maintain 
The representatives of China said at the COP16, his country have enormous efforts being made to reduce the kohlenstoffspuren supply and it would be maintained until 2020, 40 to 45% of its greenhouse gases. 
China does his offer the emission of greenhouse gases by the year 2020 by 40 to 45%, assured us Su Wei, the representatives of this country on the COP16. 
In his first appearance in the 16 world climate summit of the United Nations (COP16) assured Su Wei, his country would have enormous efforts to lower the kohlenstoffspuren and the conversion of its industry. 
He said that in the last four years of his country 245 million dollars, in order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. 
On the other hand, he declared that China would not change its objectives but, together with the international community in this matter would work. 
He stated that the Chinese strategy on climate change in four aspects unterteile: dialogue, capacity-building, institution building and support of pilot programmes. 
In all the aspects we have made progress, including the adoption of a new energiegesetzes last year, the objectives relating to the reduction of emissions of gases delivers, he said. 
On the other hand, it reveals that, in China, the authorities of the Federal States with those of the zentralstaats and the communities working together the targets for energy saving, the efficient use of energy and to achieve the reduction of emissions. 
He has also, are already some multiannual plans in or have been concluded, both those who have been financed by the Chinese Government, as well as such, the money received by other countries. 
For example, he was referring to the programme for the effective use of energy, in the last five years was introduced and investment of the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands. 
It is also a project on provincial level on climate change, a further exchange of the traditional incandescent light bulbs by energiesparbirnen and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said. 
Martin krol, scientific regierungsberater on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts are far greater than is commonly believed. 
It showed that the pro-kopf-emission of greenhouse gases in China six tonnes per person betrage, while in the United States are 100 tonnes. China is for a neunprozentigen total contribution to environmental pollution. 
Just do it unprecedented progress in the area of energy use. The energiewirksamkeit has been in the last five years and increased by 20% by the year 2020 is another, he said.
