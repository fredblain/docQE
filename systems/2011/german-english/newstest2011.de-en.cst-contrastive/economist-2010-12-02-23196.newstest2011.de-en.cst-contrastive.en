Weak applause for China 
Taiwan's voters are slowly closer connection to the mainland. 
What does Taiwan of its big brother across the straits? 
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the electorate, in order in the five city mayors and councillors. This is as broad evaluation of the President Ma Ying-jeou. 
The creation of a partial einschl. cutting-edge business contacts, Ma itself free trade agreement, is a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland. Its policy has the relationship with the Chinese Motherland, for the first time since 1949 lasting changes. 
Ma has the tests, but only just. 
Although his Kuomintang Party was split (KMT) three of the five mayor, it received no majority. 
Instead, the democratic fortschrittspartei (DPP), the greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the vote, the KMT was 45%. 
In a presidential election, this would have for Ma problems means. 
Since his election two years ago is the part of his party by around 8%. 
For the first time, the DPP even together with the KMT in town councils. 
During the election, there was the usual cases like convoys of lorries in Taiwan, with krawallmachern flaggen-schwenkende massenumzüge and sparse dancers, broke ranks. 
There were even the compulsory, mysterious mordversuch. 
Sean LIEN, the son of Lien Chan and ehrenvorsitzender the KMT, on the eve of the election a speech to a kmt-kandidaten, 
As a man from the amount in the face of fold. LIEN was a umstehender viewers killed and wounded. 
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter LIEN kill or a dispute with the candidates wanted to resolve. 
Regardless of the attack has tsai ing-wen according to the leader of the DPP, the election affected and the DPP in a bad light, what the KMT has provided more votes. 
China was perhaps the biggest winners of the campaign. 
Remarkably, the relations with the mainland was not raised. 
Instead, the candidates debated on plans to social housing and the creation of jobs. 
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's militärbedrohung. 
This is why the KMT their relations with the government in Beijing in the forefront. 
But this time, also avoided the DPP, the anti-Chinese feelings too much. 
You responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy without China cannot survive. 
Ma, for its part, would like to confirm that the majority of the Taiwanese his China policy. 
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy, Taiwan, with economic incentives to attract the Community. 
China sent a negotiators immediately after Taipei, at a summit on security of investment and medical cooperation. 
Certainly, it also wants a political integration, but the most important first. 
It is so dear to the 2012 presidential election. 
The DPP is now reinvented. 
Two years ago, it was severely weakened: the former party leader, Chen Shui-bian was sitting in prison for corruption. 
During its Presidency, between 2000 and 2008, he was strongly for the absolute independence. 
But under tais reign spans developed into a new generation gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the professionals and the young. 
As a presidential candidate, Mrs tsai was the DPP huge agreement, like Su tseng-chang under Chen. 
Your party is doing everything now, in order to show that it is in a position to establish close relations with Beijing. 
Tsai is planning a ideenschmiede as a contact point between the DPP and China. This, however, presupposes open-minded discussion. 
Tsai stated publicly that your party a "trustworthy alternative 'offer to MAS vorschneller approach to China. 
Chen seems very annoyed about this change. 
From his he declared that the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence. 
He called for the pragmatists Su even, to run for president. 
Even without Chen's interference does the DPP difficult, their possible candidates to choose. 
The KMT will need to undergo a own selbstanalyse. 
MAS values are poor, in spite of the rapid economic growth; the kmt-kandidaten wanted to lead their campaign without him. 
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor. 
According to a statement of a kmt-sprechers it will be cabinet and the local institutions. 
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is a rapprochement, only restricted. 
At the same time, most of the Taiwanese people see the economic cooperation with China as inevitable. 
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnists, "there is already a point of no return '.
