Police action in China will be soft 
As a ausbildungsoffizier step Tang shenbin on an urban place, revised its nervous subordinates and gave it with military authority and gedämpfter voice orders. 
He wanted, that its female members of the chengguan - China's robust of urban order, feared and contempt for their arbitrary raids and their tendency to violence - the viewers. 
"are! ' 
'Look front!' 
"shows you ', he flüsterte to them,' How nice girls as are! ' 
Four girls, hardly the teenager-alter age, with white gloves and identical olivegrünen jacken and trousers were staunchly. 
Four few black pumps were in gerader number. 
Four proper hats were perfect with blau-weiß gestreiften held its hair. 
'for me, you see, on average, from', says Mr Tang dismissive remarks. 
"models are pretty." 
Several governments have already tried, the image of China's stadtinspektoren polishing. 
In a city must all new applicants have a university degree. 
The Guangdong province, instead of the graugrünen a leuchtend blue uniforms. 
Violence in mittel-china wuhan replaced by niederstarren: 2009 umkreisten according to reports, a 50 officials not properly established and imbisswagen gaze at the operators, by this after half an hour einpackte and left the room. 
Xindu, a stadtbezirk in Chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants, would like to fundamentally change the image. 
Since 2003, strengthen 13 women the urban polizeistreifen. They have been specific because of their appearance, their good figure and their young people chosen. 
They should crude police a softer, femininen aspect. 
Unfortunately, however, it would also be very difficult scarlett johansson, the bad image that the Chinese of these stadtkommandos have, to improve. 
With the right to do so, the critics. 
Unlike the police, must these civil servants of the urban laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties. 
But the Chinese media routinely a different picture. 
In January 2008 beat officials in the province of authorized a spectator to death, as this it with his mobile phone here, filming them as a protest against a dustbin still. 
Last year was a schulungshandbuch the Beijing officials stolen and published on the Internet, it is described as criminals can be beaten up without bloodshed. 
In this year suffered a Shanghai wassermelonenhändler after a handgemenge with five officials gehirnverletzungen. 
A from violence strotzendes videogame that can be downloaded from the Internet, shows in China trained officials in an attack on straßenhändler. 
"fear" chengguan power of the government, the national newspaper lamentierte China daily in the last year, after further controversy regarding the tactics. 
The newspaper called a "really thorough cleansing '. 
The current approach for sceptics are clearly inadequate. 
As the distrik in October by display eight female recruits, was an editorial in the Beijing evening news, the question whether the women real tasks, or only as optical distraction. 
Probably both. 
According to the vacancy notice women were at the age of 18 to 22 with good figure and "harmonious looking like '. 
They should be - on average 1,5m or 5 foot, 2 1 / 2 customs. 
The employment ends with reach the 26 birthday. 
According to the officials is the activity for women on 25 physically to demanding. 
'the most important thing is their image, "was a unbenannter distriktbeamter in the almost regierungs-webseite rednet.com. 
Whether the candidates' get the job depends, first from their appearance, as size, weight, gesichtszüge, etc. ' 
Then come temperament and 'internal qualities'. 
"female chengguan are as put," he said, and added, "but they also have other obligations'. 
Zheng lihua, deputy head of the City Council of the distrikts, would not agree with this description, 
But made to that in China größenvorgaben advertisements for both sexes are not unusual. 
The same applies to steady gesichtszüge. 
Whether this is synonymous with good look like in China, is controversial. 
But people with disabilities or physical corruptions need not to apply. 
"We can do here, unfortunately, not a lame or buckligen use ', as Mr Zheng. 
"their image would not be good." 
Liu Yi, at the close of a monastery baoguang-platz patroliert, is 22, has apfelbäckchen and a well geformten mouths. 
They empfindetes not as a sexist that such great store by your appearance. 
"you, I see in this uniform sexy?" asks you with ironischem view. 
With the grübchen your colleague, the 21-jährige Xu Yang, comments, "we have the task, the image of the city to represent." 
You say that you regret the brief attitude is not, as it could have been more ambitious karrierepläne than simply by the alleys traders to scheuchen on business, in order to prevent them. 
Every morning deals the some remarks with some 12 straßenhändler trying to foot or on the bicycle as many as possible to sell rolls and tofugerichte fortgejagt before you. 
'Mr Wang, disappear, here you please. " 
"We have them already said so often," declared frl. Xu a trader who have fled to foot was his on a fahrradkarre befestigten nudelküche temporarily in the lurch. 
According to the civil servants is the activity rather monotonous as demanding. 
"It is almost every day," says the same Huang Jing, 20, the recreational vertriebswesen studied. 
'Everything routine. " 
One reason for this is that the women officials the were the traders not, as their male colleagues, must confiscate. 
You can only criminals, they threaten their male superiors to report. 
This is to protect them from public harassment, which often suffer civil servants in China. 
In this year rioted outside hundreds of inhabitants of, Kunming,, the capital of Yunnan province, after the rumour stock-market boom, chengguan-beamte would have a traders killed. 
More than a dozen policemen and chenguan-beamte were injured in the night of the incident, 14 regierungsfahrzeuge upset or have been set on fire. 
Xindu remained of such violent incidents have so far been spared. 
But riots are not carried out. 
Only two blocks away from the calm baonguang-platz, on which the female officials this morning, patroulierten gathered on 50 people on a street corner. 
Officials had a motorcycle confiscated, contrary to the rules on the pavement rather than in a workshop was repaired. 
The owner cried screamed blue murder. 
After 15-minütigem hesitate bahnten the officials with cruel face the way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner. 
Li xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male some remarks, remained. It was he refers to in order to be namensschild in order to remain anonymous. 
As your colleagues to play the coordinators - men over 40 - purely a supporting role. 
But they have not been trained to present a clean image. 
"sometimes go before we verbally." 
"but also often physically," says Mr Li well-balanced. 
Most of the time, 'people are with the dispute. "
