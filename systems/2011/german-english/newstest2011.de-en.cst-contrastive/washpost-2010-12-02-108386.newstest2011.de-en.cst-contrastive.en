Can combine courtesy that divides us? 
After a campaign to schimpfwörtern and negativity is this week little courtesy in Washington has erupted. 
It is the sign of a real zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion, before we quickly to the fight of the parties in the capital return? 
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and levels of the Congress produced no breakthrough in the major issues, be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck" session, the meeting at the end of a government's policy, in which no more decisions are taken. 
After all the accounts, it was neither a polite debate between two different sides still a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan punktesammelns. 
The public meetings of the deficit Commission of the President on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences between the members continue to exist. 
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months can give a mutual respect, of the ideological divide that continue to the Members divides, hushed up. 
It is not enough to say that it was a new era of cooperation here. 
Both sides are now in a test phase - in the one from the other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise, while claiming even tried to the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters for a renewed parteienkriegsführung arbitration. 
This was why the meeting on Tuesday itself, and its assessment by the participants on a minimum requirements or accusations limited. 
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to be a rapid change the atmosphere in the last two years, which prevailed might expect. 
Regardless of whether it with taxes, donations, health or benefits is that the two sides are miles away from each other. 
Lastly, the novemberwahl Washington, at least for a short time bribed. 
'No question, the tone has changed, "said pete wehner, an official representatives of the Bush administration, the now for the' ethics and public policy center" works. 
"that is after elections inevitable. 
Elections give partisan passions that die again. 
And that is a good thing. " 
In some issues, particularly in those that are on the agenda of the "lame duck" session are Republicans and Democrats, have no other choice than to find a solution. " 
Bush's tax cuts to an end at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that. 
Both sides want to find a way to receive some or all, whether it is temporarily or permanently. 
Similarly, a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits to expect, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that people think that the recommendation that tax cuts for the rich, while they refuse to unemployed workers a support. 
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House is the optimism has risen, that it is in these issues during the "lame duck session 'some and also, at the same time, the New START Treaty, cannot ratify. 
But William glaston of the Brookings insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of lame duck session 'does not necessarily to a lasting cooperation between the parties must lead, if the new 112. Congress in January will convene. 
Instead, he says, is a phase of the nichtübereinstimmens more likely, perhaps even inevitable. 
"after the things that have to be done is done, will turn this short-term psychology in confrontation," he said. 
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many, the courtesy to real cooperation. 
"I see much of what is happening today in by 2012, as vorkampf, or further shadow boxing, for the hauptereignis from 2012," he said. 
The reasons for this have much with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House, and to do it with the teeparty-wählern who were instrumental in their education. 
How worried about the Republican leaders also may be that they too high poker, you know that you have to try their promise to reduce the expenditure of the government and health-care reform, to be adhered to. 
These parteilinien are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the deficit Commission clear how a tax reform and the raising of certain taxes, as well as the raising of the retirement age and the lowering of government spending. 
The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have adopted, in accordance with their own assessment, so very pressed the defizitfrage on the public agenda that these could no longer be ignored. 
But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes to its plan to official recommendation and to make you fight very even in the vicinity of this number. 
The greatest resistance will take place in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters, today at least, little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises. 
Galston says two stages in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress. 
The first fight will next year in the form of parteizusammenstößen take place, if the Republicans Obama in terms of the budget, the taxes and of the health system, then followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation. 
What will lead to this change? 
Public opinion. 
It has been proved that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties work together. 
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as has happened in 1995, then both sides must carefully on the public reaction. 
Whoever is condemned to lose, will change the course and the compromise must seek. 
This may in fact be an optimistic view. 
Partiality and polarisation today are greater than in the middle of the 1990's, and they seem a more ideological divide between Obama and the kongress-republikanern than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. 
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a far wider choice of consistency 2012. 
So it may be the courtesy, the this week for the display of many Americans, will be welcomed. 
But it will on both sides very much more effort, require a common denominator in the questions, the two still separated.
