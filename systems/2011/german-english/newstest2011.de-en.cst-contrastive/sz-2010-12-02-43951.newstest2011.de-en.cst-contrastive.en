Erdarbeiten Puzzle 
The Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria. 
The country, but to take a view on this - nor is it controls. 
Against midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007 I at least four Israeli F-15 fighter planes a mysteriöses, würfelförmiges buildings in Syria. 
It is on the banks of the Tigris; the next major city, 30 kilometres away, is dair as-saur. 
Your name comes up in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on when it comes to the reactor is that Syria supposedly with aid from North Korea in the quader has built, hidden in a valley, that of the electricity. 
According to a briefing of the us-auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA by the end of April 2008 would be the also under the name of the middle town el-kibar normal reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which to build nuclear weapons. 
For other purposes against the technology from the fifties hardly. 
The CIA has led a videopräsentation before with by means of fuzzy satellitenbildern. 
By computeranimation blendete you a, where the components of the reactor before the destruction have been, of a fell copy of the North Korean model from the atomzentrum Yongbyon. 
In addition, it presented photographs in the building, from the vicinity show or even the innenraum. 
The reactor is just before the beginning of the operation, it was said, but not yet with brennstäben have been drawn up. 
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more than it was then, yes the mystery were in time, a greater. 
The former US President George W. Bush has recently in his memoirs, reveals that the CIA before the attack in fairly sure was that Syria in el-kibar a reactor built, but little evidence that saw it in the country's nuclear weapons programme 'active'. 
Some intelligence officers in Europe there are rather more cautious, and yet only talk of a 'alleged reactor', even if the cia-präsentation for "plausible '. 
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. 
Asked how sure he was a reactor, to have a high un-diplomat, replied in the summer, the IAEA have only flat "enough material to ask questions'. 
The rubble of the alleged "unused militärgebäudes" surpassed the Syrians are in a hurry to one side and planierten the terrain thoroughly. 
Nevertheless, took place in June 2008 a iaea-team under the former chief inspector Olli heinonen in el-kibar traces of uranium, which had been produced by people. 
In addition, the IAEA on a Member State satellite pictures provide commercial operators from the period immediately after the attack, which should be more significant than that presented by the CIA. 
These, however, are starting to get on the market, not because of the unknown contracting authorities - perhaps Israel - it has bought exclusively. 
The IAEA can therefore verify their authenticity not independent. 
Syria has always claimed that never a secret nuclear program farms or a reactor to have built. 
The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, declared Damascus. 
But the, the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely. 
Since then refuses Damascus, debate on this - as well as on the satellite pictures provide. 
It also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the rubble of zerbombten building. 
But Israel remains silent pugnaciously. 
"We will comment on the never ', confirmed recently the at the time of the attack acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position. 
So on the investigation of the case since June 2008 and fruitless "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority ', as a high Western diplomat in the seat of the IAEA in Vienna gives - after all, it is a serious breach of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area on which the IAEA watchdog. 
As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA appear to be three more bodies, the "in functional link 'with the alleged reactor are should - and other than this still exist. 
The inspectors have so far not disclosed, at which it is that is still what role they have or what they seem suspicious. 
According to information edition of the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they will be in the IAEA internally as marj as-sultan masyaf iskandariayah described, and that, in turn, are derived from nearby towns. 
The independent institute for science and international security in Washington (ISIS advises) has identified and that these places on satellitenbildern a gebäudekomplex in masyaf tracked down, which is probably one of the suspects objects. 
It is probably in or directly, in addition to a military base - precisely with this explanatory statement Syria the IAEA are denied access to the three places. 
In Vienna, it says the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA of the United States will vorgeschickt auszuspähen military equipment. 
Because the nukleardetektive were by a piece of advice of the US intelligence services attention has been drawn to the institutions. 
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos that between the three places and the quader on Euphrates material hertransportiert back and forth. 
A high Western diplomat in Vienna has said, at least one of the installations could 'in connection with the brennstoffproduktion'. 
There is, however, 'no indications of sensitive activities', in other words, uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes to the construction of nuclear weapons are necessary. 
The type of reactor will be pursued with uranium, which is not supplemented. 
But where the uranium would have should come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated, on these central issues there are at best plausible guesswork. 
It is also unclear whether debris, the valuable traces might bring, to the three places have been stored. 
As if the hundreds of stands of disappeared from the face of the earth, no one wants to have any information as to where the rubble. 
The only a few kilometres from el-kibar on the other side of the Tigris, salzmine al-tibni, the Syria 1998 to their suitability as camps for radioactive waste, the IAEA has investigated as unlikely. 
The former iaea-inspektor Robert kelley it had in a recent analysis of satellitenbildern for the renowned magazine Jane's intelligence review with the reactor. 
Starting from the orbit show, however, that Syria to the three suspects places erdarbeiten untouched and large container distant, after the IAEA access had requested. 
This can hardly be a coincidence, but has helped to dispel the suspicion. 
It also means the IAEA in diplomats, have spent many months, a plan for inspections there, to develop the it Syria should allow any military secrets to real, the burden alone shows how great the interest of the inspectors. 
Also, however, Damascus bügelte this proposal. 
Western diplomats in Vienna had a year ago have been allayed, the reactor was destroyed, therefore, the matter no high urgency, brings about US Ambassador Mr Davies for a couple of months ago so-called sonder-inspektionen into play, one of the strongest means that the Vienna atombehörde has to controls. 
Iaea-chef yukiya Amano, of these inspections should propose, has already of "an option, for which I am open in the future ', but then it is dragging its feet. 
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it needs a majority in the Board of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented there are anything other than eager to an escalation. 
On the other hand, as a diplomat to are concerns: "What if they find nothing in the end? '
