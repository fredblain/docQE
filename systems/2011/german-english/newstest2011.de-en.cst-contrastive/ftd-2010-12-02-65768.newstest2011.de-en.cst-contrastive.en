Ogoniland is burnt down 
The water in rivers is ölbraun, it looks like in the petrol station ausgelaufenes: billion litres of crude oil have nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland destroyed. 
The people of theft, corruption and illegal ölkochen. 
Celestine akpobari means well. 
"haunts you not 'reassured the ökoaktivist journalists:" You'll still enough oily slime before the lens through which wars. " 
The 37-year-old Nigerians who has followed the attempt, a until the chest in water watenden young with the around it schlieren abzulichten: in the regenbogenfarbenen wasserglanz is the scene almost function. 
That, beneath the surface, Brown rohölschwaden, is not to see. 
Here you have previously eimerweise shrimps collected, told Esther badom on the shores of bodo-jetty-flusses. 
Now is the sluggish fluid waters completely dead. 
Five years ago poured from a geborstenen rohrleitung loads of crude oil in the huge river wetland. 
Fishermen from the nearby städtchen Bodo must now six hours to row in fischhaltige waters: located in the heart of the nigerdeltas Ogoniland is regarded as one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world. 
On the journey through the river realignments criss-crossed mangrovensümpfe will the full extent of the devastation crystal clear. 
Instead of water helles wühlt the motorboot Brown brühe who his hand into water comes up, attracting ölige finger. 
The roots of the mangrovenbäumchen stand out as black lakritzstangen from the ground, sad I occasionally unbalanced palmen their wedel depend. 
Vogelschwärme in wetlands, as usual, are not to be: as soon as the außenborder remains silent, is spreading in the as a filling station riechenden former paradise ghastly calm. 
'What is happening here, is ecological warfare, "says celestine akpobari gloomy:" We live in constant danger for the health.' 
The kriegsvergleich is appropriate. 
The area where they live the Ogoni people is a for decades disputed battlefield: here, more than 60 years ago the first explorateure from Europe, organised here in the 1980s with the later exekutierten writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, in 1993 the shell-konzern here had to stop its production, because it for its ölarbeiter too dangerous. 
Even today, the company is denied the return to Ogoniland: while from the whole of the delta region of the three times the size of Switzerland, with over 5 000 bohrquellen and 7 000 kilometres pipelines, more than two million barrels of the black gold, are the oil fields be pumped resume oil operations in Ogoniland collapsed, the company is too unstable the situation. 
All the few hundred metres stählerne gestelle stand out as bizarre sculptures from the water: "christbäumchen 'will the heads of the boreholes much to zärtlich mentioned. 
They are up to 50 years old, the most to the core korrodiert. 
Time and again, promoting good-quality such a bohrkopf akpobari rinne thinks, then a constant stream of crude oil into the water. 
More than two billion litres of are experts estimate that in 50 years has flowed into the ecosystem of the Delta: year after year the amount of oil, as you in the sinking of the supertankers' Exxon Valdez "21 years ago in the sea in Alaska drive - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of humanity. 
For the continuing öko-gau who is to blame, this is being fought. 
During the shell-konzern sabotage and the organised öldiebstahl for more than 90% of the pollution, see environmentalists berstende bohrköpfe and lecke pipelines as the main culprit. 
Shell in Nigeria attach much lower safety standards than else in the world, accused the us-wissenschaftler Richard, Steiner, the company: in 2008 alone the rate of defects in the pipes, was "many times higher than elsewhere." 
In a place from the distant as a abandoned, ölverschmierte workshop open-air looks, are emerging from the mangroves to make: they are splitternackt and up to our necks ölverschmiert. 
Under one of the many casks, the part with flasks, partly arbitrary scattered on the site associated, flackert a fire: an illegal kleinraffinerie. 
This will in the barrel of crude oil on the fire several hours inflamed passions, says Michael, the leader of the group. 
First is pressing petrol by the pipes in the auffangtopf spits, later, at the end of the leadership kerosene and, finally, diesel. 
So produce Michael and four employees a day to four casks diesel à 300 litres of: 'This brings us 34.000 naira a "- around 22 dollar. 
The deltabewohner benefit the chronic treibstoffknappheit in the largest erdölstaat of sub-Saharan Africa. 
Nigeria has only on a single refinery. 
The with barely 40 euro-cent per litre of ridiculously low dieselpreis can still undercut the illegal kocher: because their raw material they get in vain. 
He comes from "bunkerern," which pipelinenetz across Ogoniland tap: in this way, the country go according to experts in the whole of the Niger Delta every day lost at least 16 million litres of crude oil. 
Only a tiny part of the provisionally zwischengelagerten raw material, however, will fill illegally veredelt: the lion's share of organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-level military belong to oil tankers and verscherbeln him on the world market. 
The debate as to whether the environmental disaster rather on the population or the lax production methods is due to does the activist akpobari for purely academic. 
The oil companies' would not as invaders, and they would have the livelihood of the fishermen do not as thoroughly destroyed, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries. " 
Now is the relationship of the Ogoni, above all, to shell but destroyed so that only a withdrawal of the company in question would be: "Perhaps are indeed other nationalities as the Chinese as better." 
As Michael nervous. 
"high time that their disappears, 'says the muskulöse put. 
"every minute can the soldiers." 
Will the illegal ölveredler caught by the special forces, are they not arrest, but a painful bribe. 
Also the mainly hail from the North soldiers want - as all Nigerians - of the raw material benefit. 
"This damn stuff in every respect, our country has brought to the dog," says akpobari.
