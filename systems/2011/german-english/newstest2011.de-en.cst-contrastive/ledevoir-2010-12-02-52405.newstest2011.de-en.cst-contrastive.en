Global plan for renewal of lighting 
The UN has yesterday in Cancun a plan for the renewal of the lighting of budgets, trade and industry in 100 countries in relation to the achievement of a reduction of the greenhouse gas (CFC's) proposed that the almost a third of the additional reduction is the equivalent of that must be implemented, in order to stabilise the earth's climate by 2020. 
This ambitious plan adopted its position in the steps of the specific projects that the UN in Cancun hopes, in order to implement the absence of mandatory reduction commitments to compensate for the developed countries. 
After the expressed yesterday plan would the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes of (GT) of the result of the lighting of the earth cast, CFCs be avoided if the weißglühenden pears, which has a monopoly of 50 to 70% in the market, by fluoreszierende or, better still, by light-emitting diodes (led) were to be replaced. 
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. 
This represents an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust emissions of world fleets. 
In Copenhagen last year had the great abgasemittenten such as the United States, China, Europe, and other, which was also Canada, to voluntary reduktionsplänen committed itself to ensuring that the global fckw-emissionen of 53 GT to 49 GT should face. 
Of this assessment, it would, however, still 5 Gt, to withdraw from now until the year 2020 the klimaanstieg 2 degrees Celsius in order to stabilise, in order to prevent this spiral out of control. 
In the weißglühenden pears built for 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light. 
With the kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, with the new LED bulbs reduced this energy demand once again in the double. 
Keep the kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen, on average, between 6 000 by 10,000 hours. 
The new LED bulbs, such as those of the manufacturers, Philips, this week has been put on the market - this society, incidentally, has participated in the UN - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a weißglühende pear, what a suggestion of the savings of the auswechselungsplanes, should be applied in 100 countries. 
In addition to the fact that iese completely new incandescent light bulbs only very little warmth, can you also with a regelwiderstand work. 
And they do not contain any mercury. 
Several specialists have pointed out, kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves since they contain mercury and that they therefore as hazardous waste must dispose of what in the developing countries is not always possible, but the producers are a bring centre available. 
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, not the kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal-fired power stations, the essential emit more mercury to of the weißglühenden pears wasted to generate electricity. 
In the United States alone, these are 25,000 tonnes of mercury from coal-fired power stations every year. 
The report sets out in detail the profits, which each country would generate thanks to this international programme. 
Indonesia would such as, for example, a billion dollars per year in buying electricity and eight million tonnes of reducing CO2 emissions, it means an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose erbauung Indonesia 2.5 billion would cost.
