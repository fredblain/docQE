Khmer Rouge veterans to confrontation with the past forced 
In a weak pointed betonierten klassenraum with dirty and abblätternden walls, the director of the anlong veng high school to the man who, it has built to the later, the Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok alone. 
'everyone here loves Ta Mok. " 
"It was a good leader and he has focussed its people," said sreng KOR Ma, 42 years. 
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the schlachter ', remains the commander in this remote former Khmer rouge-hochburg in the north-west Cambodia's popular, where he hospitals and bridges built, the infrastructure has developed and where thousands of former soldiers still live. 
But this year, 12 years after the capitulation of the Khmer Rouge to the government, are longstanding supporters in anlong challenged veng. 
In April, a local truth and versöhnungsforum the victims the public confrontation with the people once the regime. 
In June, the government has circulated a passed official examinations, that for the first time children of former soldiers the history of the Khmer Rouge are told. 
And in July, a gemeinschaftstribunal of the United Nations and Cambodia, for the first time, a former Member of the Khmer Rouge, than the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture centres, Kaing khek iev, better known as Duch, condemned to 35 years in prison. 
With each of these developments, the fear amongst the Khmer Rouge veterans alnlong vengs, aggravated their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia. 
'There are still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything, "said chhang youk, the head of the documentation centre of Cambodia's, an independent organisation that the regime. 
'for them, life under the Khmer Rouge impressive, but the regime is a symbol of evil. " 
"It divides even families." 
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people have been executed or they died of diseases, revision or from hunger. 
When the Vietnamese invaded and 1979 the pole pot-ied Government underwent fled the leftovers of the regime and its armed forces on the border of Cambodia to Thailand. 
This widespread you until December 1998, when the last movement kapitulierte, mixed reactions. 
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary the guerrilla warfare of its basis in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, withdrew Ta Mok led the next generation in anlong veng. 
But in the mid-1990's, as a by the UN-sponsored peace agreement in 1993 to the first democratic elections, led the country's large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, to the government, which urged to the kapitulationen of Ieng Sary 1996 and nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998. 
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and be Ta Mok alone, the, was not given in 1999 of government in the dangrek mountain arrested. 
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he was waiting for to his process. 
As their benefactors they are no longer protected, the majority of former Khmer Rouge fighters in the exhausting poverty of the rural of Cambodia and many retained the movement in nostalgia memory. 
Even if a few elite official of the Khmer Rouge their local regierungsposten retained their weapons, because they were niederlegten, the poor, uneducated farmers. 
"these people have only very little of the capitulation," said Sok leang benefited from the centre for justice and reconciliation, the in Cambodia, also in anlong veng, public forums does 
'You are laid down in the utopian agrarideologie of the regime'. 
"they grew without any berufswissen." 
Sor Lim, 55 years, in 1974, a teenager, the rhmer Rouge had joined, fought in the jungle to anlang veng before he niederließ in 1998, to live as poor reisbauer. 
"life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said. 
"Ta Mok has any something to eat." 
"but now is the life difficult, because we are looking after our own." 
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raises concerns. 
At the beginning of next year, the Court will try Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister, brought to justice. 
It is the task of the Court, the old leaders and those who are responsible for the atrocities, to condemn, but it is not said, whether it be through these four cases will pursue further action. 
This has done little to the fears in anlong veng. 
Current media speculation have agreed on in the chaem, 64 years, is concentrated, the during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's, in the province of distriktchefin manteay meanchey. 
In 2007, they envoy of the documentation centre of Cambodia told they have the construction of the trapeang thma dam, a project in which thousands of zwangsarbeitern probably died. 
On a hot night in chaem came from the work in the fields on her holzhaus in a dirty street outside of anlong veng back. 
As the sun long shadow on the desiccated grass in chaem accused rejected it, about their past in the Khmer Rouge to discuss. 
The Court should they vorladen, it would refuse to go, she said. 
'Cambodia lives in peace and stability, "said it. 
"There would be no persecution more, would be war." 
Prime Minister Hun Sen, the 1878 of the Khmer Rouge has fled, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be unsafe, would the Court more suspicious charges, even though experts and historians to discuss this. 
'Cambodia must dig a hole and disregard the past, "he said. 
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia must do in order to be able to go forward, said the dokumentationszentrum chhang youk. 
"reconciliation with the khmer-zeiten means build-up of the broken pieces," he said. 
"It is our duty, these broken parts together, so that everything can understand." 
The Centre has created the first of the government approved passed official examinations on the Khmer Rouge, the 75seitige "history of the democratic Cambodia '. 
It has circulated the book in June in anlong veng as an annex to the history books for the high school of the Ministry of Education, the less than four sides on the Khmer Rouge. 
As so often in Cambodia know the young people in anlong veng little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the links of the city to the regime. 
Touch valeak, 19 years, a student of the anlong veng high school, said that the new passed official examinations students helps, an important part of its history to understand. 
But his parents, as he responded sceptical about the book with home, to it to read. 
"My family rejected many parts of the book and the Court from," he said. 
'You are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people from the Court be condemned. " 
Such a resistance makes the process of reconciliation is complex and complicated, said Sok leang. 
But the public forums, the passed official examinations and the Court and gain influence, "he said. 
Still has the Khmer Rouge here a powerful attraction. 
The top in the dangrek mountains leads a of sträuchern überwucherter and with plastikmüll verdreckter way to a rechteck of black soot, with a rostigen blechdach covered. 
Pol Pot's body was here after his death on a reifenhaufen 1998 have been burnt. 
Nuom sothea, 31 years, a handyverkäuferin on the roadside, said that it does not know much about the man who was here to have been burnt. 
'But he has a strong spirit and many people here to him to go to pray' she said. 
It was nuom sotheas birthday and later in the day they wanted to go to Pol Pot's final resting place, where they will give a Bush mature bananas - in the hope that he their luck.
