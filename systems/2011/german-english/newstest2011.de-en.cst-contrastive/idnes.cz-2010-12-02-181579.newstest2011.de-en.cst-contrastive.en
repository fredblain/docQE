The right matratze and the right bettenrost? women have other wishes than men 
Not the tollste bettrahmen, but the quality of the liegefläche - so rost matratze and make the good bed. 
However, this must be in harmony, and with the wishes of the specific user. 
The choice to play a role on many issues - the weight, the size of the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the schläfers. 
It is also just as important, in which interieur matratze and subordinate rost. 
Typical example? 
In a wochenendhaus, in which no regular heated latexmatratzen, are not suitable for much longer, as they need to be "hot." 
Moreover, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethan-matratzen. 
And - they should be turned on a regular basis. 
If you do not have enough entlüftungskanälchen in essence and even on a firm plate, staut, humidity, so it is not excluded that under your schimmel. 
In the election is, of course, also a role, in which it is used to. 
Anyone who was long time abroad, where very high matratzen with weichschicht, will be difficult to a low matratze with hard surface can get used. 
"All an ice-hockey player, which have come back from the nhl, have complained to me that you are not more right can sleep." 
"for their abgeschundenen shoulders, closely and hüften need it simply a weichschicht from visco-schaum (memory foam - a formgedächtnis-polymer). ' 
'This, I recommend that, among other things, also zuckerkranken people under a disruption of the nervous system, so that they are suffering from the' information 'from the ligaments and skin can receive bad, "says Sylva hadamcziková on polstermöbel. 
That is why I have many years ago, but also other customers eishockeyspielern these matratzen with visco-schaum (memory foam) concerned. 
"Today, this is no longer a problem, because such matratzen offer the manufacturers tempur, among other things, the Italian firm magniflex or the Czech manufacturers tropico." 
And we must not necessarily be a famous an ice-hockey player, the benefits of the visco-schaums learn to appreciate. 
This "miracle" actually works quite simple. 
The foam optimalisiert its rigour and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, it is downright schmiegt on warm body. 
Nowhere is it, in the night shifts not around as after a serious fight. 
It is sleeping easy much better. 
The foam viskoelastische also offers protection against dekubitus (gangrene). 
In the election of the matratzengröße should be to height still the length of the fußsohlen to that, is approximately 21 to 34 cm. 
As Mrs Mann, the to the 180 cm are great, need as a 210 to 220 cm bed. 
Each of the schläfer should at least 90 cm liegebreite available, together, therefore, 180 cm. 
In einzelbetten of, for example, singles are 120 to 140 cm appropriate. 
The own comfort, and also for any visitors. 
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb for the ideal bettbreite: "If you on the back is, should still enough room for the easy angewinkelten poor," advises ing. Helena prokopová, the zunftmeisterin the polsterer and raumausstatter that for years the issue of healthy schlafes and good ergonomics of furniture and to put this question to colleges. 
In a doppelbett everyone needs its own rost and his own matratze, but be careful when buying products, so that the matratzen also are high. 
Otherwise, cannot do other than the roste in different level to fit and that is not in any bettrahmen possible. 
At least 14 cm schaummatratzen should be high, with matratzen federskelett 15 cm, should at least three centimeters on the formschicht and the feinpolster. 
'with the hand or the sit down the feathers in no case, warns Helena prokopová felt ." 
Any matratze makes a specific rosttyp required. 
Ganzgepolsterte beds with matratze and document as zusammengewachsene siamzwillinge have no place in the bedroom. 
These matratzen cannot be and to reveal the reference you cannot wash today, which is already there. 
And since it in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the matratze after five to seven years of slow to a huge (and congested sieve). 
That is also why reject experts werbeslogans in matratzen a life span of up to 25 years ago, yes even lifelong guarantee promise. 
Has any matter it. 
And is therefore a practical Council by traders: in matratzen of 120 or 140 cm broad should be the hygiene of waschbaren abziehbaren salary, not be afraid, nonetheless, it is recommended that a matratzenschoner, easy to use and laundering can withdraw. 
Even if today in the rule matratzenbezüge with rundumreißverschluss are produced, so one after the open up two halves gets (immensely important for the waschvorgang and the waschmaschinengröße!), the manipulation, with greater matratzen alone, above all, often carried out as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. 
Have you in the bed rather than a rostes a firm plate? 
Get out of it. 
Or a maximum for a bed for undesirable guests and for a single night. 
So they should also prefer the plate with lüftungslöchern oversight (provided that there are already not) and matratzen with federskelett and 15 cm of minimum allocation with the so-called taschenfederkern and feinpolster use. 
Polyurethan-matratzen belong in such a document not. 
For not verstellbare lattenroste with 14 to 18 federleisten (lamellen) are suitable or latex- sandwichmatratzen (possibly also combinations of latex and kokos), always figures are roste with a larger lattenanzahl, from 28 and more federleisten from, with lordosenstütze in lendenwirbelbereich and the possibility to regulate the lattenhärte. 
On verstellbare lamellenroste not include matratzen with federskelett, because it does not respond to the ergonomische verstellung. 
In addition to the attitude of the rigid the federleisten special flexible schultermodule will also be required. 
This is a specific integration of the federleisten which allows the federleisten einzudrücken verwinkeln or even so that the specific einsinken the back of the schläfers. 
Particularly for men with broad shoulders an important matter. 
There are even matratzenhersteller which have started, in 'herrenmatratzen "weichzonen to use for the schulterbereich. 
Also to the ladies is thought - you off these weichzonen in the hüftgegend. 
For ambitious customers are punktelastische flügelfedersysteme (lattoflex) or roste with punktelastischen kontakt-pads with so-called multitorsionsfederung. 
The pressure will be distributed on a number of points, which will reduce the tension. 
But, if you at the right matratze and right rost a bad (to great and fülliges) kopfkissen, used the most benefits go back lost. 
Here, too, a rule of thumb: the kopfkissen is supposed to be the head, its leaders should only up to the shoulders rich, so that the schultermuskeln can ease. 
Ideal is therefore a 50 X 60 cm great kissen, as for example the Scandinavians. 
In the seitenlage should the kopfkissen (together with the schulterentlastungszone in rost or the weichzone in the matratze) the schulterhöhe in balance. 
Some have our modern matratzen have with the former (with hay EU-US) strohsäcken but in common. 
Modern manufacturers use more and more natural materials or at least their mixtures. 
Also in matratzen means the new magic word 'organic'. 
Instead of erdölrohstoffen we used for the manufacture of polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturelle oils - for example rizinus- and sojaöl. 
Soya is used by all known manufacturers. 
"organic matratzen, that is to say in their heart from materials purely of natural origin is," declared by the firm Petr vašíček tropico plus. 
Naturstoffe but are also used in the production of matratzenbezügen - one of the first was aloe Vera. 
One can but also mikrokapseln grant the sleep fresh forest or lavendelduft. 
Here, too, there is a difference between men and women. 
While the men a "kühlender" pflanzenextrakt from birkenblättern is used, so that the matratzenbezug the heat and cool can absorb the body, the salary for women 'wärmende "effect. 
Extracts from red paprikaschoten stimulate the blutzirkulation, the weaker sex will the sleep so warm wohlig. 
And today's favourites? 
From kaltschaum matratzen (he has greater poren with devastated zellstruktur and is therefore atmungsaktiver than handelsübliches polyurethan and also much more flexible). 
Through the combination of the various stiff (rigour) by kaltschäumen and visco-schäumen mehr-zonen-matratzen arise, the know exactly where head, hip and closely. 
For a high-quality matratze has, however, you 7 000 kroner and more to berappen. 
Gesundheitsmatratzen but are usually with lower VAT, as they apply as medical aid. 
The first Czech enterprises has been given gumotex this advantage. 
We will see, in the matratze and on rost saving is not so easy. 
Now and again, there are special offers of manufacturers and traders, the two matratzen for the price of one. 
The brand magniflex the matratze duofreeze with in relation verstepptem visco-schaum memory for 11.990 CZK. 
The second will be free to do so. 
It was the material tempur, that the era of viskoelastischen schaumstoffe with open zellstruktur and high density in almost kosmischem pace. 
No wonder they have been but for NASA, because the astronauts are developed in the launch huge überbelastungen. 
Will tempur in heat soft, in a cool environment to entrench it in turn. 
So it is the human body perfect and distributed in the best possible way the körperdruck. 
It is, therefore, not only to prevent druckbrand ideal, but increased the schlafkomfort in general. 
Viskoelastische schaumstoffe will not only in matratzen, but also in other gesundheitsprodukten, such as, for example, in particular fußpolstern, used the legs and the gefäßen should provide relief. 
For example, domestic producers use the schaumstoffe eucatherm C, twinsaver or similar products.
