NASA has announced the Fund außerirdischen life 
The North American space agency called a press conference to a fund vorzustelle tomorrow, the impact on the search for life in all will have. 
The national air and raumfahrtbehörde (NASA) of the United States is tomorrow, Thursday, a astrobiologische discovery known, the theory of the existence of außerirdischen life could confirm. 
The fund will, tomorrow, at 1 p.m. at a press conference in the seat of the NASA in Washington presented by experts of the astrobiologie. This is a science, the origin, the development, distribution and the future of life in the universe.

Apparently, it is a microbe, the at the bottom of the mono lake in the yosemite-nationalpark, California, was found. They there live in an environment for to toxic for all possible forms of life has been kept, as the sea is strong arsenhaltig. 
In any way the mikrobie used the arsenic than überlebensressource. Taking into account these capacity increases the chances that it on other planets, which do not have our protective atmosphere, similar life could be. 
If these organisms the arsenic verstoffwechseln, is in accordance with the astrobiologen shown that "it real a different way of life, a second way of life, which is different from the US known." 
The space agency is tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference the actual scope of their funds known.
