To hell, warriors! 
The kunstkino fits splatter? 
The director Nicolas winding refn is testing with his kämpfer-epos "walhalla rising" old genre-grenzen new. 
To which Members of the public may of the Danish director Nicolas winding refn have thought, "as he has turned walhalla rising"? 
A prisoner wikinger-krieger with only one eye (mads mikkelsen) freed themselves from his peinigern and places with almost superhuman forces multitudes of his opponents in order - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero thuggish tötungsmethoden like to serve and its enemies already time the gedärme from the vibrant, limb if he has bad humour. 
On the other hand, as it is actually says einauge is mentioned, the whole film about not a word, and also the other characters can at most be time to one or two sentences, or a few painful todesschreien. 
Otherwise, remained silent and in the gruselig fine hügellandschaft of Scotland, the the wikingerwelt geschwelgt from around a thousand years ago, the scene. 
Ideal rather cineasten for adults with interest for existentialismus and very calm kamerafahrten. 
Well, if a film has several target groups, it is a shame that, if they are mutually exclusive. 
Director winding refn applies since its wild and gestylten drogendealer-trilogie "pusher 'as a kind of Danish version of quentin tarantino, refuses but stoical, his works with a little more humour the mainstream or a little less brutality the arthouse accessible. 
Most kunstkino-freunde are the around spritzenden gehirnmasse and the gedärmen put off. 
At the latest the action-fans then die from boredom, if einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons, with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem aufbricht and an eternity in slump and fog, before the team seems trapped in America there is, and remains silent. 
No wonder, then, that 'walhalla rising "in Germany has found no kino-verleih and now only on DVD. 
This is particularly because of the magnificent images be a shame, but also because, behind the prätentiösen until bluttriefenden facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema, which deserves some attention. 
In this film is not about dialogues or for a rigorous action, it is all atmosphere, a filmgewordener fiebertraum. 
And from which there is no escape for the viewers. 
Hardly refn off a moment of détente and undertakes him with his icy images and the dark trance-artigen's throat soundtrack very slowly, but above all with the unspeakable hatred of him from the hearts of the characters runs. 
Only a small blonder young, the einauge faithful to the side, preserves something like innocence, all the others will of anger. 
The vast majority of the one-eyed man hero, whose motives, but never be declared for enemies and temporary allies at some point to the warriors from hell will, perhaps to the Ambassador of the devil itself. 
It means ruin, but perhaps also only for the already verdorbenen. 
"walhalla rising" is a more puzzling film you hate and admire, to annoy, upset and marvel at. 
An experience.
