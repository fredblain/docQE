Métro grand Paris: first financial tantalizing glimpses of Europe 
Since the debate about the modernisation of the transport industry on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it rains billion. 
At least in the discussions. 
We call on this, in particular, the 23 billion for the underground grand Paris in memory, the of the Société du Grand Paris is to be built. 
The baubeginn the SGP, the state has a kapitaldotation of EUR 4 billion has been declared. 
In the theoretical scheme of this is the sum of the SGP then, on the markets would allow a part of the finanzsumme to their dual. 
Today it is, after all, to first projections. 
The amending budget by 2010, this morning by the finanzkommission looked through the national assembly, contains the measures provided for in the first part of this money. 
It is two measures: the creation of a special tax on erschließund and higher taxation of the offices at the ile-de France. 
The former, Article 15 of the draft law funding, is "to the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris." 
This is quantified: "the product of this tax amounts to EUR 117 million per year '. 
Zweitere is a reorganisation of the already existing taxation: "in order to modernise the from their educational product and to increase this increase in the Société du Grand Paris to entrust." 
How much would tabling? 
A puzzle. 
This amount is not in the text. 
Of the 4 billion is a long way away. 
'It is stated that the fiscal resources to the EUR 4 billion of the kapitaldotation be added, which will be found by the state and the Société du Grand Paris to and after for the project to be done', as is clear from the explanatory statement. 
In the SGP will take place this system is not offensive. 
"since the moment in which the income has been recorded (the two taxes, that R.), the studies on three years and then cover only from the 4 billion, 'it will draw. 
"This is noted in the budget and gradually withdrawn." 
The SGP estimates that 2013 will be started, the 4 billion for the budget 2014 to note. 
This measure, whose 4 promised billion we will be able to seek, is in danger of a right, parliamentary discussion. 
The first public sitting will take place on 7 December.
