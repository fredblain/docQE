WikiLeaks is increasingly in trouble. 
The internet-dienstleister Amazon has the enthüllungsplattform of his servers exiled. 
There is perhaps political pressure for the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomaten-depeschen. 
WikiLeaks founder Assange is supposedly in England. 
The enthüllungsplattform WikiLeaks equipment in the United States increasingly under attack. 
The internet-aktivisten lost access to its previous American server and are now seeking a internet-heimat in Europe. 
The prominent American Senator Joe, Avigdor Lieberman, called, however, other countries and companies to boycott of WikiLeaks. 
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on the fahndungslisten by Interpol, should stop after a press report in the United Kingdom.

The internet-aktivisten had in the publication of the secret diplomatic depeschen on the Amazon web service (AWS), the high zugriffszahlen on the documents. 
By Twitter WikiLeaks declared to the step further: 'fine - our dollar will now be spent on people in Europe. " 
If Amazon such problem with the speech, "should stop to sell books'. 
The use of its server Amazon have stopped by WikiLeaks after staff of Senator Joe, Avigdor Lieberman, investigations, the television station CNN reported in reference to the office liebermans. 
The chairman of the Amazon senatsausschusses of homeland security was threatened with a boycott, told the British 'Guardian'.
