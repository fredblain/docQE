Sport and regelumgehung 
As the tricks of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will, a sanction. 
The supposedly of two players of the Real Madrid (xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) evidenced by the exclusion in the game of 23 November against the Ajax of the Champions League that caused much ink has been spilled on whether it is a unsportliche act or not and whether was possibly both players should be sanctioned by UEFA. 
As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before spielende (your team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls, now so that the referee you the second yellow card. 
In this way, and as the Real Madrid his group would, will be the two players in the next ligaspiel the prescribed sanction against the auxerre fulfil and so without cards in the next spielphase embarkation. 
Finally, the population of the UEFA disziplinarkommitee the coach of the clubs, José mourinho, with two play and the relevant players with different sums of money. 
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football. 
It is so widespread that it forms part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in the sport - is our rules. 
Part of the law debate about the case described, is due to the fact that a team of the club Real Madrid (which in its anthem edelmut and honour and on other occasions its players for similar incidents punished the major role played), and on the dramatisierung by mourinho, of an episode more to its long history as theatralischer and provocative technicians has added. 
In any case, is the debate about whether this does not expressly prohibited behaviour of the statutes is contrary to the principles of sport, that is to say whether these actions constitute a regelumgehung. Indeed, believes that this approach to the statutes of the sport, seem but whose sense. 
In this matter the damage caused to the sporting spirit should be investigated. 
The sporting spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that has been put at risk by these actions do not, because it was not a aggressive game. 
A further aspect of a clean game is to prevent the zuwiderhandelnden players an unjustified benefits from gegenteam. That did not happen either. 
The paradox of the activity of players of the Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally under falschspiel or regelumgehung understand, because the circumvention of the rule was not taken place in secret, in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be so long as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. 
The players waited and took the sanction joyful. 
Another question is what kind of benefit the zuwiderhandelnden from the deliberate fouls. 
It should be emphasised that the rival either in a disadvantageous position has brought benefits to the gespielte game were erheischt, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to play with less players. 
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because of the club does not then on these players. 
The advantage is that the players the next spielphase the Champions League without cards, which your participation in a future game, could threaten begin. 
But it is a long-term, up to a certain extent, uncertain advantage, because the team at some point could also retiring. Also receive the players with this approach a sanction and go in the second kartenzyklus on, in which you because kartenanhäufung with a card less than in the first cycle departure. 
That means that it is not clear whether it is really a advantage. 
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the sporting spirit, which also strategic decisions from the rules that will allow a maximum benefit. 
In this case, wanted to circumvent the players are not a sanction (that is, indeed, a clear case of regelumgehung), they wanted more choice, when it is dealing with this. 
You met a strategic decision, without a penalty or to flee to avoid before her. 
Although the border between imagination and regelumgebung blurred is, I believe that this matter is a clear case of imagination. 
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because it was two selbstausschlüsse and because of the way the provoking regelübertragung. 
The harm that the principles of sport has been done by these acts is less ethical rather than aesthetic nature.
