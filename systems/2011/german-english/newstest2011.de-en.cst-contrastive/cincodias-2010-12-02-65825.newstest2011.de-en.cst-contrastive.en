Red Bull prevails in the F1 with a geheimwaffe of Siemens 
The car will be improved with a software in real time. 
Since Red Bull in 2004 in the world of Formula 1 eindrang, is your history in this splendid universe of the speed of surprises and successes. 
Initially, no one paid attention to the newcomer and, despite its steeply rising background during the last seasons, all in the final sprint last November to the victory of the Ferrari's by Fernando Alonso. 
Without the capabilities of the German pilots and weltmeisters Sebastian vettel or the leistungsstärke of the motors of Renault going to reduce want is the "geheimwaffe" that the multinational Siemens Red Bull in the hands, and thus a siegerteam created, on the legend. 
In reality is a powerful software to simulate of processes which the German company 2007 to purposes, which do not have to do with motor race, on the market brought. 
This as plm informatikprogramm was called for the development of montageketten in factories throughout the world, energiewerken and precise instruments used. 
The goal is an exact reproduction or simulation of a product or process, before this, indeed, is being built, so as to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs. 
Plm, the development of the cameras of canon, the aircraft of Sukhoi and of the most famous commercial vehicles of Nissan easier. 
Siegfried russwurm, head of the industrieabteilung of Siemens, declared that the use of these software in the Formula 1 - factory Red Bull 'in a few hours, almost in real time, "the changes and improvements to the race and with the tests are discovered, draw up and can carry out. 
Russwurm leads from that in 1992, in the rennställen average ten technicians worked in a season of a maximum of three or four improvements have been able to introduce. 
In red bulls team today are 180 highly qualified young people. With powerful do they lead analyses and all possible changes to the rennwagen by. 
The siemens-manager stated that the plm-software is in the situation, all elements of the rennwagen of Red Bull to analyse and improve, with the exception of the motors, for the only Renault responsible. 
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamik and the safety elements will be changed. 
The changes can thanks to progressive production plants and hightech-autoklaven in less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of simulators in reality. 
The only border, the this crazy technical perfectionism is set, are the $40 million, which is a Formula 1 - team for his race in a season should spend. 
Red Bull has its hightech-fabrik for the development and production of its rennwagen in a 50 kilometres from London off the ground. 
There are two buildings in which visits, particularly of journalists - are very limited. 
All that is happening is top secret. 
The workforce is 580 persons, including the two pilots, the world champion vettel and mark webber. 
But red bulls true Formula 1 - zweifelslos hero is the latest world champion Sebastian vetell. 
Behind the enormous technological resources which the energy-drink-hersteller in the services of its participation in the race tracks, hide other protagonists, whose support invaluable and their profile is zero. 
The technologichef of the plant, Steve nevey, stressed that five years ago could even say that the progress made in the area of R & D for rennwagen with 50% to victory and contributed to the pilots were responsible for the rest. 
Today, the anteilswerte changed. The technology makes 85% of success, while the contribution of the pilots to 15%. 
Nevey recognises that vettel and webber can never be replaced by computer, because they "are not voraussagbare gladiatoren."
