Arsen-resistente microbe could new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere, allow 
The discovery of a foreign bakterienart which, amongst other things of arsenic can live, opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on earth, and elsewhere. 
Although researchers this unusual bacillus here on earth, is it your view, a sign that a life without the hitherto regarded as vital elements is possible. 
'This body has two options. " 
"he needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." 
"the power it to something very special, although it almost a form of 'foreign' way of life is', said Paul c.w. Davies of Arizona State University and co-autor of the report that on Thursday in the online-ausgabe the magazine Science. 
So far, six main elements have been regarded as a vital - carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, phosphorus and nitrogen and sulphur. 
But, as the scientists herausfanden, increases the Bacillus in the Californian mono Lake still further, if it phosphorus by arsenic replaced. 
"one wonders what else is still possible," said the co-autor of the report Ariel that Anbar of Arizona State University. 
The discovery is an important step in the search for außerirdischem life, as scientists life and its forms must recognise, so Anbar. 
The study deals with microbes that on earth were found. 
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details to the discovery of were announced, was a cause for widespread speculation on the Internet, that the report of the discovery of außerirdischen life might be. 
This is not the case. 
The discovery "shows that in other planetensystemen organisms, with the help of other elements biochemical processes can set in motion and that the 'standardelemente', which in our opinion are absolutely vital, not necessarily see given ', said Charles cockell, Professor on planetary and space sciences research institute of open university of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. 
Cockel was not part of the research teams. 
'This work is a new departure, because it shows that in basic biochemischen processes and structures one element can be replaced by another', added cockell. 
This discovery was not accidental. 
The wolfe-simon Felisa astrobiologischen Institute NASA, the study, chose the mono Lake because of the high arsengehalts. 
Since arsenic and phosphorus chemically same, that microbes that both are exposed, possibly a element by the other can replace. 
"The, were aware of the arsens is based, in particular, that there is a chemically a similar situation as phosphorus." 
"by the organisms, find it difficult to distinguish an element from the other." 
"But the difference is so great that arsenic different acts as phosphorus. It has reached in our biochemisches system, where it almost everything," says verschmiert Anbar. 
The researchers, the Bacillus gfaj-1 a rising arsenkonzentration. It suited to and grew. 
The microbe is growing phosphorus better, but that it also in arsenic can survive, shows that a arsen-basierte way of life, of course, can happen, either on the earth or another planet or on the moon, arsenic more often occurs. 
According to Jamie S. foster, dozentin for Microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new. But so far there was still no functioning example. 
Arsenic came in the early erdjahren more common, she says, that is why the science assumed that early forms of life there have been used. 
"There is reason to believe that life can also have developed differently than in the early erdzeitalter," Forster, which was not a Member in wolfe-simons forschungsteam. 
The research were from NASA and the Department of Energy and the national health authorities.
