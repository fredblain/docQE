Puigcercós addiction with a nod to the Carod close to peace in the ERC 
The Republican leaders allows the party a secret vote on its continuance in office. 
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the vollversammlungsprinzips. 
Joan puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for the umpteenth time an internal turmoil in the ranks of the following the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes rudderless ERC from the way to go. 
The Party's leader is aware that its threat of resignation the close of the former Labour party whip Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira is not enough, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is now so weakened as your mentor itself, and not the same headache will bring, as other former tendencies. 
Therefore tried the leaders of Esquerra with a nod to the new critics to gain, what its position until the next local elections would secure. 
For the beginning kündete yesterday that the over 200 Regional Council members of ERC is about his remain in office could express secret. 
With ballot papers, not with superior hand. 
If the carodisten the präsidenen a fine miss, could you wanted to do this without fear of reprisals. 
Indeed, the head would like to both the impression of division, as well as the of subjection to avoid his person. 
In several interviews he confirmed that he would with half of the votes plus a not feel confirmed, and he added without any indication of prozentwerten, a result of 'in the Bulgarian style' would be a good thing. 
The Carod by the President, who are close to call for more than just the party office. An inadequate gesture, since puigcercós the supreme body of the kongresse controlled. 
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to enhance resignations have will you with the chairman of a vorgehensplan from now until May. 
For this they expect in the drafting of the document on strategic change of direction, the management on 18 to the vote in the Council, will be able to participate. 
Its intention is to guarantee, for puigcercós. In return, these promises, the Congress in the autumn of 2011, what the leader already for a fact. 
The leader of the ERC is of the opinion that the "polyphonie" a pity the stability and it seeks once and for all, the organisation in the situation, their dirty laundry wash behind closed doors. 
In this sense, the article of the President-in-Office conseller Josep huguet signed up to in his blog, symptomatic. 
In view of this, the puigcercós is an ideologue, considered the holders of innovació it for a fact that the party leaders' in exchange against various objectives' will be based. 
He was five to, two of which the priority. 
Firstly, the 'restructuring' of the governing board, so that this at least 90% of the Party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from carods environment. 
The second could the great news. 
Huguet proposes that ERC should finally abandon the vollversammlungsprinzip as operation. 
So he verfechtet a reform of the Statute, which should make it possible to hold the kongresse with elected delegates. 
By the end of the vollversammlungsmodells - an exception in the Spanish party system - is puigcercós' team that already on the last two conferences, obsessed with fought for it. 
Indeed, on the bebenden assembly of 2008, the party leadership with the review of the vollversammlungsprinzips on a congress on the reform of the Statute should deal. 
This deadline is still out, since infogle the internal aufruhe of recent years tackling this matter was not advisable. 
Now, without the critical sectors on the lookout, could be the time has come, in order to take up the matter again and for ever.
