Czech children with Fernet highest and rum, beer is out - it is simply too slow 
Fernet, rum and vodka, just for once, also time a good whisky, which the father has stolen from the hausbar. 
These are the beverages, for whose benefit from drunken Czech teenagers under fifteen most frequently notbehandelt. 
No exception are children, the their hangovers ausschlafen must repeatedly in the hospital. 
This is from the experience of doctors, with similar cases in the inclusion of the kinderabteilungen of clinics. 
'beer or wine are completely out of fashion, because it is simply too long before you get. " 
"Today's trend is clearly of hard alcohol," said právo luděk Pelikán, the chefarzt the kinderabteilung in the mittelböhmischen clinic hořovice. 
"whisky, if it succeeds, the father of a bottle of hausbar to ours and, if not, then at least Fernet or vodka. 
'vodka has the advantage that it can interfere with juice, then it smacks of not as strong, "says the chefarzt. 
The speaker of the fakultätskrankenhauses motol Eva jurinová gives him right. 
"the most, it is about Fernet or rum." 
"This is today's alkoholtrend, especially at primary school." 
"occasionally it was also about slibowitz, we feel at home ', led Mrs jurinová. 
According to Pelikán chefarzt dreizehn- or fourteen-year-old drinkers in the krankenhausaufnahme long fairly common. 
Before the clinic in hořovice, on which he is working, since this year, he was ten years in the pädiatrie-abteilung motol the hospital, where the ambulances angetrunkene ablieferten pupils from far and wide. 
'A girl had to be four times hospitalisiert. " 
"You began their careers with 12 years ago, when the first time it with 3.5 mg alcohol in the blood and even in combination with" extase "was," described the doctor was a particularly serious case. 
"It was in ausstellungsgelände in holešovice on any tanzparty." 
"The interesting in that it was not at all strange, taking their mother, that your daughter 48 hours not came home ', is the chefarzt. 
It is precisely the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance at the start with the own sprösslingen is regarded as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children. 
A real dependence in the true sense of the word, is it not, according to experts, in children. 
"under alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomenon to understand and that is not the case in these children." 
With those who enjoy repeatedly alcohol, is often a negative familiär-sozialer background characteristic, "says chefarzt Pelikán. 
The speaker of the hospital motol, according to Mrs jurinová were until the middle of November around forty drunken children in the abandonment of department for child and jugendmedizin trained. 
However, only the cases with serious alkoholvergiftung, the one in hospital was needed, go in the statistics. 
Drunken children, the following ambulatory care of the parents of the police or, if necessary, be brought home, are not registered. 
Apart from the cases in which children only times as a bottle of spirits in the schulbank austrinken are there in the opinion of Mr Pelikán three jahreszeitliche amplituden, to the 100% is good: walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve of and the end of the school year. 
"the latter for two reasons - either from distress because of the poor testimony to or from joy on the holiday." 
'in the walpurgisnacht I have already seven drunken children at once experienced in the opening, "stresses Dr Pelikán. 
A betrunkenes child that the night under medical supervision spends, paradoxically, is better off, as a child, the next day, only with a nasty hangover. 
The headaches on the morning after that, the of the dehydration and the glukosemangel, can be in hospital with a flüssigkeitsspendenden infusion with glucose produced and nutrients, the absence of the organism. 
"clearly they are better off, because according to the" beautiful 'experience in the evening, raise it with good humour, without that somewhere something ache. " 
"You are only a little confused as to where they are ', Dr Pelikán, recognising the patients sometimes at least the good humour in similar vein, by giving you the cost of that year, you who treatment will cost. 
Because of the transport with the ambulances and the night in a akutbett well and like to come to a few tens of thousands of kronor. 
"now and again I have used this as erziehungsmittel, if I directly to the children in the visit have meant, which has cost their Drunkenness and that it can happen that you time the whole holidays on must work to make the money for a single such fete to earn," added Dr Pelikán. 
In his view, the health insurance funds, however, not after regressverfahren, in order to cure the trunkenen children necessary costs of the parents.
