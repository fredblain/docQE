Secret of komplexgeschüttelten Canada lifted 
The new, American diplomatenleitungen by WikiLeaks were spread to reveal the secret about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of the Canadians, vis-à-vis the Americans believe; they, but with the same blow the superiority the latter to Canada open. 
Consequently, the American diplomats surprised that the Canadian voters in the ballot, not the kanadisch-amerikanischen relations in the spirit, and they believe that the visit by President Obama would have helped the Conservative Government, budget from 2009. 
The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington, the public have spread, yesterday, still offer more juicy details than the mere substantial content, which has a very bad outcome. 
A of 22 September 2008 carved link, that is to say in the period in which the Federal wahlkampage are in full swing, was reported on the point at which the United Nations is not more to the by their political leaders discussed operations. 
The great surprise by David Wilkins, of the American Ambassador in Ottawa, used. 
Mr Wilkins offers various erklärungsmöglichkeiten this situation. 
'A the Canadians almost innewohnender inferiority complex led to the Canadian, political leaders may be much more likely to on internal matters of everyday life, as the United States in this election pass the buck (as in 1988 during the campaign on the free trade), "he describes. 
The United Nations, so he schlußfolgert are thus "of the proverbial Goliath this choice: omnipresent, but potentially to threatening, in order to talk about him '. 
The Ambassador understands this' deafening silence 'the less, when the two countries intensive political and economic relations. 
"logically," he assessed, "should it, the ability of candidates, a party and much more of a party to hold such an essential relationship that the voters at the ballot box as a key factor in the sense." 
The other expression of this sense of importance reads on 22 January 2009 of Terry breese, geschäftsträger in Ottawa, sent communication, the President Barack Obama on his first visit to prepare in Ottawa. 
"their journey will help, the continued existence of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, in which Canada to ensure its first deficit after more than a decade will be aware, the result of a belebungsprogrammes in the level of 30 to 40 billion dollars," describes breese. 
Nowhere, he had mentioned that the government had to postpone the parliamentary sitting before Christmas must, in order to prevent the Parliament of the coalition and would throw the so conditional continuation of the opposition parties, on the quality of the proposed belebungsprogramms would impact. 
A further, from January 2008 and carved from the ambassador Wilkins communication drafted agreed by the Washington always negative image that the anti-terror broadcast on CBC, dramatic series of the United States. 
The ambassador is concerned about programmes such as border, little mosque on the prairie, intelligence and H2O, in which there was little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, "or the" no-fly-list contributions for the purposes of by muskelprotze of the CIA conducted interrogations can see. 
Yet another communication reported in detail on how Hillary remarked in their French counterparts, Bernard Kouchner in her first bilateral meetings have asked whether Europe is prepared to include certain prisoners from Guantánamo. 
Mr Kouchner is the answer is' yes', but on the basis of an individual 'case to case "-entscheidung. 
At the end of the meeting, àm, "he has described the Mrs a paper in terms of Omar Khadr handed over, a 15-year Muslims Canadian origin." 
"The Secretary of State has promised that the acts once again durchzusehen." 
Finally, we note that the WikiLeaks inflame passions in terms of the website. 
Tom flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very closely on a kind of advisers, had declared that the CBC for this massive leak killed 'responsible'. 
He was here to Mike Huckabee CITES from the United States.
