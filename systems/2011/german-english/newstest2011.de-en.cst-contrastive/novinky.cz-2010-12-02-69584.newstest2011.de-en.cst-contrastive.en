A long finger than ringfinger means lower risk to developing cancer 
Men, the finger is long, as the ringfinger, are obviously a lower risk, to prostate cancer to become ill. 
This is a surprising result of a study that on the Wednesday of the British journal of cancer has been published. 
This is the mirror of male hormone testosterone. 
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger as a simple test for prostate cancer can serve the risk and this particular at men to sixty ', said the mitautorin the study on krebsforschungsinstitut Ros eeles, a professor at the university in WARWICK. 
The finger could help to determine which men is necessarily a prostatakrebs-test should undergo, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors are available, such as, for example, family health problems, added Mrs eeles. 
In the period from 1994-2009 pursued it with their colleagues in Britain more than 1 500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time, the 3 000 healthy men. 
In more than half of all the participants of the study was the finger of the right hand shorter than the ringfinger. 
For these men was the same likelihood of prostate cancer, as for 19% of those men, whose 'ring' and finger equal long. 
In men, their finger longer than the ringfinger was, however, this risk fell by 33%, in men to sixty even 87%. 
The relationship of the length of the two mentioned finger, which is already in the prenatal age are obviously reflects the different mirror of geschlechtshormonen, which the child in the womb was exposed. 
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer fingers. 
Former research found that it is precisely the testosterone growth accelerated prostate cancer. 
Václav pačes, leading Czech geneticists and a former chairman of the Academy of Sciences čtk, said that he was aware of this study fleetingly, he think, nevertheless, that the relationship between the fingerlänge and the risk of cancer have not so far proved to be totally 'for'.
