Inspectors in zwielicht 
The European Food Authority is of the EFSA with crops experimental industry. 
This accusation testbiotech now formulated the group of experts, which, as an independent institute for the impact assessment of the biotechnology understands. 
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have it well documented," said testbiotech-chef Christoph then on Wednesday in Munich. 
The head of the efsa-expertengruppe for genetically modified plants, Harry kuiper, and another efsa-experte were for years in the lobbyistenverband ilsi under the Treaty. 
The will of groups of companies such as Monsanto, nestle or Bayer paid. 
Kuiper have significantly contributed to the efsa-prüfvorschriften for crops and hence in a clear conflict of interests, criticised then. 
The efsa-vorschriften are absatzweise word for word with position papers of the ilsi and deceive so that the imprint of the industry, the fact of the authority is to be controlled in the Italian Parma. 
It is already the second time that a testbiotech interessenskollision share your criticism. 
It should be a high-level efsa-managerin recently without conditions or transitional period for the Swiss agrarkonzern Syngenta - and have so that the sides. 
Also the mitteldeutsche broadcasting (mdr) had recently human links between kontrollierender EU authority and industrial lobby, reveals what the umweltbundesamt, as EU parliamentarians sit up and take notice. 
The EFSA can, however, see no conflict of interest. 
We would reiterate to all serious data, even on those of the industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, it says in an opinion. 
Of the experts, who work for EFSA, you do not demand that they have no contact with the industry. 
They would need to disclose this, however. 
Kuiper gives his work for the international life sciences Institute (ilsi) in the United States. 
This calls itself neutral forum of experts from science, industry and policy, among other things, the risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbyauftrag. 
In the matter of independent experts criticise how then that genetically modified plants currently without any fütterungsversuch in animals be allowed and the reaction of crops to nurture, will not tested. 
"We want to know what, for example, of genetically modified maize on the field power," says then. 
Current practice is only isolated proteins, but not the whole genpflanze to test how liefere no reliable results. 
"If the risks not addiction, how can we then find it? 'asks then and point an accusing finger. 
It also provides for Angelika hilbeck so. 
The scientist parts since 1994 in the genetic engineering and is currently in the technical university Zurich. 
The industry attempts in this area, as in the United States now also in Europe is becoming more and more, critical scientists to influence and to discredit. 
There is therefore hardly researchers, not with groups are intertwined. 
For businesses critical studies would not usually published. 
"The industry controls the security research," claims hilbeck.
