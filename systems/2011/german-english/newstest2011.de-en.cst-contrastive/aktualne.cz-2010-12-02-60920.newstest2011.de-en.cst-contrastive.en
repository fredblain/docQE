A file under the poor with three new mietverträgen to three homes: for the own and the homes of his daughters and his son, who is a sentence. 
All three within the framework of the so-called 'deregulation' just the rent increased. 
Instead of SEK 3 500 monatsmiete is the son in the next year for a 2-zimmer-wohnung with cuisine of the second category of SEK 4100 berappen. 
'and there is in the home not time a fluent hot water and heating must be in a simple kohleofen', for he angry pointing the finger at the new mietvertrag of the son, to the signing of which he has a power. 
'But what - who I signed, "he says half and half resignedly annoying. 
Bytyokd.cz's citizens' Association, the new mietbedingungen as "incorrect and immoral," the tenants, the new Treaties simply not to sign and until 7 December in which it intends to publish a guidance as to how to take action against such treaties. 
But the man beckons only. 
'A says this, and the other is the', makes it a benighted face. 
The region will Ostrava so much "deregulierungslabor." 
After the new year is this deregulation most rental housing in the Czech Republic before, whose tenants no market-oriented rent figures. 
Aktuálně.cz decided, therefore, this "laboratory" personally. 
The rpg-warteraum in havířov is one of four in the region and Ostrava already nine o'clock in the morning in this Tuesday brechend fully. 
Alongside the door the bodyguards a safety agency and to her a aufrufgerät. 
'rent 2011, "is a special tastfeld on the touchscreen. 
Briefly touched upon this and already the machine spuckt a nummernzettel. 
We hardly have the number '157 "entziffert and already piepst you on the large screen an indication to the ceiling of the warteraums. 
Half a minute later is one's turn. 
A little later enter an older married couple the warteraum after the rent to questions, but the rush in warteraum is obviously not the new rent. 
Most people are here to the usual problems to solve - reparaturanträge, insurance and so on. 
From the middle of November fly in the region the Ostrava kuverts with the new mietverträgen most tenants of a total of 44 000 homes of the portfolios of rpg in the letter boxes. 
The rpg byty proposes to you in the letters a mieterhöhung of around 15 to 38%. 
The specific switch to the new rent in the klientenzentrum is opened since 18 November. 
"The action is something over a week, that is to say, this is only the beginning," answers the honourable behind the counter hesitate for a moment, as the 'legal' as a journalist dictator. 
The deregulation and bakalas former bergarbeiterwohnungen are a sensitive issue. 
Before the elections, the from Ostrava deputy speaker he lubomír zaorálek originating from the čssd taken up this issue very loudly, no wonder that, today, the newspapers are full of this. 
Twenty years of "I want to you a new floor." 
'not time ne besch. Wc-brille they could change', makes the aforementioned man air. 
Up to now, according to the staff, are particularly pensioners switch to in order to convince the promised mietermäßigung, whether they really received rpg promises you, if you sign the spezialangebot in good time. 
The benefit of a half reduced februarmiete should also the other tenants, which the new mietvertrag by 15 December. 
Up to now is' deregulierungsschalter "in havířov but everything other than overloaded of follow-up questions. 
'from yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011, because here' value the schalterbeamtinnen. 
Rpg offers both on their websites, as well as wandtafeln individual mietvereinbarungen, where it seems necessary. 
Should the mietparteien but not to the new rent some, will you of an independent court. 
"that is not a threat, but as information on the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach to understand," says rpg on its web sites. 
"This is no one in court," says one of the workers from rpg byty and a man on the street before the klientenzentrum is their right, at least in part. 
"I have welcomed 13, 000 (crowns) pension, I remain 5,000 to eating left, where I should the money for a gerichtsstreit come from," he says. 
Then the employees but uncertain. 
"time." 
'Mr zaorálek says you on the media, they should not sign and waiting for it to the people even' are you to bear in mind. 
The regulated rent ends in the largest part of the Czech Republic to new year 2011 and, according to the mieterhöhung rpg byty is an economic necessity. 
"the existing level of rent is not enough time to the maintenance of the wohnfonds from ', argues Pavel klimeš, the director of the wohnungs-portfolios society rpg byty and - particularly of the disgruntled tenants criticised neglect of the wohnungsfonds is, in the opinion of the main reason for the mieterhöhung homeowners. 
While rpg in the years between 2005 and 2010 collected from the rent four billion could invest in the homes, in the four years from 2011 until 2014, is it to be 5.2 billion. 
On the großformatigen lcd-display to the ceiling to the polstersesseln in warteraum of havířov appear again and again in a few red shining information. 
"The mieterhöhungen in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31 200 homes, which means more than 90% of the homes of rpg." 
This means "always at most 7,50 CZK per square metre and month ', is on the lcd-monitor to read. 
Only in 400 homes from the portfolio of rpg has increased the rent by 38%. 
"in these cases it is the increase in extremely low mietpreise of 19,66 CZK per square metre," argued rpg. 
In 2600 housing remains the rent in the next year at the same level. 
Rpg byty promises that the deregulation of the rent not in leaps and bounds, but gradually within four and eight years ago. 
What is more, the company is imposed on a further obligation: all of the revenue from the mieterhöhung (see graph), the companies in the homes are again, particularly in wärmeersparnisse - in new windows and in the thermal insulation. 
But, primarily, those who benefit from the people, the agreements on the mieterhöhung sign.
