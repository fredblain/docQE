Belarus is in agreement with this, not further weapons-grade uranium accumulate 
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to global security of nuclear material has the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons. 
The deal was in a common statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister, Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the sicherheitsgipfels made known. 
For years, the US Government had tried to convince, Belarus, not more highly enriched uranium and seemed to collect last spring a hurdle to have achieved. 
But official of the US administration told the Washington Post that in the last two months two secret agreement with Belarus have been taken 187 pound weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian forschungsanstalt. 
This concerned the stage for the agreement on Wednesday, the rest of the material to remove - according to an official staff, because of the sensitivity of the issue of anonymous, approximately GBP 500. 
The agreement is one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear summit on security of the 47 nations' in April, the Belarus had excluded. 
And it was obvious good enough, at the invitation of the former Soviet Republic of the next summit of 2012. 
'I was truly thrilled about the fact that it has a seat in the nuclear summit on security (from 2012) want. " 
'This shows me that it works, "said Ken luongo, President of the partnership global security, a group on the promotion of nuclear safety. 
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant and important step 'of Belarus. 
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009, within four years to ensure all precarious nuclear material. 
Since the US administration has helped six countries, their highly enriched uranium to get rid of. 
Belarus will the seventh. 
A dozen countries did it under the Government of George W. Bush. 
In the time of Obama's nuclear summit on security, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that the nation will never abandon their uranium. 
'How retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally waffenfähig, and less enriched uranium, "said Lukashenko does at the time. 
"This is our raw material... we will make no dirty bombs and we will sell it to anybody '. 
"We use it solely for research purposes, that is all." 
Belarus approached, however, a few months ago the United States when it interest in the meeting of an agreement anzeigte. 
The first round of the uranium to remove Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material easy verstrahlt was, say official. 
It has been in a spezialzug load, of the more than 1 300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say official. 
The second attempt was decided on Monday and has been carried out according to the official by plane. 
The US government pays for this effort $14 million, with a large part of the money in the Belarusian research with depleted uranium, which will not be used for nuclear weapons. 
'this was extremely cautious, coordinated and to strengthen confidence, "the to the agreement, which was signed by President Clinton, led, said Andrew bieniawski, a representative of the department, that in the global gefahrenreduzierung works. 
The James Martin centre for nichtweiterzugebende studies estimates that Belarus in this year at least 88 pound waffenfähhigen uranium had, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus will be according to the common agreement camps by 2012. 
The relations between Belarus and the US for years been tense, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights. 
But the statement from Wednesday suggests a possible rapprochement. 
"the progress of this global security issues welcome heißend, the United States of America and Belarus aware that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus is a central theme in the improvement of the bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens', it states.
