PP calls for a postponement of the tax agreement of MAs 
The chairman of the PPC, alicia sánchez-camacho yesterday, took the opportunity, artur MAS personally their conditions to support his first day as Prime Minister of the proposed. These are no different from the already during the election campaign, and may be raised with the absolute priority of the economic recovery and the failure of regionalist unabhängigkeitsabenteuern, as a finanzausgleichsvereinbarung the regionalistische leaders at the height of its mandate wishes to propose to summarise. 
The chairman of the Catalan people's party thus with the safety of artur MAS it by the 18 Members, which they had won last Sunday - a paragraph, which is more than adequate, in order to feel is essential, because the candidate of the bürgerlich-regionalistischen party ciu is dependent on that at least one of the opposition parties during the vote, when he took up office, abstaining. 
The future alliances, the the regionalists in the next parliamentary elections in Congress, intend to depend on a possible Entente with the PP. The talks, the MAS at the time with the other parties leads, however, Catalonia. 
What the leader of the PPC is concerned, this calls for that to support the first day 'all discourse, the the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia concern', as well as an agreement on the financial compensation between the state and the autonomous region - as happens in the Basque country - and the leader of ciu even want to a referendum, at the back. 
Two political leaders is common characteristic of the oversized political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and the level of inheritance and geschenksteuer wish to abolish. 
With the details of the negotiations on the office of MAS, deal from the PPC Jordi cornet and dolors Montserrat. 
MAS has already with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - of a tough opposition announced - and Joan Herrera (icv). Today, it will Joan puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (ciutadans) and Joan laporta (solidaritat catalana).
