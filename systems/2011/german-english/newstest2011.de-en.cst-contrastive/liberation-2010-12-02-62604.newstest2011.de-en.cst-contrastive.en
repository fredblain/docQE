Climate such as France his finanzversprechen amount: 
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to compliance with the quickly resolved financing pledge (also 'almost start' or premature financing mentioned) to investigate the of the developing countries have been realised. 
And are already the gross French vulnerable to blandishments exposed. 
With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries committed to $30 billion between 2010 and 2012. 
The EU has EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France 1.26 billion promised (that is to say EUR 420 million per year). 
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16 has the EU all its partners of the fact of their commitments regarding the fast-start-finanzierungen: detailgetreuer vorgehensbericht to convince the Member States to press conference, great nebenevents, broschürenverteilung. 
The operation transparency is remarkable and extent of their actual value estimated: the developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries do the same for the same präzisionsniveau. 
The EU, announced in the years 2010 to have released EUR 2.2 billion, what they are on the right road to respektbezollung their commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012. 
But if we look into the details, things are a little more complicated. 
This money should be according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new" and, in addition, in order to ensure that an additional use has been tabled, without, at the expense of public aid for development. 
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what 'new and additional' means. 
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonisation, have certain Member States, including France, the procedure is being blocked. 
Today everyone chooses the benchmark that he considers as best. 
The European Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those of 2009: the international financing, for their attacks are maintained, and is within the framework of funding 'fast-start "150 million over three years. 
Other countries have similar indicative values, either as regards year or concerning conditions at the level of public development aid. 
On the other hand, France was of the opinion that the financing 'of all new projects' of the year 2010 "are new, and in addition '. 
In other words, there is no indicative values in the expenditure of the previous year or at a global level of public development aid. 
Specifically, the total amount of the French support of the developing countries remain stable (or decline) - France is, his commitment to the "new and additional 'funding. 
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. 
There is still no rule, and everyone chooses its rechenmodus. 
Some, such as, for example, France, are 1 borrowed €as being equivalent to 1 donated €. 
This is apparently only difficult acceptable that the effort is not comparable. 
If the use of loans for certain profitable investment (and often to the emissionseindämmung tied projects to be based actually technology) cannot be justified, it is illusory to present the euro, known as the equivalent of a donated euro captured... should also only the cost of the loan for the kapitalgeberland as a commitment to be counted (that is the equivalent of the interest rate). 
But France has nothing else in the sense as the following consideration: it 'respect' his commitment of EUR 420 million by 91,5% loans (389,8 million euro) and 8.5% donates) 36,1 million euro) - see the EU documents, in order to convince themselves. 
France is the only country in the EU that loans to a great extent. 
Germany is calling for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands, or Slovakia (among other things) their commitments to 100% with donations. 
In other words, if the vast majority of European Union 1 €to fulfil their obligations, France spends just 10 cents and understands including a comparable efforts. 
Fine hocus-pocus! 
All in all, France in its fast-start-finanzierung operates with a double fraud: a part with a weiterentwicklkung of action over time, and, on the other part with the reality of the financial commitment. 
France manage it, believe that it 420 million "new and additional" million in accordance with its promise has spent, and it saves it 36,1 million euro. 
The manipulation of the Finance Ministry (as it appears that it was Bercy, of the arbitrage has carried out a double) could lead to negative effect; even internally (why the other Member States with the donations, but if there is enough to lend?), and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries is not completely misled... 
The chapter of the premature finance only a small issue in a relatively short time in comparison with the entirety of discussions on the climate. 
But it could the drop of too much in the huge machinery of the UNFCCC. 
We hope that this will not be the case. 
As it always was, it is essential to its lesson from this first year of premature funding to learn. 
First and foremost, France could a change in its verbuchungsart for the years 2011 and 2012, and to do so in a spirit of respect for its commitments and of the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union. 
Above all, however, France could the discussions on the subject of a dispute of the long-term financing forward (another, decisive and now discussed subject): you can escape the question of the 'verrechenbarkeit' or the verbuchungsart its loans not. 
France could change its position as progressive as regards the issues to be, as it is for other things. 
The hope is based, therefore, on the new environment minister Kosciusko-Morizet, the next week in Cancun will arrive. 
A surprising announcement on the fast-start of France and its vision of the "verrechenbarkeit ', and of the use of loans would the international nature, to raise the necessary basis for further discussions.
