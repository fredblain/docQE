In the race for WikiLeaks head 
Obama will appoint a high those responsible for the antiterrorismuskampf on the prevention of new revelations. 
Interpol is a red warning to the persecution and capable of Assange. 
Everything with WikiLeaks and its founders, jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth, in which the only difficult to investigate the facts. 
Interpol yesterday was a 'red warning "to" search and persecution' of Assange. 
However, this is not a traditional orders to arrest. 
In addition, it is not new, it comes from the 20 November. 
It has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse, which the Australians in Sweden. 
It also assured the advocate of the founder of WikiLeaks, mark Stephens, "the police would know where and how they contact with Mr Assange." 
On 20 was already the international police authority with headquarters in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden ordering from, but it was up to yesterday after receiving the power by the Swedish authorities. 
That is the way things are interpol-l채nder. The 188, Assange need to identify and, presumably, "to provisionally arrest and hand it." 
Although Interpol the arrest of a of a red warning affected individual not can impose, many consider Member States according to the organisation of the Red warning as a licence for a arrestierung - the of the national police forces must be carried out, in particular, if you have a bilateral extradition agreements, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange probably. 
The approach is outraged assanges lawyers, the gestures, published a letter in which you about it, that the 39-year-old founders of WikiLeaks is prepared by video conference, the questions of the Swedish authorities to answer. 
They also recall that Assange the departure from Sweden and requested by the prosecutor, the with the sagenumwobenen lavrentiy pavlovich Beria, security chief of Stalin, compared to the corresponding authorisation. 
"This is like a hunting, not as a legal persecution ', will, in the letter. 
While the world is seeking him - and his mother of Australia from the innocence of their son claimed - that Assange in an unknown location to, but not in silence. 
On Monday he was the head of the magazine time by Skype from a vague place from an interview. In the conversation, he called for the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton. 
"if it can be proven that it was responsible for the classification of North American diplomats to spy on the UN and international agreements signed by the United States has broken, they should resign," he said. 
His opinion was yesterday by the pressesekret채r of the White House, Robert Gibbs, condemned, of the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd." 
'I am not sure why we value to the opinion of a type with a website should lay, "he told the CNN. 
Obama himself has a high those responsible for the antiterrorismuskampf, rusell Travers, with the prevention of new dokumentenenth체llungen. 
The attempt by the spokesperson of the pr채sidenden Barack Obama, Assange less attention, is contrary to the opinions, the conservative politicians and commentators in these days. 
Congressman Peter King, the from January the Presidency of the House of Representatives in the national sicherheitskommitee will lead the staatsabteilung, has the possibility to investigate WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organisations, 'in order to put their money to seize and all the support it or to make a contribution to follow. " 
Tom flanagan, consultants, of the Canadian President Stephen Harper, was gone even further, and he had to his statement, Assange "are murdered" revoked. 
"Obama would have to turn it into a target and a not manned flight or so what use." 
Who is not apologising, was Mike Huckabee, baptistischer Minister, a former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate. 
'who it was who in the government information leaked, he is guilty of treason and everything is no execution is eiine to mild punishment, "he told the sender Fox.
