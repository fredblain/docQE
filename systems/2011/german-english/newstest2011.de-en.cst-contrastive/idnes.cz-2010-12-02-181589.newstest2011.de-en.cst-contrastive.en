The army has so many zündschnüre that we could keep the Czech Republic umwickeln but only two years 
The Czech army has 445 kilometres zündschnüre bought with explosives, be released. 
In the year before, the Defense Ministry already 224 kilometres to the armeelager powder. 
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces for 225 years have ausgesorgt. 
The problem is only the shelf-life of zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years. 
The army of the company bought the zündschnüre stv group, other things S. for a mere 40 million kroner. 
In his explanatory statement for the procurement of this huge amount of powder replied the General Staff mf dnes, the soldiers would in a year, the 60 kilometres powder use. 
According to the research of armeepyrotechnikern, the mf dnes point that came from this claim is that the whole army every year a very intensive pyrotechnic training should - of all the generals and officers of the armeekommandos, to the secretaries and Putzfrauen. 
Defense minister Alexandr Vondra and army general picek vlastimil not excluded. 
Only in this way can the substantial annual consumption of 60 kilometres zündschnüren reasonably justified. 
This length is also actually 25,000 detonationen. 
But even so, would these armeebestände for more than ten years. 
But if the old rule of experts is that for the training of each new professional two metres powder is quite sufficient, then the army by these neueinkäufe - even from the point of view of the increased needs of the key and special units - a reassuring supply for the above-mentioned 225 years. 
It complained soldiers of the schnelleinsatzbrigade recently in the Defense Minister Vondra, you would have almost no patronen for small arms register more so that, because of the lack of resources are severely restricted. 
Not to mention the unterhosenmangel. 
'me is also not why they buy such huge amounts of us zündschnüre. " 
But that is, ultimately, its decision, you will already be aware, to what you need '. 
"for us is the army a good customer, which we, as traders to want to come as far as possible ', says the vertriebsmanager the stv group Jan děcký. 
Jan pejšek, the Department of Defense spokesman justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of powder, the army that would have been so for at least ten years with this "ammunition" heckle him. 
Jan děcký of the stv group but talks only of a four-year gebrauchsdauer the zündschnüre and police and armeepyrotechniker even only of two years ago. 
'With perfect storage are probably also the four mentioned years possible', one of them a, but wants to remain turns, not as a soldier accused the criticism of the army. 
After the expiry of the gebrauchsdauer any munitions must be thoroughly tested, whether they are reliable and not the lives of the soldiers at risk. 
These tests are but not for nothing, but cost money. 
A further argument, Department of Defense is the mengenrabatt for the 445 kilometres powder. 
"They cost us 60% less than the letztjährige supply of 244 kilometres," spokesman pejšek shares the view of the US Department of Defense einkäufer with. 
Only by way of comparison, the annual consumption of zündschnüren of pyrotechnikern of the police, the ammunition from the second world war or the Soviet bruderarmee withdraw, exceeds some years already barely 1 500 metres. 
And the police state, not always only such quantities of these munitions which it before the end of the gebrauchsdauer can consume. 
The security of the pyrotechniker, furthermore, because they are so the possibility of flexible purchases more modern and thus also reliable zündschnüre open. 
In any case, the Defense Ministry has huge problems in the winding-up of the tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak people " s army continuously on their campaign on the Rhine prepared. 
According to the pyrotechnikern mf dnes has raised, expected the Czech forces in a few years, the same problem in the winding up of hundreds of kilometres of old zündschnüre you today as "good" has bought.
