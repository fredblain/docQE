For the takeover of excentris staatsanleihe 
The quebecer government by the Société Angus and the companies parallèle was called upon to do it, funding of the adoption of the kinokomplexes excentris to take part, with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive borrowing. 
The entwicklergesellschaft Angus parallèle, as well as the companies, which are a donation of EUR 7 million dollars by the kultusministerium for the adoption of the Daniel Langlois excentris kinokomplexes belonging to the Boulevard saint-laurent had hoped, this again to entrust its actual cineastischen function, clearly not what they have asked. 
The government has accepted, in this case, however, to involve to their own conditions. 
Instead of the expected donation provides the quebecer government rather a loan in less than the amount which initially hoped for a viable solution to the advantageous conditions could, at least according to the state scaremongers entnehmbaren sources. 
A first action plan, as well as a question after 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, which was once again bittgesuch since the overall downwards. 
A proposal, together with an action plan have already been expressed by the President of the "Société de Développement des Entreprises culturelles" (sodec), François macerola, to Minister st-pierre, which the acts excentris. 
A few days ago, he had her a last technical report. 
The counter-proposal of cabinet was the sodec, however, on Wednesday. 
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December, at this time to reply. 
In any case, it seems that the premise of the staatsspende really to have been pushed aside. 
Let us remember that the quebecer eigentümergemeinschaft cinemas and kinokomplexe against a direct staatsinvestition to support the adoption of excentris had revolted by the argument invoked, the Culture Ministers have no financial aid for immobilienprojekte there to do it not also have other cinema. 
Several other market participants of the light, there, on the contrary, the substantial, economic assistance. 
Kinochef Daniel Langlois had the eigenfinanzierten construction of the cinema over ten years the autorenkino with great difficulty in the premises of his kinokomplexes, what the unique position on the part of the public treasury. 
The lack of cinema, the independent films in Montreal, is more than obvious, and excentris was aware of his clients to keep. 
The Société Angus and the company parallèle with Christian yaccarini at the top, taxes, for its part, a privately financed campagne, of which it is a sum 700 000 $hope for the acquisition, in order to stimulate. 
Since the spring of 2009 is only one screen so that continue to show in excentris, films, namely Le parallèle. 
The aim of the future acquirer is it, the three kinosäle on 27 February of next year with the demonstration of the very successful film of Xavier beauvois' of the hommes et des dieux 'new. 
Christian yaccarini but has the newspaper 'Le devoir "not removed, and it ignores what he and his group of the corrected downwards, we believe that the proposals you have made.
