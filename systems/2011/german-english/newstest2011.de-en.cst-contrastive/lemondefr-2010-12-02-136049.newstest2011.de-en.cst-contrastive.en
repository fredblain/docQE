Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the elysée-palast exaggerates its mittlerfunktion for Syria 
In the space of more than six months, of July 2009 to May 2010, considered the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher, the in Iran for "spying" has been laid down in the French public life, left the diplomacy in alert and akzentuierte the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran. 
All of this under the thoughtful look the diplomats of the United States. 
The by WikiLeaks and received by the newspaper 'Le Monde' durchgesehenen American documents some background to this crisis price. 
You describe how the Elysée the Americans had declared its strategy, which, as far as this advice to deal with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of wanderern). 
They show, as the French leaders have tried to convince, Washington that the liberation of young French person, not the release of Majid kakavand, one in France and held prisoner by the American justice because of trade with material in favour of the Iranian nuklearprogrammes fugitive iraners to gegeleistung have. 
After all, the way in which the French Presidency for the media to manipulate the purposes, has tried to make this the idea credible, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad have a central role to play in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, played in a harsh light. 
In truth, he had done nothing in this respect. 
A on 12 August 2009 in Paris redigiertes diplomatentelegramm bears the title 'Iran: French comments about the way of dealing with hostage taking. " 
François richier, elysée-berater -- is maintained in the company of Patrice paoli, Director of the Quai d 'orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen allegrone. 
They declared her French method. 
The advised the Americans to do everything to ensure that their own nationals, the violently rückzuführen held in Iran. 
"power noise ', they said,' articulated loud and clear, without letting up ', the words' grundmenschenrechte ',' innocence ',' immediate release 'in the media. 
This is necessary in order to the Iranian regime to embarrass, the very sensitive to its image. 
"policy, all the more so given that you ask the Iranians that not to do so '. 
Because 'silence solves nothing', over the diskussionsversuche on on unauffälligem ways, the Iranians are "masters in ausweichmanövern." 
Mr richier adds that the detention of foreigners a "normal, Iranian tactics" was: 'hostage taking for political blackmail'. 
It announces the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which should be reached on 16 August, on the day that they are in the French embassy vanishes) 'demand the payment of a large payout to the Iranians' (230,000 Euro bail). 
And he does state that the Elysée antizipiere further hostage taking, a phenomenon that, "will exacerbate." 
Could the Iranians' in the near future, a other of the approximately 1,800 French citizens arrest, living in Iran, "he said. 
28 August 2009. 
Clotilde Reiss is twelve days been released from jail, will, however, continue to in Iran. 
An information has been in circulation, the Iranians Majid kakavand, whose extradition to the United States because of illegal trade in empfindlichem elektronikmaterial to Iran, is after decision of a judge in Paris has been released from detention. 
The American Embassy is, as many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence. 
For Washington, that the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material envisaged for the nuclear programme, is the release of Majid khakavand a bad news. 
France has a horse trading in? 
The liberation of the iraners against the French person? 
On the occasion of a further meeting with Kathleen allegrone on 4 September François richier assured that this was not the case. 
The Elysée, he says, was not just 'completely surprised by the decision of the judge, "but have also tried, against the authorities. 
"It has a rain exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice ' (currently given Michèle Alliot-Marie), but" the French government can do not change the judicial decision, "he says. 
Mr richier would also like to point out that Majid kakavand to remain under 'strict' supervision of the French secret service. 
The elysée-berater opts for a telephone number, sets back on, then informed the American diplomat, the Iranians' is currently in the chair of the Iranian Embassy buildings in Paris. " 
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran the Elysée not spare its efforts, through statements and of the media organized "fluchtversuche" believe, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad Games a "important" and "influential role as mediator." 
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and conclude that the manipulation bears fruit, since several articles in the press the official French version. 
A on 25 August 2009 datierendes telegram rebellion evokes "the medienblitz of the French authorities'. 
What is based so much "dankesbezeugung 'to Mr Assad, the Paris message. 
"despite their statements give full lobpreis tacitly to the French authorities that they have only a vague idea about what the syrier actually have done '. 
The document also deals with the reasons that have led the Elysée this fiction to lapse. 
The intensive communication efforts' aims, Sarkozy's policy of opening up towards Syria to confirm, "he analysed. 
Policy, launched a 2008, the then "of numerous kritikerstimmen, in France and in the outside world as premature and unverdient was perceived '. 
"The Syrian role aufbauschend 'attempts Paris" Syria, we can achieve what belobigung by a constructive role in the region'. 
The aim is, moreover, "discord between Syria and Iran to sow." 
The American Embassy know this from good source. 
On 11 August François richier had to her, "of course we do not know whether the syrier whatever have '. 
"But we have, in spite of everything, we thank you. ' 
"this should at least cause confusion on the part of the Iranians'. 
Clotilde Reiss, on 16 May 2010 back to France. 
Nicolas Sarkozy it receives in the Elysée. 
In a communiqué thanks it the President of Brazil, of Senegal and Syria for its active role in favour of the release of our fellow countryman. "
