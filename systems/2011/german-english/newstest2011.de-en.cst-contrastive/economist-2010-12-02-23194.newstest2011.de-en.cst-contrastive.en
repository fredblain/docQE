In the middle of secretly 
In the weeks after the sudden death of their man was told Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy which their beliebtheitsrate by 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest value since your election in 2007. 
However, whether you do in the next year to a re-election provides, depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández compromise than their deceased husband, your predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner. 
The signs are not clear. 
Néstor Kirchner, even after the election of his wife the economic policy, was often budgets in the tax revenues, economic growth and inflation is not fully into account. 
This allowed the präsidentenpaar, the extraeinnahmen spend as it sees fit. 
On paper, the fernández-regierung last year the majority in Congress. 
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October has led to further divisions. 
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández. 
But after chaotic meetings (in which a parliamentarian another in the face of other proposed, and the Government of the bribery accused), the Congress not to adopt the budget for 2011. 
"I will not discuss', as the President. 
The 2010 budget applies now for the next year, which the President has an even greater opportunity to spend money as they see fit. 
The economy is hotly: probably will it this year by up to 9% increase. 
The official inflation rate is z.z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - are pushing the value to nearly 30%. 
Kirchner, the 2003 the took office as Argentina of economic crises ridden growth and poverty reduction, said to his primary objectives, and not the inflationssenkung. 
He refused to the cooperation with the IMF, the private sector and säuberte has singled out for bullying as the National Institute for statistics and census, which then indec official inflationsstatistiken schönte. 
Fernández now can we route? 
It has the private sector and the trade union leaders, called upon to talks. 
And official statements according to that wage increases in the next year to 18% should be limited. 
The high prices for Argentina's agricultural products have been a strong boost to the economy. 
But the burst of inflation undermined by a great devaluation in the year 2002. 
Perhaps for this reason Cristina Fernández would like to Argentina and back to the rest of the world. 
At the beginning of this year, the government an agreement with shareholders holding the former debt restructuring of the country in the year 2001 had rejected. 
Now it seems that Fernández on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club to which it owes around $6.7 billion. 
The Kirchners have had a review by the IMF elsewhere, as usual, been rejected. 
But in the last month, the Finance Minister Amado boudou known that the fund in the drawing up of a new national consumer price index "technical support '. It looks as this would be the first step towards the cleansing of the indec. 
It is not known whether Fernández after the end of its term of office, even without the support of their husband politically active will be. 
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which is largely by the kirchnerismus has enough. 
If the Argentines from their summer holiday in March, will return to the wave of sympatie, it was shown to be fizzled. 
If you would like to gain a further election, it must decide whether it many political choices of its man quietly lifted.
