A knochenhaus fascinated even after 100 years. If you look at the interieure of Gaudi to 
The roof seems to be as the backs of prehistoric echse, the stairs as the vertebral column of a dinosauriers and the balkone are aufgerissene fischmäuler. 
That is the Casa batlló of Catalan architects Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. 
Of the local inhabitants experienced the House with its organic forms the nicknamed "knochenhaus." 
Organic forms, wild paints, the unusual use of stone, kachelsplittern and to shed "jigsaw creating false fronts and ubiquitous soft lines, all this are typical features for the jugendstil of Antonio Gaudi. 
The façade of the House is playing with beautiful lines, zärtlichen paints and texturen in nature and living beings. 
Only if we look carefully noted that everything of geometry rhythm and profound order dominated. 
In the night, the whole façade still plastic, dramatic and the special anleuchtung reinforces the glory of the colours. 
The same dynamic lines and tortuous forms dominate the home of the House. 
Creates ripple geformtes wood being copied the window frames, support, zierelemente of doors, even gucklöcher and. 
The House batlló in quarter eixample in a crowded einkaufsstraße passeig de grácia no 43 was created by the reconstruction of a house from the years 1877, the architects Emilio sala cortese said. 
The reconstruction, two years and was concluded detailed. 
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he voted the idea gaudís on an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction. 
The mietshaus Casa outlined batlló Antoni Gaudí, however, not only. 
He worked with the architects José Maria jujol together. 
It is precisely on the drawing board the dekorationen created for representative home of the realitätenbesitzers and also the use of mosaiken to the façade was his idea. 
In the design of the façade worked also, however, many other bildner and artists with. 
The joint work of the drafts of the Casa batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation of jujola and Gaudí. 
So jujol also participated in the construction of gaudís House Casa milá in the park güell, where the further work by Antoni Gaudí. 
Shortly after his completion experienced the House of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the nicknamed "knochenhaus." 
Others called it the specific fensteröffnungsmechanismus because of the "yawning House '. 
It also says that at the top of the building is the sword of holy Georg, of the existence of Catalonia. 
But also further bildhauerische elements symbolise hidden religious motives. 
Gaudí outlined for the House for the time unique zentralheizungssystem with entlüftungskanälen and typical kaminen. 
A little bizarre is their 45-grad-neigung already. 
In his create Gaudí consistently ignored all then building regulations and could not be deterred by this. 
Before baubeginn Holte it from the city of the appropriate planning a but the claims made on the planned reconstruction were so vague that the stadtväter two years later in the implementation so horrified by the result was that they were asked to remedy. 
The ratsherren is met with, among other things, that the construction, with its pillars, even in the public pavement intervention. 
To amendments, we, however, not more, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the call of the stadtviertels, Josep batlló a request for approval of the lease of the two höchstgelegenen floors of the House - and it has been granted him promptly. 
The homeowner itself, in the lower echelons of a. 
In the gallery, in 2 stock was a gesellschaftssalon, on the third floor were the bedroom and privaträume of housing. 
The ground floor was a juweliergeschäft leased. 
The whole sechsstöckige buildings is going through a stairs, right up to the dachterrasse. 
Through the fundamental elements of the adaptation were all right corner and dead straight lines and removed and replaced by gebogene geschwungene walls. 
Gaudí worked but also with a modern approach to mutual connection of places. 
The social part is, by opening the salontüren completely and, therefore, a large society convenient plaudern, without in vertraulicheren talks on a certain degree of privacy. 
The House was given by gaudís restructuring out of a new front also a rather unusual thing roof and two further floors. 
Impressive is also gaudís game with the light, as well as the blue and White glasierten kacheln with which the courtyard packets is and the lichthöfe. 
The game of these two colours gives all floors of the House a maximum of light. 
In this he made simply to take advantage of the principle that know better reflect the light, as a dark paints, the sunlight on the contrary to absorb. 
The House Casa batlló, the 2005 in the welterbe-liste UNESCO has been included, can today everyone visits. 
In the first stock is the geräumigste and prächtigste housing accessible to the public. 
The homeowner determined only in the years to this step and that on the occasion of the 150.geburtstags of the famous creator. 
As you said, that this is a very profitable business activities, the surveys in, indeed we extended it to other common and the dachgeschossräume, including the dachterrasse. 
The price to visit the baudenkmals, however, is no trifling matter, it is 16,50 euro, students, pensioners, groups and holders of touristenausweisen get 20% reduction. 
This amount exceeds the eintrittspreise to other gaudí-bauten in the city. 
Who the real atmosphere of the House with his drachentürmchen know would like to learn, should try, friendship with one of the inhabitants to close to home and to visit him.
