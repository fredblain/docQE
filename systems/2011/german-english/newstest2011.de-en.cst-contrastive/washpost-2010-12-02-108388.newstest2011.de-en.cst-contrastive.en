Moscow us-dokument durchgesickertes portrayed as a port of corruption 
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy 'and you are a part of the bribes and of the schutzgeldes that you einsammelt, further to the Kremlin. As reported in February the American embassy in Russia in a memo. 
Both police and blackmail the staatssicherheitsdienst high protection money so that they can keep expensive standard of living in Moscow, as it says. 
They collect money not only of legitimate business, but also of organised criminal gangs. 
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as a "vertical the authority" - takes its part of the money that the head to the top. 
The memo, which under the name of Ambassador John beyrle to Washington, was broadcast on Tuesday of WikiLeaks published on its website. 
The memo is based on sources, whose names have been redigiert. 
It was written, while still Moscow's mayor Yuri Luzhkov was, and it accuses him of corruption. 
He was in October of President Dmitry Medvedev fired, but there is little evidence that, in the meantime, would have been cleared up. 
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena baturina, a well-known construction company has over the years, have always rejected accusations of corruption, and he has won many verleumdungsklagen against such accusations. 
In September, he declared a Russian TV stations, when he was asked for a documentation, which suggests that he is corrupt: "It is crazy, it is bad way, it is dirty." 
. An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. The have surveys show. 
But it is extraordinary that, as in the report of the ambassador, individuals are mentioned, and it is unheard, that this by a diplomats of a foreign country. 
"The direct link to the government of Moscow with the crime has led to some it as' disrupted call 'and to the conclusion that the government is more like a kleptokrat as a government," the memo. 
'criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminal / the mafia, which literally "roof" or protection means) on the police, the state security (FSB), the dienstaufsichtsbehörde (MVD) and the office of the public prosecutor, as well as covered by the whole of the Moscow regierungsbürokratie. 
Experts have a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow. 
"Luzhkov is paramount." 
"FSB and MVD, the militia are on the second stage." 
'least consequences the ordinären criminals and the criminal inspectors at the bottom. " 
"This is a inkompetentes system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap, because the city of no help." 
The report goes on to say that the FSB money from the largest firms from the police and the small business people arrested. 
One source, that is to say, "declared that Moscow shopkeepers understand that it is best, the protection of the FSB and MVD (and not by organised crime), as they not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law '. 
"This is the reason why the protection by criminal gangs not more so asked as before '. 
The memo noted that, while the collection of the money is comprehensive, the protection itself very be modest no; even the, the figures are sometimes arrested. 
The who do not pay their business, find very quickly - on the basis of one or other vorwands. 
Medvedev has spoken about this on several occasions, to fight corruption, but at the same time, has said that he has made very little progress. 
The message the memo contains descriptions of men, the with with suitcases full of money, probably, in the Kremlin. 
"in his fight against corruption must Medvedev to leave the bureaucrats," said finds satarov, Director of by Moscow, a committee of experts, in a recent interview. 
'But he is part of this bureaucracy. " 
"It is not part of the political class, because a political class in Russia no longer exists." 
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable. 
Nationally, costs, as is estimated by the corruption Russia more than $300 billion per year. 
The country is in place 154 a recent investigation into the global perception of the corruption by the non-governmental organisation transparence international (countries will be of 'least corrupt "to" most corrupt'). 
The revelation of the memos the US Embassy in Moscow time evening, what happened, will certainly displeasure within the Russian Government, although, as Luzhkov for the mistakes of Moscow can be accused of, it for the Kremlin can also be a possibility to claim that it will resolve the problems. 
In an interview with Larry King for CNN Putin claimed that the wikileaks-dokumente could be a counterfeiting and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats him Batman and Medvedev Robin mentioned. 
"The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country is," he said. 
"But, to be quite honest, we would not have expected that this would happen with such arrogance, with a kind of pressure and to so unethical way know it."
