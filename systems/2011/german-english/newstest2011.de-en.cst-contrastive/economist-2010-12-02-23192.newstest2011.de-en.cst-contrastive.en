The demokatrische routine 
The democracy movement in Latin America will more, as the support of private companies. 
Crime is a greater problem than the unemployment. 
In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil larger than that of the United States. 
This outcome was the latinobarómetro-umfrage in 18 countries and carried out exclusively in the economist has been published. 
Since 1995, this survey is being carried out regularly and shows that the meinungswechsel in this region. 
Two facts in the year's survey of September and October particularly in 's eye. 
Firstly, the good mood in Latin America 
And, secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions. 
In many countries of the South American pazifikküste has greatly increased the democratic movement (S. table 1). 
In Peru, for example, where the economy since 2002 by around 6% is growing every year, the number of demokratiebefürworter of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. 
In Mexico, where the economy since the strong collapse in the last year recovers, is such a trend. 
But only half of the people polled in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries of the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (S. graph 2). 
Around 44% of the respondents said that you with the democratic practice of their country to be satisfied. That is as much as in the last year, however, 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3). 
Some 34% trust the Congress of your country and 45% of their government. Both values are those of last year, but a sharp increase from 2003 (17% and 24%). 
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined the efforts to bring more democracy. 
The so during the Great Depression, thanks is probably that the countries of Latin America experienced only a brief recession, and a speedy recovery. 
In addition, the poor by a stronger sozialnetz instead. 
(according to reports of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America from this week, 2009, the level of poverty in Latin America only slightly and is again this year by 32%.) 
But from country to country, there are strong stimmungsunterschiede (S. graph 4). 
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread fortschrittsdenken. 
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more tangible and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case. 
Only the second time since umfragebeginn see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country is a greater problem than in the unemployment (S. graph 5). 
Some 31% say that either they or a family member in the last year have been victims of a crime, but to 38% in the last year are the values and thus achieve the lowest level since 1995. 
The rising economic performance is reflected in the increase in support of the private and the market economy: around 71% of the respondents überregional stated that the private sector is essential for development, in 2007, it was 56% (S. graph 6). 
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy their country can bring progress, compared with 47% in the last year. 
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela this view maintained (and 80% are for a private sector), even though its left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, many private companies nationalized. 
Brazil has according to 19% of the respondents (18% in the last year) the greatest emphasis in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% in the last year). 
The people polled in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, and this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela will be accepted.
