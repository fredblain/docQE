The FIFA World Cup 2018-2022 appoints the in: 
In a state of great excitement because of corruption will appoint the Executive Committee of the FIFA World Cup on Thursday the ausrichterländer 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice, in which the rangeln for influence and the lobbying the technical criteria to press in the background. 
One thing is certain: the issuing 2018 the accepted the FIFA will in Europe, of their traditional stronghold, take place (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, spanien-portugal, niederlande-belgien). 
The issuing 2022 will then be something for exotic; the International Football Federation hopes, after the first on the African continent in the years 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) for themselves to win, or its establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to continue to pursue. 
The list of personalities, loyalty to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) is the level of economic and political use of a World Cup. 
The machinations behind the scenes, therefore, face up to the last minute. 
Difficult otherwise, a hierarchy of candidates. 
After the an evaluation report of FIFA, the English, offer spanisch-portugiesische (2018) and American (2022) acts bessseren arguments than those of their competitors. 
But these considerations will be for the 22 members of the exekutifkommitees the moment of choice is not as great. 
The Sunday Times, the with the achievement of the suspension of two members of the exekutifkommitees (reynald temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, might as well the opportunities for their own country, cradle of football, can ruin, the only once the World Cup was allowed to thrash out, namely in 1966. 
The BBC was once again the on Monday breeding ground by you own had a broadcast, of the three influential members of the kommitees, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas leoz and Issas hayatou under attack. 
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and the English responsible to embarrass, in the first place, with David Cameron in these last few weeks an intensive lobbying. 
The head of government hopes for a relaunch of the from his predecessor, Tony Blair successful schachzuges, the London in 2005 for the organisation of the Olympic Games 2012 had reached. 
This intensive use would be sufficient to the image of England before the kommitee revalue again? 
Nothing is less safe, because the duo spanien-portugal does not lack assets, with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its fußballkultur. 
But the economic and financial downside of the two countries could dampen their ambitions. 
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal to the opportunities of Russia, which, despite its shortcomings in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) to the weighty outsiders, increase. 
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has, however, decided, the unumwundenen suggestion on the bezichtigungen the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote 'on the part of the kommiteemitglieder condemned. 
"You bewirft you with dirt, trying to compromise," Putin raged. 
The United States for 2022 seem, strengthened by the experience of 1994, the logical favourites. 
First, the headquarters of the fifa-hauptsponsoren economic world power, the country seems a long list of benefits to Japan and South Korea which separately have set a very good project. 
But this new nominations seem premature for two countries, the competitions co-organised had in 2002. 
Another threat: the FIFA World Cup allocation of the long-awaited 2026 for China and the Asian opportunities on 2022 lapses. 
With Australia and Qatar, that with the aufwartung futuristischer stages of all, is following the FIFA had their extension in the direction of new areas, however, these two countries a greater risk, because certainty. 
Australia might as well as Japan and South Korea under the of the European countries akquittierten weakness of television rights (due to the zeitverschiebung), the sensitive nerve FIFA.
