Kowtow to the European Central Bank (ECB) 
Yesterday the investors responded strongly to the threat of the ECB President, Mr Trichet, the warned, "the markets should not underestimate our capacity to react." 
The risk premia the euro-peripheriländer are increased dramatically and the shares of the European banks is more than 5%. 
We should, however, the possibility that the ECB and the euro fooled can hardly points, which has led to the concern, not to be underestimated. 
The events of yesterday are typical of a illiquid market, to the extent that it breaks down are recovered, however, as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.

The Bundesbank, called for must of the plan for the purchase of government debt, as they are ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquiditätsmaßnahmen. It should only a einwöchiger permanent access be maintained. 
After the irland-krise, we expect that the current liquiditätsmaßnahmen 'at least until March' extended and the quarterly invitations to tender with unbegrenztem access on quartalsende to ensure the liquidity at least until June to be maintained. 
We also expect that the programme for the purchase of bonds continue and a stärkendes signal will be spent. 
If the created expectations are not met, the excellent response of the markets of yesterday set back again and if halstarrig insistence that we withdraw our liquiditätsmaßnahmen, can only God help us! 
Just as with the ezb-sitzung in May, in which the Bank reiterated, the purchase of staatschuldpapieren not to consider the markets and then collapsed, could this history repeat tomorrow.

The sum is to about 10 000 million in the short term and possible further 15 000 estimated. There is time to February, in order to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalised. 
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after the problem with the stress tests in July had not recognised, the figures in the framework of the rescue plan, acceptable and help to reduce, the uncertainty. 
However, the government on Tuesday the parliamentary assent to his new budget. As they still do not have the sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.

The sabbatical year Zapatero and Mr Trichet, explains why the Spanish stock exchange by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges. 
In comparison with the February was the response of the government and the Spanish central bank quickly and convincing, and we will benefit from the surprise result. 
Today there is a crucial auction a three-year bond, which might the benefits from trichet-effekt. That is why we will draw on a strong demand that all the doubts about our umschuldungsfähigkeit will remove. 
For Spain would be the application of a hilfsplans a self-sacrifice. 
We would liquidity, which we do not need. The Treasury has EUR 40 billion available, three times as much as in the march. The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would without any notice closed.

Only courage that we create!
