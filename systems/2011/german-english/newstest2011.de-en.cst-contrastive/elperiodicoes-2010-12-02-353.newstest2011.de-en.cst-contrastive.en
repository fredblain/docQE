Zapatero and the red line of Germany 
Berlin has decided for keeping the euro but, at the same time, conditions for the whole of the European Union. 
The tension on the markets have a dual response of the government. 
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation measures presented, starting with reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of work agencies or the lifting of 426 euro support for the unemployed, the no unemployment benefit, to the privatisation of 49% of the management of airports, AENA Barajas and El Prat and 30% of state lottery. 
On the other hand, the Deputy Prime Minister who supported, Elena Salgado, with the aid of the former regierungspräsidenten Felipe González, the criticism of the Chancellor, Angela Merkel, as responsible that the current crisis have herausbeschwört. 
How are these events to understand? 
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their public relations. 
On the contrary, it is about a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro. 
It is Germany a fundamental new perspective to shape our future, the with the retention of the ancient traditions of much of its partners. 
In view of the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis to spekuliern. 
The first: a strong euro, with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South would have to leave the euro area. 
The second: the reintroduction of the German mark - although that currently, rather, for science fiction sounds -, supported by a large proportion of public opinion, around 50% of the population. 
The third: a transformation of the euro in accordance with German proposals, which means: more macroeconomic control; strict financial management; punishment of the countries which are invading the benchmarks; möglichereweise the default of some countries, and the extension of the costs of potential adaptation measures on the private sector. 
The German position is clear and is for some time already. That is why there is now no excuses. 
First, in 2009, as both the IMF, as well as the European Commission incentives for deficits created and the German Government drew up from a constitutional reform, in order to prevent it from 2016. 
That was the first signs of the polarisation between what Germany was thought necessary (strict steuerpläne and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. 
The second signal, a central European country, as Merkel the decision to rescue of Greece hinausschob painful. 
At that time, it was the criticism, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion absolutely against a rescue of Greece. 
Finally, Merkel in the last oktobertagen again with a clear position; it calls for a reform of the agreements of the European Union, in order to allow the saving of a country and, at the same time, the private lenders to commit to a part of the cost. 
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, because they are the irlandkrise and all the following through on. 
But your proposal, if somewhat sweetened, was accepted in the next few months we will be on the reform of the European Union, which should allow these measures from 2013. 
Germany has a red line, not to exceed the it does. 
It says all that - even if now unpopular measures have to be made - it from that date the old functioning of the euro will not be. 
2013 will the geburtsjahr of a new currency zone, in which the zuwiderhandelnden countries be severely punished, can be forced to declare itself bankrupt, and in this case the private sector must take a share of the costs. 
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard path of growth, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improve the productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances. 
The other alternative, the on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments is based, as was mentioned by Spain in boom times, simply will not be tolerated. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would be a bad thing to do to it not to understand. 
It is not just a question of the general government deficit until the year 2013 to three per cent runterzufahren. 
The demands are much tougher. 
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, is ourselves to cheat. 
I hope that the current turbulence in more calm. 
And that we take the opportunities offered to us by the spring of 2013, make use of. 
It seems that Zapatero has taken this so well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) points out that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, its own house in order, to create their way has been. 
But the of Germany was not bold enough red line is there, and it does not seem that change. 
Under the contemplating opportunities is that we the with little serious countries fully gestopften euro area, cannot be ruled out. 
In this case, could Germany are still say that it have warned us.
