Dear in times of war 
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer with the work on her still nameless Regiedebüt begun, there is anger. 
The script, she has written a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man. 
We know a lot more about it - but that is enough for unrest. 
The rumour persists, the woman, a Muslim, Verliebe during the war in Yugoslavia their Serbian rapists. 
Bosnian women's associations have immediately protested, and some in Sarajevo planned Drehtage short term were transferred to Hungary. 
The film is marginalised in Hungary and is now in the post-production, but it will still protested in Bosnia. 
Bakira Hasecic female war victims wrote about the organisation of the UN refugee agency UNHCR of Jolie and requesting for a meeting with the actress, now a Bosnian newspaper has reported, Jolie is itself ambassador of UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerks. 
Diplomatically, it is not - the women weeks she has been a meeting in Hungary, which offered but rejected. 
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic. 
Love stories in rape camps have not been, and Jolie attitude towards the victims betraying her enough on the script. 
According to the UN refugee agency has recommended their organisation, Jolie as Ambassador to dismiss, told the Guardian. 
But what exactly has Jolie for scenes written? 
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, the their script to read, has given a Drehgenehmigung for Sarajevo - it is not clear why after some to-ing and still not occurred. 
The young author even claimed that they have no political intentions with their film, with great effort, incorporated into the Yugoslav conflict has wanted to show the terrible consequences of the war and all of the parties involved a voice. 
The content, however, remains vague. 
So too a second Synopsis on film in the network, which sounds pretty different: Loving knew already war break out and when they meet again, a Bosnian Muslim, abducted in a Serbian Camp, where he works as a vigil. 
What sounds is significantly different than the variant "rape victims verknallt torturer". 
Jolie film actually begins before the war - that much is certain. 
The pressure on them, as Jolie, was "unfair and is based on misinformation." 
They can give their well only the hackers from Hollywood peace: By now the script, as so many before it, illegally put on the network.
