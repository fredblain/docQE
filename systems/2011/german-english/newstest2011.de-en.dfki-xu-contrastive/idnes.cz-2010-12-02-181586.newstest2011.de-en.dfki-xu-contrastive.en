More and more parents want people to have the kids under control surveillance devices 
The fear for our own children, and so consider more and more parents are to monitor by GPS. 
The system, which was originally invented for tracing cars that can equally well people locate what would be helpful in cases such as the trail recently unemployed disappearance of nine-year Anička Janatková. 
The device is about as large as a packet of cigarettes but soon it will be no bigger than a wristwatch. 
Many people, the case of the missing Anička in a funk and so they are looking for ways to better protect their children. 
For the price of a violation of their privacy. 
"We are trying to say that it is not all around pioneers, but an effective way to reduce the likelihood that it leads to tragedy", Petr Pilin society Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market. 
"I admit that it cannot abuse of such devices, for example, if you know someone in the pocket, without it, but so far we have had no such case." 
"Most customers buy it really," Pilin adds, for security reasons. 
In his opinion, should the child but always know what purpose the "box" and how they are used in an emergency. 
The Kinderpsychologin Dana Bočková notes, however, that if a child is such a thing may not wear, it simply emptied. 
"Even very small children show great creativity, when it comes to certain things deliberately to lose if they do not want to be controlled." 
"The phones awoke initially great expectations among parents, but they can be just as easy, as this new surveillance equipment," says Mrs Bočková. 
Their opinion is also questionable whether such a body in the event of an attack really help. 
"At Planned abduction, the kidnappers almost always checked whether the child has any electronics, it could be located." 
"Today is the mobile phone." 
"If such monitoring equipment wider use, they also because their sales would certainly accompanied by massive advertising". 
"In these cases, the criminals are always a step ahead of the police," says psychologist. 
It acknowledges that similar devices in a sudden attack by a paedophile can be extremely helpful. 
Roberta Čech RC monitoring by society, according to the tracking services offers both for cars for individuals, the existence of such an appliance can then help, even if it destroys immediately after the attack. 
"The device is that it is hiring the respective position at certain intervals reported." 
"Even if it would be destroyed, at least the final position of the person involved is available immediately." 
"In more expensive equipment is even a Neigungsmesser integrated, in other words, if you are going hinfällt and movement, the device sends a warning immediately indicate the position," said Mr Čech. 
His opinion, similar services could also smart phones with navigation, it just needs a special software einzuspielen. 
The problem with the current positioning equipment is that it is either equipment in matchbox-size, similar to the supporters or smaller mobile phones. 
There is always the risk that they will lose. 
Mr Pilin of the Macro Weil, it therefore testing devices, which look like ordinary digital clocks in the present. 
"This has the advantage that the possible attackers do not realise that it is a monitoring and tracking device. 
"Or he realises what the police only after a certain time, a time lead there," he adds. 
Regardless of the direction in which the development - Armbändern or trailers, as always, the same technology used in vehicle tracking. 
So The combination of positioning function through the GPS system (just as the Ms in the car) and the function of a mobile phone, which the current position.
