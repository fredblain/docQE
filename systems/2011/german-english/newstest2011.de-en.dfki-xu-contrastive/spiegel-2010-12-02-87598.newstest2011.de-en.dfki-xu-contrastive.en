To hell, warriors. 
Splatter fits the art of cinema? 
The director Nicolas winding Refn testing with his fighters-epic "Walhalla Rising" old genre-borders. 
In what may the Danish director Nicolas winding Refn have thought, as he "Walhalla Rising" has? 
A captured Vikings-warriors with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) freed themselves from his Peinigern and places with almost superhuman powers rushed his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody Action, precisely because our hero like rough killing methods and its enemies to Gedärme leap from the vibrant limb when he has bad-tempered. 
On the other hand, says Einauge, as it is called, the whole film about a word, and the other characters can at most be to one or two sentences or a few painful death shouting. 
Otherwise, kept silence and in the gruselig fine Hügellandschaft Scotland geschwelgt, the Wikingerwelt offers of around a thousand years ago the scene. 
Ideal more for adult Cineasten with interest for Existentialismus and very calm camera journeys. 
Well, if a film has several target groups, it is a pity if they are mutually exclusive. 
Orchestrator winding Refn applies since his wild and gestylten drug dealer trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but refuses stoically, his works with a little more mainstream humour or a little less brutality the Arthouse accessible. 
Most art cinema-friends are around the spritzenden brain mass and the Gedärmen deterred. 
The Action-fans will die from boredom, if Einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship after Jerusalem arousing popular and is an eternity in the doldrums and fog before the team arrives in America and there remains silent. 
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany has found no cinema-distribution and now only on DVD. 
This is particularly the magnificent pictures a shame, but also because, behind the prätentiösen until bluttriefenden facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention. 
In This film is not about dialogues or a stringent action, it is all atmosphere, a film a fever dream. 
And there is no escape for the spectators. 
Refn takes him barely a moment of détente and drawn him with his icy images and the dark drift-like sound track very slowly cut the throats, but above all with the incredible hatred of him from the heart of the characters. 
Only a small blonder boy, the Einauge faithful, retains a presumption that all others are driven by anger. 
The vast majority of the one-eyed man hero whose motives are never explained, but may be ambassador for enemies and temporary allies will eventually warriors from the hell of the devil himself. 
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the Verdorbenen anyway. 
"Walhalla Rising" is an unexplained film you hate and admire, upset and annoyed, gee. 
An experience.
