Sport and usually bypass 
Tricks as Alonso and Ramos in the match against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the desire to bypass a sanction. 
The supposedly from two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) has instigated exclusion in the game on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League led to much ink has been shed about, whether it was a unsportliche act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA. 
As is well known, lost two players a few minutes before game end (their team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls, now the second yellow card by referee showed. 
In this way, and since the Real Madrid his group, the two players would meet the prescribed sanction the next league game against Auxerre and without maps in the next game phase. 
Finally, the Disziplinarkommitee of UEFA, the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different sums of money. 
The provocation of a yellow card in this or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football. 
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed in the sport's rules. 
Part of the debate that have arisen outlined the case goes back to that a team of football clubs, Real Madrid (his anthem Edelmut claims and honour and on other occasions his players for similar incidents had punished) played the key role, and the drama by Mourinho, the episode has added to its long history, more than theatralischer and provocative technicians. 
In any case, the debate about whether this is not explicitly prohibited by the statutes behaviour contradicts the principles of the sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a rule circumvention. indeed, this approach to the statutes of the sport, but its meaning. 
The damage caused to the sporting spirit should be examined in this matter. 
The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that was not compromised by these actions, because there was no aggressive game. 
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that to ban players an unjustified. Also benefits from the team that has not been done. 
The paradox of the action of Real Madrid's players is that they do not correspond to what we normally under wrong game or rule bypass understand, because the circumvention of the rule has not been secretly, in order to avoid a penalty, but it should be as conspicuous as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. 
The players waited and took the sanction happily. 
Another question is what kind of advantage the offender from the deliberate fouls. 
It should be emphasised that the rival either in a disadvantageous position was still benefits for the feigned game were erheischt because the obvious result of this action was that the team with fewer players had to play. 
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because then the club does not have these players. 
Obviously The advantage is that the players the next phase of the Champions League game without tickets, their participation in a future game could begin. 
But it is a long-term, up to a certain point uncertain advantage because the team could eventually retire. With this approach, players also receive a sanction and go in the second cycle on cards, because card accumulation with a card less than in the first cycle of departures. 
So it is not clear whether it is really an advantage. 
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the sporting spirit, also include strategic decisions from the rules a maximum benefit. 
In this case the players wanted to avoid any penalty (that would actually be a clear case of rule bypass), they wanted more when they undergo this. 
They took a strategic decision, without a sentence or to flee before her. 
Although the border between imagination and Regelumgebung is, I believe, that this is a clear case of inventiveness. 
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: Because two exclusions and because of the way the provoking Regelübertragung. 
The damage done to the principles of the sport by these acts is less ethical than aesthetic.
