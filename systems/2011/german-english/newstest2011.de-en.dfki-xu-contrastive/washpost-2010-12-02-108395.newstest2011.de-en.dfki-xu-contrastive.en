Belarus agrees not to collect weapons-grade uranium 
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials, the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons. 
The deal was in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov Security Summit announced an additional article. 
The US government has for years tried to convince Belarus, not collect more highly enriched uranium and seemed to have achieved a hurdle last spring. 
But officials of the US government told the Washington Post that in the last two months, two secret agreements with Belarus have been taken to remove Belarus 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a research center. 
The agreement on Wednesday, setting the stage for the rest of the material to be removed, according to an official staff because of the sensitivity of the subject, anonymous, approximately 500 pounds. 
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear security summit in April, the White ruled Russia. 
And it was obvious good enough, at the invitation of the former Soviet republic to secure the next summit in 2012. 
"I was really thrilled about the fact that they want a nuclear security summit (2012) seat." 
"It shows me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the partnership Global security, a group promoting nuclear safety. 
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant step" of Belarus. 
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, within four years to secure all vulnerable nuclear material. 
Since then, the US government six countries helped her to get rid of highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus will be the seventh. 
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush. 
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus has declared that the nation will never abandon their uranium. 
"How retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos of what fundamentally weapons is capable of, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said then. 
"This is our commodity... 
"We use it only for research purposes, this dirty bombs and we will not sell." 
Belarus still approached a few months ago the US meeting on an agreement anzeigte than interest. 
The first attempt to remove the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material easily contaminated by radiation, say officials. 
It was in a Spezialzug load, the more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say. 
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials. 
The US government pays $14 million for this effort, with a large part of the money in the Belarusian research with depleted uranium, which can be used for nuclear weapons. 
"This was extremely careful coordinated in order to build confidence," which led to the agreement which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, the global threat reduction. 
The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende study estimates that Belarus this year at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium, and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus will be under the joint agreement camps until 2012. 
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights. 
But the statement Wednesday suggests a possible rapprochement. 
"The progress of this global security issues heißend welcome the United States of America and Belarus aware that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens", they said.
