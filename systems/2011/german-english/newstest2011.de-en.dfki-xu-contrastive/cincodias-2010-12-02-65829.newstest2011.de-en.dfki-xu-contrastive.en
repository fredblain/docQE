Sabadell wants his rivals in three years, a million customers' steal ' 
The caretaker board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but first rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war. 
However, he sees a collapse in interest rate spreads, the banks are trying to offset with increases of fees and prices for loans. 
Sabadell expected in three years million private customers - a consensus still exists. 
Sabadell has found the way to the next three years, and so in a very difficult economic environment. 
The Bank will introduce a new Dreijahresleitplan 2011. 
The objective is not only to survive without public aid from the FROB to take market share, but also a million private customers - 700 000 if the customers, the bank will lose - to increase. This is the great challenge facing this Bank, because until now it has their business customers more attention than their retail customers. 
This year it has 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies. 
Its market share in retail is 3.5 per cent, while the business customers more than 10 per cent. 
Another principle of 2011-2013 business plan is increasing the productivity, austerity, reducing costs. The challenges facing the bank so that together with annual report. 
Only a few banks are daring in these difficult times targets and to publish, since the banks all plans are disrupted by the financial crisis worldwide. 
Sabadell will complete its master plan Optima set four years ago this year. This was initially interpreted to three years, but due to the market situation he was extended for a year. 
The Customers who leave the savings banks, are the main objective of the bank. 
At a breakfast organised by the APIE stressed Guardiola, 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with a longer range." 
The manager expects Spain would only "slow" out of the crisis. 
Moreover, it would be "very difficult", in two or three years' work crucial to the survival of the banks. 
Even if he assumes that the war for liabilities - the interest margins punished - will abate, will the risk premia, banks and building societies must pay for their emissions to maintaining liquidity as compensation for sagging profit margins already shifted onto the price of loans. 
"The issues liquidity and funding are of a structural nature, and they will put pressure on the loans." 
"We have not tap off the tap, but the Zinsdifferenziale are very high," Guardiola said. 
BANESTO Thursday were already ordering their Filialnetz from restricting the granting of long-term loans, and to increase the Zinsdifferenziale (cf. Cinco Díaz on 22 and 27 November). 
The manager also acknowledged that the banks have now Stategie, "to increase the fees, within a competitive framework". 
Sabadells master plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group does not exclude, as always, corporate transactions. 
Not for nothing he assured that in Spain 'larger companies are necessary. " 
"In the coming year will change everything," he assures. 
He stressed that the need for capital currently "huge increase" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions in red figures are falling. 
He is of the opinion that the FROB in Kaptitalaufstockungen replace the money market. 
Having said that Sabadell a temporary closure of the markets could survive, he refuted the argument of some bankers already predict a new liquidity crisis. 
He stressed that nothing can be in circulation, but unlike the incidents in June, you could get short-term funding on Repogeschäfte and intercept the crisis.
