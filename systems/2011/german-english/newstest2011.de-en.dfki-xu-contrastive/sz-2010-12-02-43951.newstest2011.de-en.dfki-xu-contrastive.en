Mysterious Erdarbeiten 
The Atomic Energy authority IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria. 
But the country refuses to comment - nor is it controls. 
About midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 fighter planes, a mysteriöses würfelförmiges building in Syria. 
It is on the banks of the Euphrates, the next major city 30 miles away, is Dair as-Saur. 
Her name appears in the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) documents, when it comes to the reactor, Syria allegedly built with help from North Korea in the Quader has hidden in a valley by the electricity. 
According to a briefing of the US-Auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA by the end of April 2008 would also under the name of the nearby town of el-Kibar normal reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium - to build nuclear weapons. 
For other purposes against the technology from the fifties. 
The CIA ran a video presentation with blurred satellite images. 
By Computeranimation ignored it, where the components of the reactor before the destruction, a verkleinerte copy of North Korea model from the Yongbyon nuclear center. 
Moreover, it presented photographs that show the buildings from near or even interior space. 
The reactor was briefly stood before the operation, it said, but not yet with pellets peppers. 
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more than it was then known, the mystery with time rather bigger. 
Former US President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack was fairly sure that Syria in al-Kibar a reactor built, but hardly saw evidence that it was in the country, "an active nuclear weapons programme '. 
Some intelligence officers in Europe are even more cautious and only talk of a 'alleged reactor, "even if the CIA presentation for" plausible ". 
You lack of hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. 
Asked how confident he was to have a reactor, said a senior UN diplomat in summer only flat, the IAEA "has enough material to ask questions". 
The ruins of the alleged "unused military building" surpassed the Syrians eager aside and planierten thoroughly premises. 
However, in June 2008 a IAEA-Team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people. 
Moreover, the IAEA on a Member State satellite images of commercial providers the period immediately after the attack, which might be more powerful than the CIA. 
However, these recordings on the market, not because of the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - it has bought exclusive. 
The IAEA can therefore not independently verify its authenticity. 
Syria has always claimed that never operated a secret nuclear program or to have built a reactor. 
The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus. 
But the IAEA to analyse the particles as unlikely. 
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss - as well as on the satellite images. 
Inspectors also denied a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the rubble of bombed-out building. 
But Israel says pugnaciously. 
"We will never comment on," said recently at the time of the attack acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position. 
Dragging the investigation of the case since June 2008 and fruitless "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority, as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna gives - after all, is a grave violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area, about IAEA watchdog. 
As a key to progress in the investigation to the IAEA apparently sees three more bodies, "functional link" with the alleged reactor And this still exist. 
The inspectors have not disclosed what plants are, or what they are or what they seem suspicious. 
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung they are in the IAEA internally as Marj as-Sultan Masyaf and Iskandariayah described, in turn, derived from nearby towns. 
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and on a complex in Masyaf, in which it is most probably one of the suspicious objects. 
It is probably in or directly next to a military base - precisely with this justification denied Syria IAEA access to the three locations. 
In Vienna, the Syrians feared a rather than fishing expedition - that the IAEA by the United States will vorgeschickt auszuspähen military installations. 
Because the nuclear detectives were the result of a tip of the US intelligence services on the institutions closely. 
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the Euphrates Quader material was moved back and forth. 
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could "in connection with the fuel production". 
But there were "no evidence of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes that are necessary to build nuclear weapons. 
The type of reactor will not enriched uranium, which is. 
But where the uranium could have come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated on these central issues there are plausible conjecture. 
It is also unclear whether other debris that could bring valuable traces stored at the three locations. 
As if the hundreds of lorry loads of disappeared, nobody wants information about where the rubble. 
Only a few kilometers from al-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, salt mine al-Tibni Syria 1998 to investigate its suitability as a camp for radioactive waste, the IAEA as unlikely. 
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had it in a recent analysis of satellite images for the venerable magazine Jane's Intelligence Review associated with the reactor. 
Footage from the orbiting but show that Syria to the three suspect sites Erdarbeiten and large container, after the IAEA access had requested. 
That cannot be coincidence, but has hardly helped dispel the suspicion. 
It is also stated In diplomatic circles, have spent many months to develop a plan for inspections of the IAEA, which should allow Syria to safeguard any military secrets - alone shows how much interest the inspectors is the effort. 
Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte this proposal too. 
Western diplomats in Vienna had a year ago assuaged, the reactor was destroyed, therefore, have no high urgency, brings the matter around US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months called special inspections into the game, one of the harshest means the Vienna nuclear authority to enforce controls. 
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, these inspections should propose, has already spoken of a "option, for which I am open in the future", but even he is hesitant. 
It is a high risk in this way: It needs for a majority On the board of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented are anything other than eager for an escalation. 
On the other hand, as a diplomat recalled: "What if they end up nothing?
