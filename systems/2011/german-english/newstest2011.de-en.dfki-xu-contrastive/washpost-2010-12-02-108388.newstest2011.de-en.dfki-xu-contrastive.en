It was written, while it was still Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, and accuses him of corruption. 
He was in October by President Dmitry Medvedev fired, but there is little evidence that in the meantime would have been cleaned. 
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a construction company, have repeatedly rejected accusations of corruption for years, and he has many defamation lawsuits against such accusations.

Like A huge number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, The polls. 
But it is unusual that, as the report of the ambassador, individuals, and it is unheard of that a diplomat from a foreign country. 
"The direct link to the government of Moscow with the crime has led to some of them as" disturbing "and come to the conclusion that the government is more like a Kleptokrat acts as a government," according to the memo.

The report says that the FSB further money from the biggest companies from the police and the small business people arrested. 
A source said, "declared that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get the protection from the FSB and MVD (and not by organised crime), as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law. ' 
"That is why the protection by criminal gangs as previously asked." 
The memo noted that, while the collection of the funds is complete, protecting themselves very modest pay no; even the, the, are sometimes arrested.

In an interview with Larry King of CNN said Putin that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats have called it Medvedev Batman and Robin. 
"The truth is that our interaction is an important factor of domestic politics in this country," he said. 
"But to be honest, we did not expect that to happen with such arrogance, such pressure and unethical way, you know."
