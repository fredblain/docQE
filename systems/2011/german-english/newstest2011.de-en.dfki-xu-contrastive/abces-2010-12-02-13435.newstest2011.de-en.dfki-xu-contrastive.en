The old nursing home confirmed that the deaths are not due to "lack of action" 
The owners of the old homes in Olot does not preclude their carers on eleven elderly killed 
The leaders of the old nursing homes La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday, highlighted the damage the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurses, who during his work had killed at least eleven old people, for which he was responsible, the establishment had caused. 
The head of the care home, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada in court and announced, "La Caritat would indict the responsible (for deaths)," but "the right and our liability compel us to adopt the process and the civil liability". 
The establishment is not just a social prestige because they accept the criminal acts of Pflegers not realised in time, but now a high compensation paid by the legal representatives of the families of the victims will be calculated. 
Joan Vila Dilmé acknowledged that the first crime originates in August 2009 and that he had since the killing. 
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the old nursing homes - because he suspected that no doctor has examined the deceased person, but the formalities because of their age and disease by telephone. 
The head of La Caritat prominent writers have expressed this point flatly and declared that "any time the reason for the lack of measures may have been incidents." 
The lawyer of La Caritat added that there was "no evidence in the dispute for negligent acts a person other than the accused." 
The already as "death angel" getaufte acknowledged yesterday and said that the first eleven murders committed crimes on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later, the second old lady. 
In this case he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime that he had a mix of various sedatives. 
The head of La Caritat said the staff access to medicines is difficult to control. 
The insulin injections and the sedative cocktail of nurses in six of nine crimes committed in patients with the death of their suffering. 
But the results of the laboratory tests will be able to see whether Vila is lying and for his first victims actually a less cruel death or whether he chose this ausbrannte from within, by offering them Bleichlauge verabreichte as he loudly confession in three women had done, he killed between 12 and 17 October. 
In La Caritat listens to the Pflegers no faith, even as the number of murders, which could be much more. This attitude is justified that Vila very different statements in court had made and that it makes no sense to change its approach after eight successful murders suddenly 
They say that they did it is for this reason and to clarify the scope of these events to the judiciary.
