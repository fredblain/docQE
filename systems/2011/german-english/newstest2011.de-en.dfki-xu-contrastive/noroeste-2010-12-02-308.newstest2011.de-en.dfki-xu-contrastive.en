NASA has announced the discovery Außerirdischen life 
The American space agency convened a press conference to a fund vorzustelle tomorrow, the impact on the search for life in space. 
The National aviation and space Agency (NASA) of the United States tomorrow, Thursday, a astrobiologische discovery, the theory of the existence of Außerirdischen life could confirm. 
The Fund will tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts from the Astrobiologie. This is a science which the origin, development, distribution and the future of life in the universe. 
At the press conference convened NASA assured that it will 'a aufsichtserregenden Fund for the search for außerirdischem life "imagine what triggered speculation when experts to other countries. 
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments, it has been found unbwohnbar, people can similar creatures exist. It has raised the possibility that this could turn into intelligent creatures - as people - if their living conditions improved. 
Apparently, it is a microbe, at the bottom of the mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, was found. They are living in an environment that was considered too toxic for all possible forms of life when the sea is strong arsenhaltig. 
In any way used the Mikrobie the arsenic than survival resource. With this ability to increase the chances that it could not have our protective atmosphere similar life on other planets. 
If these organisms the arsenic verstoffwechseln, according to the Astrobiologen demonstrated that "there is a real a different way of life, a second life form that is different from the known." 
The space agency is tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference the actual scope of their funds. 
At the conference the Geobiologin Pamela Conrad, the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, the titan (the largest moon Saturns) under the question of whether its chemical composition of the earth, studied.
