Zapatero and the red line Germany 
Berlin has opted for keeping the euro, but at the same time, conditions for the whole of the European Union. 
The tensions in the markets have a dual response from the government. 
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has submitted new adaptation measures, starting with tax reliefs for small and micro-enterprises, regulating temporary work agencies or the lifting of the 426 euro support for the unemployed, no unemployment benefit related to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of airports Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery. 
On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former Prime Minister Felipe González, the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis presents. 
How are these transactions to understand? 
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their public relations. 
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro. 
It is Germany a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future to maintain ancient traditions clash of much of its partners. 
Given the resistance in Europe begins one in Germany to spekuliern on three possible ways out of the crisis. 
The first: A strong euro Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south to leave the euro area. 
The Second: The reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - although it is more science fiction sounds - supported by a large part of public opinion, approximately 50% of the population. 
The Third: A transformation of the euro under German proposals. This means: More macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; penalise the countries, broken; möglichereweise the default of certain countries, and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures on the private sector. 
The German position is clear and has been for some time. So there are no excuses now. 
First 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission for deficits, and the German Government constitutional reform, in order to prevent it from 2016. 
It was the first signs of the polarisation between what Germany was thought necessary (strict fiscal plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. 
The second sign the Central European country than Merkel postponed the decision to save Greece painful,. 
Then it was strongly criticised. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published absolutely against a rescue of Greece. 
Finally, Merkel in the last October days again with a clear position, It calls for a reform of the European Union agreements, to enable the rescue of one country while private lenders to commit a part of the cost. 
This position was interpreted as anti-European, since they propelled Ireland crisis and everything. 
But her proposal, if a little sweetened, was approved in the coming months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which these measures from 2013. 
Germany has drawn a red line that it intends not to exceed. 
It says all that - even if unpopular measures must be taken, from that date there will no longer be the old ways of the euro. 
2013 will be the birth of a new currency area, in which the countries to ban be severely punished, be forced to declare themselves bankrupt and in this case, the private sector must play a part of the cost. 
Germany shows us that we need a strong growth path, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances. 
The alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as was mentioned by Spain in boom times, will simply not be tolerated. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would badly do not understand it. 
It is not just about the deficit to 3% by the year 2013 runterzufahren. 
The demands are much harder. 
Under these conditions, And the worst thing we could do is to cheat. 
I hope that the current turbulence in more calm. 
And that we will use the opportunities offered to us by early 2013. 
It seems that Zapatero has taken this so well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel hypothesis, in order to make their way. 
But Germany-red line is there, and it is not that something would change. 
Among the possibilities is that In countries with little serious full gestopften euro area, not to be excluded. 
In this case, we still say it could have warned us.
