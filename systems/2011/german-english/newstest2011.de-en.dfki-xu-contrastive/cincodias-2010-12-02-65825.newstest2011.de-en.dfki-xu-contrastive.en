Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens 
The car will be improved with a software in real time. 
Since 2004 Red Bull in the world of Formula 1 is their history in this splendid universe of speed of surprises and successes. 
Initially, no one paid the newcomer attention and, despite its sharply rising will round during the recent seasons began the final sprint victory last November, all of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso. 
Without the capabilities of the German pilots and champion Sebastian Vettel or the performance of the engine of Renault to belittle want is the "secret weapon" that the multi-Siemens Red Bull in the hands, and created a winning team, have become legend. 
In reality is a powerful software to simulate processes, the German company in 2007 for purposes of motor racing to the market. 
This was dubbed PLM computer programme for the development of assembling chains in factories around the world, energy plants and precise instruments used. 
The goal is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is built, so as to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs. 
PLM has made the development of the cameras from Canon, the Sukhoi aircraft and the most famous vehicles of Nissan. 
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial department of Siemens, said that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 - factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes and improvements to the race and the tests, design and implement. 
Russwurm contends that in 1992 from the maximum average 10 technicians worked in a season three or four could introduce improvements. 
In Red Bulls team are now 180 highly qualified young people. With powerful computer equipment they analyses and all sorts of changes to the cars. 
The Siemens managers said that the PLM software is all the components of the cars Rennwagen of Red Bull to analyse and improve, with the exception of the Motors, the only responsible for Renault. 
The materials, the fuel, the Aerodynamik and the elements will be changed. 
The changes, thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech Autoklaven in less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the Simulators into reality. 
The only limit this madness technical perfect is set to spend $40 million, a formula 1 team for his race in a season. 
Red Bull has its high-tech factory for the development and production of its cars in a remote place built 50 kilometres from London. 
There are two buildings in which visits, particularly from journalists are severely limited. 
Everything that is happening is, Top Secret. 
The workforce includes 580 people, including two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber. 
But Red Bulls real formula 1 - hero is the latest zweifelslos world champion Sebastian Vetell. 
Behind the huge technological resources, which the Energy-Drink producer in the services of its participation in the race tracks is hiding other protagonists whose support priceless and whose fame is zero. 
The Technologichef the plant, Steve Nevey emphasised that, five years ago, we could say that the progress made in R & D for cars with 50% to victory and earned the pilots were responsible for the rest. 
Today the share values have changed. The technology is 85% of success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 per cent. 
Nevey recognises that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computer, because they "are not voraussagbare gladiators'.
