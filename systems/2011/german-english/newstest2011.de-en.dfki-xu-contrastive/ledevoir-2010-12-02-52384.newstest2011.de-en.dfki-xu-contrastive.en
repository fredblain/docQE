450 million in contracts without tendering 
Hydro-Quebec has in mutual agreement project planning firms 450 million dollars in contracts for the hydroelectric project East Main-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert. 
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium, consisting of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, the most important part of the project, to a total of $295 million without tendering has received. 
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance," was in 2004 as part of the decision-making by Hydro-Québec, the private sector their responsibility, this important hydroelectric project a sum of $5 billion. 
At the beginning of 2005 ergatterte the consortium "Énergie gérance" the lucrative contract without a public tender. 
For the Parti Québécois is resorting to companies consortia a serious ethical problem that the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung and a price increase. 
"This is a new way of conspiracy and refuted the competition." 
"This means that rather than fix games instead of secret way now in open form," said Sylvain yesterday Simard, a member of the PQ, at the press conference. 
Early in the morning Simard had raised the issue before the National Assembly, because it seems to him hard to understand how the public's interest in this way can be served. 
Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau had afternoon responded by vehemently deny this Treaty was that it had been a stitch-up. 
"I remain faithful to my line," she lashed out, confirmed that the PQ was "dishonest" and "lack rigour". 
She said that it "is the least" that the PQ apologize. 
The model of the consortium is common practice in the world. 
It is usually a time such a temporary alliance that it two or more companies their expertise on a requirement for a tender for a complex project. 
The project "East Main" has a high level of complexity regarding his work from level. 
The construction techniques is under way and should be established until 2012. 
However, the Treaty was awarded without competition had taken place; it had already given negotiations. 
Moreover, the model of the consortium in Quebec with relatively simple projects no longer constitute an exception. 
As the newspaper Le Devoir "noted last week, is in the field of Bauingenieur- and advisory professionals used model of the consortium of government investigations. 
A brief overflying the Quebecer companies register allows more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be consistent duration. 
In this way, for example, the company Dessau is working in partnership with the majority of its main competitors to Cima +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or include Roche and Tecsult together. 
Any link, and there are several dozen, at one and the same legal person - Dessau. 
What the consortium "Énergie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a particular work force dynamism and hydro-Quebec this fact since the 1970s in a special way account pays'. 
Réal Laporte, the major employers of Société d 'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement the nose on the fact that the Treaty on the project management after agreement was approved. 
"If you make a tender and there are few candidate will your prices soar." 
"You have two options: Either you do the people who see in this Mart and say: We will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price." 
"The idea is that the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," said Laporte. 
The consortium "Énergie gérance" amount appropriated is one of a long list of contracts on more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois. 
The contracts were either the hydro-Quebec or the SEBJ East Main-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert approved for the project. 
After reviewing was the newspaper Le Devoir "more than 100 Ingenieurs- and consultant contracts, the companies or their branches, including in particular resources laboratories conferred between 2002 and March 2010. 
SNC-Lavalin had 22 gerafft contracts, Génivar had received 16 Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without their participation in "Énergie gérance counting". 
All these contracts have been negotiated. 
It is estimated the total to $449 783 344, including the Treaty with "Énergie gérance" about 295 131 $564. 
Sylvain Simard had said that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of "Parti libéral du Quebec well known." 
Minister Normandeau had suggested, the PQ is equally connected with the firms that they "funded", before they specify that it was its managers.
