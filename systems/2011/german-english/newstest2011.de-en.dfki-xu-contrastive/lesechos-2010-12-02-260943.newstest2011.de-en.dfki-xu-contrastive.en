World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the Ausrichterland 
In a state of excitement because of suspicions of corruption will appoint the Executive Committee on Thursday the Ausrichterländer FIFA World Cup 2018 and 2022, a highly political election, in which the rangeln influence and lobbying are threatening to push the technical criteria in the background. 
However, One thing is certain: The 2018 edition of King discipline FIFA will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold, (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spanien-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium). 
The edition 2022 will be something exotic; the International Football Association hopes, the first on the continent of Africa in 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) is to win, or its subsidiary in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to pursue. 
The list of people who belong to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) is the degree of economic and political use of the World Cup. 
The machinations behind the scenes are so until the last minute. 
Difficult otherwise a hierarchy of candidates. 
After the evaluation report of FIFA, the English, spanisch-portugiesische (2018) and American (2022) Act bessseren arguments than their competitors. 
But these considerations for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees the election to be not so important. 
The Sunday Times, forging the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the start of the revelations, could just as well the opportunities for their own country cradle of football, ruined, the only once the World Cup victory, namely to 1966. 
The BBC had given the ground again on Monday, giving it a own broadcast had three senior members of the Kommitees, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under fire. 
Reason enough to alienate FIFA and the English responsible to embarrass primarily with David Cameron in these last weeks had an intensive lobbying. 
The head of the government hopes for a repeat of his predecessor Tony Blair successful chess train in 2005 for London, the organisation of the Olympic Games 2012. 
Would this intensive use meet the image of England before the upgrade Kommitee again? 
Nothing is less certain, because the Bush-Blair Spanien-Portugal does not lack assets with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in 92 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and his football culture. 
But the economic and financial downside of the two countries could dampen their ambitions. 
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal to the opportunities of Russia, which despite its shortfalls in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become the weighty outsiders, increase. 
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has, however, decided that the treaty candidly suggestion on the Bezichtigungen the English press "an unfair competition in the preparations for the vote" from the Kommiteemitglieder. 
"You bewirft it with dirt, trying to embarrass them," raged Putin. 
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, the logical favourites. 
First economic world power, seat of the FIFA-Hauptsponsoren, the country seems a long list of benefits to Japan and South Korea, which is a very good project separately. 
But these new nominations seem premature for two countries who had co-organised the competitions in 2002. 
Another threat: The long-awaited approval of the World Cup by FIFA 2026 opportunities for China, the Asian to 2022 lapses. 
With Australia and Qatar, with Aufwartung futuristischer stadiums had pulled out all the stops to the FIFA to pursue its expansion into new areas, however, these two countries a greater risk because certainty. 
Australia might as well as Japan and South Korea by European countries akquittierten weakness of television rights (because of the time), the sensitive nerve FIFA.
