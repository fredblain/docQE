Inspectors in Zwielicht 
The European Food Authority EFSA is with Genpflanzen experimental industry. 
This charge now formulated the group of experts understand the impact assessment test Biotech, the independent institute for biotechnology. 
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well documented," said test biotech leader Christoph then in Munich on Wednesday. 
The head of the EFSA expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert was for years the lobbyists Association Ilsi under contract. 
The will of companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer paid. 
Kuiper was instrumental in the EFSA test requirements for Genpflanzen worked and am in a clear conflict of interests, then criticised. 
The EFSA rules are (manner, word for word, with position papers of the Ilsi and deceive the imprint of the industry, which really should be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma. 
It is the second time that test Biotech bem√§ngle a conflict of interest. 
It is a high-level EFSA Managerin recently without restrictions or transitional period on the Swiss company Syngenta farm - and have changed sides. 
The funds also German radio (MDR) recently had personal links between kontrollierender EU authority and industrial lobby reveals what has made the environment Federal Office as well as EU parliamentarians avenue. 
The EFSA can However, see no conflict of interest. 
We use every serious data, even on such industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, says in a statement. 
The experts who work for EFSA, we ask that they have no contact with the industry. 
But they have to disclose them. 
Kuiper gives his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States. 
This describes himself as a neutral forum for experts from academia, industry and policy - including on risk assessment for biotechnology without lobby. 
In the matter criticize independent experts as then that genetically modified crops currently feeding without any attempt Genpflanzen in animals be allowed and the response to environmental influences will not tested. 
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize on arable power," says then. 
Current practice is only isolated proteins, but not the whole Genpflanze to test how artificial no reliable results. 
"If the risks should not be how you find it?" Asks then pointed. 
It is also Angelika Hilbeck. 
The scientist had since 1994 in the engineering and is currently at the Technical University of Zurich. 
The industry is trying in this area, as in the United States now in Europe is becoming more critical scientists to influence or discredit. 
There is therefore hardly researchers, companies are intertwined. 
For businesses critical studies would usually not published. 
"The industry," claims Hilbeck controls the security research.
