'Fernet, rum and vodka, for just a good whisky, the father of Hausbar has stolen. 
These are the drinks after enjoyed drunken Czech teenager under fifteen most notbehandelt. 
Children are No exception, their hangovers repeatedly in hospital ausschlafen. 
This is from the experience of doctors, with similar cases in the inclusion of child departments of clinics. 
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion, simply because it takes too long to be drunk." 
"The current trend is clearly of hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief doctor of the children's unit in the Bohemian clinic Hořovice. 
"whisky, if it succeeds, the father of a bottle of Hausbar to snatch, and if not, then at least 'Fernet or vodka. 
"Vodka has the advantage that it blended with juice can smell it not so hard," says the head doctor. 
The spokesman of the Fakultätskrankenhauses Motol Eva Jurinová gives him right. 
"Most 'Fernet or rum." 
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools." 
"Sometimes it was also about slivovice, you take home", Mrs Jurinová. 
Chief doctor Pelikán, three or four ten year olds drinkers in the hospital admission long is no exception. 
Before the clinic in Hořovice he ten years since this year, he was working in the hospital Motol paediatric use section, where ambulances angetrunkene pupils from Middle and distance selling of ablieferten. 
"A girl had four allergic." 
"It began her career with 12 years ago, when the first time with 3.5 per mil alcohol in the blood and in combination with" Extase "has been hospitalised," the doctor described a particularly severe case. 
"It was in the exhibition site Holešovice on any dance party." 
"The interesting thing is that it was their mother not strange found that 48 hours not her daughter came home," the chief doctor wondered. 
The lack of interest by parents or their incredible tolerance in Anstoßen with their own Sprösslingen is regarded as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism by children. 
A real dependency in the true sense of the word, according to the experts in children. 
"under Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomenon to understand and that is not the case with these children". 
Among those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, is mostly a negative family-social background characteristic, "says chief doctor Pelikán. 
The spokesman for the hospital Motol, according to Mrs Jurinová until mid-November, were around 40 drunken children admitted to the abandonment of children and youth Department of medicine. 
But only with severe cases of alcohol poisoning, a hospital to go in the statistics.

Apart from the cases in which children as only a bottle of spirits in school desk austrinken there are opinion of Mr Pelikán three year time Amplituden, 100% is good: Walpurgisnacht, Sylvester and the end of the school year. 
"The latter for two reasons - either from pain because of the bad certificate or joy on the holiday." 
"In the Walpurgisnacht I have already seen in the opening seven drunken children at once," said Dr Pelikán. 
A betrunkenes child spend the night under medical supervision, paradoxically, is better off than a child who has to contend with a nasty hangover the next day. 
The headaches in the morning after the Dehydration and lack of glucose that can be in hospital with a flüssigkeitsspendenden Infusion with glucose, the body of the missing, distribute and nutrients. 
"Clearly they are better off, because after the 'nice' experience in the evening, raise them with good humour to somewhere without something hurts." 
"They are only slightly confused about where they are," Dr Pelikán admits, although he sometimes at least good humour to perish by the patients he considers the costs they will cost the treatment. 
Because of the transport with the rescue and the night in an acute bed come well on a few tens of thousand kronor. 
"Occasionally I have an educational resources used, if I have direct the children to visit calculated what their drunkenness has cost and that it may well happen that they take must work to earn the money for a single such Fete", the whole holidays added Dr Pelikán added. 
In his view, the health insurance but not after Regressverfahren, in order to cure the trunkenen children still-necessary costs of the parents.
