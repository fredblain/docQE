In the race for Wikileaks head 
Obama appoints a high responsible for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new revelations. 
Interpol is a red warning to monitor and detect Assange. 
Everything with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated maze in which facts just difficult to explain. 
Yesterday Interpol "red alert" to "locate and prosecute" Assange. 
However, this is not a traditional layout on the arrest. 
Furthermore, it is not new, it comes from the 20 November. 
It also has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the US, but with the accusations of sexual abuse, which the Australians in Sweden. 
Also assured the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police know where and how they could contact with Mr Assange." 
Already on 20 was the international police agency based in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden ordering from, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving authorisation by the Swedish authorities. 
That is the way things. The 188 Interpol-dependent countries are to identify and locate "Assange provisionally arrest and extradite him." 
Although Interpol the arrest of a red warning affected individual cannot issue orders, many member countries according to the Organisation see the red warning as a Arrestierung - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreements, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely. 
The action Assanges outraged lawyers gesten published a letter in which they were informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference. 
They also recall that Assange has the exit from Sweden and requested by the prosecutor, with the sagenumwobenen Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security chief of Stalin, compared to the approval. 
"It is a fighter, not as a legal persecution," the letter. 
While the world is seeking him - and his mother of Australia from the innocence of their son - Assange at an unknown location, but not in silence. 
On Monday he was the head of the magazine Time via Skype from an unspecified location. In an interview the conversation he requested the resignation of US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. 
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and international agreement signed by the United States, they should resign," he said. 
His opinion was yesterday by the White House, press secretary Robert Gibbs, condemned the request to resign as "ridiculous and absurd." 
"I am not sure why we value on the opinion of a type with a website," he told CNN. 
Obama himself has a high responsible for the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, charged with the prevention of new documents revelations. 
The attempt by the spokesperson of the Pr√§sidenden Barack Obama, Assange to pay less attention to, contrary to the views of the conservative politicians and commentators these days. 
Congressman Peter King, from January lead the National Security COM Mitee the House of Representatives, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "in order to seize their money and those who supported or to make a contribution to follow." 
Tom Flanagan, adviser to the Canadian president Stephen Harper, has gone further, and he had to withdraw his statement, Assange "murdered". 
"Obama should turn it into a target and a not bemanntes aircraft or what use." 
Anyone not apologising, was Mike Huckabee, baptistischer ministers, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate. 
"Whoever It was always the leaked information in the government, he is guilty of treason and everything that is no execution is eiine to mild punishment", he told the broadcaster Fox.
