Mystery of the komplexgeschüttelten Canada lifted 
The new American diplomats pipes were spread by WikiLeaks, to reveal the secret about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of Canadians towards Americans consider; they show but with the same blow the superiority of the latter open against Canada. 
Consequently, the American diplomats surprised that the Canadian voters at the ballot has not the Canadian-American relations, and they believe that the visit by President Obama, the conservative government helped its budget from 2009. 
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington yesterday publicly offer were spread more juicy details than mere substantial content, in which it has a very bad outcome. 
A carved link on 22 September 2008, i.e. in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage was in full swing, reported about what the United Nations is no longer involved in the operations of their political leaders discussed. 
The great surprise of David Wilkins used in Ottawa, the American ambassador. 
Mr Wilkins offers various channels this situation. 
"The Canadians almost economic inferiority complex, possibly led the Canadian, political leaders, to talk about internal matters of everyday life, rather than the United States in this election the buck (as in 1988, when the campaign on the free trade)," he describes. 
The United Nations, he concludes, are therefore 'the proverbial Goliath this election: omnipresent, but potentially threatening, in order to talk about him. " 
The ambassador understands these "deafening silence" especially since the two countries have close political and economic relations. 
"Logically," he assessed, "should the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leaders to drive such a crucial relationship, the voters at the polls as a key factor in the sense." 
The other expression of this sense of importance reads on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business sources in Ottawa, sent communication, President Barack Obama on his first visit to prepare in Ottawa. 
"Their journey will help support the continuation of government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, when Canada its first deficit after more than a decade, will be the basis of a recovery programme in the $30 to $40 billion is created," Breese. 
Nowhere, he said that the government had to postpone parliamentary session before Christmas, in order to prevent Parliament from the the coalition would throw and the conditional continuation of opposition parties would impact on the quality of the proposed regeneration programme. 
Another, from January 2008 and carved by Ambassador Wilkins wrote Washington from the increasingly negative image that the communication on CBC broadcast dramatic series from the United States. 
The ambassador is concerned about programmes as Border, little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" or contributions for the purposes of Muskelprotze administered the CIA interrogations could see. 
Yet another communication reported extensively about how Hillary Clinton remarked with her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner during their first bilateral meeting then asked whether Europe is prepared to certain prisoners from Guantanamo. 
Mr Kouchner is said to have the answer is yes, but on the basis of an individual decision. 
Àm at the end of the meeting, described the Secretary of State, "he was handed a document in terms of Omar Khadr, over a 15-year-old Muslims Canadian origin." 
"The State Secretary, promised that the acts again by watch". 
We are, after all, still to that tempers on the website WikiLeaks. 
Tom Flanagan, an old and very closely Stephen Harper adviser, had on CBC said that those responsible for this massive leak "should be killed". 
He was speaking at Mike Huckabee here from the United States.
