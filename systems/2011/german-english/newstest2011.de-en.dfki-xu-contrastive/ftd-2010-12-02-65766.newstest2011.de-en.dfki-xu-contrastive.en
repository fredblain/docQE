Obama stops new drilling 
Off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years there will be no new drilling. 
A ban, the government issued in Washington - and their previous plans finally revoked. 
New drilling off the Atlantic coast remain banned for now. 
This divided Interior Ken Salazar on Wednesday. 
The trigger for the strict ban, at least for the next five years, is the explosion of Bohrplattform "Deepwater Horizon" in April. 
Before the accident that claimed the lives of 11 workers and the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had led to pressure from the opposition and the industry his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico. 
The supporters want to reduce US dependence on oil from overseas. 
Who bears the responsibility for the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf, is still not finally resolved. 
In the centre of the criticism is the British energy group BP, with billions demands. 
An investigation commissioned by Obama in the course of 2008 to submit their results. 
In October, Home Secretary Ken Salazar the Bohrstopp imposed after the explosion. 
In the end have had several oil companies immediately applications for new Bohrvorhaben. 
With tighter controls and stricter safety regulations want Obama and Salazar a fresh disaster. 
At present, the competent authority, which was in disrepute, radically reformed after numerous corruption charges. 
Obama has announced that lucrative to close tax loopholes for the oil and Gaskonzerne. 
The industry warns now publicly that the output in the Gulf by a stricter regulation would be significantly lower than before. 
"The government's plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the oil and gas industry" is the result of a recent industry survey by the consultant BDO - before the Bohrverbot by Wednesday. 
The American Energy Alliance also complained the uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows what will change with the regulatory exactly." 
Investment in new projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
