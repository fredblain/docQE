What should they do, the ČSSD? the Czech Social Democrats in Prague are not aware of Voldemort, "Konditorei." 
The new Office gentlemen of capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously some language barriers to overcome their old-new colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and in the city of representation to understand at all. 
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz members of the new Council from the ČSSD a little "abgeklopft ', as they dominate the notorious Slang that has become popular in recent years, in which the current coalition partners in Prague at the helm. 
The codierte vocabulary, in the long era of Mayor Pavel Bém of the Prague political elite was introduced, some of the most well-known actors, situations and Causae borrowed. 
Surprisingly, the new councils in relation to these new notions something in the dark. 
That, At least, they say. 
"Who is Voldemort?" 
"No idea." 
"I am more of a newcomer in the Prague policy", Lukáš responded Kaucký, the new Office Mr for culture, to the test "godfather of vocabulary." 
But the Council Mr Březina - a political veteran, reacted in a similar way. 
For example, on the concept of 'Golfloch'. 
"This is the only expression of which you are submitting me, which I use now and again." 
"otherwise, I think that not much of slang." 
From the days before the leaf Aktuálně.cz in this year's June election vocabulary, the Congress of the ODS had published pickte editorial six words, especially those notoriously associated with the Prague magistrate. 
The Social Democrats should the concepts' Voldemort ',' biggest Prague golf hole, "" Konditorei go in ',' bull necks "," betrayal of the capital "and" verblechen ". 
Three Prague Council agreed to the test, the fourth - Mr Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - first his participation in the talks, but then not even the headphones. 
The fifth-in-Office, Mr, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset. 
"These are things I don't care and how the Civic Democrats themselves talking about - I do not." 
"For me, it is how we understand our programmes," he countered. 
As already indicated, would have Lukáš Kaucký mentioned in the above headline allegedly not recognised by the influential entrepreneurs and friend of the ex-mayor who Bém, Roman Janoušek. 
The term "Voldemort" says Kaucky absolutely nothing and the only concept, he erriet correctly in the test, was "the greatest Prague golf hole." 
"This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, added to security but added: "But I know this from the newspaper". 
And jokingly: "I will probably have to show a language course." 
"The Gulf hole" will not only matador Karel Březina, but also by the Council on the Environment Lukáš Plachý right as tunnel Blanka entziffert. 
Both Social Democrats also know, however, for whom the term Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý senses even where this figure is and what it means to go "in the Konditorei 
"I believe that that is, in some kind of Prague to go Gastronomiebetrieb ', is Plachý quite close to the solution to the problem, when we know that it is the seat of Janoušeks firms. 
In line with Březina, but he claimed that this knowledge to have drawn from the newspapers, rather than him this vocabulary would own. 
Judging from The test participants, there seems to be no similar naturalisations Slang 'repatriations' under the Social Democrats. 
"I asked my colleagues too, but there is obviously something we really not." 
"We call upon us, and we also use acronym or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - from his party colloquially called "Hulda." 
"in school I was Bříza (Birke), but I do not know whether to call my colleagues," tells us Karel Březina his nickname. 
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried and behold - it works. 
Mr Weinert Office is for the party of the kind of "one's grandfather" or less friendly to the 'old', the representative Miroslav poche ahead of the elections by machinations of the party-sponsorship is vocal by some colleagues' Igráček "(known Czech Lego-figure). 
Moniker is the only one that the Social Democrats in the whose language. 
Hulínský may not, if we call it "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered yet another moniker the Prague chairman. 
Be Spitzname 'doctor of rubber truncheons-rights "has alleged that Petr Hulínský his title juris doctor in the Bratislaver police academy.
