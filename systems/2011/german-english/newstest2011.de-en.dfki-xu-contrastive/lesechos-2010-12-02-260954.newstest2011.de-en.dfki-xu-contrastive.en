Second mandate: The Offenkundigkeit 
De Gaulle had really away. 
Mitterrand had to believe that he stutze. 
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation. 
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that. 
A mandate in the Elysée on the next. 
The current head of state is so candidate in 2012. 
But the Offenkundigkeit is the side of the Mysteriums, the presidential function, not look good. 
We must therefore act as if the doubts henceforth. 
In one sense, as well as in the other. 
In 2006 the supporters Jacques Chirac, a third mandate is not excluded, without even to believe that. 
On 15 November assured Nicolas Sarkozy in serious by his decision, "some time in the autumn of 2011". 
On Tuesday evening in the Elysée before the UMP members of the prospect of "two mandates thus would" let slip was a little Fieberhaftigkeit spread. 
The official announcement of his candidacy? 
Far from it. 
The President was simply remind you that the constitution in 2008, the number of five-year term periods to just two. 
He made a statement that no announcement. 
It is not the first time that the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone. 
"You have the worst seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009. 
In May a new 2010: "Does not believe that I not reflecting on the later stages." 
His words from the day before yesterday not to make him more candidates than the previous day, but also no less. 
They should comment, then from a double reason. 
The acceleration of Wettlaufes candidacy with the PS on one side. 
But it is not the start of competition with Segolene Royal, Nicolas Sarkozy, to reveal. 
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, many members of the PS adopted earlier than to EU-diplomatic. 
The bad polls on the other side. 
The first time the voters would right a candidacy of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to a survey by the BVA-L Express) prefer. 
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion with the UMP," the Prime Minister responded immediately and careful about the environment. 
"If he was a defeat as possible, he would not" candidate, Jean-Pierre Raffarin agrees with. 
"He will always believe they can win," corrected Alain Juppé, with the Offenkundigkeit has resigned.
