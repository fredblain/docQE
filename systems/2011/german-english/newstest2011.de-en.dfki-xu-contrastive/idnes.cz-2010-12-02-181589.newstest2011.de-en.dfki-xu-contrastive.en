The army has so many Zündschnüre quite the Czech Republic that umwickeln could you but only two years 
The Czech army has 445 kilometres Zündschnüre purchased with explosives bomb. 
The year before, the Ministry of Defence has 224 miles powder to the army camp. 
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces for 225 years ausgesorgt. 
The only problem is the durability of the Zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years. 
The army bought the Zündschnüre by the Company STV Group, including For paltry 40 million kronor. 
In his explanatory statement for the procurement of this huge amount of powder said the General Staff MF DNES, the soldiers would annually to consume 60 kilometres powder. 
According to The research from Armeepyrotechnikern, MF DNES point raised is clear from this data that the whole army of an intensive year pyrotechnic training - all the generals and officers of the army commandos, up to the secretaries and cleaners. 
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek is no exception. 
Only then could the substantial annual consumption of 60 kilometres Zündschnüren reasonably justified. 
This length to 25,000 Detonationen. 
But would this army enough stocks for more than ten years. 
But if the old rule of experts is that the training each new professional soldiers two metres powder is quite sufficient, then the army by this Neueinkäufe - also from the point of view of the increased needs of the pioneering special units - a reassuring supply for the already mentioned, 225 years. 
It complained soldiers quickly use Brigade recently, in the Defence Minister Vondra, they have almost no more cartridges for hand guns, so register are severely restricted because of lack of resources. 
Not to mention The Unterhosenmangel. 
"Me is not why they are such huge Zündschnüre buy." 
But it is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need. " 
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we want as traders largely concession," says Jan Děcký distribution managers the STV Group. 
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Department of Defence justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of powder, the army had so for at least ten years with this "ammunition" heckle him. 
Jan Děcký use of the STV Group but talks only of a four-year duration of the Zündschnüre and police and Armeepyrotechniker only two years. 
"With perfect storage are also mentioned possible four years", one of them, but wants to remain unnamed, not to be a soldier accused the criticism of the army. 
After the expiry of the term must use any ammunition thoroughly tested whether it is reliable and not the lives of soldiers at risk. 
But These tests are not for nothing, but cost more money. 
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the amount rebate for 445 kilometres powder. 
"They cost us 60% less than last year supply of 244 miles," spokesman Pejšek tells us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence. 
Only by way of comparison, the annual consumption of Zündschnüren of Pyrotechnikern police, the munitions from the second world war or the Soviet brother army liquidate exceeds some years has barely 1,500 metres. 
And ordered the police always just such quantities of ammunition it before the end of the long-term use can consume. 
The safety of the Pyrotechniker because, furthermore, if one considers the possibility of more modern flexible purchases and therefore reliable Zündschnüre open. 
The Ministry of Defence has already huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tonnes of munitions from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, as the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak People's Army for their campaign to the Rhine. 
According to the Pyrotechnikern MF DNES raised the Czech armed forces have the same problem in a few years in the killing of hundreds of kilometres of old Zündschnüre today as "good" has bought.
