No trace of sadness. 
For the home team dominated his guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States.

The predictions come true, there is a wave of emigration, comparable with those suffered from Ireland in the 1980s. 
After a decade of boom, is now again sadness for the Irish great prosperity. 
The economic crisis, particularly the young, well-educated, Irish, for which it has only uphill. 
Jobverlust and social decline during the boom years seemed absurd. 
Everyone was needed, money was in abundance. 
But now three of ten men and women under 30 without work. 
In the Irish Times, there are loads Leserbriefe young immigrants, the lament: "Everything is in Ireland going down the drain".

Because there was anything more to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now worked with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany. 
In Genselkirchen they just a fashion house. 
In January it goes on Hanover or Berlin, the next project. 
His country is O Donovan now only rarely because he makes extra layers of the credit for his house at home abbezahlen. 
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, as he after a long time, for the first time on the threshold of his home. 
"I should have money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I am never more." 
He laughs and goes through something ausgekühlte areas.
