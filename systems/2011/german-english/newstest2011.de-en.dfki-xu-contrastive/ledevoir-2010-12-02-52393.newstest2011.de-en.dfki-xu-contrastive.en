Bond for the takeover of eXcentris 
The Quebecer government, the Société Angus and the parallèle called on companies to participate financially in the takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris explains with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive loan. 
The developers society Angus and the company Parallèle, a donation of seven million dollars in the Kultusministerium belonging to acceptance of Daniel Langlois cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent had hoped this again its actual cineastischen function to entrust, apparently not receive what they have demanded. 
The government has accepted, in this case, however, on their own terms. 
Instead of the expected donation provides the Quebecer government rather a bond in less than initially hoped that a viable solution to create favourable conditions could, at least in the opinion of the state scaremongers entnehmbaren sources. 
A first action plan and a question after 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, the Bittgesuch, since the sums moderately downwards. 
A proposal together with an action plan have already been approved by the president of the 'Société de Développement of entreprises culturelles "(SODEC), François Macerola, minister of St-Pierre sent the acts eXcentris guides. 
Several days ago, he had to give her one last technical report. 
However, The SODEC Wednesday was sent to the proposal of the Cabinet. 
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December time to respond to this. 
In any case, the premise seems to have been the Staatsspende really pushed aside. 
Let us remember that the Quebecer owners Community cinemas and cinema complex against direct state investment to support the takeover of eXcentris revolted had invoked by the argument, the Culture Ministers have no financial assistance for housing projects there, which he does not sent to other cinemas. 
Several other market participants of the segment heard but in contrast, substantial economic assistance. 
Cinema chief Daniel Langlois had the self-financed construction of the cinema over ten years with great difficulty, the authors cinema in the premises of his cinema complex, with the exception of the Treasury could justify. 
The lack of cinema, the independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew his clientele. 
Société Angus and the company parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, in turn, is a privately financed Campagne, of which it is a sum of $700 000, in order to boost employment. 
Since the spring 2009 continued only a single screen, to show films in eXcentris: Le parallèle. 
The aim of future purchasers is the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the demonstration of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "The hommes et des dieux 'to reopen. 
Christian Yaccarini but has the newspaper Le Devoir 'is not removed, and it ignores what he and his group of the revised downwards proposals keep them.
