Affair Clotilde Reiss: The Elysée Palace exaggerates its intermediary role for Syria 
Inland, more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, considered the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher, which was held for "espionage" in Iran, the French public in breathing, appalled the diplomacy alert and akzentuierte the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran. 
All this under the close scrutiny of diplomats from the United States. 
The WikiLeaks and received by the newspaper Le Monde - American documents give some background to this crisis. 
They describe how the Elysée the Americans had declared his strategy, which went so far as this advice for dealing with their own crisis of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of Wanderern). 
They show how the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman not the release of Majid Kakavand imprisoned in France, and from the American justice because of trade with materials in the Iranian nuclear programme Iranian Gegeleistung. 
Finally, they put the manner with which the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media to the purposes this idea to make credible, Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad have played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss, in a harsh light. 
In truth, he had done nothing in that respect. 
A telegram on 12 August 2009 redigiertes diplomats in Paris entitled "Iran: French comments on their way of dealing with hostage." 
François Richier, Elysée advisers strategy, in the company of Mr Paoli, director of the Quai d "Orsay to North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone. 
They told her French method. 
The advised the Americans, all keen to do their own nationals rückzuführen which would forcibly detained in Iran. 
"Makes noise", they said, 'articulated loud and clear, without going' the words' human rights', 'innocence, "" immediate release "in the media. 
This is necessary in order to the Iranian regime to embarrass the very sensitive to its image. 
", all the more so since you ask the Iranians not to do that." 
Because 'silence solves nothing ", the debate over testing on unauffälligem routes, the Iranians are" masters in Ausweichmanövern. " 
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is a "normal, Iranian tactics ":" Hostage taking for political blackmail. " 
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss (from prison on 16 August should come on the day to take refuge in the French embassy ") for the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians' (230,000 euro) bail. 
And he is announcing the Elysée antizipiere another hostage, a phenomenon that will "intensify". 
The Iranians could "in the near future, another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens arrest living in Iran," he said. 
28 August 2009. 
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison in 12 days, however, continue to be detained in Iran. 
An information was circulated: The Iranians Majid Kakavand, whose extradition to the United States for illegal trade in empfindlichem electronics demand material to Iran, has been released from custody in Paris after a judge's decision. 
The American Embassy is, as with many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence. 
For Washington, which followed the illegal Iranian networks of acquiring the material intended for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand bad news. 
France has a horse-trading on board? 
The release of the Iranian against the Frenchwoman? 
At a further meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September François Richier assured that this is not the case. 
The Elysée, he says, not only was "completely surprised by the decision of the judge," but have also tried it. 
"It has a heated exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government can not change the judicial decision," he says. 
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remain under "strict" control of the French secret service. 
The Elysée advisers elects a telephone number, again, then the American diplomat, the Iranians "is currently in the chair of the Iranian Embassy in Paris." 
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran spares the Elysée not, through its efforts to make pronouncements and organised "flight attempts" by the media believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential role". 
The Americans are watching this activity not without irony, and note that manipulation bears fruit, because several press articles reflect the official French version. 
One of 25 August 2009 datierendes telegram calls "the media the French authorities". 
What is so much "thanks" towards Mr Assad, wonders the Paris embassy. 
"Despite their statements Lobpreis secretly to the French authorities, that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done." 
The document also deals with the reasons that have led to the Elysée this fiction. 
The intensive communication efforts "aimed at Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria to confirm," he analysed. 
A 2008 launched policy then "by many critics in France and abroad was perceived as premature and undeserved." 
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" Paris "Syria is trying to laud what can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region". 
The aim is also to "sowing discord between Syria and Iran." 
The American Embassy know this from a good source. 
On 11 August, François Richier her: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians have whatever". 
"But despite everything we have thanked them." 
"This should at least cause confusion on the part of the Iranians." 
Clotilde Reiss, back to France, on 16 May 2010. 
Nicolas Sarkozy will receive it in the Elysée.
