China considers its targets to reduce greenhouse gases 
China's representative said at the COP16, his country had made substantial efforts to reduce carbon footprints, and it would maintain its offer of 40-45% of its greenhouse gases by 2020. 
China considers his offer the emission of greenhouse gases by 40 to 45% by 2020, Su Wei, the representative of this country in the COP16. 
In his first public appearance at the United Nations (16 world climate summit COP16) assured Su Wei, his country would have enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and convert its industry. 
He said that his country in the last four years have invested $245 million to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. 
However, he said that China would not change his goals, but on this matter would work together with the international community. 
He said that the Chinese strategy on climate change in four aspects under share: Dialogue, capacity building, development of institutions and support pilot programmes. 
Have we made progress In all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy bill last year, the targets for the reduction of the emission of gases meant, he said. 
On the other hand, he stressed that the states with which the authorities in China and the Central State communities working together to achieve the targets for energy saving, the efficient use of energy and reduction of emissions. 
Furthermore, He has enough number multiannual plans have already been undertaken or completed, both those who have been financed by the Chinese government, and those of other countries. 
For Example, he was referring to the programme to Wirksamen use of energy, which was introduced in the last five years, and investment by the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands. 
It is a project at provincial level on climate change, another exchange of traditional incandescent light bulbs with energy-saving pears and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said. 
Martin Krol, scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts are far greater than is commonly believed. 
It showed that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China six tonnes per person betrage 100 tonnes, while in the United States. China is responsible for a overall contribution to environmental pollution. 
Just do it unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has increased by 20 percent in the last five years, and 2020 will be a further, he said.
