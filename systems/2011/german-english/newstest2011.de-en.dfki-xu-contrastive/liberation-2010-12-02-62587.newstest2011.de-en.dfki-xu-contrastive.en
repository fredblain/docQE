Métro Grand Paris: First financial vignettes 
Since the debate about the modernisation of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it rains billion. 
At least in the discussions. 
We call this the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris in memory of the Société du Grand Paris is being built. 
At the start of construction - the SGP MEPs to launch, the state has a Kapitaldotation declared of EUR 4 billion. 
In theory, this system is the sum of the SGP is then in the markets, a part of the financial sum to her twin. 
Today it is finally reached first high bills. 
The supplementary budget by 2010, this morning by the Commission looked at the National Assembly, the measures, the first part of this money. 
It is two measures: The creation of a special tax to Erschließund and higher taxation of offices on the Ile de France. 
The former, so remove Article 15 of the draft law, "the benefit of the public service station Société du Grand Paris." 
This is the product of quantified: "This tax amounts to EUR 117 million per year. 
Zweitere to modernise the existing company taxation: "This is a reorganization to increase its educational product and this increase of Société du Grand Paris's". 
How much would the table? 
A mystery. 
This amount is not in the text. 
Of the 4 billion is away. 
"It is said that the fiscal resources to be allocated EUR 4 billion of the Kapitaldotation being added by the State and the Société du Grand Paris and for the project to be done," is the explanatory statement. 
In the SGP will take place this system not offensive. 
"For the moment when we recorded revenue (the two taxes, R.), you can put on three years of cover and then draw from the 4 billion," explains. 
"This is noted in the budget and gradually withdrawn." 
The SGP estimates that 2013 will be started, to note the 2014 4 billion for the budget. 
This measure, the 4 billion promised one long will seek runs the risk of a very eventful, parliamentary discussion. 
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
