Ogoniland is burned 
The water in the river is ölbraun, it looks like the station: billion litres of Ausgelaufenes crude oil have destroyed the natural in Ogoniland in Nigeria. 
The people of theft, corruption and illegal Ölkochen. 
Celestine Akpobari means well. 
"You will not be" reassured haunts the eco activist journalists: 'You will still have the lens oily slime enough today. " 
The 37-year-old Nigerians has followed the attempt, a until the chest in water watenden boys with the surrounding Schlieren abzulichten: In the regenbogenfarbenen water the scene almost nicely. 
That Under the surface brown Rohölschwaden, is not to see. 
Previously Have buckets way shrimp collected told Esther Badom on the shores of the Bodo-Jetty river. 
Now is the lazy river waters completely dead. 
Five years ago, poured from a geborstenen pipeline tons of crude oil in the vast wetland. 
Fishermen from the nearby city Bodo must now six hours row to fish containing waters, in the heart of the Niger Delta Ogoniland is one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world. 
On the journey through the Flussläufen criss-crossed Mangrovensümpfe is apparent the full extent of the devastation. 
Instead water wühlt motor boat brown Brühe on who its hand pops into the water, ölige finger. 
The roots of the Mangrovenbäumchen stand out as black Lakritzstangen from the ground, sad I occasionally present palms their Wedel depend. 
Vogelschwärme as usual in wetlands are meted: Once the External war remains silent in the former as a filling station riechenden paradise gespenstische calm spreads. 
"What happens is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari gloomy: "We live in constant danger for the health." 
The war comparison is apt. 
The Ogoni settlement is a disputed battlefield for decades: Here, more than 60 years ago, the first Explorateure from Europe, here in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa later executed the first organised resistance here the Shell had to stop his production company in 1993 because it was dangerous for its Ölarbeiter. 
Today the company return Ogoniland denied: While across the delta region of triple the size of Switzerland with about 5,000 Bohrquellen and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines are pumped more than two million barrels a day of the black gold, oil fields in Ogoniland collapsed, the situation is too unstable to the company. 
Every few hundred metres stand out stählerne Gestelle as fanciful sculptures from the water: "Christbäumchen" are the heads of the boreholes much to zärtlich mentioned. 
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded. 
Always breche such a Bohrkopf apart, says Akpobari, then rinne a constant stream of crude oil into the water. 
More than two billion litres of the quantity of oil spilled into the ecosystem of the Delta experts estimate in 50 years: Year after year, as the wreck of the super-tanker Exxon Valdez '"21 years into the sea off Alaska became one of the biggest environmental disaster in the history of mankind. 
Who is to blame for the continuing eco-meltdown, it is argued. 
While the Shell company sabotage and organised Öldiebstahl blames for more than 90% of the pollution, see environmentalists berstende Bohrköpfe and lecke pipelines as the main culprit. 
Shell in Nigeria attach much lower safety standards than elsewhere in the world, accusing the US scientist Richard Steiner, the company of 2008: The rate of defects in the pipes was "considerably higher than elsewhere". 
In one place, which from a distance looks like a abandoned oil workshop in the open air, popping from the mangroves characters: Cluster naked and They are up to our necks ölverschmiert. 
Among the many barrels, which are partly linked tubes, partly arbitrary scattered on the site to identify future has come a fire: An illegal small refinery. 
In the barrel, crude oil on the fire several hours fervid, says Michael, the head of the group. 
First insist petrol through the pipes in the Auffangtopf later spits at the end of the pipeline, kerosene and diesel. 
So produce Michael and four staff on a daily basis up to four barrels of diesel à 300 litres: "It brings us 34,000 Naira a" - around 22 dollars. 
The delta residents use the chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state of black Africa. 
Nigeria has only one refinery. 
The Ridiculously low with just 40 euro cents per litre diesel price can undercut the illegal Kocher: Because its resource get it for free. 
He comes from "Bunkerern 'pipeline network across Ogoniland tap: Go to the country, according to experts in the entire Niger day lost at least 16 million litres of crude oil. 
Only a tiny part of the provisionally between raw material stored illegally fashioned methods, however: The lion's share will fill organised criminal networks, which include politicians and senior military tankers and in command on the world market. 
The debate is whether the environmental disaster due to the activities of the population or the lax production of activist Akpobari for purely academic. 
"The oil companies would not perceived as invaders and they would have the livelihood of the fishermen not so thoroughly destroyed, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries." 
Now is the relationship of the Ogoni especially Shell but destroyed so that only a withdrawal of the group in question would be: "Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese stand out as better." 
As Michael nervous. 
"High time that it disappears," says the muskulöse put. 
"Every minute, the soldiers can come." 
The illegal Ölveredler of the special forces are caught, they are not arrest, but a painful bribes. 
The mainly hail from the north - as all Nigerians - from the raw material benefit. 
"This damn toys has brought our country in every respect to the dog," says Akpobari.
