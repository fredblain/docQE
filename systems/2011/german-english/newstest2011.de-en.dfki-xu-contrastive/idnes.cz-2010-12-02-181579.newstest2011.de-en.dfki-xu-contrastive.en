The right mattress and the proper beds rust Women have other wishes than men? 
Not the tollste bed framework, but the quality of the deck area - mattress and rust make the good bed. 
These are, however, ways to meet the wishes of the specific user. 
In selecting many things play a role - the weight, size, health and, last but not least, the sex of the Schläfers. 
Equally important is the Interieur where mattress and rust. 
Typical example? 
In a Wochenendhaus, not regularly heated, are not well suited to Latexmatratzen because they are much longer, "warm". 
In addition, they are much more serious than usual polyurethane foams mattresses. 
And, it should be changed regularly. 
If it is not enough Entlüftungskanälchen essentially have and still have a strong record, snarled moisture in, so it is not ruled out that the tape. 
Of course, also plays a role in the election, accustomed to what one. 
Anyone who has been a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with soft class, will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with hard surface. 
"All you get from the NHL have returned, have complained to me that they can no longer sleep right here." 
"For their abgeschundenen shoulders, and Hüften they simply need a soft layer from Visco-foam (memory Foam - a form of memory-Polymer)." 
"This I recommend including sugar people under a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the" information "from the ligaments and the skin is bad," says Sylva Hadamcziková, specialising in Polstermöbel. 
I therefore have many years ago Eishockeyspielern, but also other customers this mattresses with Visco-sparkling (memory Foam) concerned. 
"today, it is no longer a problem, because such mattresses provide among manufacturers Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico. ' 
And one need not necessarily be a famous you learn to appreciate the benefits of foam Visco-. 
This "miracle" actually works quite simple. 
The foam optimalisiert his toughness and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, he schmiegt downright warm body. 
Nowhere is there in the night, rolling around as after a serious fight. 
It is simply sleeping much better. 
The viskoelastische sparkling also offers protection against Dekubitus (gangrene). 
In the election of the Matratzengröße should be to body size is still the length of the Fußsohlen add some 21 to 34 inches. 
As Mrs Mann on the 180 cm are large need as a 210 to 220 cm bed. 
Each of the Schläfer should at least 90 cm is widely available, is 180 cm. 
In Einzelbetten, for example in singles, 120 to 140 cm. 
The comfort and also for the visitors. 
Otherwise the following applies rule of thumb for the ideal bed broad: "If you on the back, should have enough room for the easy angewinkelten arms," advises mine. Polsterer Helena Prokopová, Zunftmeisterin and Raumausstatter for years the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and this discussion at a university. 
In a double bed everyone needs a own rust and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are too high. 
Otherwise there is nothing different amounts than the Roste assembling and this is not possible in every bed framework. 
Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with the skeleton 15 cm, should be at least three centimetres in the form of class and the fine cushion. 
"With the hand or the Hinsetzen the feathers on no account should we felt", warns Helen Prokopová. 
Each mattress makes a specific Rosttyp. 
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and under position as evolved Siamzwillinge have no place in the bedroom. 
These mattresses cannot drop and you cannot wash, which is already commonplace today. 
And since we are in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years slowly to a huge (and sieve). 
Also therefore reject specialists advertising slogans in mattresses a life span of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee. 
Every cause has its ifs and buts. 
And so a practical Council by dealers: Mattresses of 120 or 140 cm diameter the hygiene of waschbaren abziehbaren salaries should not be afraid, however, it is recommended to use a Matratzenschoner you can easily leave and wash. 
Even if today usually Matratzenbezüge with Rundumreißverschluss manufactured so that you get after the opening two halves (immensely important for the Waschvorgang and washing machines size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, often alone, especially as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. 
They have in bed instead of a Rostes firm record? 
Get out of it. 
Or for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night. 
So should they prefer the record with ventilation holes (if not content) and mattresses with pen skeleton and 15 cm minimum height so pockets with pen core and finely cushion. 
Polyurethane foams mattresses belong on such a basis. 
For not verstellbare Lattenroste with 14 to 18 (Lamellen) are Latex- or Sandwichmatratzen suited (possibly also combinations of Latex and Kokos), always afford it with a larger Lattenanzahl Roste from 28 and more pen with Lordosenstütze in Lendenwirbelbereich and the ability to regulate the Lattenhärte. 
On verstellbare Lamellenroste does not include mattresses with Federskelett, since they do not belong to the ergonomische hardly react. 
Alongside the attitudes of stiff the pen will make special flexible shoulder modules. 
This is a special strengthen the pen, which allows the pen makes einzudrücken or even to verwinkeln that they allow the individual Einsinken the shoulder of the Schläfers. 
Especially important for men with broad shoulders. 
There is even Matratzenhersteller which have started to use "soft Herrenmatratzen" zones for the shoulder area. 
In The ladies is thought - them fighting these soft zones in the Hüftgegend. 
For most demanding customers are punktelastische wing stroke systems (Lattoflex) or Roste burden with points of contact-Pads with so Multitorsionsfederung. 
The pressure will be distributed on several points, thus reducing the tension. 
But, if the right mattress and right rust a bad (too big and fülliges), most are used Kopfkissen benefits lost. 
Here too, a rule of thumb: The to the head, his top should only up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles relax. 
Ideal is therefore a 50 x 60 cm big cushion, as for example the Scandinavians. 
In the side should Kopfkissen (along with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or soft zone in the bed) offset the shoulder height. 
Have our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (fat) Strohsäcken but with hay. 
Modern manufacturers use natural materials, or at least their mixtures. 
Also In the new magic formula "organic". 
Instead of oil raw materials used to manufacture of Polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturelle oils - for example, Rizinus- and soya oil. 
Soya is well used by all known manufacturers. 
"Organic mattresses, which means their nuclear materials from purely natural origin is," said Petr Vašíček by the company Tropico Plus. 
Natural materials, but also in the production of Matratzenbezügen - one of the first was Aloe Vera. 
But one can also micro-capsules grant in sleep, Mr President fresh woodland or Lavendelduft spread. 
Here too there is a difference between men and women. 
While the men a "kühlender" Pflanzenextrakt from Birkenblättern used so that the Matratzenbezug absorb heat and cool the body can have the salary for women "wärmende" effect. 
Extracts from red Paprikaschoten stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex will sleep, Mr President wohlig warm. 
And The current favourites? 
Foam mattresses from cold (he has greater Poren with devastated Zellstruktur and is therefore breathing trade more active than usual Polyurethan) and also a lot more flexible. 
The combination of the various Kaltschäumen stiff (severity) and Visco-foaming does occur create More zones mattresses, know exactly where capita, hip and closely. 
For a quality mattress, though, has to fork out 7,000 kronor and more. 
Gesundheitsmatratzen but are usually with lower VAT burden, because they are considered medical device. 
The first Czech companies were Gumotex this advantage. 
You see, in the bed and the pair to save is not so easy. 
And there are special offers of manufacturers and distributors, the two mattresses for the price of one. 
So the brand Magniflex offers the mattress Duofreeze with in relation verstepptem Visco-foam memory for 11.990 CZK. 
The second will get free to do so. 
It was the Tempur material which the era of viskoelastischen sparkling substances with open Zellstruktur and high density in almost kosmischem pace. 
No surprise, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are involved in the launch enormous excessive. 
Tempur will heat soft, cool milieu entrenched it again. 
So it is to the human body is perfect and distributed in the best possible way, the body pressure. 
It is therefore not only on the prevention of Druckbrand, but generally the sleep of comfort. 
Viskoelastische sparkling substances will not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as for specific Fußpolstern used the legs and the Gefäßen provide relief. 
Domestic producers use the example of sparkling substances Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
