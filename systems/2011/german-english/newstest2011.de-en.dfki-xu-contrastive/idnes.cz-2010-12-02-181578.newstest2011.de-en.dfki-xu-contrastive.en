A bone House fascinates even after 100 years. If you look at the Interieure of Gaudi 
The roof seems to the backs of prehistoric Echse, the stairs as the vertebral column of Dinosauriers and Balkone are aufgerissene Fischmäuler. 
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. 
From the local residents, the house with his organic forms the nicknames "bones house." 
Organic forms, wild colours, the unusual use of stone, Kachelsplittern and mosaic, the scales facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all of these are typical features for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi. 
The facade of the House plays with dream liable lines lack force paints and Texturen in nature and living creatures. 
Only On closer inspection, they noticed that everything from geometry, rhythm and thoughtful dominated order. 
In the night, the whole facade still plastic, dramatic and the special Anleuchtung reinforces the glory of the colours. 
The same dynamic lines and tortuous forms also dominate the interior of the House. 
Waves geformtes wood copied the window frames, support, Zierelemente of doors, even Gucklöcher and trade. 
The House Batlló in the quarter Eixample on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No 43 was created by converting a house in 1877, the architects Emilio Sala Cortese said. 
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906. 
The investor, the wealthy industrialists Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but in the end it agreed the idea Gaudís on an unusual and cheaper reconstruction. 
The rental house, Casa Batlló devised Antoni Gaudí but not alone. 
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol together. 
Just On the drawing board created the Dekorationen for representative housing and the Realitätenbesitzers use of mosaics of responding façade was his idea. 
In the design of the facade, but also worked with many other Bildner and artists. 
The joint work on the drafting of the Casa Batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí. 
So Jujol also involved in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá in the Park Güell where other works of Antoni Gaudí. 
Shortly after its completion, the home of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the moniker Knochenhaus'. 
Others called it the specific Fensteröffnungsmechanismus because of the "yawning House". 
It also says that the top of the building is the sword of Saint George, of the existence of Catalonia. 
But further bildhauerische elements symbolize hidden religious motives. 
Gaudí devised a unique central heating system for the time for the House with Entlüftungskanälen and typical Kaminen. 
Something weird is their 45-degree slopes already. 
In his creation Gaudí consistently ignored all the building codes and did not influence this. 
Before the appropriate planning permission but the start of construction - although he absorbed from the city of it claims made about the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later in completing the city fathers were so horrified by the result that they remedy. 
Gentlemen of The Council found that among other things, that the construction with its pillars even in the public pavement intervening. 
More amendments, however, it was not quite the opposite - only 15 days after the call of the urban community, Josep Batlló a motion authorising the lease of the two upper floors of the House - and was promptly given him. 
The homeowners themselves, in the lower floors. 
In the gallery in 2 Stock was a Gesellschaftssalon, on the third floor were bedrooms and private rooms housing. 
The ground floor was leased to a Juweliergeschäft. 
The whole sechsstöckige buildings undergoing a steps up to Dachterrasse. 
The main elements of the redevelopments were all right corner and straight lines removed and replaced by bent and geschwungene walls. 
Gaudí worked but also with a modern approach to mutual connection of spaces. 
The social part through the opening of Salontüren completely combine and greater society chatting comfortably without vertraulicheren on talks with a certain degree of intimacy. 
The House received by Gaudís retrofit except a new facade of a very unusual roof and two other floors. 
Impressively is also Gaudís game with the light, and the blue and white glasierten Kacheln with which the courtyard dressed and light. 
The game these two colours gives maximum light all floors of the House. 
While he made simply exploiting the principle that white reflects the light is better than dark colors, contrary to absorb sunlight. 
The House Casa Batlló, in 2005 the World Heritage List Unesco, everyone can now visit. 
The first floor is the geräumigste and prächtigste home made available to the public. 
Homeowners decided only in The years to this step and that the 150.Geburtstags of the famous Creator. 
As we noted that this is a very profitable business, retained inspections, indeed we extended it to other common and the Dachgeschossräume, including the Dachterrasse. 
The price for an inspection of the is no trifling matter, however, he is EUR 16,50, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourists cards get 20% reduction. 
This figure exceeds the entry prices to other Gaudí-construction in the city. 
Who the real atmosphere of the house with his Drachentürmchen acquaintance should try to close friendship with one of the inhabitants and visit him at home.
