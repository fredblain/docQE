The ice-university 
In "gelato University" in Bologna Eiskonditoren prepared for better times of the year. 
The three-day Grundkurs for future Gelatieri has the largest feeder and visitors from around the world. 
Why is actually the whole ice? 
The Gelatiere and the Gelataio. 
The Gelatiere on German something old-fashioned the Eiskonditor represents cream following all the rules of the Italian Eismacherkunst. 
The Gelataio is catching up with a Spachtel the ice cream from the Kühltheke, it abolishes the Waffel and then selling them. 
In order to know this, we must not Anzola Dell Emilia Bologna in the province. 
But who would like to know more about ice, is not in the 'gelato-University "the Italian firm Carpigiani over. 
The ice University has the manufacturer of Eismaschinen in 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines everywhere the high Italian ideals. 
The three-day Grundkurs for future Gelatieri has the largest feeder and visitors from around the world. 
But there are also more day Spezialkurse around the Schokoladeneis and internships in the House own Eisdiele. 
Some in the mid-life crisis dreams of a new career, other cars simply let the treacherous ice of vague aspirations. 
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia. 
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow-food movement and the country's industrial Ice-cream will provide a European quality product. 
Anke from Berlin is business adviser and after years in a nerve-racking job eintüten gone. 
Two young Egyptians dream in Cairo to open a Eisdiele. 
A man from Malta and a wish to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars from Brazil - and the Canadian housewife Julia is because their children Italian ice cream. 
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari declared the participants first the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream. 
It is not only good taste, but also the seidige fluidity and good consistency. 
Luciano forgets his training but also not the icing on the cake of national and südländischen excess construction: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and there is still plenty of romanticism." 
The first step to manufacturing seems very simple. 
Luciano dump the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a major Mixgerät with an electronic programme everything to 85 degrees heated and then immediately to four degrees. 
Then he turns to a tap on the machine, and is a white pasteurised Basiscreme basis for all Milcheissorten. 
The teacher immediately with questions: Can ice cream only with natural substances without stabiliser? 
How can one of their own Experimentierlust free rein? 
Luciano warns, the spirit of the age to be fooled. 
Who of ice cream "only from natural ingredients", has probably still stabilisers - usually a natural product, such as Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne. 
Of course you can ice without stabiliser, only it must then be sold within a day, otherwise sackt it, and bite the customer to Eiskörnchen louder. 
Certain variations in the mass are allowed. 
There will be more Exciting with flavourings. 
For the ice taste different Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients in the fruit-department or the sweets of supermarket buying. 
In addition, there are powder and Pasten. 
"The suppliers are all trying to foist onto dozens aromatic additives you." 
"But you should simply experiment." 
Either the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruit. 
Or in the ice cream from the white reason mass with eggs to the yellow cream and cocoa powder into the basis for all kinds of chocolate temptations offered. 
Now the course participants in the Eismaschinen. 
Luciano will they each four different types of Vanille-, Schokolade-, Mokka- and produce Haselnuss-Eis - with or without eggs in the mass with more or less Vanillearoma or other natural supplements. 
The same experiment will also Fruchteissorten. 
More flavourings, more fruit-Püree - geschmacklich is not necessarily better. 
Haselnuss-ice tastes not necessarily nut, when it contains more hazelnuts. 
The most popular Kiwi-ice, the working group, the more fruit, using less water and less stabiliser. 
Only a balanced combination would highlight the taste of a gelato clear says Luciano. 
Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: Will peach-Püree used with a lot of sugar, the sugar in the recipe must be reduced. 
For Zitroneneis an extra dose of sugar is necessary. 
Luciano a device, with which he prefers the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winemakers to measure the Oechsle in grape musts). 
Fortunately, facilitate tables the calculation. 
Ice to make requires not so much physical use as before. 
Not only the equipment for the automatic restoration of basic mass helps. 
There is also a device in the ready-made ice-mix at the same time cremig beaten and freezing temperatures refrigerators. 
Despite all the automated remain accidents. 
The Brazilian Gustavo acquitted him and his colleagues from top to bottom with Fruchtpüree than the colossal hand blenders spiral out of control. 
"In every direction," says Maestro Luciano, "it is only a matter of time until something happens."
