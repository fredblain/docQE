A long finger than ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer 
Men whose finger is long, as the Ringfinger, are obviously a lower risk of developing prostate cancer. 
That is the surprising results of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer. 
This is the levels of the male hormone testosterone. 
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer can serve and this particular to sixty in men," said the signing of the study, Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick. 
The finger could help to determine which men are necessarily a prostate cancer testing should, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health problems, added Mrs Eeles added. 
In the period 1994-2009 followed it with their colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men. 
More than half of the participants of the study was the fingers of the right hand shorter than the ring finger. 
For these men was the same likelihood of prostate cancer, as for 19% of those men whose vaccination and finger were equally long. 
In men, whose finger was longer than the ring finger, fell by 33%, however, this risk in men to sixty even by 87 percent. 
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, in prenatal age form obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones, which the child in the womb. 
Less testosterone is a long finger. 
Previous research found that the testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer. 
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticists and former chairman of the National Academy of Sciences, said ČTK him was this study fleetingly aware, he nevertheless consider that the relationship between the finger length and cancer risk have not proved to be "completely".
