In the middle of secretly 
In the weeks after the sudden death of your man told Argentina's President Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, their popularity rate by 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest level since her election in 2007. 
But whether its a re-election next year, it depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández is further compromises as her late husband, Néstor Kirchner, her predecessor and political partner. 
The signs are not clear. 
Néstor Kirchner, even after the election, his wife economic policy, was often budget plans, the tax revenue, economic growth and inflation not fully into account. 
This allowed the couple to spend the extra revenue as they see fit. 
On paper, the Fernández-government lost the majority in Congress last year. 
But the opposition is divided and Kirchners death after a heart attack on 27 October, leading to further Zerwürfnissen. 
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández. 
But after chaotic meetings (where a Member of Parliament another in the face, and other proposed the government policy of corruption), the Congress, the budget for 2011. 
"I will not discuss," the President. 
The 2010 budget applies now for the next year, which the President has more opportunity to spend money as they see fit. 
The economy is hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year. 
The official inflation rate is z.Z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - up to almost 30%. 
Kirchner took office in 2003, when Argentina was beset by economic crisis, said growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not reduce inflation. 
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, has singled out for bullying as the private sector and säuberte the National Institute for Statistics and census INDEC, prompting the official inflation statistics schönte. 
Fernández Now can we take? 
It has business and union leaders called for talks. 
And According to official wage increases should be limited to 18% next year. 
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have a strong boost to the economy. 
But inflation undermined the growth spurt by a large devaluation in 2002. 
Perhaps to Cristina Fernández why Argentina financial economically back to the rest of the world. 
Earlier this year, the government had rejected a previous refinancing agreement with shareholders of the country in 2001. 
Fernández Now appears on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which it owes about $6.7 billion. 
The Kirchners have had a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere, always rejected. 
But last month, the economy minister, Amado Boudou, announced that the Fund in the drafting of a new national consumer price index "technical assistance". It looks as if this is the first step to clean up the INDEC. 
It is not known whether Fernández after leaving office without the support of her husband politically active. 
If so, it needs to get the support of the middle class, which largely enough by Kirchnerism. 
If the Argentinians will return from their summer holidays, in March the wave of Sympatie she was shown abgeebbt. 
If they win another election, she must decide whether they would many political decisions of their man quietly lifted.
