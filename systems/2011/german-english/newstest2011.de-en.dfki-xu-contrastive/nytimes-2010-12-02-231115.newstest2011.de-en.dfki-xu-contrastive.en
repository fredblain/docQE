Tech Toys keeps your gifts budget in balance 
This year's favourite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect Videokonsole. Both games can be a great hole in your Geschenkebudget. 
A iPad costs as much as five BMX-wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game around 10 classic Spring rush or approximately 48 doses Play-Doh. 
But you can protect your Geschenkebudget. 
I recently visited in search of three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys' R 'Us and a BJ's Wholesale club. 
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law has entered into force. This year, the technology toys are efficient and cost less than last year. 
And while fewer new toys with its own website, is the best known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, improved supply. 
There are more and more button-cell-powered toys on the market, and many of them contain wiederaufladbare batteries. 
Here are a few suggestions. 
(Unless otherwise indicated, are all prices of toys "R" Us.) 
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for children from the age of 3 years) are Plüschfiguren, as big as sea pig that if you sing a note on its belly. 
Even push meets a note by mehrmaliges flick you can play a song. 
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony. 
Respect: If you with the pressing started, you can no longer stop. 
For a combination of Gesand and dancing is the Dance star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60 for children, 2) the best choice. 
On the basis of last year developed Elmo Live technology offers the animatronische doll recantations as' Simon says' and, thanks to the new interface feet with Radblockierung dominated the moon-Walk. 
Children who tested the machine use Mickey as a dance teacher, but Their parents complained about the lack of volume. 
If you are a child of the 1980s, certainly remember Alphie, one of the first computerized Lernspielzeuge. 
Now he is back (Hasbro / play Kool, $40, for children from the age of 3), with a whole bunch of issue cards with a car journey to a teaching can be, with a preached with car-function as a teacher. 
If you want to entrust your child Smartphone, here are three independent alternatives. 
MobiGo of VTech ($60 for children 3 to 8) is the cheapest and benutzerfreundlichste solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. The Games, however, are not as instructive as contained in the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children 3 to 12 after Leapfrogs), the first major revision of the Leapster-Reihe is equipped with a new, brighter screen. 
The versions not compatible with older cassettes. 
IXL from Fisher-Price ($90 for children 3 to 7) for the Games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD-card plant family photographs can also be seen. 
Finally, there is still Scrabble flash ($30 of Hasbro, for children from the age of 8). the five bloc are no bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED-Bildschirm. 
At stake is the blocks words together, before the time. It is great to improvise a Buchstabierwettbewerb. 
More and more toys have a kind of online link. 
If you are on offer in the toy shops, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important. 
For your child an online animal in Club Penguin, you can, for example, a Disney Club Penguin 2 'mix' match figures package ($5 for children 6-12) buy a coin with a secret code. 
If you have the code online your child in Club Penguin Store enough bill for two other parts. 
The animal can roll shoes or a Puffle-hydrogen. 
The latest Kopfzellen-betriebene Mikroroboter, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children 5) is larger than the head of your toothbrushes. 
The Käfer moves quickly to 12 vibrierenden silicone legs in any direction. 
It makes fun to send him through a maze Klötzen. 
And he does something. 
Our fell from the dinner table and überstand even some time in the mouth of our dog.
