The demokatrische routine 
The movement for democracy in Latin America will be stronger, such as the support of private companies. 
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment. 
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States. 
These results came the Latinobarómetro survey carried out in 18 countries and exclusively was published in The Economist. 
This survey is being carried out regularly since 1995 and shows that the change in this region. 
Two facts in this year's survey in September and October, particularly in's eye. 
First, the good mood in Latin America 
And secondly the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions. 
In many countries of the South American Pacific coast has greatly increased the democratic movement (so table 1). 
In Peru, for example, where the economy is growing at approximately 6% year since 2002, the number of democracy advocates of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. 
In Mexico, where the economy since the onset last year recovered, is such a trend. 
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries of the region, are what the regional average cuts (so Diagram 2). 
Approximately 44% of respondents said that they are satisfied with their country's democratic practice. The same as last year, 25% more than in 2001 (diagram 3). 
Some 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values are those of last year, but show a sharp increase from 2003 (17% and 24%). 
A decade ago undermined efforts to Latin America's economic crisis, more democracy. 
Also during the global economic crisis lasted perhaps is that the countries of Latin America experienced only a brief recession and a speedy recovery. 
Moreover, the poor absorbed by a stronger social network. 
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America only slightly and is again this year fell by 32%.) 
But there is strong mood from country to country differences (so diagram 4). 
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread Fortschrittsdenken. 
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession mount and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case. 
Only the second time since the poll began many respondents in Latin America in a bigger problem than crime in their country in the unemployment (5). 
Some 31% say that either they or a family member last year were victims of a crime. But declined the values and 38% last year, reaching the lowest level since 1995. 
The rising economic performance is reflected in the greater support from the private and the market economy: around 71% of respondents on regional said that the private sector is essential for the development, in 2007 there were 56% (6). 
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy their country can bring progress, compared with 47% last year. 
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela this view maintained (and 80% are for a private sector), even though its left-wing President, Hugo Chávez, many private companies. 
Brazil has the biggest influence in the region last year, according to 19% of respondents (18%), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year). 
The respondents in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, and this role in the Dominican Republic of Venezuela and Nicaragua.
