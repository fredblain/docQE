Posturing of the European Central Bank (ECB) 
Investors reacted strongly yesterday on the threat of ECB President Trichet, warned that "markets should not underestimate our capacity to respond." 
The euro Peripheriländer risk premia increased dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%. 
We should, however, the possibility that the ECB and the euro can hardly deceive points, which led to concern not underestimate. 
The events of yesterday are typical for an illiquid market collapses in the extent to which he recovered, but following the closure of short and highly speculative positions. 
The institutional investors will not lose his fear. 
A month ago urged the European Central Bank to reverse our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen, whereby the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably many times in the future, must backtrack. 
The Bundesbank has called for the lifting of the plan to buy government debt, because they are ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. it is Only a einwöchiger permanent access will be maintained. 
After the Ireland-crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures "at least until March" extended and the quarterly contracts with unlimited access at quarter end to guarantee the liquidity until at least June. 
We also expect that the programme to buy bonds and spend a stärkendes signal. 
If the created expectations are not met, the excellent response from the markets yesterday back and if halstarrig insistence that we withdraw our liquidity measures can only God help us! 
Just as with the ECB meeting in May, when the bank confirmed the purchase of government debt securities not to consider and then the markets collapsed, that history could repeat tomorrow. 
The ECB must be credible and tenaciously. 
In May showed the teeth and on Wednesday said they, too, which they bought a new collapse of the market. 
Yesterday was the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal rather weak. 
The state asset management was only 500 million to 5,28% to 750 million 4,81% in the previous auction. 
Yet the interest rates in Portugal by 30 basis points across the curve and reflected a perception changes in the markets after the words Trichet's. 
In Ireland the Schuldenlochs of Allied and Bank of Ireland the figures were published. 
The sum is estimated at approximately 10 000 million in the short term and possible further 15 000. There is time until February, private capital or these banks will be nationalized. 
Although Ireland has lost all its credibility, after it had not identified the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures within the framework of the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce the uncertainty. 
However, the government must obtain the parliamentary assent to his new budget next Tuesday. Because it still does not have the sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty. 
Angela Merkel has their discourse at the summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December moderate. There is political unity needed to show that together we play the same score. 
The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries the ninth symphony Beethoven's. 
The Spanish Government yesterday emphasised the action plan on Friday is expected to be approved by the Council of Ministers. 
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reducing the public deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures, The sound like Vivaldis four seasons in the ears of investors. 
The dual effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges. 
Compared with the February was the reaction of the government and the Bank of Spain quickly and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect. 
Today there is a major auction of a three-year government bonds, which will benefit from the Trichet Effect. That is why we are a strong demand, which will remove all doubts about our ability to refinance. 
The application of an aid plan for Spain would be a self-sacrifice. 
We would liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would close without notice. 
Nevertheless, our strategy should comply with the motto Caesar's wife: "Now is not only the existence, but also of bogus." 
Only courage that we create.
