Paul Coggins, main defenders of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call on Monday, a prosecutor and a further the next day, in which he was told that the Ministry will raise no complaints against his clients. 
Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator, as his office, in a statement on Wednesday again repeated, "in accordance with the law."

"I am not well in the conversation details between me and the Ministry of Justice. Just say this much: we believe the right decision," he said. 
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop the investigation for a separate complaint with the ethics group, after a payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensigns parents to the Hamptons against the federal election law. 
The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift. 
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, the length of time senator, was one of the firms, in which Mr. Hampton thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyists working. 
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that, after the company Mr. Hampton has got as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, in which he told him that he had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, the Interior Ministry for a cause "anklopfe." 
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and one other customers from Nevada, Allegiant Air, agreed to lunch and asked the transport Minister, a meeting on behalf of the airline to agree after Mr. Hampton to lobby had stopped.
