A tenant of Bakala: He fueling the kiln, yet pays higher rent 
An elderly untersetzter men just leaves the society clients centre RPG Byty of "Kohlebarons" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest Privatbesitzers of rental housing in the Czech Republic. 
Under the arm a commemorative envelope with three new rental agreements to three homes: For our own and the homes of his daughters and his son, just a sentence. 
All three in the context of the so-called "deregulation" just rent increases. 
Instead of 3,500 kronor per month to rent the son next year for a two-room apartment with kitchen in the second category 4100 kroner fork out. 
"And There are times in housing not fluent hot water and heat must be in a simple coal stove," if he angered pointing the finger at the new lease of the son, whose signing he has a power. 
"But what I," he says - signed half annoys and half resignedly. 
The citizens association BytyOKD.cz, the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral," advises not to sign the tenants, the new agreements simple, and to wait until 7 December at which it intends to publish guidance as it combats such contracts. 
But the man beckons only. 
"One says this, the other the", it makes a benighted face. 
The region is Ostrava to large "deregulation laboratory." 
After the New Year is this deregulation most rental housing in the Czech Republic before, whose tenants have not been highly marketable pay rent. 
Aktuálně.cz, therefore, this "laboratory" personally. 
The RPG-waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the region Ostrava and nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday packed. 
Alongside the door the Bodyguards a safety agency and a call. 
"Rent in 2011, so is a special Tastfeld Touchscreen. 
Short angetippt and already spuckt the device a list of numbers. 
Hardly the number entziffert "157, and we have already piepst at the large display from the ceiling of the waiting area. 
Half a minute later is seen in the series. 
A little later an old couple enters the waiting room to ask after the rent, but the onslaught in the waiting room is obviously not the new rent. 
Most people are here to the usual problems to solve - repairs, insurance and so on. 
As of mid-November fly in the region Kuverts Ostrava with the new rental agreements with the most tenants of a total of 44.000 apartments in the portfolios of RPG in the letter boxes. 
The RPG Byty proposes them in the letter a rent increase of around 15 to 38%. 
The special switch to the new rent in clients centre is opened since 18 November. 
"The action is a little over a week, which means that this is only the beginning," answer the ladies behind the counter for a moment of hesitation, as the "client" as a journalist dictator. 
The deregulation and Bakalas former miners' homes are a sensitive issue. 
Before the elections, the Vice-President Lubomír Parliament originating in Ostrava Zaorálek by the ČSSD raised this issue quite loudly, no surprise that today the newspapers are full of them. 
"Twenty years of them I want a new floor." 
"Not even ne besch. WC-glasses they were positioned," is the aforementioned man air. 
Until now, according to the staff, especially pensioners on counters, in order to convince whether they promised tenants moderation really receive promises RPG when they Spezialangebot sign in time. 
In a half reduced February rent the other tenants, the new lease until 15 December sign. 
Until now, "switch" in Havířov but anything other than overloaded of questions. 
"From yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent due in 2011," here appreciate the counters officials. 
RPG offers both on their websites, as well as Wandtafeln individual Mietvereinbarungen, where it appears necessary. 
But they will not agree to the new rent, the set by an independent court. 
"This is not a threat, but as information about the only viable and legitimate legal approach to understand," said RPG on its websites. 
"No one goes to court," says one of the workers from RPG Byty and one man on the street before the clients centre gives it at least partly right. 
"I have 13,000 (kroner) pension, it left me 5,000 eating, where I should find the money for a legal dispute," he says. 
Then the employees but uncertain. 
"Time." 
"Mr Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and people still waiting for it," she notes. 
The regulated rent ends in the largest part of the Czech Republic New Year 2011 and RPG Byty according to increase the rent is an economic necessity. 
"The existing amount of maintenance rent is not the Wohnfonds from," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the Wohnungs portfolios of society RPG Byty and - particularly of the disgruntled tenants criticised neglect of housing fund is the homeowners believe that the main reason for the rent increase. 
While RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the rent collected four billion in housing could invest in the four years from 2011 to 2014 to 5.2 billion. 
At the large format LCD) display from the ceiling to the Polstersesseln in the waiting room of Havířov appear staged is always a few red shining information. 
"The rent increases by 15% in 2011 and less concern 31 200 homes, which means more than 90% of the homes of RPG." 
"Always this means most 7,50 CZK per square metre and month" is on the LCD screen to read. 
Only 400 homes from the portfolio of RPG has increased the rent by 38 percent. 
"In these cases, it is to increase extremely low rental prices of 19,66 CZK per square metre," argued RPG. 
In 2600 housing remains the rent at the same level next year. 
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation rents not spectacular, but gradually within four and eight years ago. 
What more - the company imposes a further commitment: All revenue from the rent increase (see diagram) wants it back in the houses, especially in heat savings - in new windows and insulation. 
But, primarily to those people benefit the agreements on the Mieterhöhung sign.
