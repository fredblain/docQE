</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But the Council Mr Karel Březina, a political veteran, reacted to a similar way. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example, the term "Gulf hole". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "This is the only expression of those who are here with me, I am now and again." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Otherwise, I think often infiltrated by slang not much." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="11"> The House Batlló in the Eixample quarter of the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No 43 was created by the refurbishment of the house, which dates from 1877, the architects Emilio Sala Cortese said. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reconstruction took two years, and was completed in 1906. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The investor, the wealthy industrialists Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a new building, but in the end it agreed to the idea of Gaudís on an unusual and cheaper reconstruction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The Casa Batlló Miet House noted, Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> The main elements of the transformation were all right corner and straight lines removed and replaced by bent and geschwungene walls. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Gaudí worked but with a modern approach to mutual combination of places. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The social part through the opening of the completely Salontüren and a larger society was chatting comfortably without vertraulicheren in talks at a certain level of intimacy. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The right mattress and the proper beds Rost? Women are different than men Wënsch </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Not the tollste bed frame, but the quality of the deck area - mattress and Rost make the good bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> They must, however, ways to accommodate the specific user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In choosing to play a role - many things the weight, size, the state of health and, last but not least, the gender of the Schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Just as important is the Interieur, in the mattress and Rost. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a Wochenendhaus, which is not on a regular basis, it is heated Latexmatratzen not well suited for much longer, as they need to be "warm". </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition, they are much more serious than usual Polyurethan-Matratzen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And, it should be changed regularly. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If they do not have enough Entlüftungskanälchen the core and have to have a strong record, snarled up moisture, so it is not impossible that, under her mold. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the election, also plays a role, of course, what we used to. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Anyone who has been a long time in the country, where very high with mattresses soft class, will be difficult to a low mattress with hard surface can get used to. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "Probably all an ice-hockey, which have come back from the NHL, have complained to me about the fact that they are no longer able to sleep properly." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "For their abgeschundenen shoulders, and hips will give out they need simply a soft layer from Visco-Schaum Foam (memory - a Formgedächtnis-Polymer)." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "This, I recommend including sugar sick people is a disorder of the nervous system, so that they the" information "from the ligaments and skin can receive bad," says Sylva Hadamcziková to cushion furniture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> That is why I have many Eishockeyspielern years ago, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco-Schaum Foam (memory). </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Today, it is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer the manufacturer Tempur, among other things, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And one does not need to be a famous an ice-hockey the benefits of Visco-Schaums learn to appreciate. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" actually works quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The sparkling optimalisiert his toughness and form absorbierten in the heat, in other words, it is downright schmiegt on warm body. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Nowhere is it, passing in the night as it is not around after a major fight. </seg>
<seg id="22"> You simply sleep much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The sparkling viskoelastische also offers protection against Dekubitus (gangrene). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In the choice of Matratzengröße should be to body size, the length of the Fußsohlen still add some 21 to 34 cm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Man as a woman, to the 180 cm big need as a 210 to 220 cm bed. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Each of the Schläfer should at least 90 cm is widely available is 180 inches. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In the case of, for example, Singles Einzelbetten are 120 and 140 cm appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The own comfort and also for any visitors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise, the rule of thumb for the ideal bed broad: "If you are on the back, there is enough room for the easy angewinkelten arms," advises mine Prokopová. Helena, the Zunftmeisterin the Polsterer Raumausstatter and for years the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture, devoted to this issue in schools presents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> In a Doppelbett needs every one of his own and his own mattress, but take care when buying products, so that the mattresses also are high. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise, there is no other option but to the Roste different amounts of assembling and that is not, by a long way, in every bed framework possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with the skeleton 15 cm, it should at least three centimetres on the form of class and the fine buffer. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "With the hand or the Hinsetzen the feathers, we cannot in any way," warns Helen Prokopová feel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Every bed is a specific Rosttyp required. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and in a situation such as increased Siamzwillinge together have no place in the bedroom. </seg>
<seg id="36"> These mattresses will not open and the reference you cannot wash of what is already the practice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And because you are in a single night between 0.2 and 0.75 ltrs sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years ago, becoming a huge (and congested 17). </seg>
<seg id="38"> That is why experts are also advertising slogans in mattresses has a life span of up to 25 years, and even lifetime guarantee. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Every cause has its ifs and buts. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And that is why a practical advice of dealers: Mattresses of 120 and 140 cm breadth of the hygiene waschbaren abziehbaren, not shy, however, it is recommended that a Matratzenschoner, it is easy to use and can wash. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even if today usually Matratzenbezüge with Rundumreißverschluss be produced, so it would be after the opening two halves gets (immensely important for the Waschvorgang and washing machines size!), is the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially alone, often as the unequal fight between David and Goliath. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> They are in bed instead of a Rostes a solid record? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Get out of it. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or a maximum of a bed for unloved guests and for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The record, they should also be better equipped with ventilation holes (if not already in) and mattresses with the skeleton and 15 cm floor with so-called pocket the core and buffer. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethan-Matratzen are in such a situation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For not verstellbare Lattenroste with 14 to 18 pen (Lamellen) are Latex- or Sandwichmatratzen (perhaps also appropriate combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay is Roste with a larger Lattenanzahl, from 28 and more stroke play, with Lordosenstütze in Lendenwirbelbereich, and the possibility of the Lattenhärte to regulate. </seg>
<seg id="48"> At verstellbare Lamellenroste are no mattresses with the skeleton, because they do not respond to the ergonomische pretexts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> In addition to the suspension of stiff the pen will provide specific, flexible Schultermodule required. </seg>
<seg id="50"> This is a specific strengthen the pen, which allows the pen, or even to make einzudrücken verwinkeln that the one-off Einsinken Schläfers of the shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Especially for men with broad shoulders an important matter. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There are even Matratzenhersteller which have started, "Herrenmatratzen" soft zone in the shoulder area. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The ladies also thought - is fighting them these soft Hüftgegend in the zones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For most demanding customers are punktelastische wing pen systems (Lattoflex Roste with points), or mixing with the so-called Multitorsionsfederung Kontakt-Pads burden. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure will be distributed to a number of issues, causing the tension is reduced. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But, if you are on the right mattress and right Rost a bad (and big) Kopfkissen fülliges used the most benefits are lost. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Here, too, a rule of thumb: The Kopfkissen to the head, his top should only up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles to relax. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Ideal is therefore a 50 x 60 cm big cushions, for example, the Scandinavians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In the pages of this situation should Kopfkissen (along with the shoulder discharge area in Rost or the soft zone in the bed) the shoulder level. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Some have mattresses have our modern with the old (with hay full) Strohsäcken but common. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Increasingly modern manufacturers use natural materials, or at least their mixtures. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Also in mattresses means the new magic word "organic." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of raw oil is used to manufacture Polyurethanschäumen frequency of natural oils figures - for example, Rizinus- and soya oil. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soya is used by all the well-known manufacturers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> "Organic mattresses, in other words, the core of it is purely natural materials," says Petr Vašíček Tropico Plus by the company. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Natural substances, but they are also used in the manufacture of Matratzenbezügen - one of the first was Aloe Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> But you can also indulge in the capsules micro-supervisory sleeping in fresh woodland or Lavendelduft spread. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Here, too, there is a difference between a man and a woman. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While the men a "kühlender" Pflanzenextrakt from Birkenblättern Matratzenbezug is used in order to absorb the heat and cool the body can have the salary for women "wärmende" effect. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Extracts from red Paprikaschoten stimulate blood circulation to the weaker sex with the sleeping wohlig so warm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> And today's favorite? </seg>
<seg id="72"> Foam mattresses from cold (he has greater Poren with devastated Zellstruktur and, therefore, is breathing more active than usual Polyurethan trade, and a much more flexible). </seg>
<seg id="73"> The combination of various stiff (severity) by Kaltschäumen and Visco-Schäumen Mehr-Zonen-Matratzen arise who know exactly where head, hip and closely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> For a high-end mattress, though, has 7,000 SKR and more to fork out. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Gesundheitsmatratzen, but usually with a lower value added tax, but as a medical device. </seg>
<seg id="76"> The first Czech companies were Gumotex this advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> You see, in the bed and the Rost to save is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Now and again there is a special offer of manufacturers and dealers, the two mattresses for the price of one. </seg>
<seg id="79"> It offers the brand Magniflex the mattress Duofreeze with the memory for 11.990 verstepptem Visco-Schaum CZK. </seg>
<seg id="80"> The second will be free to do so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the evidence that the era of the Tempur viskoelastischen sparkling materials with open Zellstruktur and high density in almost kosmischem pace was launched. </seg>
<seg id="82"> No wonder they were but for NASA because the astronauts are taking off in the enormous excess strain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83"> Tempur will heat soft, cool environment cemented it in turn. </seg>
<seg id="84"> So it fits perfectly in the human body and distributed in an optimal way the physical pressure. </seg>
<seg id="85"> It is therefore not only ideal to prevent pressure fire, but generally the sleep increased comfort. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86"> Viskoelastische sparkling substances will not only with mattresses, but also for other health products, such as used in specific Fußpolstern, the legs and the Gefäßen to provide relief. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Use local manufacturers, for example, the sparkling substances Eucatherm C Twinsaver or similar products. </seg>

<seg id="3"> In the year before, the Ministry of Defence already 224 miles powder to the army camp. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is reassuring to know that the armed forces for ausgesorgt 225 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The only problem is the shelf-life of Zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The army bought the Zündschnüre of the Company, including STV Group. For a mere 40 million kronor. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In its justification for the purchase of the huge quantity of powder DNES MF the General Staff said that the soldiers would be 60 kilometres a year to use the powder. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="8"> According to the research by Armeepyrotechnikern, MF DNES point raised by this data shows that the whole army every year a very intensive pyrotechnische training course - of all of the generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaners. </seg>

<seg id="13"> But if the old rule of experts is that the training of any new professional soldiers two metres powder is quite sufficient, then the army by this Neueinkäufe - in the light of the increased needs of the pioneering special units - a reassuring supply for the above-mentioned 225 years. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantities of rebate for the 445 kilometres of powder. </seg>

<seg id="15"> Obviously against a fat compensation. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It would also be a sufficient explanation for why he his detention in such a large amount of money to be had. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Men, whose finger is long, as the ring fingers are obviously a lower risk of developing prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This is a surprising result of a study on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer, was published. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This is, in fact, with the levels of the male hormone testosterone. </seg>

<seg id="5"> "Our results show that the relative length of the fingers as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and that it can serve in men up to 60," said co-author of the study, the Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick. </seg>

<seg id="20"> What is crucial is not only good taste but also the seidige fluidity and good consistency. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Luciano forgets in its training but not the icing on the cake of the national and even südländischen excessive building: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and that is still a lot of romanticism in that." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first step in the production seems quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Luciano dump the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a major Mixgerät with an electronic programme everything to 85 degrees heated and then cools to four degrees. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Then he turns off the engine, and out comes a pasteurised white base cream, Milcheissorten basis for all. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="27"> Luciano warns that in the spirit of the time. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Those of ice cream "natural ingredients only" talk, perhaps still stabilisers is used, often a product of nature, for example, from the Guarbohne Guarkernmehl. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Of course you can hold even without a binding agent, only it must then be sold within a day, otherwise sackt it in, and the customer will bite on Eiskörnchen louder. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="38"> Now the course participants in the Eismaschinen. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano, they each of four different types of Vanille-, Schokolade- Mokka- Haselnuss-Eis, and produce - with or without eggs in the mass, with more or less Vanillearoma or other natural supplements. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The same experiment will also undergo Fruchteissorten. </seg>
<seg id="41"> More flavourings, more Frucht-Püree taste - is not necessarily better. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Haselnuss-Eis tastes not necessarily nut, if it contains the hazelnuts. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The most popular Kiwi-Eis, the working group, the more fruit used, less water and a little less stabiliser. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Only a balanced mix will highlight the taste of a gelato clear, says Luciano. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: Will Pfirsich-Püree used with a lot of sugar, the sugars in the basic recipe be reduced. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For Zitroneneis is an extra dose of sugar needed. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano prefers a piece of equipment, with the sugar content of the fruit varieties (vine-growers measure determined the Oechsle in the grape must). </seg>
<seg id="48"> Fortunately tables which facilitate the benefits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Ice to no longer require so much physical use as in the past. </seg>

<seg id="4"> To what audience may the Danish director Nicolas Refn winding than he could have imagined, "Rising Walhalla, revolved around"? </seg>
<seg id="5"> A captured Wikinger-Krieger with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) exempt themselves from his Peinigern and places with almost superhuman forces rushed to his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, it is because our hero like rough killing methods and his enemies to Gedärme from the vibrant physical, if he has a bad mood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On the other hand, says Einauge, as he is called, indeed, the whole film about a word, and the other characters are on, at most, one or two sentences or shout a few painful death. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The country, however, refuses to comment on that - nor is it controls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At about midnight on 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 Ι fighter-planes a mysteriöses, würfelförmiges building in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is on the banks of the Euphrates, the next major city, 30 miles away, is Dair as-Saur. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Her name appears in documents to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, which Syria allegedly with help from North Korea in the Quader built hidden in a valley of the electricity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing of the US-Auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA at the end of April 2008 would be the under the name of the nearest town el-Kibar normal reactor have been well placed to produce plutonium, which can build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes, however, the technology is hardly in the fifties. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA ran a video presentation with fuzzy satellite images. </seg>
<seg id="10"> They ignored by Computeranimation, where the components of the reactor before the destruction, of a verkleinerte copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyong nuclear centre. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Moreover, it presented photographs of the buildings in the vicinity, or even the indoor show. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor was shortly before the beginning of the operation, it said, but not yet with Brennstäben peppers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more than it was then, of course, the mystery with the time were more likely to be greater. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Former President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack is fairly sure that Syria had built a reactor in el-Kibar, but little evidence that it is in the country, "an active nuclear weapons programme. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some intelligence officers in Europe are even more cautious and prefer to speak only of an "alleged reactor," even if the CIA-Präsentation for "plausible". </seg>
<seg id="16"> They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Asked how certain he was a reactor, said to have a high UN-Diplomat only flat in the summer, the IAEA "has enough material to ask questions". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The rubble of the alleged "unused military building" the Syrians eager to one side and planierten the site thoroughly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, it took place in June 2008, a IAEA-Team under former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Moreover, the IAEA on a Member State commercial providers of satellite images from the period directly after the attack, which is likely to be more powerful than the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The recordings, however, are not on the market, because of the unknown mandator - perhaps Israel - they bought the exclusive. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The IAEA can therefore not independently verify its authenticity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always claimed that never run a secret nuclear programme or to have built a nuclear reactor. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium has come from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But it pointed out the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Damascus since then refuses to discuss the issue - as well as on the satellite images. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In addition, the inspectors were denied a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the rubble of bombed-out building. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But Israel is sticking. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We will not comment on", confirmed recently the time of the attack on the office of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> So the investigation of the case has been dragging on since June 2008 in vain and "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the agency," as a senior Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna for - there is, after all, a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the IAEA. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As key to making progress in the investigation, the IAEA apparently three more bodies, the "functional link" with the alleged reactor will be different than this - and still exist. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In doing so, the inspectors have not disclosed what facilities they are, or what they are or what they appear to be suspicious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they will have to the IAEA and internally Marj as-Sultan Masyaf Iskandariayah, and that, in turn, are derived from nearby towns. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS advises) has identified these locations and a complex satellite images identified in Masyaf where it is most likely to be one of the suspicious objects. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It is probably in or adjacent to a military base, this is precisely what grounds Syria denied the IAEA access to the three locations. </seg>
<seg id="36"> It is in Vienna that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will vorgeschickt by the United States military installations auszuspähen. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Because the nuclear detectives were the result of a tip of the US intelligence services to discover the bodies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos that, between the three locations and the Quader the Euphrates material was moved back and forth. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A senior Western diplomat in Vienna, said that at least one of the facilities could "in connection with the fuel production". </seg>
<seg id="40"> "But there is no evidence of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or reprocessing and processes which are required to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Is the type of reactor with enriched uranium, which is not. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But where the uranium could have come from, and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated, these central issues there are only plausible assumptions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> It is also unclear whether the valuable pieces of debris, could carry traces of the three places were stored. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As if the hundreds of truck loads of the disappeared, no one wants to have information on where the debris. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Only a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, salt mine al-Tibni, the Syria 1998 to their suitability as a camp for radioactive waste has investigated, the IAEA as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Robert Kelley, a former IAEA-Inspektor it was, in a recent analysis of satellite images on the venerable magazine Jane's Intelligence Review in contact with the reactor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Footage from the orbiting but show that Syria in the three suspect sites Erdarbeiten and large container distant, after the IAEA access had requested. </seg>
<seg id="48"> This can hardly be a coincidence, but it has helped to dispel the suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Furthermore, it is said in diplomatic circles, have spent many months, the IAEA, in a plan for inspections to develop, it should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - of the effort shows how much interest the inspectors. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte this one too. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Still, Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago, to appease the reactor was destroyed, therefore, have no great urgency of the matter is, for example, US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a couple of months' special inspections of the game, one of the harshest means Vienna nuclear authority to control. </seg>
<seg id="52"> IAEA-Chef Yukiya Amano, these inspections should propose, has been of "an option, for which I am open in the future, however, is reluctant to talk about it. </seg>
<seg id="53"> It is a high risk in this way: On the one hand, it needs to ensure a majority of the board of governors of the IAEA, and several of the 35 countries represented there are anything other than eager for an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other hand, as a diplomat to bear in mind: "What if they find nothing at all, in the end?" </seg>

<seg id="9"> Diplomatically, it is not, she has taken the women to a few weeks ago at a meeting in Hungary, which rejected the offer, though. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The movement for democracy in Latin America will be stronger, as the support of private companies. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil larger than that of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="5"> These results came the Latinobarómetro-Umfrage in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This survey will be carried out on a regular basis since 1995 and it shows that the change of opinion in this region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two facts are in this year's poll in September and October, particularly in 's eye. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First, the good mood in Latin America </seg>
<seg id="9"> And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In many Latin American countries on the Pacific coast, has greatly increased in the democratic movement (s table 1). </seg>
<seg id="11"> In Peru, for example, where the economy since 2002 to around 6% a year, the number of advocates of democracy from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In Mexico, where the economy has been the sharp fall in the last year, the recovery is such a trend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries of the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (s diagram 2). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some 44% of the respondents stated that they will be satisfied with their country's democratic practice, which is as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3). </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some 34 percent trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values are those of last year, however, show a marked increase over 2003 (17% and 24%). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> A decade ago, Latin American economic crisis undermined the efforts for more democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Also during the global economic crisis continued, perhaps, is the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a brief recession and a speedy recovery. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Furthermore, the poor by a stronger social network. </seg>
<seg id="19"> (According to reports from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week, 2009, the poverty rate in Latin America, only slightly and is again this year by 32%.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But from country to country, there is a strong mood differences (s graph 4). </seg>
<seg id="21"> Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread step forward thinking. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was much more tangible and violent crimes have increased, it is less the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> For only the second time since the start of the survey, see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country is a bigger problem than in the diagram s unemployment (5). </seg>
<seg id="24"> Some 31% say that either they or a family member in the last year have been victims of a crime, but compared to 38% in the last year, are the values have fallen, reaching the lowest level since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The rising economic performance is reflected in the increase in support of the family and the market economy: Around 71% of respondents on regional said that the private sector is essential for development in 2007, there were 56% (s graph 6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> Some 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress their country, compared with 47% in the last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly, 62% of those polled in Venezuela this view maintained (and 80% are in favour of a private sector), though their leftist President, Hugo Chávez, many private enterprises nationalised. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil has under 19% of the respondents (18% in the last year) the biggest force in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared with 11% in the past year). </seg>
<seg id="29"> The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, with a role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela. </seg>

<seg id="6"> This allowed the presidential couple, the extra income to spend as they see fit. </seg>

<seg id="14"> The official inflation rate, at 11.1% z.Z., but many private estimates - and wage demands of the unions, pushing the value to nearly 30%. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not known whether Mr Fernández after the end of their term even without the support of her husband will be politically active. </seg>

<seg id="29"> If the Argentinians in March from their summer holidays, is to return to the wave of Sympatie it was, fizzled. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The discovery of an alien variety of bacteria, among other things, of arsenic can opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Although scientists this unusual bacterium here on earth, in their view, it is a sign that a life without the previously deemed vital elements is possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "This body has two ways. ' </seg>
<seg id="5"> "He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "That makes it a very particular reason, even though there are almost a sort of 'alien' way of life is," said C.W. Paul Davies of Arizona State University and Co-Autor of the report on Thursday, in the Online-Ausgabe the journal Science. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> So far, there have been six main elements as vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> But the scientists figured out how to grow the bacterium in the Californian mono Lake even further, if it has replaced by arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "One wonders what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar Co-Autor of the report by the Arizona State University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is an important step in the search for life, as scientists außerirdischem life and his forms need to be able to see, in Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study, which deals with microbes on Earth have been found. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report by the discovery Außerirdischen life. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "shows that in other planet systems organisms, with the help of other elements biochemical processes can set in motion, and that the 'standard' elements that, in our opinion, is absolutely vital, not necessarily see are imposed," said Mr Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute held University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockel was not part of the research team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "This work is a first, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures an element can be replaced by another," added Cockell. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The discovery was not accidental. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Felisa Wolfe-Simon Astrobiologischen Institute by NASA, which led the study, chose the mono Lake because of the high levels of arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> As arsenic and phosphorus chemically same, that microbes that both are exposed, may be a factor in the other place. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "The toxicity of Arsens is based primarily on the fact that there is a similar situation such as phosphorus chemically". </seg>
<seg id="21"> "It is thus, an element of the organisms is difficult to distinguish from the other." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "But the difference is so large that arsenic different acts as phosphorus, enter our biochemisches system, where it covered almost everything," says Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 a rising arsenic concentration, it suited to and grew. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The microbe is growing in phosphorus better, but also that they can survive in arsenic, shows that a Arsen-basierte life form can happen, of course, either on the ground or on another planet or moon, on the arsenic more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> According to Jamie S. Foster, Dozentin for microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new, but so far there has been no functioning example. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Arsenic was more common in the early Erdjahren, she says, it is for this reason that the science on the assumption that early life forms of it have been used. </seg>

<seg id="6"> For MGM Chapter 11, in fact, comes into force when JPMorgan Chase a proposed loan of $500 million to fund the new MGM-Produktionen has been completed. </seg>
<seg id="7"> At the moment, is leading a consortium of the investment bank, the $75 million, the company, which is funding up to the middle of December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The restructuring of the studios began in May 2009, with the mandate to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management of companies with interest payments of $300 million per year, in the solution to their financial problems. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In August, the CEO Harry Sloan replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, through his work with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts became known. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The efforts of Moelis & Cooper, the financial worries MGMs and more than 140 Gläuber auszubezahlen the studios, went on longer than expected. </seg>
<seg id="11"> After months of discussions, the parties at the end of 2009, to offer to buy the company. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But the auction drew only a few bidders and no one wanted to the creditors of the $2 billion required to pay. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In the spring of this year, and all started from the MGM-Team began with the restructuring plan, after months of debate and infighting at the end of October, the creditors have been signed. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="4"> But you can protect your gifts budget. </seg>
<seg id="5"> I recently visited in search of three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, and BJ's wholesale club. </seg>
<seg id="6"> I was immediately clear that Moore's law came into force this year, was the technology toys are more efficient and cost slightly less than the same time last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> And while fewer new toys with their own website, will take place in the best known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, a wider offer. </seg>
<seg id="8"> There are always more Knopfzellen-betriebene toys on the market, and many of them contain wiederaufladbare batteries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Here are some recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="10"> (Unless otherwise stated, all prices of Toys "R" Us). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for children from the age of 3 years) are Plüschfiguren, as big as guinea pig to sing a note, if you are on their belly. </seg>

<seg id="22"> None of the versions is compatible with old cassettes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> IXL from Fisher-Price ($90 for children 3 to 7) for the Games and eBooks used a system similar to iTunes and, thanks to the SD-Kartenlaufwerks can also be said to be family photo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Last but not least, there are still Scrabble Flash ($30 by Hasbro, for children from the age of 8). Five blocks are no bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED-Bildschirm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In the game, it is a question of the blocks to words together, before the time. It is a great thing for an improvised Buchstabierwettbewerb. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The decision brought to an end the worst legislative success against Senator Ensign, Republican of Nevada, and up to the scandal, the nationwide headlines and was a drubbing of his career, he was seen as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="5"> The ethics committee of the Senate, could, however, still a Disziplarstrafe impose. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Ensigns lawyers say that they have been informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign have been cancelled and that in this matter, no further charges. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Ministry of Justice did not comment on the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The judgment was for many Ethik-Anwälte outside the Ministry of Justice as a surprise; they think there is sufficient evidence that the Lobbying-Verbot Ensign has ignored. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Interviews, emails and other documents, for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times have been revealed, has led to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of the election workers, helped to lucrative contracts for his silence on a dossier with Hamptons wife Cynthia to buy. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Cynthia Hampton was during an election campaign Ensigns as treasurer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Ensign, contact some political friends to Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogations took for them to lobby the Hamptons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Since Hampton recently in Ensigns election team was, it was a year, he was not lobbying for his former employers or accept the whole Senate. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> While the Justice Department formally rejected it, the reasons for the decision to announce the Ensign-Fall, said Mr. fire and other ethics lawyers, the department seems to be very cautious in rather political charges after a multitude of failures by the media followed with a great deal of interest, including the decision last year, the case against the former Senator Ted Stevens because of misconduct on the part of the public prosecutor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Prosecutors "are obviously scared detention," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the association, "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organisation, which aims to combat corruption in parliament and government circles in the United States), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr. Ensign brought before the courts. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "This means that, in general, high-profile government officials now assume that the law does not apply to them," she added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Paul Coggins, the main defenders of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had a telephone call on Monday, a prosecutor, and another the next day, where he was told that the department does not levy charges against his clients. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Mr. Ensigns defender had cooperated with prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator as his office, in a statement on Wednesday, again repeated, "in accordance with the law". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr. Coggins refused, the legal arguments which he had presented to prosecutors, to explain. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "I think it is not in the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice, and I just want to go, and, we believe, to have made the right decision," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided that the investigation of a separate appeal by the group, after the payment of $96,000 of Mr. Ensigns parents to the Hamptons against the federal election law. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that anything other than the money was a gift. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which for a long time, the Senator was one of the firms, in which Mr. Hampton, thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign Lobbyisten-Arbeit took place. </seg>
<seg id="25"> An e-mail from December 2008 shows that, since the company has helped Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a conversation with Mr. Hampton had him, in which he said that he, the Interior Ministry because of a cause "anklopfe." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and other customers for Nevada, and Allegiant Air, agreed to lunch and asked the transport minister, in a meeting in the name of the airline, to reconcile after Mr. Hampton for lobbying had stopped. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Last year, for the first time, information about this case, Medellín apologize to the public, Mr. Ensign was in his constituents and his position in the Senate, where he is in the ranking of Republicans in fourth place. </seg>
<seg id="28"> After many months, he no longer was struck two weeks ago, Mr. Ensign told reporters that he has a third term in the Senate, would like to see. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="4"> In the end, such as the defence, there were more than 140,000 Twitter-Meldungen on the process in order to rape and beds gekettete children in a house, the flare-up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Thursday, the closely followed process of Steven J. Hayes, was accused of three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, to have killed an official end to the ruling on the death sentence, the panel has said. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted applications to court to explain the grounds for appeal and the courts in years to come. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Most provocative one of the reasons is that the intense coverage of the process, but also by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - to a "circus" atmosphere and such a widespread, instant penetration rebel details come, so that the jury was improperly influenced by public outrage. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This protest might encourage Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question of whether the new technologies necessary new rules in the court room. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "As I have seen during this process, I think that it really is a danger, when the arrival of new technologies in the courtroom every individual" s right to a fair trial, "said Thomas J. influenced Ullman, Mr. Hayes main defenders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue House, rejected by the Supreme Court last week, applications by referendum, succinct and when he said that the new media would be "carefully monitored", and that there is no proof that the jury had been driven by passions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But this was certainly not the last word on this matter. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For decades, about a court found that the reporting on notorious cases doubt on the fairness of the process. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In his historic decision by 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, is to have his wife killed, and said in his ruling that it was because of the new media "Karnevalsatmosphäre in the courtroom". </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some believed that the television and the movie "On the flight" based on this crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some lawyers say, court judgments, what Mr. Hayes veroordeling half a century later, the argument might be that new rules are necessary, and with the channels of communication from the courtroom at the time of the case, Dr Sheppard were unimaginable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "There is a good reason, about the impact of the new media in trials, which will be followed by a general public to be concerned about," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut, according to his report, will they arbitrarily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor Donohue said some Appelationsgerichte could be intrigued by the idea that restricting a prompt communication from the courtroom, could make the process fair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Twitter-Angelegenheit is just one of the many lawyers of Mr. Hayes, in order to discuss for years to come, and a condemnation of war. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defenders argue, for example, that Mr. Hayes might have been already explanation, judge Blue not to allow them, the reactions of potential judges to test them by while the Jurorenauswahl grey cent scene photos showed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some of the judges said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years, they would have been met with revulsion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defenders say they are also the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution into question, and argue that the judge wrongly a jury have exchanged views, a critic of the department, and that he was improperly exerted pressure on the ruling, as he had the unusual decision was made by the panel to free over the weekend. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The judges were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But their arguments about the impact of the extensive coverage of the process is perhaps the greatest interest. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In a judgment, the challenge that they have tabled last month, made it clear that the case has dominated the news in Connecticut, and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American Senate candidate was discussed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They argued that the new media constantly the flames of the emotions on the case would be reopened. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "Such a daily crush of Medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "has previously in New Haven and maybe even nationwide," not yet seen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Their focus to the reporting by Twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that the direct messages are rabble-rousing but more slowly than reports which are reimbursed, a technology hostile view is that the report on future processes verarme. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> But some lawyers said, were often Appelationsgerichte with the argument, social and technological changes need the Adaptation through the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr. Hayers lawyers step up this assertion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In her appeal, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, in which the conviction of Dr Sheppard because of the reporting has been lifted and made it clear that the new media, new rules require. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> After a campaign to Schimpfwörtern and negativity is little courtesy this week in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It is the sign of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion, before it was quickly back to the struggle of the parties in the capital, returning? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The meeting on Tuesday between President Barack Obama and leaders of Congress produced no breakthrough on the big issues to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck" session of the sitting at the end of a period of government in which no decisions had to be made to look. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After all, that is what we hear, it was either a polite discussion between two sides still a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan collection points. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meeting of the deficit commission of the president on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences between the members to continue. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months can give a kind of mutual respect, the ideological divide that still divides members of concealing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It is not enough to say that it was a new era of cooperation arrived. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Both sides are now in a test phase, in one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise, while you tried to the limits of public opinion and the patience of the electorate, according to a new parties warfare. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This was the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants on a minimum requirements or accusations limited. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep, and that there is a rapid change of atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, might expect. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or pension is, the two sides are miles apart. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Lastly, the November election Washington, at least for a short period of time, to say the least. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official of the Bush administration, which is now in the "Ethics and Public Policy Center," is working. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "It is inevitable after elections. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elections give partisan passions, to die. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And that is a good thing. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> On some issues, particularly on those who will be on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. " </seg>
<seg id="19"> Bush's tax cuts, at the end of the year, and no one in favour of it. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way to get some or all of it, either temporarily or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that, it believes, the favoured tax cuts for the rich, support unemployed workers while they refuse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House is of the optimism has grown that these issues during the "lame duck" session and, at the same time, some of the New START Treaty, cannot ratify. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But William Glaston of Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation on pressing issues of the lame duck session "to a lasting cooperation of the parties must, if the new 112. Congress will convene in January. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead, he says, is a period of not more than once immensely more likely, perhaps even necessary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "After the things that are done that need to be done in the short term, it will shift the psychology in confrontation," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many, the courtesy to real cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "I see a lot of what is happening from here until 2012, as Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event in 2012," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons have a great deal to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House, and to do it with the Teeparty-Wählern, which have been instrumental in their education. </seg>
<seg id="29"> How worried the Republican leaders also may be that they have too high pokern, they know that they must try to their promise to cut government spending and the healthcare reform, to be adhered to. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> This party lines are already in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which is a tax reform and raising some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and reduce government spending. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles are one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, according to their own assessment, insisted that the deficit issue on the public agenda that they could no longer be ignored. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes with its plan to official recommendation and they are very much, too, just in the proximity of this figure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The biggest resistance is the elected representatives of the body, as in financial issues, today at least, little room for compromise or little sympathy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Galston says two stages of the battle between the White House and Republicans in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The first campaign will next year in the form of party clashes take place, if the Republicans Obama in terms of the budget of the state, the taxes and the health system, challenging then followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> Public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It has been proved that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If confrontation at an impasse, as it happened in 1995, then both sides must look carefully at the public reaction. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Whoever the losers being condemned will change tack and seek compromises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> This may, in fact, a more optimistic view. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Partisanship and polarization are now greater than it is in the middle of the 1990's, and they seem a more ideological gap between Obama and the Kongress-Republikanern at the time to be between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At the same time, the defenders of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a much broader consequences in the 2012 election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Such courtesy may have seen the greatest display of this week, will be welcomed by many Americans. </seg>
<seg id="45"> On both sides, but it will be a great deal more effort, a common denominator in the issues that the two still separated. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The deal has been in a joint statement after a meeting of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in additional articles of the security summit. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The US government had for years sought to convince Russia knows more highly enriched uranium, not to collect and last spring seemed to have reached a hurdle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But officials of the US government told the Washington Post that, in the last two months, two secret agreements with Belarus has been made to 187 pounds of weapon-grade uranium from a Belarus research center. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The setting the stage for the agreement on Wednesday, the rest of the material to be removed, according to an official staff, because of the sensitivity of the matter, the anonymous, about £500. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The agreement seems to be one of the main findings of Obama's "nuclear security summit of 47 nations" from April, the Belarus had ruled out. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And it was, of course, good enough for the invitation of the former Soviet republic of the next summit in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I was really excited by the fact that they have a seat on the nuclear security summit (from 2012)." </seg>
<seg id="10"> "It shows me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group promoting nuclear security. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Clinton called the agreement "a very important, very important step" of Belarus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Obama promised, in Prague in April 2009, within the space of four years to secure all vulnerable nuclear material. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since then, the US government helped her six countries to get rid of highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Belarus will be the seventh. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, the white Russian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never abandon their uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "How to maintain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is capable of radically weapons, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "This is our commodity... We will not derive any dirty bomb and we will sell it to anyone". </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We will use it solely for research purposes, and that is it." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Belarus approached yet just a few months ago, the United States, as it is interested in meeting anzeigte of an agreement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The first port of call, the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material is easily contaminated by radiation was, say officials. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It was loaded into a Spezialzug, of the more than 1,300 miles of a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, officials say. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The second attempt was decided on Monday and has been carried out by plane, according to the officials. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The US government will pay for this effort $14 million, with much of the money in the Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "This was a carefully coordinated to build confidence," to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton led, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, this is due to the global threat reduction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende studies estimates that Belarus this year, at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium, and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Belarus under the joint agreement will be in stores by the end of 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, first and foremost because of Lukashenko's harsh abuse of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But the statement on Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> "The progress this global security issues, welcome heißend the United States of America and Belarus known that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus is a central theme in the improvement in bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," it said. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The owners of the old home in Olot does not preclude their carers of elderly people killed eleven </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The leaders of the old nursing home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) yesterday a press conference, in which she revealed the damage the criminal acts - Joan Vila Dilmés of nurses, during his work at least eleven old people, for which he was responsible, was killed - the establishment had caused. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The director of the elderly home, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, in court, Joan Cañada on and announced, "La Caritat would like the responsible (for the deaths accuse)," but the "right and our liability force us the process and civil liability". </seg>
<seg id="5"> The establishment is not only a society to lose, because they see the criminal acts of the Pflegers not found in time, but there is now also a high amount of compensation to be paid by the legal representatives of the families of the victims will be calculated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime in August 2009 and that further since then, he has been murdered. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - the former patients of the old nursing homes - because it was suspected that no doctor personally have investigated the dead, but the formalities because of their age and diseases have been handled by phone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The head of La Caritat prominent this point, and has stated flatly that "lack of action any time the cause of the incidents may have been". </seg>
<seg id="9"> The lawyer of La Caritat added that "there was no evidence in the legal dispute for negligent acts a person other than the accused." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The "Angel of Death" getaufte 11 murders confessed to the other day and said that the first crime committed on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later, the second old lady. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this case he killed with an overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first crime in which he was a mixture of various sedatives. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The head of La Caritat said the access of staff to the drugs is difficult to control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The insulin injections and cocktail of sedatives, the nurses in six of the nine crimes committed in patients with the death of her suffering. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But the results of the lab tests are to be seen whether Vila is lying and his first victims actually have a less gruesome death, or whether it is this from the inside, by offering them Bleichlauge ausbrannte verabreichte according to the confession, as he had done in three women, between 12 and 17 October. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> In La Caritat listens to the testimony of the Pflegers no faith, not even say what the number of murders, which could be much more. This attitude is justified that Vila very different statements made in court, and that it would make no sense, his approach after eight successful murders suddenly change. </seg>
<seg id="16"> They say that they did it for that reason, and in order to raise awareness of the impact of the events of the judiciary. </seg>

<seg id="8"> The Federal Bank has called on the outcome of the plan to buy government debt, since these were ineffective, as well as the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures, and it should only be a einwöchiger permanent access to be maintained. </seg>
<seg id="9"> After the crisis in Ireland, we expect the current liquidity measures, "at least until March," extended and the quarterly contracts with unlimited access to the quarter end to ensure the liquidity will remain at least until June. </seg>
<seg id="10"> We also expect that the programme to purchase bonds continued to signal and a means to spend. </seg>

<seg id="12"> Just as with the EZB-Sitzung in May, the bank confirmed that the purchase of government debt securities not to take into account and then collapsed, the markets could be a repeat of that story tomorrow. </seg>

<seg id="20"> Although Ireland has lost all its credibility after the problem with the stress tests, in July, had not seen the figures are acceptable as part of the rescue plan and help to reduce uncertainty. </seg>

<seg id="30"> We would get liquidity that we do not need. The treasury has 40 billion euros, three times as much as in March. The rates are very expensive, and access to markets would be closed without notice. </seg>

<seg id="18"> At that time, it has been strongly criticised. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion is totally opposed to a bailout of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally, Merkel last October in the days after, with a clear position, and it is calling for a reform of the agreement, the European Union, in order to allow for the bailout of a country, and at the same time, the private lenders to make part of the cost. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position was interpreted as anti-European because the Ireland crisis and following through on. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But her proposal, although slightly sweetened, has been approved in the next few months we will be in the reform of the European Union, which is to allow these measures from 2013. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has drawn a red line not to cross, which it does. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It says all that - even if now unpopular measures must be taken, it is as of this date, the old workings of the euro, will no longer be available. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In 2013, the birth year of a new currency area, where zuwiderhandelnden countries be severely punished, it can be forced to declare themselves bankrupt and, in this case, the private sector must take a share of the costs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows us that we have a strong growth path, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive foreign trade balance. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The other option, which is in debt and construction of huge holes in the balance of payments is based, just as they led Spain in times of boom, will simply not be tolerated. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we do that, it would be wrong not to understand. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not simply a matter of the public deficit by 2013 runterzufahren to 3%. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much tougher. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the worst thing we could do in these conditions, is to give us. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the present turbulence into more rest. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And that we have the opportunities that we need to be by early 2013. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that, Zapatero has taken this so well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis that our own house in order to establish their way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But Germany was red line is there, and it is not so, that this would change. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Among the possibilities is contemplating that we fully gestopften with little serious countries would have to leave the euro area, should not be ruled out. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Sport and rule bypassing </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tricks such as Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will, a sanction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The supposedly of two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) has instigated exclusion in the game on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League that caused much ink has been spilled about whether it is a unsportliche action or not acted and whether both players should be punished by UEFA. </seg>
<seg id="4"> As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before the end of the game (her team had clearly won) and played several Fouls time, so that the referee showed them the second yellow card. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way, and, because the Real Madrid, his group would be the two players the statutory penalty for the next league match against Auxerre and without tickets to enter the next phase of the game. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Finally, punished the Disziplinarkommitee of UEFA, the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players with different sums of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow card in this or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this game - following rules. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of the debate about the images that have arisen case to the fact that a team of football clubs (Real Madrid and honour his anthem Edelmut and on other occasions, his players for similar incidents had punished play a major role in the process), and the drama by Mourinho, an episode more to its long history as a technician and provocative theatralischer has added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case, the debate is about whether this is not explicitly by the statutes of banned behaviour contradicts the principles of sport, this means a rule, if these actions bypassing. In fact, is this approach to the statutes of the sport, but it seems to make sense. </seg>
<seg id="11"> On this issue, should the damage caused to the sporting spirit be investigated. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sporting spirit defended the physical safety of the players, an aspect that has been put at risk by these actions not, because it was not an aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that, the zuwiderhandelnden players an unjustified benefit from the draw against a team that has not been done, too. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradox of the action of the players of the Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally under wrong game or rule bypassing understand, because the circumvention of the rule was not made in secret to avoid a sanction, but it should be as noticeable as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players waited and the sanctions to go. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is what kind of advantage of the offender from the deliberate Fouls. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Here it should be emphasised that the rival either in a worse situation still has advantages for the feigned erheischt game, because the obvious result of this was that your own team with fewer players weiterspielen had to. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not, on these players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The benefit is obvious, is that the players of the next phase of the Champions League game without a ticket that makes their participation in a future game could begin to threaten. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a long-term, up to a certain extent, uncertain advantage, because at some point, leaving the team could get to the players, and with this approach, a sanction and go in the second round on the cards for cards with a card accumulation less than in the first round of departures. </seg>
<seg id="21"> So it is not clear whether it is a real advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> In the end, such practices are not against the sporting spirit, including strategic decisions, in order to escape from the rules a maximum benefit. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case, did not sanction the players handle (that would be a clear case of rule to bypass), they wanted to vote, when they will be. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They met a strategic decision, without a penalty or avoid it. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Although the border between inventiveness and regulatory environment blurred, I believe, is that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: Because two even exclusions, and because of the type of provoking Regelübertragung. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The damage done to the principles of the sport was caused by these actions, it is less of an ethical as aesthetic. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> Everything with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated maze, in the bottom of the facts just difficult. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Yesterday Interpol had a "red alert" to "discover and persecution" of Assange. </seg>
<seg id="6"> It is, however, not to be a traditional order to arrest. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In addition, it is not new, it comes from the 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It also has nothing to do with the recent revelation of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but also to do with the accusations of sexual abuse, which the Australians are in Sweden. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The lawyer also assured the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they have been in contact with Mr Assange." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Already on 20, the international police agency based in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden the order, but it was up to yesterday after receiving authorisation by the Swedish authorities have not been announced. </seg>
<seg id="11"> As things are, the 188 Interpol countries are instructed, Assange to identify and locate, "to arrest and extradite him for the time being." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Although Interpol the arrest of a red warning affected individual cannot issue orders, many member countries, according to the organisation the red warning as a licence for a Arrestierung - the national police force must be carried out, particularly when they are on a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange presumably. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The move outraged Assanges lawyers gesten, published a letter in which they were informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is prepared by video conference to answer questions from the Swedish authorities. </seg>

<seg id="23"> The Congressman Peter King of January chaired the National Security COM Mitee of the House of Representatives, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "in order to put their money to seize and everyone they supported or contributes to follow." </seg>

<seg id="7"> Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010 "in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén has had a setback, because the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of the game was tied, but at the time he came forward and got to 3-1 two ways to take the title, but ultimately misguided three of his players the 11 steps and opposing the game into a 4-3. </seg>

<seg id="8"> The supplementary budget from 2010, this morning looked at by the finance committee of the National Assembly, contains the measures, the first part of that money. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The dossier, WikiLeaks has a twofold significance. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On one hand, it is turning itself as the obvious scandal, a scandal, just a scandal in the Sinner hypocrisy is the Beziehunge between the countries, the public and the press. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand, it has announced major changes at international level, and is a taste of the future, which is dominated by regression. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But we are going after the series. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that all of a secret service has produced acts (of any nation) exclusively from newspaper cuttings. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi's throw nothing more than what you have months anyway, in every other Journal to read (apart from those whose owners Berlusconi is), and the appalling karikaturierte Kabarettkünstlern Gaddafi's profile has been offered fuel for their Sketche a long time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The principle of the secret dossier only are already well-known news, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go into a library, esotherischen publications, you will see that every station (on the grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau Templer, or the Rosenkreuzler) accurately repeating what has already been written in previous works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is not, therefore, that the author occult texts to publish any research (yet, therefore, that he did not know where to find news about the Nicht-Existierende would be), but because those who devote themselves to the Okkultismus nothing different than they already know and what they have learned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the success of mechanism of Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> As well as the secret files. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informant is lazy, and lazy (or restricted spirit) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be whatever, editor of Libération, for example), the only true, which he recognizes. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Top-Secret information on Berlusconi, which the American Embassy in Rome, the Staatsdezernat had sent were the same as those who already Newsweek published the previous week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> So why was such a fuss about the revelations, this dossier? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On one side is that every educated person already know, which is that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the Government can call each other or a plane, in order to make for dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of a few small representativity tasks in espionage centres have turned. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Any viewers by investigating films knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that we should act, to ignore it. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Nevertheless, the fact that it is open to the public, violated the task to reiterate the hypocrisy and serves to American diplomacy in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In second place: The idea that a business-as-usual hackers most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world, can tap into the substantial blow to the prestige of the Staatsdezernats. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, the scandal less the victims, rather than the 'Executioner "in trouble. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we are giving the profound nature of what happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Formerly, to Orwell's time, it was all the power of a Big Brother pool, every gesture controlled his subjects. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwell's prophecy since then would have to be absolutely true can highlight, where every move, thanks to the phone can check every transaction, made a visit to the hotel, the elected motorway, and so on; the citizens would total victims of hard power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> However, if you look to see what is happening today that even the secret Krypten of power no longer can escape the control of a Hackers so, the Kontrollgang to unilaterally zirkelförmig to be addressed and will be. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power to control everyone, but everyone, or at least of the hacker - chosen as the avenger of the citizen - can experience the secrets of power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> But how can a power, which is no longer able to maintain their own secrets? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is true, Georg Simmel said that a real secret an open secret (and a mere secrecy can never be unveiled); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's and Merkel's basically a secret free of Geheimis, because it exposes the public sphere; but in the styles of WikiLeaks reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means any power strip. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Wikileaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What are the consequences of this injury to be such a huge power has been done? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the states in future no more information be reserved Online - that would be one of the street corner angeklebten Aushang. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is equally obvious that the current state of technology, it is to be hoped, in confidential reports on phone to keep secret. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is easier than finding out whether and when a head of state in a plane move and has been in contact with one of his colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could in future private and only for certain ears of certain relationships? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know very well that my forecast to be in the moment and Roman prison sounds like science fiction, but I am forced to present me with the government agents to secret way preoccupied to uncontrollable march routes moving, their messages anywhere else than in the mere memory in order, and in addition, the few written information they received in the footwear (verbergend. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information would be in single copy are stored in locked drawers: Basically, the espionage attempt by Watergate less success, as WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity to write that the technology nowadays like a cancer progresses, backwards. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A century after the wireless Telegraf had revolutionized the communication, the Internet, with a reconstructed Telegrafen (telephone) wire. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The (analogue) video tapes had the film allows them tape for a film auszukundschaften band from the back forward spulen and reveal all the secrets of the installation while the (digital) CDs, now nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter Makroportionen, in other words. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Climate: How France is its financial promises </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A year after the Copenhagen treaty, it is time to comply with the financial promises (also quickly resolved "fast start" finance) or premature to investigate by developing countries, which have been implemented. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The rough French are already vulnerable to blandishments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries committed to $30 billion between 2010 and 2012. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The EU has 7.2 billion euros over three years, promised France 1.26 billion euros (420 million per year). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> At the opening of the COP16, the EU has pulled out all the stops for its partners from the fact their efforts to persuade about Fast-Start-Finanzierungen: Detailgetreuer approach report of its Member States, press conference that large events, as well as the distribution of brochures. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The operation is a remarkable transparency and precisely for its estimated value: The developing countries and the society would like to see all the developed countries do the same for the same level of precision. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The EU announced that in 2010 to 2.2 billion euros, which they released to the right path to Respektbezollung their commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you look into the details, however, things are a little more complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should be according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional use was introduced, to the detriment of the public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means. </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the Commission had proposed a harmonisation have certain members states, including France, the process deadlocked. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today everyone chooses the benchmark, which he regarded as the best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The European Commission, for example, as a benchmark for those of the year for 2009: The international funding will be retained, and in the context of the funding "Fast-Start" 150 million over three years. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries have similar standards, either in terms of the year, or about conditions at the level of public aid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In return, France was of the opinion that the funding "of all new projects" of 2010 were "new and additional". </seg>
<seg id="17"> In other words, there are no references in the spending of the previous year, or at a global level of public aid. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In practical terms, the total amount of the French support of developing countries remain stable (or decrease) - France claims that his commitment to the "new and additional" funding. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another key factor is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is no rule, and everyone chooses his Rechenmodus. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, such as France, are lent €1 as being equivalent to 1 donated €. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Obviously, this is hard to justify that the effort is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loans for certain profitable investment (often linked to emissions control technology projects on effektivster based) can be justified, it is misleading to present the euro, known as the equivalent for a donated euro captured... also should only the cost of the loan for the capital donor country and commitment are counted (i.e. the equivalent of the interest rate). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France has not in the sense that, as the following comment: "Respected" his commitment of 420 million euros, making 91.5% loans (389,8 million euros), and 8.5% donates) 36.1 million euro) - see also the document, in order to persuade yourself. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only land the EU that loans to a great extent. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands, or Slovakia (among other things) to 100% of its commitments with donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In other words, if the overwhelming majority of the European Union to fulfil their obligations to €1, France spends just 10 cents and understands including a comparable effort. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Beautiful Hokuspokus! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> All in all, operates France in its Fast-Start-Finanzierung with a double fraud: A part of the action with a Weiterentwicklkung on time and partly with the reality of financial support. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France, manages to believe that there are 420 million "new and additional" million, in line with his promise and has spent it saves 36.1 million euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it appears that it was the arbitrage Bercy, which has carried out a double negative effect) could entail; even internally (why the other members states with the donations, if there is enough to lend?), and then to the negotiations, as the emerging countries are not completely fooled... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter of the premature funding only a small matter in a relatively short period, compared to the entirety of discussions about the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it could drop too many in the vast machine of the UNFCCC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Let us hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As it always had, it is essential that his lesson from this first year of premature funding to learn. </seg>
<seg id="36"> First and foremost, France could be a change in its accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, and to do so in a spirit of respect for his obligations and compensatory justice with the other countries in the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> But above all France could the discussions on the subject of a dispute of long-term financing to move forward (another key topic), and at the moment: You can escape the question of 'Verrechenbarkeit "the recording kind of its loans or not. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could alter its position, just ahead of the curve in terms of the contentious issues, as it is in other areas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The hope is based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, which will arrive in Cancun next week. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A surprising announcement on the Fast-Start of France and his vision of "Verrechenbarkeit" as well as the use of loan would inherently the international trust to raise the necessary for further discussions. </seg>
