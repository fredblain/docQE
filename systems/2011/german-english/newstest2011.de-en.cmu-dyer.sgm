<seg id="1"> What should you do to the ČSSD? in Prague, the Czech Social Democrats know neither Voldemort, nor the "Konditorei." </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new council members of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously certain language barriers to overcome their old-new colleagues from the ODS in Prague, the city council and in representation at all to understand. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has members of the new council from the ČSSD time a little, "cut off" as they dominate the notorious slang that has become popular in recent years, in which the current coalition partners in Prague were at the helm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The encoded vocabulary, long gone in the era of Mayor Pavel Bém was introduced by the Prague political elite, some of the best-known actors, situations and Causae borrowed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Surprisingly, showed that the new councils in relation to these new concepts somewhat in the dark. </seg>
<seg id="6"> They claim at least. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Who is Voldemort?" </seg>
<seg id="8"> "No idea." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am more of a newcomer in the Prague policy," responded Lukáš Kaucký, the new president of the Council for culture, to the test of the 'Godfather' vocabulary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But the council, a political veteran, Mr Březina responded in a similar way. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example, on the concept of 'golf hole. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "This is the only expression of those present to me, which I use now and again." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "I do not think that a lot of slang." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The vocabulary, the daily newspaper Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the election, had published the ODS Congress pickte the editorial six concepts, particularly those that are notoriously linked to the Prague magistrate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Social Democrats' Voldemort, '"greatest Prague golf hole", should "go in the confectioner," "bull neck", "betrayal" and "verblechen", the capital. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Three Prague council members agreed to the test, the fourth, Mr Weinert, the future head of the Prague education promised his participation in the first conversation, but then not pick up the telephone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The fifth council Mr, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "These are things I don't care, and the Civic Democrats, that I do not judgments." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "I think it is important that we understand in the context of our programs," he countered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> As indicated, had Lukáš Kaucký in the above-mentioned headline allegedly failed to recognize that the influential businessman and friend of the former mayoress Bém, Roman Janoušek. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The term "Voldemort" Kaucky says nothing and the only word he erriet correctly, the test was "the greatest Prague golf hole." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "It is the Tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, for security, but added: "But I know that more from the newspapers." </seg>
<seg id="23"> And jokingly: "I will probably need to show a language course." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> "The golf hole" will not only Matador Karel Březina, but also by the council on the environment, Mr Lukáš Plachý right as Tunnel Blanka deciphered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Both Social Democrats also know, however, for whom the concept of Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý senses even to find where this figure and this is also what it means to "to go in the confectioner." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "I believe that this means that, in a Prague restaurant business to go," Plachý is quite close to the conundrum solution, if we know that it is the seat of Janoušeks firms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> In line with this knowledge Březina, but he claims to have drawn from the newspapers, rather than that it would be this vocabulary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The test participants, it seems, judging by the Social Democrats actually no similar naturalizations slang. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I asked my colleagues, but obviously, there is really not something for us." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "We again call upon us by name, and we also use words or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský from his party comrades colloquially called "Hulda." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "I was in school Bříza (Birch), but I do not know whether my colleagues so call me too," tells us Karel Březina his nickname. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried and behold, it works. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Mr Weinert is friendly to the party members' grandfather 'or less of the' old ', the representative Miroslav Poche, drew attention to the machinations of the party before the elections, sponsorship, and some of my colleagues' Igráček (well-known Czech Lego figure). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Nicknames are the only, as the Social Democrats, whose use of language. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Hulínský it may not, if it calls "Hulda," but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname, chairman of the Prague. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> His nickname "doctor of Gummiknüppel rights" was supposed to do with the fact that Petr Hulínský doctor's title Juris Bratislaver to police academy has acquired. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The right mattress and the right beds Rost women have other aspirations than men? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The tollste bed framework, but the quality of the Liege area-mattress and rust-are the good bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, this must be harmonious complement in order to meet the wishes of the specific user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Many things play a role in the selection process, the weight, size, health and, last but not least, the sex of the Schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Interieur is just as important in the mattress and Rost. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> A typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a weekend house, which does not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not suitable, because they need to be 'warm' for much longer. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethane mattresses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And they should be changed regularly. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If you do not have enough air inlets Kanälchen the essence and lie on a firm record, gets snarled up moisture, so it is not excluded that under its mold. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Of course, plays a role in the election, in which it is used. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Anyone who has been long time abroad, where very high mattresses with soft class are normal, it will be difficult to low mattress with a hard surface can be used. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "All ice hockey players who come back from the NHL, have complained to me that they are no longer able to sleep properly." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "For their abgeschundenen shoulders, heels and waists they need simply a soft layer of Visco-foam (memory foam, a form of memory polymer)." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I recommend including sugar sick people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the" bad information "from the Gelenken and the skin," said Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in padded furniture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> That is why I have years ago many hockey players, but also other customers concerned these mattresses with Visco foam (memory foam). </seg>
<seg id="17"> "This is no longer a problem, because such mattresses are among the manufacturers Tempur, the Italian firm Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And one does not need to be a famous ice hockey players will learn to appreciate the benefits of Visco foam. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The "miracle" is really quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The foam optimalisiert his toughness and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, he schmiegt directly on hot bodies. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Nowhere is there, it is not passing in the night as around after a serious fight. </seg>
<seg id="22"> We simply sleep much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The sparkling Viskoela tables also provides protection against Dekubitus (gangrene). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The choice of mattresses size should be to body size is still the length of the Fußsohlen, CA. to add 21 to 34 cm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Men and women to the 180 cm are large, so need a 210 to 220 cm. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Each of the sleepers should at least 90 cm is widely available, so 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In separate beds, for example, singles are 120 to 140 cm. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The Comfort's sake and for potential visitors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise, the rule of thumb for the ideal bed broad: "If you have enough room on the back, should be easy for the angewinkelten poor," advises Ing. Helen Prokopová, the Guild of Ausstatter Polsterer and space, which is already years devoted to the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and then put this question to schools. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> In a double bed everyone needs its own Rost and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are also high. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise, there is nothing other than to make the different amounts of Roste and that is not possible for each bed framework. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with the skeleton of 15 cm, and it should be at least three centimeters in the form of class and Fein cushion. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "With the hand or sit the feathers in any case we must feel," warns Helena Prokopová. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Each mattress requires a special type of Rost. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Gepolsterte beds with mattresses and document as increased Siam twins have nothing to do in the bedroom. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The mattresses are not reveal the terms and you cannot wash today, and already there is. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And since we are in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years is becoming a huge (and congested Sieb). </seg>
<seg id="38"> This is also why experts reject advertising slogans in many a life span of up to 25 years, and even life guarantee promises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Every cause has its ifs and buts. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And that is why a practical council by dealers: mattresses of 120 and 140 cm wide, waschbaren hygiene abziehbaren salaries should not be afraid to use a mattresses Schoner, nonetheless, it is recommended that you can easily leave and wash. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even if today usually mattresses salary be established with all respect, so it open after the two sides is immensely important for the washing process, and the size of washing machines!), is the manipulation of larger mattresses, especially said, often alone as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> Have you in bed instead of a Rostes firm record? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Raus! </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or more for a bed for unpopular guests and for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The record must be better equipped with ventilation holes (if not included) and mattresses with the skeleton and 15 cm minimum level with sog. pocket Feder Kern and Fein cushion. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethane mattresses are not in such a document. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Verstellbare Lattenroste with 14 to 18 Feder (Lamellen) sandwich or latex mattresses are suitable (possibly combinations of latex and Kokos), always figures are Roste with a larger number of latte, also from 28 and provide more relevant, with the Lordosenstütze Lendenwirbel area and the possibility of raising the bar to regulate severity. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Verstellbare Lamellenroste does not include mattresses with the skeleton, since they do not respond to the ergonomische subterfuge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> In addition to the suspension of stiff Feder will also make special flexible shoulder modules. </seg>
<seg id="50"> There is a specific fastening the Feder, which enables the Feder, einzudrücken or even verwinkeln so that the specific Einsinken Schläfers's shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="51"> For men with broad shoulders an important matter. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There are even mattresses manufacturers have started to use in "Gentlemen mattresses" soft zones for the shoulder area. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The ladies is also thought that soft-fighting areas in the hip area. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For most customers are entitled, elastic wing Feder systems (Lattoflex) or Roste with point elastic touch pads with sog. multi-torsion Federung. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure will be distributed to a number of issues, thus reducing the tension. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But, if you look at the right mattress and right Rost used a bad (too big and fülliges) pillow, most of the gains are lost. </seg>
<seg id="57"> This is a rule of thumb: the pillow to head restraints, its leaders should extend only to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax. </seg>
<seg id="58"> It seems an ideal 50 x 60 cm high, as it may, for example, the Scandinavians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The sides should have the pillow (together with the shoulder area in the rust-discharge or soft zone in the bed) compensate the shoulder level. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Have our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (but) straw bags full of hay. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern manufacturers increasingly use natural materials, or at least their mixtures. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Many also say the new game "organic." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of oil, raw materials used to manufacture of polyurethane foams frequency of natural oils-for example, Elle Rizinus and soya oil. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soya is used by all well-known manufacturers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> "Biotechnology is in mattresses, the heart of it is purely natural materials," said Petr Vašíček Tropico Plus of the company. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Natural substances will also be used in the manufacture of mattresses salary-it was one of the first Aloe Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> But one can also be micro-capsules, the fresh forest or sleep Lavendel odor spread. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Here too there is a difference between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While the men a "kühlender" plant extracts from birch leaves used to the heat and cool the body can absorb the mattresses, the remuneration for women "wärmende" effect. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Extracts from red paprika Schoten rain the blood circulation to the weaker sex, sleep so wohlig warm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> The current favorites? </seg>
<seg id="72"> Kalt foam mattresses (he has greater Poren with destroyed cell structure and is therefore breathing more active than standard polyurethane and more flexible). </seg>
<seg id="73"> The combination of the various technical (tough) by cold foams and Visco-foaming produce more zones mattresses that know exactly where head, hip and heels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> A high-quality mattresses, though, has 7,000 kroner and to fork out more. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Health mattresses, but usually with lower value added tax burden, because they are seen as a medical device. </seg>
<seg id="76"> The first Czech companies have received Gumotex this advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> It is to save money in the mattress and the rust-is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Now and again there are special offers from manufacturers and retailers who offer two mattresses for the price of one. </seg>
<seg id="79"> It offers the brand Magniflex mattresses duo freeze in relation to verstepptem Visco-foam memory for CZK 11.990. </seg>
<seg id="80"> The second will be free to do so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the era of the Material Tempur Viskoela Tischen foam material with open cell structure and high density in almost kosmischem pace. </seg>
<seg id="82"> No wonder they were developed for NASA, however, because the astronauts are starts in the enormous pressures. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Amazon blocking server - threats against Assange </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> WikiLeaks is increasingly in trouble. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Perhaps behind political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic diplomatic cables. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Assange WikiLeaks founder is supposedly in England. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The WikiLeaks disclosure platform in the United States is increasingly under attack. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now seeking an Internet home in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="8"> A prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman, meanwhile, called on other countries and companies to boycott of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="9"> WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, the tracking lists of Interpol, is residing in Britain, according to a newspaper report. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> "WikiLeaks of Amazon server." </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Free speech in the land of the free," shared the Enthüllungs activists by text messaging service Twitter (local time) on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Shortly before the Internet company Amazon had consigned the WikiLeaks documents from its servers. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The Internet activists in the publication of secret diplomatic diplomatic cables had resorted to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) in order to be able to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> By Twitter said WikiLeaks to step further: "Prima-our dollars are spent to employ people in Europe." </seg>
<seg id="15"> If Amazon have this problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop to sell books." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Amazon, the use of its servers by WikiLeaks stopped after staff of Senator Joe Lieberman have made inquiries, the CNN television channel reported, citing the office of the mans. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security, Amazon had threatened to boycott, the British newspaper reported. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "I would have liked that Amazon this measure was taken in light of the previous publications classified information by WikiLeaks," said the senator. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Lieberman, meanwhile, called on the platform, to deny the use of servers in other countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "WikiLeaks' illegal, hideous and thuggery jeopardizes our national security and endangering lives around the globe," the non-party senator, in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "No responsible companies, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks in its efforts to disseminate stolen material." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Assange WikiLeaks founder, who is being sought by the authorities in Sweden, is suspected of rape on the Interpol list of investigations. </seg>
<seg id="23"> According to a report by the London newspaper The Independent in Britain, "the 39-year-old Australian is the exact place Scotland Yard was known. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The Internet activist, the investigations in Sweden has set as his opponents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson in London, said there had been threats. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange." </seg>
<seg id="27"> That is why Assange rightly fear for his safety, said Hrafnsson. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The WikiLeaks founder will therefore continue to hide. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Hrafnsson apparently reacted to comments from North America. </seg>
<seg id="30"> In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations should be charged with treason and executed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In Canada, obviously ironic, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on television, "Assange should be killed" and Obama could "use of a drone." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Between the White House and Assange has meanwhile been exchanged. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had called for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, if it is responsible for recently leaked spy invitations to diplomats. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "I am not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a type with a website," Gibbs said. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than a website." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> The American government is the protection of their data banks fully to the test. </seg>
<seg id="37"> As a special envoy, the vice-director of the Center for anti-terrorism measures, Russell Travers, was appointed, the White House said. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Travers was responsible for the "necessary structural reforms" to develop the message of the disclosure of the reports by WikiLeaks have become necessary. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The White House will also check the ways how the whole government, exchanging information and safeguards. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> The American government also announced that for the safety of dissidents and activists want to worry, they should be by the WikiLeaks publication in jeopardy. </seg>
<seg id="41"> "We have done everything to come in contact with them," said their spokesman Philip Crowley. </seg>
<seg id="42"> "We are ready to protect them if it should be necessary." </seg>

<seg id="13"> Some dreams in a midlife crisis of a new career, others simply dare again treacherous ice their vague aspirations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents from Brazil via Hungary to Saudi Arabia. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Maestro Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari declared the participants first, the ideal characteristics of perfect ice cream. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is not only good taste and good consistency, but also the seidige suppleness. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Luciano forgets in his training but not the icing on the cake of national and even Latin Überbaus: "Italian gelato is simply the best, and there is still a lot of romance." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first step to production seems quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Luciano overturns the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a great mix with an electronic device which program everything at 85 degree heat and then immediately to four degrees cools. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Then he turns to the machine is a cock and a pasteurized White basis lotions, basis for all milk Eissorten. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The lecturer will immediately bombarded with questions: can you ice cream only with natural substances without stabilizer? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How can we allow them to unleash their own experimental lust? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Luciano warns to mislead the zeitgeist. </seg>
<seg id="28"> "Only natural ingredients" speech, ice cream, who may yet stabilizers, mostly used a natural product, such as Guarkernmehl Guarbohne. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Of course you can produce ice without stabilizing, but it must be sold within a day, otherwise sackt it, and the customer bites on the ice grains. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Some variation on the basic mass are allowed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It will be exciting with the flavorings. </seg>
<seg id="32"> For the taste of ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes the ingredients in the fruit or the sweets section of the supermarket buys. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Furthermore, there are bullets and Pasten. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "The suppliers are all trying to foist onto dozens of aromatic additions them." </seg>

<seg id="37"> The yellow or white, from the mass of ice cream with eggs, cream and cocoa powder used as the basis for all kinds of chocolate temptations offered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Now, the course participants in the ice machines. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano, each of them four different types of vanilla, chocolate, Mokka and hazelnut-ice, with or without producing eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural supplements. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The same experiment, the Fruchteis varieties. </seg>
<seg id="41"> More flavor, more fruit mashed-taste is not necessarily better. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Hazelnut ice tastes not necessarily nussiger if it contains more hazelnuts. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The most popular Kiwi-ice, the working group, which used more fruit, less water and less stabilizer. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Only a balanced combination Hebe the taste of a gelato right, says Luciano. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Ice production is a mathematical exercise: peach-mashed with a lot of sugar used, the sugars in the basic recipe must be reduced. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For Zitroneneis is an extra dose of sugar needed. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano is a machine, with the sugar content of the fruit varieties (wine, so that the grape musts Oechsle). </seg>
<seg id="48"> Fortunately easier tables the calculation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> To make ice no longer requires so much physical work as before. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Not only the equipment for the automatic restoration of basic mass helps. </seg>
<seg id="51"> There is also a device, in which the final EIS mixture cremig beaten and cooled to minus temperatures at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Despite all the automation, remain small margins. </seg>

<seg id="2"> The International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But the country refuses to comment, nor can it controls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007, with at least four Israeli F-15 fighter planes is a mystery, würfelförmiges buildings in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is on the banks of the Euphrates, the next major city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Her name appeared in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), if it comes to the reactor that Syria was allegedly being built with help from North Korea in the Quader, hidden in a valley, the electricity line. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing by the United States Secret Service CIA abroad would be the end of April 2008, in the name of Middle Village el-Kibar have been well-suited to produce plutonium-based reactor to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes, it is hardly the technology from the Fifties. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA led a video presentation with blurred satellite images. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Played by computer animation, where the components of the reactor before the destruction alleged to have been a fell copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center. </seg>
<seg id="11"> They also presented photographs from near the building in the show or even the atrium. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor was not yet on the eve of the operation, it was with fuel rods have been drawn. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more than it was then known, the mystery has been rather bigger in time. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The former US president George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack in el-Kibar was quite sure that Syria build a reactor, but saw little evidence that it was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some intelligence officers in Europe, there are even more cautious and talk only of a "alleged reactor," even if you believe that the presentation of the CIA is "plausible". </seg>
<seg id="16"> They lack of hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Asked how confident he is, to have a reactor, a senior UN diplomat replied in the summer is simply that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The rubble of the alleged "unused military building", while the Syrians eilig aside and planierten carefully the terrain. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, an IAEA team in June 2008 under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, the IAEA on a member state satellite images commercial providers from the period immediately after the attack, which might be stronger than those presented by the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But these recordings are not available on the market, because the unknown client-perhaps Israel-it has bought exclusive. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The IAEA therefore cannot independently verify its authenticity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always claimed that never pursued a secret nuclear program or a reactor to be built. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, Damascus said. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But the IAEA had to analyze the particles as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss-as well as on the satellite images. </seg>
<seg id="27"> It denied the inspectors access to a second inspection in el-Kibar and the rubble of the bombed-out building. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Israel silent also staunchly. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We will never comment on that," acting prime minister Ehud Olmert at the time of the attack recently reiterated the official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The investigation of the case has been dragging on since June 2008, fruitless and "is becoming a serious problem of credibility for the authority," a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna is allowed, there is a serious breach of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) in the area, monitored by the IAEA. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As the key to progress in the investigation, the IAEA apparently three other bodies "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor are and unlike that still exist. </seg>
<seg id="32"> So far the inspectors have not revealed what assets it is, or what they are or what they appear to be suspicious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they will be in the IAEA internally as Marj known as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived from nearby towns. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) has identified these places in Washington and on satellite images of a building complex in Masyaf tracked objects, it is probably one of the suspects. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It is possibly in or adjacent to a military base, with this justification denied Syria the IAEA access to the three places. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In Vienna, it says the Syrians feared a fishing expedition that the IAEA may be sent by the United States, in order to military installations. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The nuclear detectives were woken by a tip of the US intelligence services to the institutions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the Quader of Euphrates and material was moved. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could "in connection with the fuel production". </seg>
<seg id="40"> But there is no evidence of "sensitive" uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities and processes that are necessary to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The reactor is powered by uranium, which is not enriched. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But where the uranium had come from, and where it would later be separated the plutonium for the bomb on these key issues, there are only plausible assumptions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> It is also unclear whether the debris that might bring valuable traces, stored in the three places. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As if the hundreds of cargo trucks disappeared from the face of the Earth, nobody wants to have information on where the debris remained. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Only a few kilometers from el-Kibar al-Tibni salt mine situated on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria has studied their suitability as a storage for radioactive waste in 1998, the IAEA is unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had it in a recent analysis of satellite images of the venerable magazine Jane's Intelligence Review associated with the reactor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Recordings from the orbit but show that Syria on the three suspects work places Earth and big container remote access that the IAEA had requested. </seg>
<seg id="48"> It may be coincidence, but has hardly helped to dispel the suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> In addition, the IAEA says that in diplomatic circles, have spent many months to develop a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets, the tape shows how much interest the inspectors. </seg>
<seg id="50"> However, Damascus bügelte this proposal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago had assuaged, the reactor was destroyed, and therefore have no urgency to the matter as US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months' special inspections into the game, one of the strongest means that the Vienna nuclear authority to impose controls. </seg>
<seg id="52"> IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, these inspections should suggest, has spoken of "an option in the future, for which I am open, but he hesitates. </seg>
<seg id="53"> It is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it needs for a majority of the board of the IAEA, and many of the countries represented 35 countries are eager to anything other than an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other hand, as a diplomat to consider is: 'What is that if you find nothing in the end? " </seg>

<seg id="17"> This lasted even during the global economic crisis, is probably the fact that the Latin American countries have experienced only a brief recession and quickly recovered. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, the poor through stronger social network instead. </seg>
<seg id="19"> (According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, rose only slightly in 2009, the poverty rate in Latin America and is again this year fell by 32%). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But there are strong differences (S mood from country to country. chart 4). </seg>
<seg id="21"> Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread progress thinking. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and violent crime have increased, this is less the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> For only the second time since the beginning of the survey, many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country a bigger problem than unemployment (s). chart 5). </seg>
<seg id="24"> Approximately 31% say that either they or a family member have been victim of a crime, but last year to 38% last year, the values dropped and thus achieve the lowest level since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The rising economic performance is reflected in the strong support of the private sector and the market economy: approximately-71% of respondents said that the private sector is essential for development, in 2007 there were 56% (s. chart 6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> Approximately 58% said that the market economy can bring their country progress, compared with 47% last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela maintain this view (and 80% are in favor of a private sector), even though their leftist President, Hugo Chávez, many private companies nationalized. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil has the 19% of respondents (18% last year) the biggest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year). </seg>
<seg id="29"> The respondents in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, are the most influential country in the United States, and this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua will be accepted by Venezuela. </seg>

<seg id="11"> According to a cautious statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean community "to make these irregularities, so seriously they may be, the process is not necessarily unlawful". </seg>
<seg id="12"> In other words, the show goes on. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The electoral authority, allegedly the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is committed to the preliminary results will be announced on 7 December. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, their popularity rate of around 20 points driving upwards to more than 50%, which is the highest value since its election in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Whether it gets to a re-election next year, however, depends on whether the obvious Cristina Fernández compromise is in mourning for her late husband, Néstor Kirchner, her predecessor and political partner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The signs are not clear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Néstor Kirchner, even after the election of his wife's economic policies, was often budget plans, the tax revenue, not fully take into account the economic growth and inflation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This allowed the presidential couple, the extra revenue to spend as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On paper, Fernández-last year, the government lost its majority in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further divisions. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten, rallying around Cristina Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But after chaotic meetings (where a parliamentarian in the face of another accused the government of corruption, and others), the Congress failed to pass the budget for 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I will not discuss it," the president said. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The 2010 budget for the next year, which is now the president has more opportunity to spend money as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy is hot: this year it is likely to grow up to 9%. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official inflation rate is z.Z. to 11.1%, but many private estimates and wage demands of the unions, pushing the value to almost 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was ridden by economic crises, said his main objectives, and not the inflation growth and poverty reduction. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He refused to cooperate with the IMF, bullying the private sector and the National Institute of Statistics and Census säuberte INDEC, prompting the official inflation statistics schönte. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Fernández can now a modest path? </seg>
<seg id="18"> It has called on the private sector and the trade union leaders for talks. </seg>
<seg id="19"> According to official statements and wage increases should be limited to 18% next year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But inflation undermined the growth by a large devaluation in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Perhaps for this reason, Cristina Fernández, Argentina's financial support to the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="23"> At the beginning of this year, the government made an agreement with holders of securities that had rejected the previous restructuring of the country in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Fernández now appears on an agreement with the Paris club donors to urge that they approximately $6.7 billion debt. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Kirchners had a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere, always rejected. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But last month, the Economy Minister Amado Boudou, announced that the fund in the drafting of a new national consumer price index will provide "technical support". it looks as if this is the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not known whether Mr Fernández, after leaving office without the support of her husband will be politically active. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If so, they need to get the support of middle-class, largely have had enough of Kirchnerism. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the Argentines return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of Sympatie that has been shown to be abgeebbt. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If you must decide whether they would like to win another election, many political decisions her husband quietly lifted. </seg>

<seg id="4"> On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters in five city districts, which are 70% of all eligible voters to elect mayors and local councilors. This will be seen as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou. </seg>
<seg id="5"> By building a pioneering business relations, einschl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbol for relations with the mainland, its policy has greatly changed the relationship to the Chinese motherland, for the first time since 1949. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Ma has insisted the examination, but only barely. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) mayor, three of the five, it received a majority of votes. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which favors greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the votes, the KMT has received 45%. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In a presidential election would mean for Ma problems. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Since his election two years ago, has fallen by approximately 8%. The share of his party. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For the first time, the DPP, together with the KMT in the city. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as convoys of trucks with rioters, flags-schwenkende mass parades and only scantily clad dancers. </seg>
<seg id="13"> There was even the obligatory, mysterious murder attempt. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, in a speech on the eve of the election, a KMT candidate </seg>
<seg id="15"> In the face of a man from the crowd when he resigned, lien was wounded and a umstehender bystander were killed. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Bizarre Weiser, it is not clear whether the shooter lien kill or wanted to settle a dispute with the candidates. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Irrespective of the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the election affected the KMT and the DPP has been in a bad light, which has brought more votes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> China was perhaps the biggest winners in the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Remarkably, the issue of relations with the mainland was not broached. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Instead, the candidates debated on plans for social housing and job creation. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The Taiwanese love their de facto independence, and oppose China's military threat. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This is why the KMT not to the fore in its relations with the government in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But this time, the DPP also avoided too much fuel to the anti-Chinese feelings. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China. </seg>

<seg id="29"> We prefer to wait until after the 2012 presidential election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The DPP has now reinvented itself. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Two years ago it was severely weakened, the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption. </seg>
<seg id="32"> During his presidency from 2000 to 2008 he was pressing for the absolute independence. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But under tais reign has developed a new generation of politicians and the DPP gemässigter fighting for the votes of the professionals and the youth. </seg>

<seg id="36"> Tsai is planning a think tank as a contact point between the DPP and China, which, however, open-minded discussions. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Tsai said publicly that their party is a "trustworthy alternative" to offer Mas vorschneller rapprochement with China. </seg>

<seg id="40"> He even asked the pragmatists Su to waive the presidential candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even without Chen's interference is difficult for the DPP to choose its possible candidates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The KMT will have a self-analysis. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Ma's values are low, despite the rapid economic growth, the KMT candidates to lead their campaign without him. </seg>

<seg id="4"> In view of the fact that Spalding since their 2008 album "Esperanza" in the jazz scene is already a celebrated star, the nomination appears to be a little unusual, but it is the Grammy rules under which an artist before publication of the albums, he became known among the general public, with only three Alben should have been given out. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The ambitious album of the year 2010, "Chamber Music Society" is certainly a step forward, and with its beschwingten voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, can be compared with Norah Jones 2003 calmly Spalding, whose great success in 2003, when the nomination in that category jazz Interpretin Spaldings comes closest. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The discovery of an alien bacteria type of arsenic can live, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth, and elsewhere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, you think it is a sign that a life without the necessary elements so far in life is possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "This organism has two options." </seg>
<seg id="5"> "He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "It is something very special, although it is almost a sort of 'foreign' way of life," said C.W. Paul Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears in the online edition of the journal Science on Thursday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> So far six main elements have been regarded as a vital carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> But, as the scientists discovered the bacterium in Mono Lake, California is growing even further if it phosphor replaced by arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "One wonders what else is possible," said the report's co-author Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists, its forms have to recognize in Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study deals with microbes that have been found on Earth. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The announcement of a press conference that no details of the discovery were made known, led to widespread speculation that the report by the discovery of aliens living on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "shows that in other planet systems organisms with the help of other elements can kickstart biochemical processes, and that the 'standard', which, in our opinion, are absolutely vital elements are not necessarily set out," said Charles Cockell, Professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University in Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockel was not part of the research teams. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "This work is a novelty because it shows that in fundamental biochemical processes and structures an element can be replaced by another," added Cockell. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The discovery was not accidental. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Felisa Wolfe-Simon by Astro biological Institute of NASA, which led the study, chose the Mono Lake because of the high arsenic content. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Arsenic and phosphorus, the same chemical that microbes that are both suspended, possibly an element could replace by the other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "The toxicity of the Arsens is mainly based on the fact that it is chemically the same as phosphorus." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "The organisms will find it hard to distinguish one element from the other." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "But the difference is so great that arsenic is different than phosphorus. it into our bio-chemical system, where almost all covered," said Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers, the bacterium GFAJ 1 an increasing concentration of arsenic. It is fit and grew. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The microbe is growing in phosphorus in arsenic can survive better, but that it also shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on earth or another planet or moon, often on the arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> According to Jamie S. Foster, believe for microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new, but so far there has been still no functioning example. </seg>

<seg id="7"> At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank earned $75 million. The financing to the company by mid-December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The restructuring of the studios began in May 2009 with the mandate of the investment bank Moelis & Co, the company's management, with interest payments of $300 million per year struggled to help solve their financial problems. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In August, the chief executive Harry Sloan replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert who through his work with Krispy Kreme doughnuts became known. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve the financial concerns MGMs and more than 140 Gläuber Studios auszubezahlen, lasted longer than expected. </seg>
<seg id="11"> After months of discussions, the parties decided to offer to buy the company at the end of 2009. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But the auction drew only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion requested by the creditors. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In the spring of this year, everything started from scratch, as MGM's team began with the restructuring plan, after months of debate and infighting at the end of October was finally signed by the creditors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> If MGM has survived the bankruptcy officially in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper for their work received a bonus of several million dollars. </seg>

<seg id="3"> An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect-game about 10 traditional spring rush or approximately 48 doses of Play-Doh. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> But they can protect their gifts budget. </seg>
<seg id="5"> I recently visited in search of three electronic toys under $80 three national toy retailers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club. </seg>
<seg id="6"> I was immediately clear that Moore's law was in force. This year, the technology toys more efficient and cost less than at the same time last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> And while fewer new toys with its own website, is in the best-known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, a wider range. </seg>
<seg id="8"> There are more button-cell-powered toys on the market, and many of them contain phone batteries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Here are a few recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="10"> (Unless otherwise stated, all prices of Toys' R 'Us.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for children 3 years) are PlüSch characters, such as guinea pigs who sing a note, if you take on your stomach turns. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Once, in a note that number, you can play a song. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Respect: If you with the press have begun, they can no longer stop. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> For a combination of Gesand and dance the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price is $60 for children, 2) the best option. </seg>
<seg id="16"> On the basis of the last year developed technology offers the animatronische Elmo Live doll recantations as' Simon says' toes, and thanks to the new interface with wheel blocking dominated the moon-walk. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Children who tested the device to use Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complained about the lack of noise regulation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> If you are a child of the 1980s, you surely remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Now he is back (Hasbro / play Kool, $40 for children, 3), with a whole bunch of question cards, which can be a lesson to a car journey, with a better know auto correction function as a teacher. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> If your child does not want to entrust their smartphone, there are three independent alternatives. </seg>
<seg id="21"> VTech MobiGo ($60 for children 3 to 8) is the cheapest and user-friendly solution, equipped with a QWERTY keyboard, which contained the games, however, are not as useful as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children 3 to 12, leapfrogs), the first major revision of the Leapster series is equipped with a new, brighter screen. </seg>
<seg id="22"> None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> IXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children 3-7) used for the games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD cards Laufwerks family photographs can also be seen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Finally, there is still a Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children 8). The five blocks are not bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In the game, there is a need to merge the blocks of words before the time is running out, and it is great to improvise a Buchstabier competition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> More and more toys have a kind of online connection. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If you alone after the supply in the toy shops, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Her child to an animal in the Club Penguin online, you can, for example, a Disney's Club Penguin 2 mix 'n' match figures buy package ($5 for children 6-12), which contains a coin with a secret code. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If it gets the code online, her child the Club Penguin Store enough credits for a further two parts. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice, Senator John Ensign acquitted of charges after his affair with a former election worker and his attempt to give her husband a lobbying against him has been collected, the lawyers of the senator announced on Wednesday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The decision closed the most serious charge against Senator Ensign, Republican of Nevada, until the scandal made headlines across the country, and a drubbing to his career, it was as a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As Senator Ensigns office announced that he was "delighted" about the judgment of the one-year study. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Senate Ethics Committee could, however, still a Disziplar penalty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to the Ensigns lawyers they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were recruited and that no further charges in this matter. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Justice Ministry did not comment on the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The judgment was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. They believe there was sufficient evidence that the ban on lobbying Ensign has ignored. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Interviews, e-mails and other documents that have been revealed for the first time in the New York Times in October 2009, gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of its election workers to gave lucrative contracts to buy his silence about the affair with Hamptons wife Cynthia. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Cynthia Hampton was active during an election campaign as a treasurer of Ensigns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Ensign, contact some political friends to Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogations he assumed for them following the suspension Hamptons lobbying. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Hampton was recently in Ensigns election team, it was a year had he not lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate. </seg>
<seg id="13"> According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton before the affair were chummy, against the so-called revolving door ban Lobbykratie. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> According to the published evidence "apparently it is an agreement and the violation of the revolving door statutes," Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients, which is targeted by the government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to the reasons for the decision to announce in the Ensign case, said Mr. brand and other ethics lawyers, the department notes very careful in accepting political charges after a series of setbacks that have been followed with great interest by the media, including the decision last year that the charges against the former Senator Ted Stevens because of misconduct by the prosecutor to drop. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Prosecutors "are obviously detention," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the Association of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington "(an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in Parliament and government circles in the United States), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr. Ensign has brought before the courts. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "This means that, in general, high government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to you," she added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Paul Coggins, main defenders of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call from a public prosecutor on Monday and another the next day, where he was told that the Ministry will not levy any charges against his clients. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator, as his office in a statement on Wednesday repeated again, "acted in accordance with the law." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr. Coggins refused, the legal arguments that he had made with prosecutors to explain in more detail. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "I am not here to go into the details of talks between me and the Ministry of Justice, but it must be said that we believe that we have taken the right decision," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided that the investigations of a separate appeal by the group to suspend the payment of $96,000 on Mr. Ensigns parents to the Hamptons have infringed the federal election law. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The election commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money was anything other than a gift. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which supported the senator for a long time, was one of the firms, in which Mr. Hampton thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign was work of lobbyists. </seg>
<seg id="25"> An e-mail in December 2008 shows that, after the company brought on Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, who told him that he had a conversation with Mr. Hampton in the interior ministry for a cause "anklopfe." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and other customers from Nevada, Allegiant Air, to lunch and asked the minister of transport, agreed to convene a meeting on behalf of the airline, given that Mr. Hampton for lobbying had stopped. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> For the first time last year when information about this affair to the public came to apologize to Mr. Ensign and his constituents and his position in the hierarchy of Republicans in the Senate, where he had been in fourth place. </seg>
<seg id="28"> After many months, was not struck two weeks ago, Mr. Ensign told reporters that he wanted a third term in the Senate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> In an announcement that Mr. Ensign no longer be the target of police investigations, said his press secretary, Jennifer Cooper, the senator quickly follow the example of the Justice Ministry and his hope that the ethics committee investigations einstelle. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "Senator Ensign is pleased to continue its hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Half a dozen of them tippten in the riots in the courtroom. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the minutes breath verschickten you on Twitter their reports on grausige testimonies. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the end, the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the process to rape and beds gekettete children in a house that flare. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Thursday, the closely watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was charged with killing three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, to have a formal end, if the ruling on the death sentence, imposed by the jury. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already filed motions in court to explain the reasons for an appeal to the courts for years to come. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Provozierendsten one of the reasons is that the intensive coverage of the process, and the extensive use of Twitter by average reporter, a "circus atmosphere" and such a widespread, swift penetration rebel details came in, so that the jury had been improperly influenced by the public indignation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This protest the Appelation courts could lead to new rules to deal with the question of whether the new technologies will be needed in the courtroom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "As I have seen during this process, I believe that there is a real danger that the arrival of new technologies in the courtroom on every individual's right to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes's defenders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue by the Supreme Court chamber, said last week the amendments by ruling succinctly when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But this was certainly not the last word on this matter. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For decades, Court of Appeals noted that the reporting of notorious cases raising doubts about the fairness of the process. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In his historic 1966 decision, the Supreme Court of the United States the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Cleveland osteopaths, killed his wife, will be lifted and said in its decision that it would have been because of the "new media" a carnival atmosphere in the courtroom. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some believe that the television series and the movie "on the flight" is based on the crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some lawyers say court of appeals, which Mr. Hayes condemnation could see half a century later, the argument that new rules are necessary to ensure that the channels of communication from the courtroom at the time of the event, Dr. Sheppard was unimaginable to regulate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "There is a good reason, on the impact of new media to be in trials of the general public to be concerned," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut, according to his report, it arbitrarily imposed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor Donohue said, some appelation courts could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of instant communications out of the courtroom could make the process fairer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Twitter issue is just one of many that the lawyers from Mr. Hayes set to debate for years and thus delay a condemnation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defender, for example, claim that Mr. Hayes could have been tried before, Judge Blue did not allow them to test the reactions of potential judges, giving them during the judges selected grausige scene photographs showed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some of the judges said that photos of the victim, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and its Tüchter, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years, they have met with disgust. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Defenders say it would also call into question the constitutionality of the death penalty is constitutional, and argue that the judge wrongly a jury have exchanged, a critic of the prosecutor's office, and that he was improperly put pressure on the ruling, as he had taken the unusual decision to ask the jury for free over the weekend. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The judges were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But their arguments about the impact of the detailed reporting about the process, perhaps the greatest interest. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In a court dispute that they have submitted last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and the American Senate was discussed by the candidates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They argued that the new media have continuously re-ignite the flames of emotion on the case. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "Such a daily crush of media Piepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "we have never experienced before in New Haven, and perhaps even across the country." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Their focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that direct news reports are rabble than be reimbursed more slowly, a technology hostile view is that the report on future processes verarme. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> However, some lawyers said that appelation courts were often faced with the argument that social and technological changes require the adaptation of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr. Hayers lawyers reinforce that claim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In their appeal, they were based on the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, the sentencing of Dr. Sheppard was lifted on the basis of the report and made it clear that the new media require new rules. </seg>
<seg id="32"> "This case," they wrote, "represented Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21 century." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Can connect courtesy the division? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> After a campaign in his words and negativity is little civility in Washington this week broke out. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It is the sign of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion, before quickly return to the battle of the parties in the capital. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The meeting between President Barack Obama and the congressional leaders on Tuesday produced no breakthrough in the major issues, with the man during the sog. "lame duck" session, the meeting at the end of a period in which no government had to employ more decisions to be taken. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After all what we hear, it was not a polite debate between two different sides, a respect for their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan collection points. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meeting on Wednesday, the president's deficit commission was equally civilized, despite the political differences between the members remain. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months to create a mutual respect of the ideological divide that continue to separate the members concealed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> This is hardly enough to say that there is a new era of cooperation here. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Both sides are now in a testing phase-in a sign of cooperation and compromise from the other demands, while even trying to weigh up the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a renewed warfare. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Therefore, the meeting itself and its assessment by the participants on Tuesday were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to be a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the last two years might expect. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or rights, the two sides are miles apart. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Finally, the November election Washington at least for a short time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official who now works for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "It is inevitable after the elections. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elections give partisan passions, to die. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And that is a good thing. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In some issues, particularly those that are on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice other than to find a solution. " </seg>
<seg id="19"> Bush's tax cuts end up at the end of the year, and no one favors it. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether temporarily or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is also expected to produce a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans favored believes that we cannot afford that the tax cuts for the rich, while refusing to help unemployed workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting in the White House on Tuesday increased the optimism is that it is on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time can ratify the New Start treaty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But William glass tone of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation on urgent issues for the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to a permanent cooperation by the parties, if the new 112. Congress will convene in January. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead, he says, is a phase of NichtüBer once immensely more likely, perhaps even inevitable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "After the things that need to be done, done, this short-term psychology will slide into confrontation," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Wehner is also skeptical, and this skepticism is shared by many, courtesy of genuine cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "I see much of what happens from now on until 2012, as busy, or shadow boxing, for the main event in 2012," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters, whose education were appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="29"> As the Republican leader is also concerned that they may be pokern too high, you know that you have to try to reduce government spending and its promise to repeal the health-care reform. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> This party lines are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the deficit commission, which is a tax reform and raising some taxes and include raising the retirement age and reducing state expenditure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The deputy chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in accordance with its own assessment, insisted that the deficit issue on the public agenda that they could no longer be ignored. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need within the Commission, 14 of the 18 votes for its plan to make a formal recommendation, and they are fighting in order to come even close to this number. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The biggest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the body, as financial issues, at least today, little sympathy or little room for compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Galston says two stages of the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes if the Republicans in the state budget, taxes and the health care system, Obama's challenge, then followed by a stage two more partisan cooperation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> The public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It is proved that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans are still hopes that the two parties work together. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If confrontation in a blind alley, as happened in 1995, both parties will have to carefully look at the public reaction. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Whoever is doomed to lose will change tack and must seek a compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> In fact, it may be an optimistic view. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Partisanship and polarization are larger than in the mid-1990's, and they seem greater ideological divide between Obama and the Congress to be Republican than his time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude for a much broader consistency in 2012 election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> So, the courtesy display this week, may be welcomed by many Americans. </seg>
<seg id="45"> But it will require much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator of the issues that still divide the two. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Khmer Rouge veterans to confrontation with the past forced </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a weak and concrete class area with dirty and abblätternden walls, recalls the director of the Anlong Veng High School to the man who built it, the future Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> "Everyone here loves Ta Mok." </seg>
<seg id="4"> "He was a good leader and he has cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butchers," the commander is popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he has developed infrastructure, hospitals and bridges built and where thousands of former soldiers still lives. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, are longtime supporters in Anlong Veng. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum the victims the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In June the government circulated a textbook for the first time, children of former soldiers told the story of the Khmer Rouge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And in July, a community court of the UN and Cambodia for the first time a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, sentenced to 35 years in prison. </seg>
<seg id="10"> With all these developments, the fear among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, hindered their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "There is still fear and rejection of the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "For them, life under the Khmer Rouge is impressive, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "It divides families." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> During the Khmer Rouge reign in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died from disease, overwork or starvation. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When the Vietnamese invaded and toppled Pol Pot in 1979 by the IED government, fled the remnants of the regime and its military to the Cambodian border in Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="16"> They surrendered until December 1998, when the last movement, widespread unrest. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from its base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok withdrew the next generation in Anlong Veng. </seg>
<seg id="18"> But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, the government began überzulaufen what Kapitulationen to Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan, in 1998. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who was not given, was arrested by government forces in the Dangrek Mountains in 1999. </seg>
<seg id="20"> He died in 2006 of the Phnom Penh prison, where he waited for his trial. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> As their benefactors they no longer protected, ran most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters in the grinding poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memories. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Even if a few elite Khmer Rouge official kept their local government posts, because they laid down their arms, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> "These people have very little benefit from the capitulation," said Sok Leang, by the Center for Justice and Reconciliation in Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng, public forums, </seg>
<seg id="24"> "They are enshrined in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime." </seg>
<seg id="25"> "They grew without any professional knowledge." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Sor Lim, 55, joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974 as a teenager, had fought in the jungle to Anlang Veng, before he was to lead a life as a poor rice farmer in 1998. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> "Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said. </seg>
<seg id="28"> "Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat." </seg>
<seg id="29"> "But now life is difficult, because we have to take care of ourselves." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The current Khmer Rouge tribunal has also raised concerns here. </seg>
<seg id="31"> At the beginning of next year, the court will try to Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister facing trial. </seg>
<seg id="32"> It is the task of the court, the old leaders and to condemn those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it has not said whether it will pursue further action on these four cases. </seg>
<seg id="33"> That has done little to allay the fears in Anlong Veng to alleviate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Recent media speculation, have focused on the Chaem, 64 years, during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's, district leader in the province of Manteay Meanchey was. </seg>
<seg id="35"> In 2007 it was representative of the Documentation Center of Cambodia told they have the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers probably died. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> On a hot night in the work in the fields of Chaem came to her wooden house on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng. </seg>
<seg id="37"> As the sun cast a long shadow on the desiccated grass in Chaem it refused to discuss her past in the Khmer Rouge. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Should the court it would subpoena them, so they refuse to go, she said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> "Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said. </seg>
<seg id="40"> "There would be no more prosecutions, it is war." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> Prime Minister Hun Sen, has fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain if the tribunal to indict suspects, although experts and historians discuss this. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> "Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center. </seg>
<seg id="44"> "Reconciliation with the Khmer Rouge-era will bring together the broken pieces," he said. </seg>
<seg id="45"> "It is our obligation to set the broken parts together, so that all can understand." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> The Center created the first textbook approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75seitige 'history of Democratic Kampuchea. " </seg>
<seg id="47"> It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng appended to the history books for the high school of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> As is often the case in Cambodia know the young people in Anlong Veng little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's links to the regime. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Touch Valeak, 19, a student in the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new textbook to help students to understand an important part of their history. </seg>
<seg id="50"> But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought home a book to read it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> "My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said. </seg>
<seg id="52"> "They are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people will be condemned by the court." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> This resistance makes the reconciliation process is complex and complicated, said Sok Leang. </seg>
<seg id="54"> But the public forums, the textbook and the court to gain influence, "he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> Still, the Khmer Rouge is a powerful attraction. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The cars will be improved with a software in real time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Since Red Bull 2004 invaded the world of Formula 1, is its history in this splendid universe of speed of surprises and successes. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Initially, no one paid the newcomer attention and, despite its rising sharply to gangs during the last seasons, all of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso's victory in the sprint last November. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Without the skills of the pilots and German world champion Sebastian Vettel to belittle or the performance of the Renault engine is the "secret weapon", the multinational Siemens in the hands of Red Bull, and created a winning team, has become a legend. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="6"> In reality, is a powerful software to simulate processes, the German company for purposes that have nothing to do with motor racing in 2007, on the market. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This was described as PLM computer program for the development of assembling chains in factories around the world, energy plants and precise instruments used. </seg>
<seg id="8"> There is a faithful reproduction and / or simulation of a product or process before this will actually be built, so as to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The development of the PLM cameras from Canon, the Sukhoi aircraft and the most famous commercial vehicles for Nissan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial department of Siemens, said that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 Red Bull factory "in a few hours," the changes and improvements to the race almost in real time and can be found in the tests, plan and carry out. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Russwurm contends that in 1992 the teams an average of ten technicians working in a season could introduce a maximum of three or four improvements. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Red Bulls team are highly qualified young people 180. with powerful computer facilities in all kinds of analyses and changes to the cars. </seg>

<seg id="14"> The materials, fuel, alloys and the safety elements will be changed. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The changes, thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclave within less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of the simulators will be transferred to reality. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The only limit to this insane technical perfection is the $40 million, a Formula 1 team can spend on his race in a season. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The director-general of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, dismissed yesterday the possibility that it could be a wave of mergers of banks and building societies and stressed the speed with which the industry will be restructured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> When the concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several savings banks to participate in the first stage, retained the second round. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand, assured the director-general of the Association of Spanish savings banks (CECA), Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round would not take place. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "I believe that the biggest part of the merger is completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the group Banca Cívica cannot be regarded as the second round, it was rather adjustments." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "The biggest part is completed, it may be that we instead of siebzehen 13 or 14, but all major processes have been completed and they have been strongly supported by Banco de España, all transactions, controlled." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Zapatero and the red line in Germany </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin has opted for the keeping of the euro, but at the same time conditions set for the whole of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tension on the markets have sparked a mixed response from the government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has submitted new adaptation measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, regulation of the temporary work company or the removal of the 426 Euro support for the unemployed, no unemployment benefits, and the privatization of 49% from AENA, the management of Barajas airport and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, the deputy head of government, with the help of the former prime minister Felipe González, Elena Salgado, the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel have upheld as responsible for the current crisis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How are these transactions to understand? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their public relations work. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which clashed with the preservation of the ancient traditions of most of its partners. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Given the resistance in Europe is in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis on spekuliern. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South would have to leave the euro area. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The second: the re-introduction of the German mark, although this sounds more like science fiction, currently supported by a majority of public opinion, approximately 50% of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The third: a transformation of the euros in German proposals, which means: more macro-economic control, strict management and punishment of the countries that exceed the targets; possible must reject the default of some countries, as well as the extension of the potential costs of adaptation to the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is clear and has been for quite some time, so there are no excuses now. </seg>
<seg id="15"> By 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission incentives for deficits, and the German government drew up a constitutional reform in order to prevent this from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It was the first sign of the divergence between what Germany was thought necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second message, the central European country, as Merkel's decision to rescue Greece painful, postponed. </seg>
<seg id="18"> This was strongly criticized at the time, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion were totally opposed to the rescue of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally, in the last days of October Merkel anew with a clear position. The agreement calls for a reform of the European Union, in order to facilitate the rescue of a country and at the same time, the private lenders to commit to a part of the cost. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position was interpreted as anti-European, because the Ireland crisis and all the drive. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But their proposal was adopted, if somewhat sweetened, and in the next few months we will be in the reform of the European Union, which is intended to enable these measures from 2013. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It says that everyone, even if it now unpopular measures must be taken from this date the old will no longer be functioning of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In 2013, the year of the birth of a new area, in which the offending countries be severely punished, can be forced to declare insolvency, and in this case, the private sector must take a part of the cost. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows us that we have a strong growth path, with high rates of saving and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improve productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external economic balances. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The alternative, which is based on debt with huge holes in the balance of payments and construction, as it was mentioned by Spain in boom times, simply will not be tolerated. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would do badly, we do not understand. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not just about cutting the deficit down to 3% by 2013. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much harder. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Under these conditions, and the worst thing we could do is deceiving ourselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the current turbulence in more rest. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And we will use the opportunities provided by the spring of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero has managed to do so, and his dual announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) indicates that, despite the criticism of Merkel to establish our own house in order, it has paved the way for the hypothesis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But the red line drawn by Germany is there and it is not just that things would change. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Among the options into account is that we leave the countries with little serious fully gestopften euro area, should not be ruled out. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In that case, Germany, we still say it could have warned us. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Sport and bypass rule </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tricks like Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the desire to avoid a sanction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The two players supposedly launched the Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos (Real Madrid) on 23 November exclusion in the game against Ajax in the Champions League meant that much ink has been spilled, whether it is a unsportliche act or not, and whether both players should be sanctioned by Uefa. </seg>
<seg id="4"> As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before the match (her team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls and the referee showed me the second yellow card. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way, and the Real Madrid would make his group, the two players will next meet Ligaspiel against Auxerre and the mandatory sanctions without tickets to enter the next phase of the game. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Uefa's disciplinary committee finally punished, José Mourinho, the coach of the club with two to play and the players involved with different sums of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow card under these or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more commonly found in the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of the unwritten rules followed, but in this sport. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of the emerging debate about the case, outlined to the fact that a team of Real Madrid football club (in the Anthem could honor and claims and on other occasions had chastised his players for similar incidents) played the main role, and the drama by Mourinho, the episode has added to its long history more than theatralischer and provocative technicians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case, the debate about whether this is not explicitly banned by the statutes behavior is contrary to the principles of the sport, that is, whether these acts constitute a rule infringement. In fact, this approach to the statutes of the sport, but appear to circumvent the sense. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The damage caused to the sports spirit in this matter should be investigated. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect which was not damaged by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the offending players an unjustified benefit from the team, which did not happen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradox of the action of Real Madrid's players is that it does not correspond to what we normally play wrong or bypassing understand, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly taken in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as visible as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players waited and happily accepted the sanction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is what kind of advantage the offending went from the deliberate fouls. </seg>
<seg id="17"> It should be emphasized that the rival has not been placed in a disadvantageous position and played benefits for the game have been erheischt, because the obvious result of this action was that their own team with fewer players to play. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is also a useful strategy for the next game, because the club is not about these players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The benefit is obvious is that the players in the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game to begin. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree of uncertain advantage, because the team could eventually retire. With this approach, the players also receive a sanction and go in the second cycle on maps, because card accumulation with a card less than in the first round exit. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is not clear whether there is a real advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Ultimately, such practices are not against the spirit of sport, which also include strategic decisions in order to gain the maximum benefit from the legislation. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case the players wanted to avoid any penalty (this would really be a clear case of rule evasion), they wanted more choice when they undergo this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They took a strategic decision to avoid a penalty or to flee before her. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Although blur the line between inventiveness and rule is, I believe that it is in this matter is a clear case of inventiveness. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because there are two of exclusions, and because of the way the rule provoked transfer. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The damage that has been inflicted on the principles of the sport by these actions, it is less ethical than aesthetic art. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> To know that this series will be decided by penalty shootout, not worried about it, because he knows his players: "You will never arrive, the penalty shootout to finish in the regular game, but sometimes there is no alternative and we must be prepared in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately we were the fate of a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the strong desire to keep the title already in the hands, which left us something for the final, and we hope that this time it will not happen." </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The government of the Société Quebecer Angus Parallèle, and the company has been invited to participate financially in the takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris, explains with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive bond. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="3"> The developers company Angus and the company Parallèle, a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture for the adoption of the Daniel Langlois, cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent had hoped to regain its role as a cineastischen, do not seem to have what they demanded. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The government has accepted to get involved in this matter, but on their own terms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Instead of the expected donation offers a Quebecer government a loan in less than the value of the initially hoped for a viable solution to create beneficial conditions could, at least according to the sources from the scaremongers entnehmbaren state. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, the Bittgesuch has been revised downwards since the sum again. </seg>

<seg id="11"> In any case, it seems that the premise of the donation to be really been pushed to the side. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Let us remember that the Quebecer owners community of cinema and cinema complex, against a direct state investment to support the adoption of eXcentris revolted, was cited by the argument that the culture minister had no financial aid for real estate projects there, which he had not even other cinemas. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Several other market participants of the two-segment, on the contrary, the substantial economic aid. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Mystery of the complex in Canada lifted </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new lines by WikiLeaks, American diplomats were spread up the mystery about what the United Nations under the inferiority of Canadians feel towards the Americans; they are the feeling of superiority, but with the same blow the latter with Canada open. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Consequently, American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters to the ballot, the Canadian-American relations in the spirit, and they believe that the visit by President Obama would have helped the conservative government to enforce its budget for 2009. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington yesterday publicly disseminated to offer more risqué details than the mere substantial content, which has a very bad outcome. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On 22 September 2008 dating relationship, i.e., the period in which the federal electoral Kampage in full swing was once reported to the point the United Nations is no longer involved in the operations of their political leaders discussed. </seg>
<seg id="6"> To the amazement of David Wilkins, the American ambassador used in Ottawa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Mr Wilkins offers various ways of explaining the situation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "The Canadians are held almost inferiority complex, prompted perhaps the Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of daily life, much more than the United States in this election the buck (as in 1988, when the campaign on the free trade)," he says. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The United Nations, he concludes, "are the proverbial Goliath this election: omnipresent, but potentially threatening, in order to talk about him." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The ambassador understands the "deafening silence" less, since the two countries have close political and economic relations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Logically," he acknowledged, "it should be the ability of a party candidate, and much more of a party leader to lead such a crucial relationship, the voters at the polls as a key factor in the spirit." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The other expression of this sense of importance reads on January 22, 2009, by Terry Breese, business sources in Ottawa, communication, which sent President Barack Obama on his first visit in Ottawa to prepare. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Their mission is to help ensure the continued existence of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget in early February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, due to a recovery of $30 to $40 billion program has been created," describes Breese. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Nowhere he had mentioned that the government had postponed the parliamentary session before Christmas, to prevent the parliament from the coalition were overthrown and related to the continued existence of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed expansion program. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Another, dating from January 2008 and part of the ambassador Wilkins wrote communication agreed Washington of increasingly negative image that the CBC Broadcast, dramatic series in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The ambassador is concerned about programs such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" or payments for the purposes of CIA interrogations carried out by Muskelprotze can see. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Yet another communication reported extensively about how Hillary Clinton with her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner during their first bilateral meeting then asked whether Europe was willing to incorporate certain prisoners from Guantanamo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Mr Kouchner should have answered yes to the question, but on the basis of an individual decision "on a case-by-case basis". </seg>
<seg id="19"> Àm end of the meeting, the secretary of state, "he described a paper issued in terms of Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim Canadian origin." </seg>
<seg id="20"> "The Secretary of State has promised to act again to see." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Finally, we realize that, in the forefront of people's minds on the WikiLeaks website. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper, advisers, was very closely on CBC said that those responsible for this massive leak "should be killed." </seg>
<seg id="23"> He was here to Mike Huckabee reported from the United States. </seg>

<seg id="5"> The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In Copenhagen last year had the major gas emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans, which should lower the global GT GT CFC emissions from 53 to 49. </seg>

<seg id="15"> Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent pears reserves, because they contain mercury and that it is as hazardous waste in developing countries, which is not always possible, but the producers are an adoption is available. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, is not the compact fluorescent pear, but the coal-fired power plants, which emit mercury, much more aware of the fervent pears waste to generate electricity. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The coal-fired power stations in the United States alone have 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually. </seg>

<seg id="3"> All this under the close eye of the diplomats of the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The documents obtained by WikiLeaks and the newspaper Le Monde by American diet give some background to this crisis. </seg>

<seg id="8"> The rule that the secret dossiers already known only from news must insist, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go into a library, the esotherischen publications, you will see that each work (on the grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) repeatedly exactly what already has been written in previous works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is not only so that the author of occult texts will not publish research (so that he would not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to the Okkultismus, nothing other than to believe what you already know and confirmed what they have learned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the success of Dan Brown's mechanism. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Also, the secret files. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informant is lazy, lazy or limited (Spirit) is also the head of the Secret Service (otherwise be whatever he could, for example, editor of Libération), which recognizes only what he regarded as true. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The top-secret information on Berlusconi, the American embassy in Rome had sent the State squad were the same as those that Newsweek had already published the previous week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> So why was such a fuss about the revelation of this dossier? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On one side, which stipulate that every educated person already know, and that the embassies, at least since the end of the second world war, and since then the heads of government will also be able to call each other or an airplane, in order to meet dinner-have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small representation tasks have turned into espionage centers. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Any viewer from identifying films knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that you pretend to ignore this. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Nevertheless, the fact that it violated public to repeat the task of hypocrisy and serves to American diplomacy in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> My second point: the idea that an X-any hackers geheimsten secrets can tap into the most powerful country in the world, is a major blow to the prestige of the state Dezernats. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Moreover, the scandal rather than the victims, "the executioner" in trouble. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we have to address the profound nature of what happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Previously, Orwell's time, it was all power as a big brother pool, every gesture controlled his subjects. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwell's prophecy could have since proved to be quite right, where every movement you can monitor the telephone made, every transaction, visited the hotel, the elected motorway and so on; the citizens would be the total victims of the eye of the power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Bearing in mind what is happening today, however, that even the secret Krypten power can no longer escape the control of hackers, so does the control order to be unilaterally directed and will circle shaped. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power control every citizen, but everyone, or at least the hacker acquired experience as the vindicator of the citizen, the secrets of power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> But how can a power that is no longer in a position to maintain their own secrets? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is true, Georg Simmel said that a real secret is an open secret (and an empty can never be revealed secret); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi or Merkel's basically free from Geheimis is a mystery, because it exposes the public sphere; but the styles of WikiLeaks reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty secrets, means that they have no power to deprive. </seg>
<seg id="28"> WikiLeaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wronged but Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What are the consequences of this affront to be such a great power has been done? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the States will make no more reserved information online in the future-that would be a angeklebten posting on the street corner. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is equally obvious that the current technology is to be hoped in vain to keep secret, confidential reports on telephone. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is easier than finding out whether and when a head of state in a plane moving and has been in contact with one of his colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could in future be private and only for certain ears maintain relations? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know very well that my prediction at the moment, science fiction and Roman prison sounds, but I am compelled to imagine the government agents in secret active way to uncontrollable March routes moving, their communications anywhere else than in a mere memory, and, in addition to the few written information you have, shoe (verbergend. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information would be stored in single copy in closed drawers: basically, the espionage attempt by Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity to write that the technology today as a cancer progresses, namely backwards. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A century after the wireless telecommunications Graf had revolutionized the communication, reconstructed the Internet a Telegraph with (telephone) wire. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The video (analog) had the film band for researchers, a Band auszukundschaften from the back forward spulen and all could reveal secrets of the installation, while the (digital) CDs now allow nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter in macro-portions. </seg>
<seg id="39"> With the high-speed trains traveling within three hours by plane from Rome to Milan, while including the switching requires three and a half hours. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It is not extraordinary that, policy and communications technology in cars and horse to come back. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> One final observation. </seg>
<seg id="42"> In earlier times tried to understand what the press for secrets between the embassies were forged. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Currently, there are the messages that confidential information from the press. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Climate: France as its financial promises good talks </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A year after the Copenhagen treaty quickly resolved, it is time to comply with the financial promises to investigate (also known as "fast-start" funding or premature) of the developing countries, which have been implemented. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The rough French blandishments are already exposed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With the Copenhagen treaty, developing countries have committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The EU promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France has 1.26 billion euros (i.e., 420 million per year). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> At the opening of the COP16, the EU has pulled out all the stops to its partners from the fact their commitment to fast-start funding to convince: detail faithful will report its member states, major press conference alongside events, distribution of leaflets. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The operation transparency is remarkable and grade for their valued: the developing countries and civil society would like to see all the developed countries did the same at the same level of precision. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The EU announced that EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, which we have released them in the right way to respect Bezollung dedication of 7.2 billion in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But if you look into the details, things are a little more complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should be according to the Copenhagen treaty be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional deployment was introduced, to the detriment of public aid for development. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what the "new and additional" means. </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the EU Commission had proposed a harmonization, certain member states, including France, have blocked the process. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today everyone elects the benchmark, which he considers the best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The EU Commission, for example, serve as a guideline for those of 2009: the international funding will be maintained, and are within the framework of the "fast start" funding over three years to 150 million. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries have similar standards, either on year or about conditions at the level of official development assistance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In return, France was of the opinion that the financing "of new projects" of 2010 were "new and additional". </seg>
<seg id="17"> In other words, there are no guidelines on the spending of the previous year, or at the global level of official development assistance. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Specifically, the total amount of French aid to the developing countries remain stable (or decrease)-France is to comply with its commitment to the "new and additional" funding. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another key element is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is no rule, and yet each elects its calculation method. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, such as France, are 1 borrowed €donated the equivalent of €1. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Obviously, this is hard to believe that the effort is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loans for certain types of profitable investment (often linked to emissions reduction projects to maximum effect technology based) can be justified, it is wrong to present the euro, it donated the equivalent of a euro captured... only the cost of the loan for capital donor should also be counted as commitment (i.e. the equivalent of the interest rate). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France is not in a different way than the following observation: it "respects" his commitment of EUR 420 million (EUR 389.8 million) loans, by 91.5% and 8.5% donates EUR 36.1 million)-see the EU document, in order to convince themselves. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only country in the EU that loans to a great extent. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) to 100% of their obligations with donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union is spending €1 to meet their commitments, France just 10 cents and understood a similar commitment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Beautiful hocus-pocus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> In all, operates France in its fast-start financing with a double deception: one part to another Twicklkung the action over time and partly with the reality of the financial commitment. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France, manages to believe that "new and additional" 420 million it has spent millions in accordance with its pledge and saves that 36.1 million euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the Treasury (because it seems that it was Bercy, has carried out the arbitrage) could lead to a double negative impact, even EU internally (why are the other members states with the donations continue to lend if there are enough?) and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries are not completely fooled... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter on premature funding only a small question of relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions on the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it could be the drop too much in the vast machinery of the UNFCCC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> We hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Still, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year premature financing. </seg>
<seg id="36"> First, France could announce a change in its accounting method for the years 2011 and 2012, and in a spirit of respect for his commitments and the redistributive justice with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> But France, above all the discussions on the dispute in the long-term financing to move forward (and another key topic at the moment): you can escape the question of "Verrechenbarkeit" or the recording nature of his loans. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could alter its position in order to be as advanced in terms of the issues, as it is in other areas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The hope is also on the new environment minister, Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive next week in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A surprising announcement on the fast-start France and its vision of "Verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loans would increase by nature, the International Trust, which is necessary for further discussions. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The teller record is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as possibly or probably carcinogenic and five as safe karziogen classified, as well as 37 substances with Endokrinin-glitch, according to studies of various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "Even if the virtually all the cases will not exceed the legal limits for any chemical substance taken individually, we remove this survey are very good that the reality of the consumer possibly carcinogenic substances or substances with Endokrinin-glitch is suspended, is worrying," said the association. </seg>
