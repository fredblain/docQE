Ogoniland is burned 
The water in the rivers is ölbraun, it looks like at the pump: billion liters of crude oil spills have destroyed the natural in Ogoniland in Nigeria. 
The lives of theft, corruption and illegal Ölkochen. 
Celestine Akpobari means well. 
"Do not haunt you," reassured the eco-activist the journalists: "You'll still enough oil slicks in the lens wars." 
The 37-year-old Nigerians has pursued the attempt, one to the chest in water watenden young with the surrounding Schlieren abzulichten: the rainbow colored water Glanz, the scene almost nicely. 
Brown crude oil plumes hanging below the surface that is not to see. 
In the past have a bucket, shrimp, told Esther Badom on the shores of the Bodo jetty-river. 
Meanwhile, the slow flowing waters completely dead. 
Five years ago poured from a geborstenen pipeline tons crude oil in the vast wetland. 
Fishermen from the nearby town Bodo now have six hours to reach fish containing waters: rowing the Ogoniland is situated in the heart of the Niger Delta as one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world. 
On the journey through the mangrove swamps criss-crossed by river basins, the apparent scale of the devastation. 
The motor boat wühlt water instead of bright brown soup who breaks his hand into the water, ölige Finger. 
The roots of mangrove nurture outstanding as black liquorice cartons from the soil, sad, palm trees occasionally hold their Wedel. 
Swarms of birds in wetlands, as usual, one looks in vain: as soon as the external border quiet, is spreading in the former as a station smelling paradise haunts rest. 
"What happens is environmental warfare," says Celestine Akpobari dark: "We live in constant danger to health." 
The war is appropriate comparison. 
The Ogoni area of settlement is a controversial battlefield for decades, came here more than 60 years ago, the first Explora expensive here from Europe, organized in the 1980s, with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, the first opposition in the shell-had to stop its production in 1993, because it was too dangerous for the oil workers. 
Even today the company is allowed to return to Ogoniland, while across the delta region of the three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 drilling sources and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines being pumped more than two million barrels a day of black gold, the oilfields in the Ogoniland, the situation is too unstable the company. 
Every few hundred meters Ragen steel Gestelle as bizarre sculptures from the water, "Christian" nurture, much to the heads of the boreholes zärtlich. 
They are up to 50 years old, most to mark had corroded. 
Always stop such a Bohrkopf, says Akpobari, Rinne a constant flow of crude oil into the water. 
Experts estimate that there are more than two billion liters in 50 years: every year, the quantity of oil were spilled into the ecosystem of the Delta, in the sinking of the super-tanker Exxon Valdez in Alaska drive into the sea "21 years ago, one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind. 
Who is to blame for the ongoing eco-gau, it will be argued. 
While the shell-sabotage and organized Öldiebstahl responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see berstende Bohrköpfe and leaky pipelines as the main culprit. 
Shell in Nigeria is much lower than usual safety standards in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner accused the group in 2008, only the rate of defects in the pipelines was "much higher than elsewhere." 
In a place that looks like a deserted, open-air garage oil from afar, diving from the mangroves to make: they are splitter and naked ölverschmiert up to our necks. 
In one of the many barrels, some with tubes, some are scattered on the site to identify, arbitrarily flackert a fire: an illegal small refinery. 
The barrels crude oil on the fire several hours of heated, said Michael, the head of the group. 
First get petrol through the pipes in the reception pot, then spits at the end of the pipeline, kerosene and diesel. 
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel daily à 300 liters: "This brings us $34,000 a" around 22 naira. 
The Delta residents use the chronic fuel shortages in the sub-Saharan Africa's largest oil state. 
Nigeria has only one refinery. 
With nearly 40 euro cents per liter ridiculously low diesel price can still undercut the illegal Kocher: because their raw material they have been in vain. 
It comes from "Bunkerern", the pipeline network across Ogoniland on tap: in this way, according to experts in the whole of the Niger Delta, the country lost at least 16 million liters of crude oil a day. 
Only a tiny part of the provisionally between raw material will be stored illegally processed: fill the lion's share of organized criminal networks, which also includes politicians and senior military officers to tankers and command it on the world market. 
The debate about whether the environmental disaster more or lax production is due to the activities of the people, the activist Akpobari for purely academic. 
"The oil companies would not be perceived as intrusive and they were not as thoroughly destroyed the livelihoods of fishermen, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries." 
Meanwhile, the ratio of the Ogoni especially shell but so destroyed that only a withdrawal of the company's question would be: "perhaps there are other nationalities as the Chinese proved to be better." 
There is Michael nervous. 
"High time that it is disappearing," says the muskulöse put. 
"Every minute, the soldiers can come." 
The illegal Ölveredler from the special unit of the armed forces, but they are not arrest caught a painful bribes. 
The first soldiers from the north, as all Nigerians, want to benefit from the commodity. 
"This damn stuff has brought our country in every respect to the dog," says Akpobari.
