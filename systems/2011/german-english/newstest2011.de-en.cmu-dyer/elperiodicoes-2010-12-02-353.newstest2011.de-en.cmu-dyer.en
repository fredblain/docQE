Zapatero and the red line in Germany 
Berlin has opted for the keeping of the euro, but at the same time conditions set for the whole of the European Union. 
The tension on the markets have sparked a mixed response from the government. 
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has submitted new adaptation measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, regulation of the temporary work company or the removal of the 426 Euro support for the unemployed, no unemployment benefits, and the privatization of 49% from AENA, the management of Barajas airport and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery. 
On the other hand, the deputy head of government, with the help of the former prime minister Felipe González, Elena Salgado, the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel have upheld as responsible for the current crisis. 
How are these transactions to understand? 
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their public relations work. 
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro. 
Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which clashed with the preservation of the ancient traditions of most of its partners. 
Given the resistance in Europe is in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis on spekuliern. 
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South would have to leave the euro area. 
The second: the re-introduction of the German mark, although this sounds more like science fiction, currently supported by a majority of public opinion, approximately 50% of the population. 
The third: a transformation of the euros in German proposals, which means: more macro-economic control, strict management and punishment of the countries that exceed the targets; possible must reject the default of some countries, as well as the extension of the potential costs of adaptation to the private sector. 
The German position is clear and has been for quite some time, so there are no excuses now. 
By 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission incentives for deficits, and the German government drew up a constitutional reform in order to prevent this from 2016. 
It was the first sign of the divergence between what Germany was thought necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. 
The second message, the central European country, as Merkel's decision to rescue Greece painful, postponed. 
This was strongly criticized at the time, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion were totally opposed to the rescue of Greece. 
Finally, in the last days of October Merkel anew with a clear position. The agreement calls for a reform of the European Union, in order to facilitate the rescue of a country and at the same time, the private lenders to commit to a part of the cost. 
This position was interpreted as anti-European, because the Ireland crisis and all the drive. 
But their proposal was adopted, if somewhat sweetened, and in the next few months we will be in the reform of the European Union, which is intended to enable these measures from 2013. 
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross. 
It says that everyone, even if it now unpopular measures must be taken from this date the old will no longer be functioning of the euro. 
In 2013, the year of the birth of a new area, in which the offending countries be severely punished, can be forced to declare insolvency, and in this case, the private sector must take a part of the cost. 
Germany shows us that we have a strong growth path, with high rates of saving and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improve productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external economic balances. 
The alternative, which is based on debt with huge holes in the balance of payments and construction, as it was mentioned by Spain in boom times, simply will not be tolerated. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would do badly, we do not understand. 
It is not just about cutting the deficit down to 3% by 2013. 
The demands are much harder. 
Under these conditions, and the worst thing we could do is deceiving ourselves. 
I hope that the current turbulence in more rest. 
And we will use the opportunities provided by the spring of 2013. 
It seems that Zapatero has managed to do so, and his dual announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) indicates that, despite the criticism of Merkel to establish our own house in order, it has paved the way for the hypothesis. 
But the red line drawn by Germany is there and it is not just that things would change. 
Among the options into account is that we leave the countries with little serious fully gestopften euro area, should not be ruled out. 
In that case, Germany, we still say it could have warned us.
