The leaders of the old Pflegeheims La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday, in which they found the damage the criminal acts of nurses, the Joan Vila Dilmés during his work at least 11 old people, for which he was responsible, had killed the establishment had caused. 
The head of the old Pflegeheims, Joan Sala, was accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, court and announced that "La Caritat would indict those responsible (for the deaths)," but the "right and our liability compel us to accept the process and civil liability." 
The establishment is not only a social image lose, because they had not found the criminal acts of Pflegers, but is now also a large sum of compensation figures by the legal representatives of the families of the victims will be calculated. 
Joan Vila Dilmé acknowledged that the first crime goes back to August 2009, and that he has since been further killings. 
The judge ordered the exhumation of bodies of eight former patients of the old Pflegeheims-because he suspected that a doctor who died had personally investigated the formalities, but because of their age and disease by telephone.

In La Caritat if you do not believe the statements of the Pflegers, even as the number of mature murders, which could be more. This attitude is justified that Vila very different statements in court and that it had made no sense to his approach after eight successful murders suddenly change. 
They say that it was for this reason, it is available to these incidents and to clarify the reach of justice.
