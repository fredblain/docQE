Police in China will be smooth 
As a training officer step Tang Shenbin on a city square, reviewed his nervous subordinates and gave the military authority and more muted voice commands. 
He wanted to see his female members of the Chengguan's robust guards of urban planning, feared and despised for their indiscriminate raids and propensity for violence, impressed the spectators. 
"It will be!" 
"Look straight ahead." 
"Shows you," he whispered to them, "how beautiful girls so!" 
Four girls, hardly the teenage age has outgrown, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and trousers, stood ramrod straight. 
Four pairs of black pumps were in gerader series. 
Four proper hats were perfect on the blue-and-white striped ribbons held hair. 
"You see average from for me," said Mr Tang condescendingly. 
"Models are beautiful." 
Several governments have tried to burnish the image of China's city inspectors. 
In a city all new applicants must have a university degree. 
The Guangdong province, instead of the gray greens a leuchtend blue uniform. 
Wuhan in central China replaced violence down rigid: 2009 skittered on reports that 50 officials for not properly established Imbiss cars and gaze at the operator, until this einpackte after half an hour and left the room. 
Xindu district in Chengdu, a city with a population of 680,000, would fundamentally change the image. 
Since 2003, up 13 women police patrols in urban areas, they were special because of their appearance, their good character and their youth selected. 
They should give the police a softer crude, feminine aspect. 
Unfortunately, there would also be Scarlett Johansson barely able to these urban commandos of the bad image that the Chinese have to improve. 
By law, so the critics. 
Unlike the police, these officials must implement the urban laws only through fines or other administrative penalties. 
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture. 
In January 2008, when it beat officials in Hubei province a bystander to death with his mobile phone while filming, as a protest against the proposed dump. 
Last year a training manual of Beijing officials have been stolen and published on the Internet, described how criminals without bloodshed can be beaten. 
This year a Shanghai water melons traders suffered brain injuries after a fight with five officials. 
More violence strotzendes video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows in China trained officials in an attack on hawkers. 
"Chengguan lamentierte frightens the government," the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy about the tactics. 
The newspaper called for a "really thorough cleaning." 
Skeptics are the current approach is clearly inadequate. 
When the Distrik in October by reporting eight female recruits sought, was an editorial in the Beijing Evening News, the question of whether the women had real tasks or serve as optical distraction. 
Probably both. 
According to the complaint, were women between the ages of 18 to 22, with good figure and "harmonious face trains". 
They should be above-average major-about 1,5m or 5 feet, 2 1 / 2 inches. 
The employment relationship ends with the 26-year life. 
According to the official, the activities for women over 25 to physically demanding. 
"The most important thing is your image," was a unbenannter district official with the quasi-governmental website Rednet.com. 
"Whether the candidates get the job, first depends on their appearance, such as height, weight, face, etc." 
Then temperaments and "internal qualities." 
"Female chengguan are as vases of flowers," he said, and added, "but they also have other duties." 
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the city administration of the district, would disagree with this description. 
In China, but that size requirements, advertisements for both sexes are not unusual. 
The same is true for equal face. 
Whether it is synonymous with good looks, is controversial in China. 
But people with disabilities or physical changes need not apply. 
"Unfortunately, we can not lame or Buckligen use," Mr Zheng. 
"Your image would not be good." 
Liu Yi, the Baoguang square near a monastery patroliert, 22, has Apple BäCkchen and a well-formed mouths. 
They are not sexist empfindetes that so much emphasis is placed on their appearance. 
"You will find, I see in this uniform sexy?" asks them with ironically Blick. 
Her colleague with Grübchen, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have a duty to represent the image of the city." 
According to her, they regret the short end, not because they had more ambitious career plans, than simply traders scheuchen through the streets to prevent them from doing business. 
Every morning the remarks is dealing with around 12 hawkers who try to walk or bicycle to as many people as possible to sell rolls and tofu courts before they are fortgejagt. 
"Mr Wang, please go here." 
"We have already said so often," said Frl. Xu a trader, who fled on foot, was on a bicycle Karre fortified Nudel and his kitchen had temporarily abandoned. 
According to the officials, the monotonous rather than hard work. 
"It is almost the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying in the leisure distribution system. 
"Everything routine." 
One reason is that the female officials, as their male colleagues, the traders were not allowed to confiscate. 
You can only criminals to threaten to declare her male superiors. 
This is to protect them against public hostility, which officials in China often are exposed. 
This year hundreds of people rioted in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, after a rumor circulated, Chengguan officers have killed a dealer. 
More than a dozen Chenguan and police officials were injured in the late-night incident, 14 government vehicles were set on fire or upset. 
Xindu of such violent incidents had been spared. 
But unrest has not been ruled out. 
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female patroulierten officials this morning, about 50 people gathered on a street corner. 
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that contrary to the rules on the pavement rather than in a garage was repaired.

After 15 minütigem hesitation gave officials with cruel face the way to their cars and drove with the motorcycle and its owner continued. 
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male remarks left back, while focusing his white name shield in order to remain anonymous. 
As her colleagues, the coordinators-men over 40-a mere supporting role. 
But they were not trained to present a clean image. 
"Sometimes we are verbal." 
"Sometimes but also physically," says Mr Li soberly. 
"Most of the time people are starting with the dispute."
