Mystery of the complex in Canada lifted 
The new lines by WikiLeaks, American diplomats were spread up the mystery about what the United Nations under the inferiority of Canadians feel towards the Americans; they are the feeling of superiority, but with the same blow the latter with Canada open. 
Consequently, American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters to the ballot, the Canadian-American relations in the spirit, and they believe that the visit by President Obama would have helped the conservative government to enforce its budget for 2009. 
The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington yesterday publicly disseminated to offer more risqué details than the mere substantial content, which has a very bad outcome. 
On 22 September 2008 dating relationship, i.e., the period in which the federal electoral Kampage in full swing was once reported to the point the United Nations is no longer involved in the operations of their political leaders discussed. 
To the amazement of David Wilkins, the American ambassador used in Ottawa. 
Mr Wilkins offers various ways of explaining the situation. 
"The Canadians are held almost inferiority complex, prompted perhaps the Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of daily life, much more than the United States in this election the buck (as in 1988, when the campaign on the free trade)," he says. 
The United Nations, he concludes, "are the proverbial Goliath this election: omnipresent, but potentially threatening, in order to talk about him." 
The ambassador understands the "deafening silence" less, since the two countries have close political and economic relations. 
"Logically," he acknowledged, "it should be the ability of a party candidate, and much more of a party leader to lead such a crucial relationship, the voters at the polls as a key factor in the spirit." 
The other expression of this sense of importance reads on January 22, 2009, by Terry Breese, business sources in Ottawa, communication, which sent President Barack Obama on his first visit in Ottawa to prepare. 
"Their mission is to help ensure the continued existence of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget in early February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, due to a recovery of $30 to $40 billion program has been created," describes Breese. 
Nowhere he had mentioned that the government had postponed the parliamentary session before Christmas, to prevent the parliament from the coalition were overthrown and related to the continued existence of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed expansion program. 
Another, dating from January 2008 and part of the ambassador Wilkins wrote communication agreed Washington of increasingly negative image that the CBC Broadcast, dramatic series in the United States. 
The ambassador is concerned about programs such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" or payments for the purposes of CIA interrogations carried out by Muskelprotze can see. 
Yet another communication reported extensively about how Hillary Clinton with her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner during their first bilateral meeting then asked whether Europe was willing to incorporate certain prisoners from Guantanamo. 
Mr Kouchner should have answered yes to the question, but on the basis of an individual decision "on a case-by-case basis". 
Àm end of the meeting, the secretary of state, "he described a paper issued in terms of Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim Canadian origin." 
"The Secretary of State has promised to act again to see." 
Finally, we realize that, in the forefront of people's minds on the WikiLeaks website. 
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper, advisers, was very closely on CBC said that those responsible for this massive leak "should be killed." 
He was here to Mike Huckabee reported from the United States.
