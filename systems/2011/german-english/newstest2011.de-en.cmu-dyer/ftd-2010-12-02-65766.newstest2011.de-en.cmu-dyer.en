Obama stop new oil drilling 
Off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the next few years there will be no new drilling. 
A similar ban in Washington, and their previous plans, the government has finally revoked. 
New drilling off the Atlantic coast remain for the time being. 
It said Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday. 
The catalyst for the strict ban should apply, at least for the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform "in April. 
Before the accident, which claimed the lives of 11 workers and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama is under pressure from the opposition and the industry had signaled its willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico. 
Advocates want to reduce the US dependence on oil from abroad. 
Who was responsible for the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf, has not yet been finally settled. 
In the center of the criticism, the British energy company BP, are faced with billions. 
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama during the December to submit their results. 
In October, Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban imposed after the explosion. 
Following various oil companies were immediately applications for new drilling projects. 
With stricter inspections and more stringent safety rules to exclude Obama and Salazar a new disaster. 
Currently, the competent supervisory authority, after numerous allegations of corruption in disrepute, has radically reformed. 
At the same time, Obama has announced lucrative to close tax loopholes for the oil and gas companies. 
The industry now publicly warning that the output in the Gulf by a stricter regulation would be significantly lower than in the past. 
"The government's plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the oil and gas industry" is the result of a recent industry survey by consultant BDO before the drilling ban on Wednesday. 
The American Energy Alliance also complained about the uncertainty in the industry: "nobody knows what the regulation that will change." 
Investment in new projects would be postponed until further notice, at the expense of growth.
