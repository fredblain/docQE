The trail of stones 
Uli Gsell has also the concerned, a total of about 400 kg. 
On Monday evening, he was told the station in Stuttgart tuba on the back. 
It was demo. 
It snowed heavily. 
The story is well known: in September, the excavators angerückt and had started to cut a big slice of the north wing. 
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the station's Tieferlegung billions. 
When it came to freeze, a large part of the wing was in ruins. 
Shattered pieces of 6,000 to 7,000. 
Crailsheimer shell, a soft gross stone blocks between 1914 and 1920. 
Gsell sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old. 
He has secured a few scraps. 
"These stones are Reliquien." 
"They should not disappear." 
He fantasize: "a cheap and poor stone, simple and Earth." 
When he took a aufsägte, gerochen of cigarette smoke. 
He does not know what he will do with the headache. 
Stones have time. 
Uli Gsell. 
The trail of Stuttgart stones, resulting in a forest in Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen stone-rich has built. 
The 44-year-old, with old stones. 
He has bought all the demolition in Stuttgart fell. 
"It would be a shame to dirt that they would finally or disappear into the landfill," he says in his office, a wood BüDchen, which was once an excited awake. 
It was insulted and threatened him, he tells in September in the newspapers was that he bought the remnants of the north wing of the demolition entrepreneur. 
But he did talk to the S-21 opponents, for several days. 
And he has told them that he could but now nothing for the demolition. 
And if it is, then it is the most sensible, however, if the stones were used. 
Some 200 opponents of the S-21 took an average of 80 kilos heavy Quader, with little price 6.50 to 14 euros. 
As a memory, but also in the hope of being able to go back to him on a reconstruction. 
500 tonnes, Rongen, bought 25 large truckloads. 
About half stored in the forest, and the rest has been sold. 
Garden owners, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer. 
Wherever you are and have been towed away, boot and supporters could bear. 
The Stuttgart stones of the scandal have been turned into "Mäuerle" or limitations of herbs Beeten. 
"This really is nothing special," says Stone Rongen. 
"Would not be the political component." 
He increased his SUV, a tour through its 20 hectares of great empire. 
He studied law and later abandoned, biology, then he is interested in computers and finally Stein traders. 
And stone lovers. 
He stored 40000 tons of stones. 
For all of Germany karrt his treasures. 
He says that he is the biggest old stone dealers of the Republic. 
He slows down. 
The snow are artfully behauene sand bricks. 
"They were once the Dresden Marie bridge," he said. 
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he fantasize. 
"My favorite stone." 
It is the path through the forest. 
It shows a bunch: red sand, formerly part of the Karlsruhe train station. 
And further. 
"Beautiful Travertin." 
Once the Quader were part of the gallery of the Neckar Stadium in Stuttgart. 
Across the snow, stones and stories Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart police bureau, St Blasien, Tuff rötlicher granite from the Cathedral of the Heilbronner hospital. 
The work, the effort, the sweat. 
If Rongen thinks, as the stones used by hand and swindled with simple bottles trains and ox carts were moved, it will be quite reverential. 
"It would be a scandal if it would be a schreddern." 
He is not rich, certainly not very rich. 
But 14 people working in the stone dealers today, moreover, the top of the forest Steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a Glasbläser and horticulturalists settled. 
"We work hard, but it is satisfactory," says the debris exploiters. 
He must soon to Cologne. 
There are also obstacles to save.
