Sport and bypass rule 
Tricks like Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the desire to avoid a sanction. 
The two players supposedly launched the Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos (Real Madrid) on 23 November exclusion in the game against Ajax in the Champions League meant that much ink has been spilled, whether it is a unsportliche act or not, and whether both players should be sanctioned by Uefa. 
As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before the match (her team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls and the referee showed me the second yellow card. 
In this way, and the Real Madrid would make his group, the two players will next meet Ligaspiel against Auxerre and the mandatory sanctions without tickets to enter the next phase of the game. 
Uefa's disciplinary committee finally punished, Jos√© Mourinho, the coach of the club with two to play and the players involved with different sums of money. 
The provocation of a yellow card under these or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more commonly found in the world of football. 
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of the unwritten rules followed, but in this sport. 
Part of the emerging debate about the case, outlined to the fact that a team of Real Madrid football club (in the Anthem could honor and claims and on other occasions had chastised his players for similar incidents) played the main role, and the drama by Mourinho, the episode has added to its long history more than theatralischer and provocative technicians. 
In any case, the debate about whether this is not explicitly banned by the statutes behavior is contrary to the principles of the sport, that is, whether these acts constitute a rule infringement. In fact, this approach to the statutes of the sport, but appear to circumvent the sense. 
The damage caused to the sports spirit in this matter should be investigated. 
The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect which was not damaged by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game. 
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the offending players an unjustified benefit from the team, which did not happen. 
The paradox of the action of Real Madrid's players is that it does not correspond to what we normally play wrong or bypassing understand, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly taken in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as visible as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. 
The players waited and happily accepted the sanction. 
Another question is what kind of advantage the offending went from the deliberate fouls. 
It should be emphasized that the rival has not been placed in a disadvantageous position and played benefits for the game have been erheischt, because the obvious result of this action was that their own team with fewer players to play. 
It is also a useful strategy for the next game, because the club is not about these players. 
The benefit is obvious is that the players in the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game to begin. 
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree of uncertain advantage, because the team could eventually retire. With this approach, the players also receive a sanction and go in the second cycle on maps, because card accumulation with a card less than in the first round exit. 
It is not clear whether there is a real advantage. 
Ultimately, such practices are not against the spirit of sport, which also include strategic decisions in order to gain the maximum benefit from the legislation. 
In this case the players wanted to avoid any penalty (this would really be a clear case of rule evasion), they wanted more choice when they undergo this. 
They took a strategic decision to avoid a penalty or to flee before her. 
Although blur the line between inventiveness and rule is, I believe that it is in this matter is a clear case of inventiveness. 
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because there are two of exclusions, and because of the way the rule provoked transfer. 
The damage that has been inflicted on the principles of the sport by these actions, it is less ethical than aesthetic art.
