The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis. 
Thanks to his ambition has far met the worst behind it. 
The price of the first rank of competition Vodafone company of the year last year, Karel Žďárský, the companies hold far met. 
The jury acknowledged the efforts with which he was from the small Česká Werkzeugbau Skalice improvised out of the ground, a company that makes hundreds of millions of sales. 
"I can say that this is a recognition that not only myself, but also encouraged all my staff and our confidence in the fight with the competition has encouraged," says of last year's winners. 
At the beginning of the corporate history of far met was the effort to do something useful. 
And the state when his father Karel Žďárský as compensation for property seized by the Communists in a small workshop offered to lease, he did not hesitate for long, left his career in the company, in which he was until then, and ditch his father with a few comrades founded his own company for the manufacture of plastic tubs. 
A short time later they began to concentrate on vegetable oil presses.

A viable company must sometimes such unpopular measures. 
However, it managed to get the situation under control and the company in the black figures to keep winning, even if less than before the crisis. 
The company was not prepared to make cuts in the investment in research and development. 
"From the grant we built a research and training center, we encouraged our presentation at International Fairs and main prices for domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský. 
Everything indicates that we have overcome the crisis.
