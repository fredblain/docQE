Amazon blocking server - threats against Assange 
WikiLeaks is increasingly in trouble. 
The internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers. 
Perhaps behind political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic diplomatic cables. 
Assange WikiLeaks founder is supposedly in England. 
The WikiLeaks disclosure platform in the United States is increasingly under attack. 
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now seeking an Internet home in Europe. 
A prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman, meanwhile, called on other countries and companies to boycott of WikiLeaks. 
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, the tracking lists of Interpol, is residing in Britain, according to a newspaper report. 
"WikiLeaks of Amazon server." 
"Free speech in the land of the free," shared the Enth√ºllungs activists by text messaging service Twitter (local time) on Wednesday. 
Shortly before the Internet company Amazon had consigned the WikiLeaks documents from its servers. 
The Internet activists in the publication of secret diplomatic diplomatic cables had resorted to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) in order to be able to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents. 
By Twitter said WikiLeaks to step further: "Prima-our dollars are spent to employ people in Europe." 
If Amazon have this problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop to sell books." 
Amazon, the use of its servers by WikiLeaks stopped after staff of Senator Joe Lieberman have made inquiries, the CNN television channel reported, citing the office of the mans. 
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security, Amazon had threatened to boycott, the British newspaper reported. 
"I would have liked that Amazon this measure was taken in light of the previous publications classified information by WikiLeaks," said the senator. 
Lieberman, meanwhile, called on the platform, to deny the use of servers in other countries. 
"WikiLeaks' illegal, hideous and thuggery jeopardizes our national security and endangering lives around the globe," the non-party senator, in a statement. 
"No responsible companies, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks in its efforts to disseminate stolen material." 
Assange WikiLeaks founder, who is being sought by the authorities in Sweden, is suspected of rape on the Interpol list of investigations. 
According to a report by the London newspaper The Independent in Britain, "the 39-year-old Australian is the exact place Scotland Yard was known. 
The Internet activist, the investigations in Sweden has set as his opponents. 
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson in London, said there had been threats. 
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange." 
That is why Assange rightly fear for his safety, said Hrafnsson. 
The WikiLeaks founder will therefore continue to hide. 
Hrafnsson apparently reacted to comments from North America. 
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations should be charged with treason and executed. 
In Canada, obviously ironic, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on television, "Assange should be killed" and Obama could "use of a drone." 
Between the White House and Assange has meanwhile been exchanged. 
The US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had called for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, if it is responsible for recently leaked spy invitations to diplomats. 
"I am not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a type with a website," Gibbs said. 
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than a website." 
The American government is the protection of their data banks fully to the test. 
As a special envoy, the vice-director of the Center for anti-terrorism measures, Russell Travers, was appointed, the White House said. 
Travers was responsible for the "necessary structural reforms" to develop the message of the disclosure of the reports by WikiLeaks have become necessary. 
The White House will also check the ways how the whole government, exchanging information and safeguards. 
The American government also announced that for the safety of dissidents and activists want to worry, they should be by the WikiLeaks publication in jeopardy. 
"We have done everything to come in contact with them," said their spokesman Philip Crowley. 
"We are ready to protect them if it should be necessary."
