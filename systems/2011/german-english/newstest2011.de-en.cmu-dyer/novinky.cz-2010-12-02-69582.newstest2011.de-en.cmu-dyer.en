Czech children are drunk with Fernet and rum, beer is out, it is simply too slow 
Fernet, Rum and vodka, once again a good whiskey, the man's father has stolen from the Hausbar. 
These are the drinks, which benefit most drunken Czech teenager under 15 should not be dealt with. 
Children are no exception, which repeated its hangover to ausschlafen in hospital. 
This is from the experiences of doctors, the inclusion of children's departments of the hospitals are faced with similar cases. 
"Beer and wine are completely out of fashion because it is simply too long before you get drunk." 
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief doctor of the children department in central bohemian clinic Hořovice. 
"A bottle of whiskey, if it succeeds, the father Hausbar to deprive, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka. 
"Vodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then it looks not so much," said the head doctor. 
The faculty Motol hospital spokeswoman Eva Jurinová gives him right. 
"It is most commonly Fernet or rum." 
"It is the current alcohol trend, particularly in primary schools." 
"Sometimes it was also about Slibowitz that you feel at home," said Mrs Jurinová. 
According to chief doctor Pelikán, thirteen or 14-year drinkers in the hospital for long, is no exception. 
Before the clinic in Hořovice, in the ten years he has been working for this year, he was active in the pediatrics department of the Motol hospital, where the ambulances angetrunkene pupils from middle and long-distance then. 
"A girl had four hospital." 
"It started her career with 12 years, the first time with a 3.5 per cent and in combination with alcohol in the blood" Extase "has been taken," the doctor described a very serious case. 
"It was in the exhibition site in Holešovice on any dance party." 
"What is interesting in that it was not their mother seemed strange that her daughter came home 48 hours not surprised," the chief doctor. 
The lack of interest by parents or their incredible tolerance to initiate their own Sprösslingen is regarded as one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism of children. 
A real dependence in the true sense of the word, according to experts, it is not for children. 
"Alcoholism is a longstanding chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomenon to understand and that is not the case with these children." 
Among those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, is mostly a negative characteristic of familial, social background, "said chief doctor Pelikán. 
According to the spokesperson of the Motol hospital, Mrs Jurinová, until mid-November, around 40 drunken children in the local department of children and youth medicine hospital. 
However, only the cases with serious alcohol poisoning, the hospital required to go in the statistics. 
Drunk, ambulatory care from parents or children who may be brought home by the police, will not be registered. 
In addition to the cases in which children just as a bottle of spirits in the school desk austrinken Mr Pelikán believes there are three-year time Amplituden, which is 100% reliable: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year. 
"The latter for two reasons-either from distress because of the bad certificate or the joy of the holidays." 
"Walpurgisnacht I have seen in the opening seven drunken children at once," said Dr Pelikán. 
A betrunkenes child who was spending the night under medical supervision, paradoxically, is better off as a child has to contend with a nasty hangover the next day. 
The headaches in the morning, then the dehydration and the lack of glucose, it can result in hospital with a liquid giving infusion of glucose and nutrients to the body not to drive. 
"Clearly they are better off, because after the" beautiful "experience in the evening, with good humor, without any raise something hurts." 
"They are just a little confused about where they are," Dr Pelikán admits, although he sometimes patients at least the good humor is, by showing them the cost of listing, the treatment will cost. 
Because the transport with the ambulances and the night in a acute bed are well and happy to a few tens of thousands of crowns. 
"Now and again I have used this as a child, if I have directly for the children on the trip, which has cost their drunkenness and it may well happen that they need to work on time, the whole holiday to earn the money for a single such fete," Dr Pelikán added. 
In his opinion, the health insurance but not to redress procedures for the costs of curing the trunkenen children from their parents.
