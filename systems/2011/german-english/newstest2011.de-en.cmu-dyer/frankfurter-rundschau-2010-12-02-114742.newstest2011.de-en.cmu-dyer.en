Inspectors in the twilight zone 
The European Food Safety Authority, EFSA is undermined by the industry with crops experimental. 
This accusation said the group of experts now test biotech, The Independent understands the impact of the Biotechnology Institute. 
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but it is well documented," said Christoph then test biotech boss in Munich on Wednesday. 
The head of the EFSA panel for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, another EFSA expert, for years the lobbyists Association Ilsi under contract. 
The is paid by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle and Bayer. 
Kuiper have significantly contributed to the EFSA test requirements for crops and am in a clear conflict of interest, then criticized. 
The EFSA rules are (word equal position papers with the Ilsi and bear the imprint of the industry, which is supposed to be monitored by the authority in Parma, Italy. 
It is the second time that a conflict of interest test biotech bem√§ngle. 
It is a high-level EFSA manager recently without restrictions or transitional period for the Swiss company Syngenta and agriculture have changed sides. 
The funds also Deutsche Rundfunk (MDR) had links between kontrollierender EU personnel recently revealed what the Federal Environment Authority and industrial lobbies as well as EU parliamentarians has been struck. 
The EFSA, however, see no conflict of interests. 
We will take back all the serious data, also to the industry, such as long as they are of a high technical quality, it said in a statement. 
The experts, who work for EFSA, we do not demand that they have no contact with the industry. 
They would have to disclose this. 
Kuiper gives his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States. 
It described itself as a neutral forum for experts from academia, industry and policy, among other things, the risk assessment for biotechnology without lobby mission. 
In the case of independent experts criticize the way then that genetically modified plants currently without any attempt of animal feed crops be allowed and that the response to environmental influences have not been tested. 
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize crop in the power," said then. 
Current practice is only isolated proteins, but not the whole Genpflanze to test how reliable results are not providing. 
"If the risks are not addiction, how will you find?" asks then accusing finger. 
It also provides for Angelika Hilbeck. 
The academic research in genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working in the Technical University of Zurich. 
The industry attempts in this area as in the United States as well as in Europe, more and more critical to influence or discredit scientists. 
There is so little researchers who were not intertwined with corporations. 
For business critical studies would usually not publicized. 
"The industry controls the security research," said Hilbeck.
