The new unit will be no unanimity 
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new, and unity in the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Sopexa rest many observers to call for the establishment of a public committee of inquiry into the issue. 
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, said that the idea had come from yesterday: Quebec last January, the New York Department of Investigation consulted on this issue. 
The metropolis has since 1870, unity in the fight against corruption. 
However, the announcement by Wednesday, more than a surprise. 
We must say that this measure at the meeting of the standing committee of the Quebecer police service on 29 October last year despite the presence of Robert Dutils was not debated in the slightest. 
It was also not that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, this announcement in terms of public security as "from the Hut gezaubertes Rabbit" and "on a table rightly gebastelte solution" qualified. 
Minister Dutil had in turn appealed to those who fear that the future unity, have too much influence on the question of political power. 
"You will see the result, if we are going to announce it," he is content to confirm. 
"We are aware of this problem." 
Under Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public opinion poll. 
"The more M. Cha rest, insists to prevent the formation of the committee of inquiry, the more people will like you and I think that he has something to hide," he said. 
"The only way to form a committee of inquiry, the resignation of Jean cha can rest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer in its ethics and policy systems of the ENA (staatl. University for training senior administrative officer). 
In order to get out of this impasse, the Quebec, he proposes to give a specific mandate to audit supervision so that appropriate investigations of corruption and collusion. 
"We should be able to extend the mandate of the examination of control," he concluded. 
He is also the view that the Quebec's review of control, it could give the same power as commissioners, which also would allow the people to commit to the statement. 
The formation of a unity government is not the only project in the drawers Sopexa rest. 
The Ottawa Quebec will also demand that the criminal law to amend in order to be better prepared for this type of crime. 
The demand comes from the chief prosecutor of the Operation Marteau, the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier has informed that the justice in this type of prosecution is not clear. 
Vic Toews, minister of state for public safety, it confirmed his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently working with certain amendments concerning this issue. 
While the 2001 Operation Printemps, which groups the motorcycle police were concerned, 131 people have been arrested, although the criminal law was not revived. 
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the anti-racketeering law.
