The tenants of Bakala: he is fueling the stove, yet pays higher rent 
An older untersetzter man leaving the clients center of society RPG coal barons' Byty Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of renting in the Czech Republic. 
Under the arm a file with three new rental agreements on three homes, for their own and the homes of his daughters and his son, who is a sentence. 
All three were in the framework of the sog. "deregulation" just the rent increases. 
Instead of 3,500 kronor per month to rent the son next year for a two-room flat with the second category of kitchen fork out 4100 kroner. 
"And there are not fluent in housing hot water and heating in a simple coal stove," if he needs to be angry with the finger on the new rental agreement to the signing of the son, he has power. 
"But what I have signed," he says, half-disgruntled and resigned. 
The citizens association BytyOKD.cz the new lease conditions as "illegitimate and immoral", advises the tenants, simply not to sign the new treaties and to wait until 7 December, in which it intends to publish a guidance as we take action against such contracts. 
But the man only is dismissive. 
"One is saying this, the other", he is a benighted face. 
The Ostrava region will be a major deregulation "laboratory." 
After the new year is this deregulation most renting in the Czech Republic before, whose tenants have so far failed to pay fair market rent. 
Aktuálně.cz decided that this "laboratory" to attend personally. 
The RPG-waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday packed. 
In addition to the door and the bodyguards of a security agency with a call. 
"Rent," 2011 is a special Tastfeld on the touchscreen. 
Briefly angetippt and disgorge the device a numbers slip. 
"We hardly have the number 157" and piepst deciphered it on the big screen in the ceiling of the waiting area. 
Half a minute later, man of the series. 
A little later an older couple enter the waiting room to ask after the rent, but the onslaught in the waiting room is obviously not the new rent. 
Most people are, in order to solve the usual problems, repairs, insurance and other similar matters. 
In mid-November, Kuverts fly in the Ostrava region with the new rental agreements most tenants of a total of 44,000 homes of the RPG portfolios in the post. 
The RPG Byty puts you in the letter at a rent increase of approximately 15% and 38%. 
The special counters for the new rent clients on 18 November, the center has been opened. 
"The action is a little over a week, which means that this is only the beginning," answers the ladies behind the counter, after a moment of hesitation, as "the client" as a journalist. 
The deregulation and Bakalas former miners' homes are a sensitive issue. 
Before the elections, the parliament from Ostrava vice-president Lubomír Zaorálek ČSSD up this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today's newspapers are full of. 
"Twenty years of you I want a new floor." 
"Not even ne certificate. WC lens you could change," is the aforementioned man air. 
Until now, according to the staff, especially pensioners on the counters, in order to convince the promised moderation tenants whether they really have the special offer, which promises RPG if they sign in time. 
To enjoy a half reduced February rent should also sign the other tenants, the new rental agreement until 15 December. 
Until now, deregulation counters "Havířov but anything other than overloaded of inquiries. 
"From yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because," we appreciate the counter officials. 
RPG offers both on their websites, as well as wall panels individual rental agreements where it seems necessary. 
Should the rent parties but not to agree to the new rent will be determined by an independent court. 
"It is not intended to be a threat, but as the only possible information and perfectly legitimate legal approach to understand," RPG says on its Web site. 
"There is no trial," says one of the staff of RPG Byty and a man on the street in the center of clients is at least partly right. 
"I have 13 (kronor) pension, it leaves 5,000 eating me, where I should find the money for a legal dispute," he says. 
The employees will then be uncertain. 
"Let us see." 
"Mr Zaorálek says not sign them through the media, and so people are still waiting," they are to be considered. 
The regulated rent ends in the Czech Republic's largest new year 2011 and RPG Byty, increase the rent is an economic necessity. 
"The existing level of rent is not enough time on the maintenance of the housing funds," said Pavel Klimeš, director of the housing portfolio of society RPG Byty criticize the disgruntled tenants and the neglect of the housing fund is the homeowners believe that the main reason for the increase in rent. 
While RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010 rents collected from the four billion to invest in the houses in the four years from 2011 until 2014 to 5.2 billion. 
The großformatigen LCD display on the ceiling of the cushion bellies in the waiting room of Havířov appear again in a few bright red data. 
"The rent increases by 15% in 2011 and less concern 31,200 homes, which means more than 90% of the homes of RPG." 
"This means maximum CZK 7.50 per square meter per month," is to read in the LCD monitor. 
Only 400 homes from the portfolio of RPG has increased the rent to 38 percent. 
"In these cases, it is to improve the extremely low rental prices of CZK 19.66 per square meter," RPG argues. 
2600 homes remains the rent at the same level next year. 
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation not erratic driving up rents, but gradually within four and eight years. 
What more, the company imposed another commitment: all revenue from the rent increase (see diagram) will put the company back into the homes, especially in heat-saving in new windows and insulation. 
But first they must benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
