NASA announced the fund aliens life in 
The American space agency convened a press conference to a fund tomorrow vorzustelle, the impact on the search for life in all. 
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States is an Astro biological discovery tomorrow, Thursday announced that the theory of life could confirm the existence of aliens. 
The fund will be at 1 p.m. tomorrow at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington presented by Astro experts in biology. It is a science the origin, development, distribution, and the future of life in the universe. 
In convening the press conference, NASA assured that it will be a "supervisory Erregenden fund" in the search for extraterrestrial life, which triggered speculation on experts from other countries. 
The discovery could show that the theory that it has in hostile environments for unbwohnbar, human-like creatures can exist, it raised the hypothesis that this could turn into intelligent creatures such as people-if their living conditions are improving. 
Apparently, it is a microbe that is at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, has been found, they are living in an environment that is toxic for every life has been held up because the sea is heavily arsenhaltig. 
In any way the Mikrobie uses the arsenic as a survival resource. In this capacity increases the chances that it on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere, similar life could be. 
If these organisms to arsenic verstoffwechseln is in accordance with the Astro biologists found that "there is a real a different way of life, a second way of life, there are different from those we know." 
The space agency is tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference the actual scope of their funds. 
The geo-biologist Pamela Conrad take part in the conference to examine the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, the Titan, the largest moon Saturns) in response to the question of whether his studied chemical composition similar to that of the Earth.
