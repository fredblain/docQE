With a nod to the addiction Puigcercós Carod close to peace in the ERC 
The Republican leader of the party allowed a secret ballot on his continuing in office. 
Huguet proposes a pluralistic government and the end of the general principle. 
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for the umpteenth time the internal turmoil in the ranks of the rudderless ERC after the loss of 11 members and half of the votes from the way to go. 
The party leader is aware that his threat of resignation by former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, not close enough, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is now so weakened as her mentor and will give him the same headaches, as other former currents. 
That is why the leader of Esquerra tries with a nod to win the new critics, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections. 
For the earlier announced yesterday that the more than 200 members of the Regional Council of ERC about his secret, could remain in office. 
With ballots, not with superior hand. 
If the Carodisten Präsidenen wanted to a fine, they could do this without fear of reprisals. 
Indeed, the chef would avoid both the impression of division, as well as the submission of a person. 
In several interviews, he confirmed he would not be vindicated with half of the votes plus one, and he added, without any indication of% values, a Bulgarian-style outcome "would not be good." 
Carod close to ask the president to provide more than just the party office. An inadequate gesture, since Puigcercós controlled the supreme body of the Congress. 
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to speeding up of resignations, they will agree with the chairman of an action plan from now until May. 
They expect that in the drafting of the document on strategic reorientation on 18 that the pipeline will submit to the vote in the council, to be able to participate. 
Its intention is to underwrite Puigcercós. In return, these promises Congress in the autumn of 2011, as the party leader is already a fact. 
The leader of the ERC is of the opinion that the "Polyphonie" Shame of stability and he wants to create a once and for all, the organization in a position to get to wash their dirty linen behind closed doors. 
In this sense, the article, which the president Conseller Josep Huguet signed in his blog, symptomatic. 
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologue, the holders of Innovació, it is a fact that the party chairman will be based "in exchange for various objectives." 
He was five, two of whom are at the forefront. 
First, the "restructuring" of the board, so that at least 90 percent of the party members, that means the inclusion of new faces from Carods environment. 
The second could be the big story. 
Huguet proposes that ERC should function finally abandon the principle of the General Assembly. 
He thus verfechtet a reform of the statutes, which should make it possible to hold the meetings with elected delegates. 
By the end of the General Assembly model, is an exception in the Spanish party system, Puigcercós' Team, which has fought in the last two conferences, obsessed with. 
Indeed, by the bebenden Assembly in 2008, the party leadership at a congress of the review of the general principle that should deal with the reform of the statutes. 
This date is still pending, the internal Aufruhe infogle in recent years, addressing this matter was not advisable. 
Now, without the critical sectors on the Lauer, could be the time to rebuild this matter and for all.
