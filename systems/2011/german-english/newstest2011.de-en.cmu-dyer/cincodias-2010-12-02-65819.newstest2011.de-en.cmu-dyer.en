Compared to February was the response of the government and the Spanish central bank quickly and convincingly, and we benefit from the surprise effect. 
There is now a crucial auction of three-year bond, which is to benefit from the Trichet-effect, which is why we are on a strong demand, which will remove all doubts about our ability to refinance.

Only courage that we create.
