Puzzling Earth work 
The International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria. 
But the country refuses to comment, nor can it controls. 
At midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007, with at least four Israeli F-15 fighter planes is a mystery, würfelförmiges buildings in Syria. 
It is on the banks of the Euphrates, the next major city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur. 
Her name appeared in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), if it comes to the reactor that Syria was allegedly being built with help from North Korea in the Quader, hidden in a valley, the electricity line. 
According to a briefing by the United States Secret Service CIA abroad would be the end of April 2008, in the name of Middle Village el-Kibar have been well-suited to produce plutonium-based reactor to build nuclear weapons. 
For other purposes, it is hardly the technology from the Fifties. 
The CIA led a video presentation with blurred satellite images. 
Played by computer animation, where the components of the reactor before the destruction alleged to have been a fell copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center. 
They also presented photographs from near the building in the show or even the atrium. 
The reactor was not yet on the eve of the operation, it was with fuel rods have been drawn. 
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more than it was then known, the mystery has been rather bigger in time. 
The former US president George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack in el-Kibar was quite sure that Syria build a reactor, but saw little evidence that it was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country. 
Some intelligence officers in Europe, there are even more cautious and talk only of a "alleged reactor," even if you believe that the presentation of the CIA is "plausible". 
They lack of hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. 
Asked how confident he is, to have a reactor, a senior UN diplomat replied in the summer is simply that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions." 
The rubble of the alleged "unused military building", while the Syrians eilig aside and planierten carefully the terrain. 
However, an IAEA team in June 2008 under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people. 
In addition, the IAEA on a member state satellite images commercial providers from the period immediately after the attack, which might be stronger than those presented by the CIA. 
But these recordings are not available on the market, because the unknown client-perhaps Israel-it has bought exclusive. 
The IAEA therefore cannot independently verify its authenticity. 
Syria has always claimed that never pursued a secret nuclear program or a reactor to be built. 
The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, Damascus said. 
But the IAEA had to analyze the particles as unlikely. 
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss-as well as on the satellite images. 
It denied the inspectors access to a second inspection in el-Kibar and the rubble of the bombed-out building. 
Israel silent also staunchly. 
"We will never comment on that," acting prime minister Ehud Olmert at the time of the attack recently reiterated the official position. 
The investigation of the case has been dragging on since June 2008, fruitless and "is becoming a serious problem of credibility for the authority," a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna is allowed, there is a serious breach of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) in the area, monitored by the IAEA. 
As the key to progress in the investigation, the IAEA apparently three other bodies "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor are and unlike that still exist. 
So far the inspectors have not revealed what assets it is, or what they are or what they appear to be suspicious. 
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they will be in the IAEA internally as Marj known as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived from nearby towns. 
The independent Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) has identified these places in Washington and on satellite images of a building complex in Masyaf tracked objects, it is probably one of the suspects. 
It is possibly in or adjacent to a military base, with this justification denied Syria the IAEA access to the three places. 
In Vienna, it says the Syrians feared a fishing expedition that the IAEA may be sent by the United States, in order to military installations. 
The nuclear detectives were woken by a tip of the US intelligence services to the institutions. 
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the Quader of Euphrates and material was moved. 
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could "in connection with the fuel production". 
But there is no evidence of "sensitive" uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities and processes that are necessary to build nuclear weapons. 
The reactor is powered by uranium, which is not enriched. 
But where the uranium had come from, and where it would later be separated the plutonium for the bomb on these key issues, there are only plausible assumptions. 
It is also unclear whether the debris that might bring valuable traces, stored in the three places. 
As if the hundreds of cargo trucks disappeared from the face of the Earth, nobody wants to have information on where the debris remained. 
Only a few kilometers from el-Kibar al-Tibni salt mine situated on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria has studied their suitability as a storage for radioactive waste in 1998, the IAEA is unlikely. 
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had it in a recent analysis of satellite images of the venerable magazine Jane's Intelligence Review associated with the reactor. 
Recordings from the orbit but show that Syria on the three suspects work places Earth and big container remote access that the IAEA had requested. 
It may be coincidence, but has hardly helped to dispel the suspicion. 
In addition, the IAEA says that in diplomatic circles, have spent many months to develop a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets, the tape shows how much interest the inspectors. 
However, Damascus bügelte this proposal. 
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago had assuaged, the reactor was destroyed, and therefore have no urgency to the matter as US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months' special inspections into the game, one of the strongest means that the Vienna nuclear authority to impose controls. 
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, these inspections should suggest, has spoken of "an option in the future, for which I am open, but he hesitates. 
It is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it needs for a majority of the board of the IAEA, and many of the countries represented 35 countries are eager to anything other than an escalation. 
On the other hand, as a diplomat to consider is: 'What is that if you find nothing in the end? "
