Can connect courtesy the division? 
After a campaign in his words and negativity is little civility in Washington this week broke out. 
It is the sign of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion, before quickly return to the battle of the parties in the capital. 
The meeting between President Barack Obama and the congressional leaders on Tuesday produced no breakthrough in the major issues, with the man during the sog. "lame duck" session, the meeting at the end of a period in which no government had to employ more decisions to be taken. 
After all what we hear, it was not a polite debate between two different sides, a respect for their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan collection points. 
The public meeting on Wednesday, the president's deficit commission was equally civilized, despite the political differences between the members remain. 
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months to create a mutual respect of the ideological divide that continue to separate the members concealed. 
This is hardly enough to say that there is a new era of cooperation here. 
Both sides are now in a testing phase-in a sign of cooperation and compromise from the other demands, while even trying to weigh up the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a renewed warfare. 
Therefore, the meeting itself and its assessment by the participants on Tuesday were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations. 
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to be a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the last two years might expect. 
Whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or rights, the two sides are miles apart. 
Finally, the November election Washington at least for a short time. 
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official who now works for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center." 
"It is inevitable after the elections. 
Elections give partisan passions, to die. 
And that is a good thing. " 
In some issues, particularly those that are on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice other than to find a solution. " 
Bush's tax cuts end up at the end of the year, and no one favors it. 
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether temporarily or permanently. 
It is also expected to produce a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans favored believes that we cannot afford that the tax cuts for the rich, while refusing to help unemployed workers. 
After the meeting in the White House on Tuesday increased the optimism is that it is on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time can ratify the New Start treaty. 
But William glass tone of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation on urgent issues for the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to a permanent cooperation by the parties, if the new 112. Congress will convene in January. 
Instead, he says, is a phase of Nicht√ºBer once immensely more likely, perhaps even inevitable. 
"After the things that need to be done, done, this short-term psychology will slide into confrontation," he said. 
Wehner is also skeptical, and this skepticism is shared by many, courtesy of genuine cooperation. 
"I see much of what happens from now on until 2012, as busy, or shadow boxing, for the main event in 2012," he said. 
The reasons have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters, whose education were appropriate. 
As the Republican leader is also concerned that they may be pokern too high, you know that you have to try to reduce government spending and its promise to repeal the health-care reform. 
This party lines are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the deficit commission, which is a tax reform and raising some taxes and include raising the retirement age and reducing state expenditure. 
The deputy chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in accordance with its own assessment, insisted that the deficit issue on the public agenda that they could no longer be ignored. 
But they need within the Commission, 14 of the 18 votes for its plan to make a formal recommendation, and they are fighting in order to come even close to this number. 
The biggest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the body, as financial issues, at least today, little sympathy or little room for compromise. 
Galston says two stages of the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress. 
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes if the Republicans in the state budget, taxes and the health care system, Obama's challenge, then followed by a stage two more partisan cooperation. 
What will this change? 
The public opinion. 
It is proved that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans are still hopes that the two parties work together. 
If confrontation in a blind alley, as happened in 1995, both parties will have to carefully look at the public reaction. 
Whoever is doomed to lose will change tack and must seek a compromise. 
In fact, it may be an optimistic view. 
Partisanship and polarization are larger than in the mid-1990's, and they seem greater ideological divide between Obama and the Congress to be Republican than his time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. 
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude for a much broader consistency in 2012 election. 
So, the courtesy display this week, may be welcomed by many Americans. 
But it will require much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator of the issues that still divide the two.
