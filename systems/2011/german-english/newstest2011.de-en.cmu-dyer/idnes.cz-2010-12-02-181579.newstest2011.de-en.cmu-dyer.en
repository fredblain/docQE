The right mattress and the right beds Rost women have other aspirations than men? 
The tollste bed framework, but the quality of the Liege area-mattress and rust-are the good bed. 
However, this must be harmonious complement in order to meet the wishes of the specific user. 
Many things play a role in the selection process, the weight, size, health and, last but not least, the sex of the Schläfers. 
The Interieur is just as important in the mattress and Rost. 
A typical example? 
In a weekend house, which does not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not suitable, because they need to be 'warm' for much longer. 
In addition, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethane mattresses. 
And they should be changed regularly. 
If you do not have enough air inlets Kanälchen the essence and lie on a firm record, gets snarled up moisture, so it is not excluded that under its mold. 
Of course, plays a role in the election, in which it is used. 
Anyone who has been long time abroad, where very high mattresses with soft class are normal, it will be difficult to low mattress with a hard surface can be used. 
"All ice hockey players who come back from the NHL, have complained to me that they are no longer able to sleep properly." 
"For their abgeschundenen shoulders, heels and waists they need simply a soft layer of Visco-foam (memory foam, a form of memory polymer)." 
"I recommend including sugar sick people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the" bad information "from the Gelenken and the skin," said Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in padded furniture. 
That is why I have years ago many hockey players, but also other customers concerned these mattresses with Visco foam (memory foam). 
"This is no longer a problem, because such mattresses are among the manufacturers Tempur, the Italian firm Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico." 
And one does not need to be a famous ice hockey players will learn to appreciate the benefits of Visco foam. 
The "miracle" is really quite simple. 
The foam optimalisiert his toughness and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, he schmiegt directly on hot bodies. 
Nowhere is there, it is not passing in the night as around after a serious fight. 
We simply sleep much better. 
The sparkling Viskoela tables also provides protection against Dekubitus (gangrene). 
The choice of mattresses size should be to body size is still the length of the Fußsohlen, CA. to add 21 to 34 cm. 
Men and women to the 180 cm are large, so need a 210 to 220 cm. 
Each of the sleepers should at least 90 cm is widely available, so 180 cm. 
In separate beds, for example, singles are 120 to 140 cm. 
The Comfort's sake and for potential visitors. 
Otherwise, the rule of thumb for the ideal bed broad: "If you have enough room on the back, should be easy for the angewinkelten poor," advises Ing. Helen Prokopová, the Guild of Ausstatter Polsterer and space, which is already years devoted to the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and then put this question to schools. 
In a double bed everyone needs its own Rost and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are also high. 
Otherwise, there is nothing other than to make the different amounts of Roste and that is not possible for each bed framework. 
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with the skeleton of 15 cm, and it should be at least three centimeters in the form of class and Fein cushion. 
"With the hand or sit the feathers in any case we must feel," warns Helena Prokopová. 
Each mattress requires a special type of Rost. 
Gepolsterte beds with mattresses and document as increased Siam twins have nothing to do in the bedroom. 
The mattresses are not reveal the terms and you cannot wash today, and already there is. 
And since we are in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years is becoming a huge (and congested Sieb). 
This is also why experts reject advertising slogans in many a life span of up to 25 years, and even life guarantee promises. 
Every cause has its ifs and buts. 
And that is why a practical council by dealers: mattresses of 120 and 140 cm wide, waschbaren hygiene abziehbaren salaries should not be afraid to use a mattresses Schoner, nonetheless, it is recommended that you can easily leave and wash. 
Even if today usually mattresses salary be established with all respect, so it open after the two sides is immensely important for the washing process, and the size of washing machines!), is the manipulation of larger mattresses, especially said, often alone as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. 
Have you in bed instead of a Rostes firm record? 
Raus! 
Or more for a bed for unpopular guests and for a single night. 
The record must be better equipped with ventilation holes (if not included) and mattresses with the skeleton and 15 cm minimum level with sog. pocket Feder Kern and Fein cushion. 
Polyurethane mattresses are not in such a document. 
Verstellbare Lattenroste with 14 to 18 Feder (Lamellen) sandwich or latex mattresses are suitable (possibly combinations of latex and Kokos), always figures are Roste with a larger number of latte, also from 28 and provide more relevant, with the Lordosenstütze Lendenwirbel area and the possibility of raising the bar to regulate severity. 
Verstellbare Lamellenroste does not include mattresses with the skeleton, since they do not respond to the ergonomische subterfuge. 
In addition to the suspension of stiff Feder will also make special flexible shoulder modules. 
There is a specific fastening the Feder, which enables the Feder, einzudrücken or even verwinkeln so that the specific Einsinken Schläfers's shoulder. 
For men with broad shoulders an important matter. 
There are even mattresses manufacturers have started to use in "Gentlemen mattresses" soft zones for the shoulder area. 
The ladies is also thought that soft-fighting areas in the hip area. 
For most customers are entitled, elastic wing Feder systems (Lattoflex) or Roste with point elastic touch pads with sog. multi-torsion Federung. 
The pressure will be distributed to a number of issues, thus reducing the tension. 
But, if you look at the right mattress and right Rost used a bad (too big and fülliges) pillow, most of the gains are lost. 
This is a rule of thumb: the pillow to head restraints, its leaders should extend only to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax. 
It seems an ideal 50 x 60 cm high, as it may, for example, the Scandinavians. 
The sides should have the pillow (together with the shoulder area in the rust-discharge or soft zone in the bed) compensate the shoulder level. 
Have our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (but) straw bags full of hay. 
Modern manufacturers increasingly use natural materials, or at least their mixtures. 
Many also say the new game "organic." 
Instead of oil, raw materials used to manufacture of polyurethane foams frequency of natural oils-for example, Elle Rizinus and soya oil. 
Soya is used by all well-known manufacturers. 
"Biotechnology is in mattresses, the heart of it is purely natural materials," said Petr Vašíček Tropico Plus of the company. 
Natural substances will also be used in the manufacture of mattresses salary-it was one of the first Aloe Vera. 
But one can also be micro-capsules, the fresh forest or sleep Lavendel odor spread. 
Here too there is a difference between men and women. 
While the men a "kühlender" plant extracts from birch leaves used to the heat and cool the body can absorb the mattresses, the remuneration for women "wärmende" effect. 
Extracts from red paprika Schoten rain the blood circulation to the weaker sex, sleep so wohlig warm. 
The current favorites? 
Kalt foam mattresses (he has greater Poren with destroyed cell structure and is therefore breathing more active than standard polyurethane and more flexible). 
The combination of the various technical (tough) by cold foams and Visco-foaming produce more zones mattresses that know exactly where head, hip and heels. 
A high-quality mattresses, though, has 7,000 kroner and to fork out more. 
Health mattresses, but usually with lower value added tax burden, because they are seen as a medical device. 
The first Czech companies have received Gumotex this advantage. 
It is to save money in the mattress and the rust-is not easy. 
Now and again there are special offers from manufacturers and retailers who offer two mattresses for the price of one. 
It offers the brand Magniflex mattresses duo freeze in relation to verstepptem Visco-foam memory for CZK 11.990. 
The second will be free to do so. 
It was the era of the Material Tempur Viskoela Tischen foam material with open cell structure and high density in almost kosmischem pace. 
No wonder they were developed for NASA, however, because the astronauts are starts in the enormous pressures. 
Tempur heat in a cool place, Weich confirmed it again. 
The human body, it is perfect and distributed in an optimal manner the body pressure. 
It is not only ideal to prevent pressure increased brand, but generally the sleep comfort. 
Viskoela foam substances, but not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot padding used to provide relief to the legs and the Gefäßen. 
For example, local manufacturers use the foam substances Eucatherm C Twinsaver or similar products.
