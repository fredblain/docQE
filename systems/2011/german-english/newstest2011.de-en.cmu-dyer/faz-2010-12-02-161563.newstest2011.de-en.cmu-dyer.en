The EIS University 
The "Gelato University" in Bologna to ice cooks prepared for better times of the year. 
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the biggest feeder and visitors from all over the world. 
What is really the whole ice? 
From Gelatiere and Gelataio. 
The Gelatiere on German Konditor, the more old-fashioned the ice cream maker after all the rules of the Italian ice art. 
The Gelataio holt with a Spachtel ice cream from the Kühltheke, cut it into Waffel and then selling them. 
In order to know this, we must not go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna. 
But who would like to know more about ice of the Italian company Carpigiani "Gelato University" is not over. 
The EIS University, the manufacturer of ice machines set up in 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines throughout the Italian high ideals. 
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the biggest feeder and visitors from around the world. 
But there are also mehrtägige special courses around the Eisdiele chocolate ice and placements in the House. 
Some dreams in a midlife crisis of a new career, others simply dare again treacherous ice their vague aspirations. 
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents from Brazil via Hungary to Saudi Arabia. 
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow-food movement and to the country's industrial ice-cream in a European quality product. 
Anke from Berlin is business adviser and will for years in a nerve-racking job a separate eintüten. 
Two young Egyptians who dream of opening a Eisdiele, in Cairo. 
A man from Malta and one from Brazil to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars and the Canadian housewife Julia is because their children love Italian ice cream. 
Maestro Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari declared the participants first, the ideal characteristics of perfect ice cream. 
It is not only good taste and good consistency, but also the seidige suppleness. 
Luciano forgets in his training but not the icing on the cake of national and even Latin Überbaus: "Italian gelato is simply the best, and there is still a lot of romance." 
The first step to production seems quite simple. 
Luciano overturns the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a great mix with an electronic device which program everything at 85 degree heat and then immediately to four degrees cools. 
Then he turns to the machine is a cock and a pasteurized White basis lotions, basis for all milk Eissorten. 
The lecturer will immediately bombarded with questions: can you ice cream only with natural substances without stabilizer? 
How can we allow them to unleash their own experimental lust? 
Luciano warns to mislead the zeitgeist. 
"Only natural ingredients" speech, ice cream, who may yet stabilizers, mostly used a natural product, such as Guarkernmehl Guarbohne. 
Of course you can produce ice without stabilizing, but it must be sold within a day, otherwise sackt it, and the customer bites on the ice grains. 
Some variation on the basic mass are allowed. 
It will be exciting with the flavorings. 
For the taste of ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes the ingredients in the fruit or the sweets section of the supermarket buys. 
Furthermore, there are bullets and Pasten. 
"The suppliers are all trying to foist onto dozens of aromatic additions them." 
"But they should just experimenting." 
Either in the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit. 
The yellow or white, from the mass of ice cream with eggs, cream and cocoa powder used as the basis for all kinds of chocolate temptations offered. 
Now, the course participants in the ice machines. 
Luciano, each of them four different types of vanilla, chocolate, Mokka and hazelnut-ice, with or without producing eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural supplements. 
The same experiment, the Fruchteis varieties. 
More flavor, more fruit mashed-taste is not necessarily better. 
Hazelnut ice tastes not necessarily nussiger if it contains more hazelnuts. 
The most popular Kiwi-ice, the working group, which used more fruit, less water and less stabilizer. 
Only a balanced combination Hebe the taste of a gelato right, says Luciano. 
Ice production is a mathematical exercise: peach-mashed with a lot of sugar used, the sugars in the basic recipe must be reduced. 
For Zitroneneis is an extra dose of sugar needed. 
Luciano is a machine, with the sugar content of the fruit varieties (wine, so that the grape musts Oechsle). 
Fortunately easier tables the calculation. 
To make ice no longer requires so much physical work as before. 
Not only the equipment for the automatic restoration of basic mass helps. 
There is also a device, in which the final EIS mixture cremig beaten and cooled to minus temperatures at the same time. 
Despite all the automation, remain small margins. 
The Brazilians Gustavo proud of himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with Fruchtpüree, as the colossal Stabmixer spirals out of control. 
"In every way," says Maestro Luciano, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens."
