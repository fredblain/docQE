A long finger and ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer 
Men whose finger is as long as the ring finger, are obviously a lower risk of developing prostate cancer. 
This is the surprising result of a study, which was published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer. 
It is connected with the levels of the male hormone testosterone. 
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men and 60," said the study's co-author, Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute of Cancer Research at the University of Warwick. 
The finger could help to determine the men must undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks, or other factors, such as family health burdens, Mrs Eeles added. 
In the period 1994-2009 followed it with their colleagues in Britain more than 500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time, 3,000 healthy men. 
More than half of the participants in the study, the finger was shorter than the right-hand ring finger. 
For these men had the same likelihood of prostate cancer, as well as for 19% of those men whose ring and finger the same length. 
In men, whose finger was longer than the ring finger, but this risk was reduced by 33% to 87%, to 60 for men. 
The relationship between the length of the two fingers, which is already reflected in the prenatal age, obviously the different levels of sex hormones, which was subjected to the child in the womb. 
Less testosterone is a longer finger. 
Previous research showed that the testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer. 
Václav ČTK Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the National Academy of Sciences, said that it was this study fleetingly aware, but it is the relationship between the finger length and the risk of cancer has not been "completely proven."
