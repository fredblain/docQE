Red Bull prevails in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens 
The cars will be improved with a software in real time. 
Since Red Bull 2004 invaded the world of Formula 1, is its history in this splendid universe of speed of surprises and successes. 
Initially, no one paid the newcomer attention and, despite its rising sharply to gangs during the last seasons, all of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso's victory in the sprint last November. 
Without the skills of the pilots and German world champion Sebastian Vettel to belittle or the performance of the Renault engine is the "secret weapon", the multinational Siemens in the hands of Red Bull, and created a winning team, has become a legend. 
In reality, is a powerful software to simulate processes, the German company for purposes that have nothing to do with motor racing in 2007, on the market. 
This was described as PLM computer program for the development of assembling chains in factories around the world, energy plants and precise instruments used. 
There is a faithful reproduction and / or simulation of a product or process before this will actually be built, so as to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs. 
The development of the PLM cameras from Canon, the Sukhoi aircraft and the most famous commercial vehicles for Nissan. 
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial department of Siemens, said that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 Red Bull factory "in a few hours," the changes and improvements to the race almost in real time and can be found in the tests, plan and carry out. 
Russwurm contends that in 1992 the teams an average of ten technicians working in a season could introduce a maximum of three or four improvements. 
The Red Bulls team are highly qualified young people 180. with powerful computer facilities in all kinds of analyses and changes to the cars. 
The Siemens manager, said that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all parts of the cars of Red Bull, with the exception of the motors that Renault is solely responsible for said. 
The materials, fuel, alloys and the safety elements will be changed. 
The changes, thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclave within less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of the simulators will be transferred to reality. 
The only limit to this insane technical perfection is the $40 million, a Formula 1 team can spend on his race in a season. 
Red Bull has its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its cars in a town 50 kilometers away from London. 
There are two buildings where visits, particularly of journalists-are heavily restricted. 
Everything that is happening is top secret. 
The workforce comprises 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber. 
But Red Bulls real Formula 1 held off is the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell. 
Behind the enormous technological resources, the energy-drink manufacturers in the services its participation at the race tracks, hide other protagonists, whose vital support and visibility is zero. 
The chief of the plant, Steve technologi Nevey five years ago, stressed that it was possible to say that the progress made in R & D for cars with 50% contributed to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest. 
Today, the share values changed. The technology is 85% of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent. 
Nevey recognizes that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computer, because they "are not female gladiators'.
