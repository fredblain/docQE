DuPont partly reprimanded 
The Quebecer radio presenter Stéphane Dupont, the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Board (CCNR) for his controversial statements on social welfare and Haitians, as well as for his speech from maturing on radio, a partial setback. 
The CCNR believes, M. Dupont and Choi 98.1 FM team had the right to their own opinion, however, certain statements "inaccurate information about the welfare and unwarranted negative images of the Haitians and also contain such an extreme way of talking to the daytime broadcast programs is not appropriate." 
The board also had finally concluded that a discussion about suicide, which contains the names of two people who have committed suicide, violates the Code of television broadcasting. 
The CCNR had several complaints regarding the comments made during the television broadcast in the period between 2008 and 2010. 
The first was available as a result of a complaint of "joint front des personnes assistées sociales du Quebec 'appeal. 
The activists had complained that the organization in the broadcast figures were inaccurate. 
The hosts should sound rather than give misleading information. 
On the issue of suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont had the view that the suicide was an expression of cowardice. 
The majority of board members had drawn the conclusion that the message conveyed is that the suicide should not be seen as a solution of food crises. 
"The majority of the supervisory board to take account of the consequences of the program," Dupont le midi "a sensitive issue would be raised in families fairer and more appropriate manner." 
So it was with no criticism against his person. 
The last sticking point was the statements that had referred to the earthquake in Haiti. 
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort, a media in this regard have provided effective argument that provoked a lot of reactions. 
Choi-presenter said that was not in favor of the Haiti aid donated to have, because we do not know with certainty that the needy would actually get the donations. 
The board is of the opinion that these comments were not improper nature, but their cumulative effect presenting an unjustified negative portrayal of the Haitians. 
"I already have my three-day suspension penalty served in this matter." 
"My act is for one and a half years Virgin," the presenter said. 
In all the decisions the board denounces the spread of a ungehobelten way. 
In all cases, the CHOI-FM radio announcer "beyond its obligations." 
The consequences for the broadcasters, among other things, his unique decisions during the main transmission within a period of three days ago to inform that are slightly.
