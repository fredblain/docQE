The second mandate: the evidence 
De Gaulle was really being whittled away. 
Mitterrand had faith that he stutze. 
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation. 
Nicolas Sarkozy, and even less than that. 
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next. 
The current head of state, ergo candidate in 2012. 
But the evidence is the Mysteriums, pervades the role of the presidency, not look good. 
We therefore need to pretend that doubts about the future. 
In a sense, as well as in the other. 
In 2006, the Jacques Chirac supporters, a third mandate is not excluded, without faith in itself. 
On 15 November assured Nicolas Sarkozy in serious tone, his decision to take "some time in the autumn of 2011". 
On Tuesday evening in the Elysée UMP parliamentarians, the prospect of "two mandates" hinting would, therefore, have a little fever nature. 
This was the official announcement of his candidacy? 
Far from it. 
The president was simply remind you that the amendments to the constitution of 2008 the number of five-year terms to just two. 
He made a comment that no announcement. 
It is not the first time that the presidential election, he mentioned in a humorous tone at such meetings. 
"You have at worst another seven years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009. 
In a new "in May 2010, does not believe that I do not think about the later stages." 
His words before the candidates make him more than the previous day, but no less. 
Should you provoke comments, then from a double reason. 
The acceleration of the run up to the candidacy of the PS on one side. 
But it is not the start of the competition with Segolene Royal, Nicolas Sarkozy, to reveal. 
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS sooner than anticipated to challenge field. 
The poor polls on the other side. 
For the first time, voters would right a candidacy of François Fillon by Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to a poll by the BVA-L'Express) prefer. 
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP," responded immediately and cautiously the environment of the Prime Minister. 
"If it would be a defeat as possible, he would not run," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin. 
"He will always believe that I can win," corrected Alain Juppé, has accepted the evidence.
