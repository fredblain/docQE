Secretly in the middle 
In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, their popularity rate of around 20 points driving upwards to more than 50%, which is the highest value since its election in 2007. 
Whether it gets to a re-election next year, however, depends on whether the obvious Cristina Fernández compromise is in mourning for her late husband, Néstor Kirchner, her predecessor and political partner. 
The signs are not clear. 
Néstor Kirchner, even after the election of his wife's economic policies, was often budget plans, the tax revenue, not fully take into account the economic growth and inflation. 
This allowed the presidential couple, the extra revenue to spend as they see fit. 
On paper, Fernández-last year, the government lost its majority in Congress. 
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further divisions. 
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten, rallying around Cristina Fernández. 
But after chaotic meetings (where a parliamentarian in the face of another accused the government of corruption, and others), the Congress failed to pass the budget for 2011. 
"I will not discuss it," the president said. 
The 2010 budget for the next year, which is now the president has more opportunity to spend money as they see fit. 
The economy is hot: this year it is likely to grow up to 9%. 
The official inflation rate is z.Z. to 11.1%, but many private estimates and wage demands of the unions, pushing the value to almost 30%. 
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was ridden by economic crises, said his main objectives, and not the inflation growth and poverty reduction. 
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, bullying the private sector and the National Institute of Statistics and Census säuberte INDEC, prompting the official inflation statistics schönte. 
Fernández can now a modest path? 
It has called on the private sector and the trade union leaders for talks. 
According to official statements and wage increases should be limited to 18% next year. 
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy. 
But inflation undermined the growth by a large devaluation in 2002. 
Perhaps for this reason, Cristina Fernández, Argentina's financial support to the rest of the world. 
At the beginning of this year, the government made an agreement with holders of securities that had rejected the previous restructuring of the country in 2001. 
Fernández now appears on an agreement with the Paris club donors to urge that they approximately $6.7 billion debt. 
The Kirchners had a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere, always rejected. 
But last month, the Economy Minister Amado Boudou, announced that the fund in the drafting of a new national consumer price index will provide "technical support". it looks as if this is the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC. 
It is not known whether Mr Fernández, after leaving office without the support of her husband will be politically active. 
If so, they need to get the support of middle-class, largely have had enough of Kirchnerism. 
If the Argentines return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of Sympatie that has been shown to be abgeebbt. 
If you must decide whether they would like to win another election, many political decisions her husband quietly lifted.
