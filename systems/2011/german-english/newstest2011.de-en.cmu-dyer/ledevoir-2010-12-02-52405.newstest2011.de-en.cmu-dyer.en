World-wide plan to regenerate the lighting 
The UN yesterday in Cancun a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (CFC's) proposed that almost a third of the additional reduction, which must be implemented in order to stabilize the earth's climate by 2020. 
This ambitious plan, its position in the concrete steps to implement major projects in Cancun that the UN hopes to compensate for the absence of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries. 
After yesterday's plan would put forward the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the lighting on the Earth made CFCs can be avoided if the ardent pears, which has a monopoly on the market, from 50% to 70% by fluoreszierende or, better still, were replaced with LEDs. 
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. 
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet. 
In Copenhagen last year had the major gas emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans, which should lower the global GT GT CFC emissions from 53 to 49. 
This balance today, however, would be to deduct 5 GT in order to stabilize the climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius by 2020, so as to prevent this from spiraling out of control. 
In the know fervent pears escaping 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light. 
The compact fluorescent pears reduced energy consumption by 75%, with the new LED bulbs that reducing energy demand once again for the double. 
The compact fluorescent pears, on average, between 6,000 and 10,000 hours. 
The new LED bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips has put on the market this week, the company has also taken part in the UN study-have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a fiery pear know what a suggestion the savings of the replacement plan, should be applied in 100 countries. 
Apart from the fact that IESE completely new light bulbs make very little heat, it can also work with a real resistance. 
They contain no mercury. 
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent pears reserves, because they contain mercury and that it is as hazardous waste in developing countries, which is not always possible, but the producers are an adoption is available. 
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, is not the compact fluorescent pear, but the coal-fired power plants, which emit mercury, much more aware of the fervent pears waste to generate electricity. 
The coal-fired power stations in the United States alone have 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually. 
The report, which detailed the profits of each country thanks to this international programmes would generate. 
Indonesia, for example, a billion dollars in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2 per year, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose spiritual Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
