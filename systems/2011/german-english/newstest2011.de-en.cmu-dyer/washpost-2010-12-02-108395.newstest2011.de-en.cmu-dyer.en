Belarus agrees not to accumulate weapons-grade uranium 
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. 
The deal was the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a joint statement after a meeting with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in additional articles of the Security Council announced. 
The US government for years has tried to do to convince Russia not to collect more highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring. 
But the US administration official told the Washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreements with Belarus have been taken to 187 pounds to remove weapons-grade uranium from a research institute in Belarus. 
On Wednesday, setting the stage for the agreement to remove the rest of the material, according to an anonymous official staff, due to the sensitivity of the issue, £500. 
The agreement is one of the most important results of Obama's nuclear security summit of 47 nations in April "to be out of Belarus. 
And it was obvious good enough to get the invitation to the former Soviet republic for the next summit in 2012. 
"I was really excited by the fact that they want a seat in the nuclear safety summit (in 2012)." 
"It shows me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership to promote global security, a group of nuclear safety. 
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step 'from Belarus. 
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009, to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials within four years. 
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of its highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus will be the seventh. 
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush. 
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up their uranium. 
"How retain highly enriched uranium-hundreds of kilos, which is capable of reaching arms, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time. 
"That is our raw material... We will not make it a dirty bombs and we will not sell anyone." 
"We use it for research purposes only, that is all." 
Belarus, however, the United States in a few months ago, when it approached interest in meeting an agreement anzeigte. 
The first attempt to remove the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly difficult because the material was easy to radiation, officials say. 
It was loaded on a special train, more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say. 
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by aircraft, according to the official. 
The US government is paying $14 million for this effort, and most of the money flowing in the Belarusian Research with low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons. 
"This was extremely careful coordinated and voted to build confidence, which led to the agreement that was signed by President Clinton," said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, which is working in the global threat reduction. 
The James Martin Center for not to incorporate further studies estimates that Belarus had at least £88 weapons FäHhigen uranium this year and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus will disappear under the joint agreement camp by 2012. 
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh violation of human rights. 
But Wednesday's statement suggested a possible rapprochement. 
"The progress of the global security issues, the United States of America, and welcome heißend Belarus announced that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus, a key issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
