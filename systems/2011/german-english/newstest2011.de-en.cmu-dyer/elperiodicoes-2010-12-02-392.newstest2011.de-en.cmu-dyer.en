On the hunt for WikiLeaks head 
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new revelations. 
Interpol is a red alert to monitor and detect Assange. 
Everything is linked to WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated maze, where the issues are difficult to explain. 
Yesterday, Interpol was a "red alert" to "locate and persecution" of Assange. 
However, it is not a traditional layout on the arrest. 
In addition, it is not new, they came on 20 November. 
It has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but also with the sexual abuse allegations, which the Australians in Sweden. 
It also assured the lawyer of the founder of WikiLeaks, Mark Stephens, "the police know where and how they could make contact with Mr Assange."

As things are, the 188 countries of the Interpol are instructed to identify and locate Assange to provisionally arrest and extradite him. " 
Although Interpol ordered the arrest of the individual is not affected by a red warning, can see many member countries of the organization, according to the red warning a carte blanche to Arrestierung-which must be carried out by the National Police, especially when you have a bilateral extradition treaty, as is the case of Sweden and England, where probably Assange. 
The action outraged Assanges lawyers who gestures, published a letter in which they also informed that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks, is ready to answer the questions by video conference from the Swedish authorities. 
They also recall that Assange to leave Sweden requested by the prosecutor, and say the Umwobenen Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security chief of Stalin, compared the permission is received.

His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd." 
"I am not sure why we should put emphasis on the opinion of the type with a website," he told the CNN. 
Obama himself has a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, charged with the prevention of new documents revelations. 
The attempt by the spokesperson of the Pr√§sidenden Barack Obama, to pay less attention to Assange, stands in stark contrast to the views of conservative politicians and commentators in recent days. 
Congressman Peter King, who chaired the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives in January, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility that WikiLeaks to confiscate the money to be put on the list of terrorist organizations, "and anyone who supports or contributes to follow." 
Tom Flanagan, adviser to the Canadian leader Stephen Harper, has gone further, and he had retracted his statement, Assange "should be murdered." 
"Obama should turn it into a target and not use a manned aircraft or what." 
Baptistischer Minister, who was not apologizing, Mike Huckabee, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
