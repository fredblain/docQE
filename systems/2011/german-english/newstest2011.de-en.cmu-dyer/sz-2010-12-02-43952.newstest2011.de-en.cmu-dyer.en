In times of war 
Since Angelina Jolie has started work on her still nameless Regie debut in the summer, there is trouble. 
The script she has even written a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man. 
We know much more about the not-but enough for unrest. 
The woman, a Muslim, a persistent rumor verliebe during the war in Yugoslavia, the Serbian rapists. 
Bosnian women's associations have planned hub in Sarajevo immediately protested, whereupon some days have been transferred to Hungary in the short term. 
In the meantime, the film in Hungary and marginalized in post-production, but there will still be protested in Bosnia. 
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war, wrote on the UN refugee agency UNHCR of Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper reported now, Jolie, ambassador of the UN's refugee relief. 
It is not diplomatically, the women, weeks before a meeting in Hungary, which offered but rejected. 
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, Hasecic. 
Love stories in rape camps have not been made, and Jolie attitude towards the victims betrays her enough on the script. 
Their organization, according to the UN refugee agency has recommended that Jolie as ambassador to dismiss, the Guardian reported. 
But what exactly has Jolie for scenes written? 
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture has got to read the script, after some back and forth a pivot granted approval for Sarajevo, it is not clear why Jolie will not yet. 
The young author even claimed that they have no political intentions with her film, with a lot of trouble incorporated into the conflict in Yugoslavia, wants to show the horrible consequences of war and give voice to all the parties involved. 
However, the content is vague. 
So are circulating a second synopsis of the film in the network, which is quite different sounds: loving knew it before the outbreak of the war and again when they meet, a Bosnian Muslim, a Serb camp kidnapped, in which he works as a guard. 
What is significantly different than the version sounds "rape victims verknallt in torturer." 
Jolie film really begins before the war, that much is sure. 
The pressure on them, Jolie, is "unfair and based on wrong information." 
Now she can probably only the hacker of Hollywood: make peace by the script, as so many times before, illegally dumped into the net.
