Affaire Clotilde Reiss, the Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediating role for Syria 
More than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained for "espionage" in Iran, the French public in suspense, left the diplomacy in alert and focused the deterioration in relations between Paris and Tehran. 
All this under the close eye of the diplomats of the United States. 
The documents obtained by WikiLeaks and the newspaper Le Monde by American diet give some background to this crisis. 
They describe how the Elysée had said his strategy, as far as the Americans, this advice for dealing with their own crisis of "hostage" in Iran (a small group of Wanderern). 
They show how the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French not the release of imprisoned in France, Majid Kakavand, a justice of the United States because of trade with material in favor of the Iranian nuclear program wanted her to have Gegeleistung. 
Finally, the way in which the French bureau has tried to manipulate the media to the ends that the idea to make credible the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad have played a key role in the liberation of woman, Clotilde Reiss, a penetrating light on. 
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard. 
A telegram redigiertes diplomats in Paris on August 12, 2009, entitled "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostage-taking." 
François Richier, Elysée advisers on policy issues, is accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay in North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone. 
They told her the French method. 
It advised the Americans to do everything possible to return to their own nationals who were forcibly detained in Iran. 
"Power noise", they said, 'it loud and clear, without reason, "the words' human rights'," Innocence, "" immediate release "in the media. 
This is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime that respects very sensitive to its image. 
"This is all the more so when you ask the Iranians not to do that." 
"Silence solves nothing," the debate over testing on unauffälligem paths, the Iranians are "Masters in evasive maneuvers." 
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is a 'normal, Iranian tactics: "hostage" to political blackmail. " 
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which should come on August 16, the day when they are in the French embassy refuge) demand the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians' (230,000 euros) bail. 
It is reported that the Elysée anticipating further hostage-taking, "a phenomenon that will worsen." 
The Iranians could in the near future, "one of the other roughly 1,800 arrested French citizens who live in Iran," he said. 
28 August 2009. 
Clotilde Reiss is 12 days had been released from jail, but will remain held in Iran. 
The information was in circulation, the Iranians Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States due to illegal trade with empfindlichem electronics demand material to Iran, is ruling by a judge in Paris have been released from prison. 
The American Embassy is, like many other observers, questions on this disturbing coincidence. 
In Washington, the illegal Iranian networks followed the acquisition of the material for a nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand a bad news. 
France has accepted a horse-trading? 
The liberation of the fare against the Frenchwoman. 
During a further meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September François Richier assured that this was not the case. 
The Elysée, he says, not only was "totally surprised by the decision of the judge," but have also tried to revolt against it. 
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Bureau and the French minister of justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but the French government "cannot change the judicial decision," he said. 
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under strict supervision of the French secret service. 
The Elysée adviser informed choice on a telephone number, then the American diplomat, the Iranians "at the moment would be led by the Iranian embassy buildings in Paris." 
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran spares the Elysée his efforts, through statements and organized by the media "flight attempts" to make believe that the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential mediator." 
The Americans see this activity not without irony and conclude that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as several articles reflect the official French version. 
On August 25, 2009 datierendes telegram conjuring up "the media blitz of the French authorities". 
What is so much you can "with Mr Assad," the Paris embassy wonders. 
"Despite their statements give praise to the French authorities privately that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have done." 
The document also deals with the reasons which led to the Elysée this fiction. 
The intensive communication efforts "aims to Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria to confirm," he analyzed. 
A policy that was launched in 2008 by numerous critics' votes in France and abroad was perceived as a premature and undeserved. " 
"The Syrian role aufbauschend attempts" Paris "to see what Syria laud can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region." 
The aim is also to "sow discord between Syria and Iran." 
The American Embassy knows this from a good source. 
On August 11, François Richier entrusted to her: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians have always done." 
"In spite of everything, but we have to thank you." 
"This should at least confusion on the part of the Iranians." 
Clotilde Reiss is returning to France on May 16, 2010. 
Nicolas Sarkozy receives the Elysée. 
In a statement he would like to thank the president of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our compatriot."
