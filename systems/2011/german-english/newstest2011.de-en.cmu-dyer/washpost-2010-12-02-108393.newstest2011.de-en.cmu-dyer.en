Khmer Rouge veterans to confrontation with the past forced 
In a weak and concrete class area with dirty and abbl채tternden walls, recalls the director of the Anlong Veng High School to the man who built it, the future Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok. 
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok." 
"He was a good leader and he has cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years. 
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butchers," the commander is popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he has developed infrastructure, hospitals and bridges built and where thousands of former soldiers still lives. 
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, are longtime supporters in Anlong Veng. 
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum the victims the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime. 
In June the government circulated a textbook for the first time, children of former soldiers told the story of the Khmer Rouge. 
And in July, a community court of the UN and Cambodia for the first time a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, sentenced to 35 years in prison. 
With all these developments, the fear among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, hindered their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia. 
"There is still fear and rejection of the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime. 
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge is impressive, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." 
"It divides families." 
During the Khmer Rouge reign in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died from disease, overwork or starvation. 
When the Vietnamese invaded and toppled Pol Pot in 1979 by the IED government, fled the remnants of the regime and its military to the Cambodian border in Thailand. 
They surrendered until December 1998, when the last movement, widespread unrest. 
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from its base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok withdrew the next generation in Anlong Veng. 
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, the government began 체berzulaufen what Kapitulationen to Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan, in 1998. 
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who was not given, was arrested by government forces in the Dangrek Mountains in 1999. 
He died in 2006 of the Phnom Penh prison, where he waited for his trial. 
As their benefactors they no longer protected, ran most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters in the grinding poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memories. 
Even if a few elite Khmer Rouge official kept their local government posts, because they laid down their arms, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers. 
"These people have very little benefit from the capitulation," said Sok Leang, by the Center for Justice and Reconciliation in Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng, public forums, 
"They are enshrined in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime." 
"They grew without any professional knowledge." 
Sor Lim, 55, joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974 as a teenager, had fought in the jungle to Anlang Veng, before he was to lead a life as a poor rice farmer in 1998. 
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said. 
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat." 
"But now life is difficult, because we have to take care of ourselves." 
The current Khmer Rouge tribunal has also raised concerns here. 
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister facing trial. 
It is the task of the court, the old leaders and to condemn those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it has not said whether it will pursue further action on these four cases. 
That has done little to allay the fears in Anlong Veng to alleviate. 
Recent media speculation, have focused on the Chaem, 64 years, during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's, district leader in the province of Manteay Meanchey was. 
In 2007 it was representative of the Documentation Center of Cambodia told they have the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers probably died. 
On a hot night in the work in the fields of Chaem came to her wooden house on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng. 
As the sun cast a long shadow on the desiccated grass in Chaem it refused to discuss her past in the Khmer Rouge. 
Should the court it would subpoena them, so they refuse to go, she said. 
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said. 
"There would be no more prosecutions, it is war." 
Prime Minister Hun Sen, has fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain if the tribunal to indict suspects, although experts and historians discuss this. 
"Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past," he said. 
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center. 
"Reconciliation with the Khmer Rouge-era will bring together the broken pieces," he said. 
"It is our obligation to set the broken parts together, so that all can understand." 
The Center created the first textbook approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75seitige 'history of Democratic Kampuchea. " 
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng appended to the history books for the high school of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge. 
As is often the case in Cambodia know the young people in Anlong Veng little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's links to the regime. 
Touch Valeak, 19, a student in the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new textbook to help students to understand an important part of their history. 
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought home a book to read it. 
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said. 
"They are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people will be condemned by the court." 
This resistance makes the reconciliation process is complex and complicated, said Sok Leang. 
But the public forums, the textbook and the court to gain influence, "he said. 
Still, the Khmer Rouge is a powerful attraction. 
The top in the Dangrek Mountains is a Str채uchern 체berwucherter and with plastic waste verdreckter path to a rectangle of black soot covered by pair of rusty metal roof. 
Pol Pot's body has been on a pile of burning tires in 1998 after his death. 
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a handy saleswoman at the roadside, said she does not know much about the man who was burned. 
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here to pray for him to go," she said. 
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later in the day to go Pol Pot's final resting place, where they wanted to give you a Busch ripe bananas for will, in the hope that it brings their luck.
