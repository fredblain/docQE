The Berlusconi government, meet in Italy 
After a disturbing week for Italy early yesterday, the situation with the decline in key interest rates to 10 years a little more relaxed. 
A return to a deceitful silence. 
At the end of the meeting with the minister of economy, the region chairman Giulio Tremonti the situation as "unentzifferbar" and qualify it with an "unpredictable" weekend, expect to hear the question, however, immediately denied. 
On Tuesday however, the gap with the German interest rates, and prices reached its record of 210 basis points of the treaties to cover the risk of bankruptcy, have risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain Kopflosigkeit in Rome. 
Silvio Berlusconi was in his ministers pointed out that the discrepancy in Spain the German interest rates 400 basis points. 
His right-hand man, Gianni Letta, was, however, as "seriously concerned" by the market turbulence "and a" potential risk of infection from Ireland. 
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone, such as Greece or Ireland." 
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," said Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute. 
The plain fact is that his problem is the part of economic growth and the concomitant, Schwind addicts tax receipts, which put the state in danger, no longer able to cover its funding needs. 
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government. 
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and by 1.4% in 2012... although it expected the Senate to examine this budget with 1.3% and 2% respectively. 
Under these conditions, the EU Commission, will calculate next year's budget deficit to 4.3% of GDP (contrary to the governments predicted 3.9% and 3.5% in 2012 (2.7%). 
Hence the uproar about a new budget, which collectively after the holidays to a value of EUR 7 billion could be used. 
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn. 
At the time Italy receives the support of international institutions. 
"The foundations of Italy's economy is in order and its accounts are regulated, repeat that we have for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF is charged with Italy. 
"At the moment, there are no problems neither short-term nor long-term, since Italy despite its high level of debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d, R.) lower stabilisation for progress will be monitored by other countries," Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD. 
There remains the question of political Unstetigkeit. 
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi, facing a motion of the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the preferred elections could be organized before the end of March. 
It is also a little favorable period for a decision on a serious crisis.
