Prosecutors will not indict Senator Ensign 
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice, Senator John Ensign acquitted of charges after his affair with a former election worker and his attempt to give her husband a lobbying against him has been collected, the lawyers of the senator announced on Wednesday. 
The decision closed the most serious charge against Senator Ensign, Republican of Nevada, until the scandal made headlines across the country, and a drubbing to his career, it was as a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2012. 
As Senator Ensigns office announced that he was "delighted" about the judgment of the one-year study. 
The Senate Ethics Committee could, however, still a Disziplar penalty. 
According to the Ensigns lawyers they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were recruited and that no further charges in this matter. 
The Justice Ministry did not comment on the case. 
The judgment was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. They believe there was sufficient evidence that the ban on lobbying Ensign has ignored. 
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that have been revealed for the first time in the New York Times in October 2009, gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of its election workers to gave lucrative contracts to buy his silence about the affair with Hamptons wife Cynthia. 
Cynthia Hampton was active during an election campaign as a treasurer of Ensigns. 
Ensign, contact some political friends to Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogations he assumed for them following the suspension Hamptons lobbying. 
Hampton was recently in Ensigns election team, it was a year had he not lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate. 
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton before the affair were chummy, against the so-called revolving door ban Lobbykratie. 
According to the published evidence "apparently it is an agreement and the violation of the revolving door statutes," Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients, which is targeted by the government. 
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to the reasons for the decision to announce in the Ensign case, said Mr. brand and other ethics lawyers, the department notes very careful in accepting political charges after a series of setbacks that have been followed with great interest by the media, including the decision last year that the charges against the former Senator Ted Stevens because of misconduct by the prosecutor to drop. 
Prosecutors "are obviously detention," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the Association of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington "(an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in Parliament and government circles in the United States), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr. Ensign has brought before the courts. 
"This means that, in general, high government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to you," she added. 
Paul Coggins, main defenders of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call from a public prosecutor on Monday and another the next day, where he was told that the Ministry will not levy any charges against his clients. 
Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator, as his office in a statement on Wednesday repeated again, "acted in accordance with the law." 
Mr. Coggins refused, the legal arguments that he had made with prosecutors to explain in more detail. 
"I am not here to go into the details of talks between me and the Ministry of Justice, but it must be said that we believe that we have taken the right decision," he said. 
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided that the investigations of a separate appeal by the group to suspend the payment of $96,000 on Mr. Ensigns parents to the Hamptons have infringed the federal election law. 
The election commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money was anything other than a gift. 
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which supported the senator for a long time, was one of the firms, in which Mr. Hampton thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign was work of lobbyists. 
An e-mail in December 2008 shows that, after the company brought on Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, who told him that he had a conversation with Mr. Hampton in the interior ministry for a cause "anklopfe." 
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and other customers from Nevada, Allegiant Air, to lunch and asked the minister of transport, agreed to convene a meeting on behalf of the airline, given that Mr. Hampton for lobbying had stopped. 
For the first time last year when information about this affair to the public came to apologize to Mr. Ensign and his constituents and his position in the hierarchy of Republicans in the Senate, where he had been in fourth place. 
After many months, was not struck two weeks ago, Mr. Ensign told reporters that he wanted a third term in the Senate. 
In an announcement that Mr. Ensign no longer be the target of police investigations, said his press secretary, Jennifer Cooper, the senator quickly follow the example of the Justice Ministry and his hope that the ethics committee investigations einstelle. 
"Senator Ensign is pleased to continue its hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
