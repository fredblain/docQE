To know that this series will be decided by penalty shootout, not worried about it, because he knows his players: "You will never arrive, the penalty shootout to finish in the regular game, but sometimes there is no alternative and we must be prepared in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately we were the fate of a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the strong desire to keep the title already in the hands, which left us something for the final, and we hope that this time it will not happen." 
It is in Romanso power, not just second to be champion and the glory of the expense for the first time, the title.
