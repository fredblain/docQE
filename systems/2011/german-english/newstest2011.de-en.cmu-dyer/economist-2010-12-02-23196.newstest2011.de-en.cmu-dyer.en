Weak applause for China 
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland. 
What is his big brother on the other side of the Taiwan Straits? 
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters in five city districts, which are 70% of all eligible voters to elect mayors and local councilors. This will be seen as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou. 
By building a pioneering business relations, einschl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbol for relations with the mainland, its policy has greatly changed the relationship to the Chinese motherland, for the first time since 1949. 
Ma has insisted the examination, but only barely. 
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) mayor, three of the five, it received a majority of votes. 
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which favors greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the votes, the KMT has received 45%. 
In a presidential election would mean for Ma problems. 
Since his election two years ago, has fallen by approximately 8%. The share of his party. 
For the first time, the DPP, together with the KMT in the city. 
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as convoys of trucks with rioters, flags-schwenkende mass parades and only scantily clad dancers. 
There was even the obligatory, mysterious murder attempt. 
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, in a speech on the eve of the election, a KMT candidate 
In the face of a man from the crowd when he resigned, lien was wounded and a umstehender bystander were killed. 
Bizarre Weiser, it is not clear whether the shooter lien kill or wanted to settle a dispute with the candidates. 
Irrespective of the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the election affected the KMT and the DPP has been in a bad light, which has brought more votes. 
China was perhaps the biggest winners in the campaign. 
Remarkably, the issue of relations with the mainland was not broached. 
Instead, the candidates debated on plans for social housing and job creation. 
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence, and oppose China's military threat. 
This is why the KMT not to the fore in its relations with the government in Beijing. 
But this time, the DPP also avoided too much fuel to the anti-Chinese feelings. 
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China. 
Ma turn would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese support for its China policy. 
The Beijing government will continue to pursue its strategy to attract Taiwan with economic incentives in the community. 
China sent an immediate negotiators for Taipei to prepare for a summit on security of investment and medical cooperation. 
Certainly it wants a political integration, but the most important thing first. 
We prefer to wait until after the 2012 presidential election. 
The DPP has now reinvented itself. 
Two years ago it was severely weakened, the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption. 
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008 he was pressing for the absolute independence. 
But under tais reign has developed a new generation of politicians and the DPP gem√§ssigter fighting for the votes of the professionals and the youth. 
Tsai was great approval as the presidential candidate of the DPP, as Su Tseng-chang, Chen. 
Their party is doing everything to show that they, too, is in a position to develop close relations with Beijing. 
Tsai is planning a think tank as a contact point between the DPP and China, which, however, open-minded discussions. 
Tsai said publicly that their party is a "trustworthy alternative" to offer Mas vorschneller rapprochement with China. 
Chen seems very angry about this change. 
From his cell, he said, the DPP candidate would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence. 
He even asked the pragmatists Su to waive the presidential candidacy. 
Even without Chen's interference is difficult for the DPP to choose its possible candidates. 
The KMT will have a self-analysis. 
Ma's values are low, despite the rapid economic growth, the KMT candidates to lead their campaign without him. 
The main reasons for his unpopularity, unemployment and the increasing gap between rich and poor. 
A KMT spokesman said that he will revamp his cabinet and local institutions. 
The strong performance of DPP suggests that Taiwan is a rapprochement only limited support. 
At the same time, most Taiwanese see the inevitable economic cooperation with China. 
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no turning back."
