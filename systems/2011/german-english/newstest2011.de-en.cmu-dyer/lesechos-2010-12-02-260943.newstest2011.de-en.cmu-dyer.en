World Cup 2018-2022, Fifa appoints the host country 
In the heat because of suspicions of corruption appoints the Fifa executive committee on Thursday the host countries of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a highly political election, in which the Rangeln influence and the lobbying threatening to push the technical criteria in the background. 
But one thing is certain: the 2018 edition will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold, the King discipline Fifa (the four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and Netherlands-Belgium). 
The 2022 edition will be somewhat exotic; the International Football Association hopes to premiere on the African continent in the new territories in 2010 (Qatar, Australia) to win, or its establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to follow. 
The list of personalities that the Delegation zugehörig (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, head of the Belgian and Dutch government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) is the level of economic and political use of the World Cup. 
The machinations behind the scenes could also hold up until the last minute. 
Difficult otherwise, a hierarchy of candidates. 
After the evaluation report of Fifa, the English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts bessseren arguments than their competitors. 
But these considerations for the 22 members of the Exekutif Kommitees not be so important at the time of the election. 
The Sunday Times to bring about the suspension of two members of the Exekutif Kommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, could just as well the opportunities for their own country, the birthplace of football, can ruin, was allowed to hold the World Cup only once, in 1966. 
The BBC had given the ground again on Monday, giving it a documentary was broadcast, the three influential members of the Kommitees, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz, and Issa Hayatou is under fire. 
Reason enough, upsetting Fifa and the English responsible to embarrass, primarily with David Cameron in recent weeks had an intensive lobbying. 
The head of government hopes for a resumption of the train, the successful chess in 2005 by his predecessor Tony Blair had achieved the organization of the 2012 Olympics for London. 
This intensive use would meet to enhance the image of England before the committee again? 
Nothing is less certain, because the Spain-Portugal duo is not lacking in assets with its already justify his expertise (World Cup stadiums, 82 in 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and his football culture. 
But the economic and financial downside of the two countries could dampen their ambitions. 
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal, the chances of Russia, which despite its shortcomings in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become the major outsider, rise. 
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to candidly suggestion to Bezichtigungen the English press "unfair competition" in the preparations for the vote from the committee members denounced. 
"You bewirft them with dirt, trying to embarrass them," Putin lashed out. 
In 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, the logical favorites. 
The first economic world power, the seat of Fifa's main sponsors, the country seems a long list of benefits to Japan and South Korea, which have drawn up a very good project separately. 
But these new nominations seem premature for two countries that the competitions were organized in 2002 with. 
Another threat: the long-awaited approval of the World Cup by Fifa 2026 for China, the Asian opportunities for 2022 lapses. 
With Australia and Qatar, with the appearance futuristischer stadiums had pulled out all the stops, the Fifa pursue its expansion into new areas, but these two countries are a bigger risk, because certainty. 
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea under the akquittierten weakness of television rights (of the European countries have been suffering due to the time shift), the sensitive nerve by Fifa.
