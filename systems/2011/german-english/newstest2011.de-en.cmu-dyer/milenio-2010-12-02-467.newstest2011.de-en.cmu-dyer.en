China has maintained its targets to reduce greenhouse gases 
The Chinese representative on the COP16, said his country had made great efforts to reduce their carbon footprints and it would maintain its offer 40-45% by 2020 and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. 
China believes its offer to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases by 40-45% by 2020, said Su Wei, the representatives of this country on the COP16. 
In his first public appearance in the 16 United Nations summit on climate change (COP16) assured Su Wei, his country had made huge efforts to reduce carbon footprints and convert its industry. 
He said that his country have invested $245 million in the last four years to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. 
However, he said that China would not change its objectives, but would work with the international community on this matter. 
He said that China's strategy on climate change in four aspects sub: dialogue, capacity building, development of institutions and support pilot programs. 
We have made progress in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, the targets for the reduction of the emission of gases include, he said. 
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the state with the central government and local authorities had worked together to the targets for saving energy, an effective use of energy and the reduction of emissions. 
Furthermore, there are already some long-term plans to tackle or have been completed, both those who were funded by the Chinese government, as well as those who received money from other countries. 
For example, he was referring to the program for the effective use of energy, which was introduced in the last five years and investment of the United Nations (UN), the government and had received from private hands. 
There is also a project at provincial level on climate change, another to replace the traditional light bulbs with energy-efficient light bulbs and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said. 
Martin Krol, government scientific adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts would be far greater than is commonly believed. 
It showed that the per-capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China six tons per person, while in the United States at 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a 9% overall contribution to the pollution. 
It is also making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use for energy efficiency has increased by 20 percent in the last five years and another to be done by the year 2020, he said.
