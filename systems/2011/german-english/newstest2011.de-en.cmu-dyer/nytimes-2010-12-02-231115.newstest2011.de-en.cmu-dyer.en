Tech Toys keeps presents budget in balance 
The iPad is the favorite among the gifts this year, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can take a considerable hole in their budget gifts. 
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect-game about 10 traditional spring rush or approximately 48 doses of Play-Doh. 
But they can protect their gifts budget. 
I recently visited in search of three electronic toys under $80 three national toy retailers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club. 
I was immediately clear that Moore's law was in force. This year, the technology toys more efficient and cost less than at the same time last year. 
And while fewer new toys with its own website, is in the best-known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, a wider range. 
There are more button-cell-powered toys on the market, and many of them contain phone batteries. 
Here are a few recommendations. 
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices of Toys' R 'Us.) 
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for children 3 years) are PlüSch characters, such as guinea pigs who sing a note, if you take on your stomach turns. 
Once, in a note that number, you can play a song. 
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony. 
Respect: If you with the press have begun, they can no longer stop. 
For a combination of Gesand and dance the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price is $60 for children, 2) the best option. 
On the basis of the last year developed technology offers the animatronische Elmo Live doll recantations as' Simon says' toes, and thanks to the new interface with wheel blocking dominated the moon-walk. 
Children who tested the device to use Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complained about the lack of noise regulation. 
If you are a child of the 1980s, you surely remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys. 
Now he is back (Hasbro / play Kool, $40 for children, 3), with a whole bunch of question cards, which can be a lesson to a car journey, with a better know auto correction function as a teacher. 
If your child does not want to entrust their smartphone, there are three independent alternatives. 
VTech MobiGo ($60 for children 3 to 8) is the cheapest and user-friendly solution, equipped with a QWERTY keyboard, which contained the games, however, are not as useful as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children 3 to 12, leapfrogs), the first major revision of the Leapster series is equipped with a new, brighter screen. 
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes. 
IXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children 3-7) used for the games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD cards Laufwerks family photographs can also be seen. 
Finally, there is still a Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children 8). The five blocks are not bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen. 
In the game, there is a need to merge the blocks of words before the time is running out, and it is great to improvise a Buchstabier competition. 
More and more toys have a kind of online connection. 
If you alone after the supply in the toy shops, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important. 
Her child to an animal in the Club Penguin online, you can, for example, a Disney's Club Penguin 2 mix 'n' match figures buy package ($5 for children 6-12), which contains a coin with a secret code. 
If it gets the code online, her child the Club Penguin Store enough credits for a further two parts. 
This can roll shoes or a Puffle substance animal. 
The latest head-cell-powered micro-robots that Hexbug Nano ($10 for children 5) is not bigger than the head of your toothbrush. 
The Käfer moves quickly to 12 vibrierenden silicone legs in any direction. 
It is fun to send it through a maze of Klötzen. 
And he does a lot. 
We fell from the kitchen table and even weathered some time in the dog's foot.
