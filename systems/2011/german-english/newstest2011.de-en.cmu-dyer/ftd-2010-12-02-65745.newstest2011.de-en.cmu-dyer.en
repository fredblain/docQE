Talents struggle for high-potential 
There is a strong surge on the buffet. 
16 students are flocking to salmon sandwich, tomato soup and sweet. 
The Braunschweig Technical University and the Volkswagen car, the engineering and design students invited to a workshop. 
They are in a kind of competition of ideas along with VW developers on the car of the future jargon and incidentally Volkswagen learning. 
In the contest for the brightest are now many companies in the close fight and, as VW, in cooperation with universities. 
Their mission: to recruit talented graduates in the Hörsälen as soon as possible, before they go on the labor market and being courted by others. 
And because the universities do not give data about the performance of their students, trying to spot the exceptional talents in practice projects and to tie itself. 
On the second day of the workshop in the TU Braunschweig, the car company to the talent. 
A young lady from the personnel department distributed ballpoint pens, Gummibärchen and folders with VW logo. 
They told the hopeful young talent training programs and student jobs and shows you ways in the company. 
Tu Nico Selle Braunschweig cared for the project with VW. 
He sees the benefits for both sides, "the students are in contact with industry and gain experience." 
"VW cannot at the same time, students learn about interesting candidates closer looky and think about who would be the staff in question." 
Such cooperation, Selle, are not unusual. 
The new offensive is that students will be gebuhlt. 
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project," says Selle. 
The battle for the fresh graduates will be even harder. 
In many industries, businesses can choose from a large crowd of candidates, their staff no longer. 
But they must advertise and especially balzen highly skilled labor. 
Graduates, especially from the engineering disciplines are in a strong negotiating position. 
According to the Association of German engineers VDI remained in October on 40,000 engineering posts vacant. 
According to VDI's forecasts, and the so-called 'engineering gap will be even greater. 
The business audit and consultancy firm KPMG, Roman Dykta on the talent hunt. 
He organized consuming recruiting events such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern schnitzel hunting, in which the participants using GPS coordinates must find their way. 
Eight promising students will send companies across the United States next year. 
Incidentally, the participants can look at KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company. 
Who must decide in two rounds of selection in the run-up. 
Only the crème de la crème of many applicants flies to the United States. 
The slashing and burning of the high potential in the universities, the guns according to Dykta widening. 
"We want to be with the race from the mass withdrawals." 
"Just a simple Segeltörn was not enough for us." 
The bill seems to talent hunters Dykta aufzugehen. 
"We have to date with all the participants a similar action last year contact." 
"Some of them are nearing completion and will soon apply to us," he says. 
In addition to the direct courting on campus, especially small and medium-sized enterprises also quite Classic at career fairs to Pirsch. 
"We try to achieve graduates at a technical measure." 
"Some on the global solar," said Sitha Stübe, head of personnel at the SolarWorld solar technology manufacturers. 
The Bonn company employs around 1,500 workers in Germany. 
Stübe know about the growing problem. 
There are currently 35 posts advertised on the company website. 
"It is very difficult to fill vakante positions." 
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says. 
Another way is to touch on the uni-professors. 
Solarworld cooperates with different universities, including the University of Freiberg. 
"The professors are evidence that we can work or write his diploma work." 
The solar specialists expensive advertising campaigns are not needed. 
The company is trying to promote with other benefits: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication. 
"This is a great company often do not provide," says staff head Stübe. 
Money discouraged workers no longer plays a key role. 
Flexible working hours, childcare or good career opportunities are other key factors. 
Solarworld came in a study of the Great Place to Work Institute 55. place among the 100 best employers in Germany. 
The Institute produced an annual list of best German employers. 
It asked people how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and look at the conditions for the workers. 
Staff head Stübe also hoped the placement, plus the Jobsuchenden. 
"I think that applicants particularly after external assessments on a potential employer look," she says.

He advises his clients to more authenticity. 
And that means, according to Kriegler, especially internal measures. 
"The best way to make an attractive employer, on its own staff," he says. 
The industry jargon, the internal employer branding employer brand education within its own workforce. 
"Happy employees are the best ambassadors." 
If you treat its people well and they identify with the companies, they would not by itself to friends and acquaintances for their employers. 
"This is a game with ties," says Kriegler.
