Grammy nominations: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly in the category of excellent newcomer of the year 
If you are on the question of a presidential speech, people will say it. 
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding, the Nobel ceremony of the 2009. Now, the 26-year-old jazz singer Ã¼Berrach Bassistin and sender, nominated for a Grammy this year in the category of newcomer of the year. 
In view of the fact that Spalding since their 2008 album "Esperanza" in the jazz scene is already a celebrated star, the nomination appears to be a little unusual, but it is the Grammy rules under which an artist before publication of the albums, he became known among the general public, with only three Alben should have been given out. 
The ambitious album of the year 2010, "Chamber Music Society" is certainly a step forward, and with its beschwingten voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, can be compared with Norah Jones 2003 calmly Spalding, whose great success in 2003, when the nomination in that category jazz Interpretin Spaldings comes closest. 
It was also the Album "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer trio nominated in the category Alben instrumental, a favorite of critics saw it a huge success. 
The competitors Iyers include "moody" experienced 4B Saxophonisten James Moody and Keyboarders "Positootly" John Beasley. 
Trombone Shorty, a robbery of some favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBOs "Treme," was in the category of contemporary jazz excellent in the otherwise rather Alben of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber. 
The wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue's Secret Societ received in the category of large group deserved attention. He is thus against Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber-jazz and the adventure Lustigen Dave Holland and his Oktett, whose Life-Ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a Bassisten as a Democratic leader.
