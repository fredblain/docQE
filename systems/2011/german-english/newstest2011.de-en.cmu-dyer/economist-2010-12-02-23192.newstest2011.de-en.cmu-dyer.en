The demokatrische Routine 
The democracy movement is growing in Latin America, such as the support of private companies. 
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment. 
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is larger than that of the United States. 
These results came the Latinobarómetro poll, conducted in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist. 
The survey will be carried out regularly since 1995 and shows the exchange of opinion in this region. 
Two facts are covered in the survey in September and October, especially in this year's eye. 
First, the good mood in Latin America 
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy, and their most important institutions. 
In many countries of the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased dramatically (S table 1). 
In Peru, for example, where the economy has been growing at a rate of approximately 6%. annually, since 2002, the number of democracy activists rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. 
In Mexico, where the economy since the great crash recovered last year, is such a trend. 
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, reducing the regional average (s). chart 2). 
Approximately 44% of the respondents said that they are satisfied with their country's democratic practice and that as many as last year, 25% more than in 2001 (chart 3). 
Approximately 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values are those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and / or 24%). 
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined the efforts for more democracy. 
This lasted even during the global economic crisis, is probably the fact that the Latin American countries have experienced only a brief recession and quickly recovered. 
In addition, the poor through stronger social network instead. 
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, rose only slightly in 2009, the poverty rate in Latin America and is again this year fell by 32%). 
But there are strong differences (S mood from country to country. chart 4). 
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread progress thinking. 
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and violent crime have increased, this is less the case. 
For only the second time since the beginning of the survey, many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country a bigger problem than unemployment (s). chart 5). 
Approximately 31% say that either they or a family member have been victim of a crime, but last year to 38% last year, the values dropped and thus achieve the lowest level since 1995. 
The rising economic performance is reflected in the strong support of the private sector and the market economy: approximately-71% of respondents said that the private sector is essential for development, in 2007 there were 56% (s. chart 6). 
Approximately 58% said that the market economy can bring their country progress, compared with 47% last year. 
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela maintain this view (and 80% are in favor of a private sector), even though their leftist President, Hugo Chávez, many private companies nationalized. 
Brazil has the 19% of respondents (18% last year) the biggest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year). 
The respondents in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, are the most influential country in the United States, and this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua will be accepted by Venezuela.
