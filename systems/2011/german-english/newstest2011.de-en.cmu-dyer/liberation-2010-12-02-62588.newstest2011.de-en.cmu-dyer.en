Rachsüchtige hackers and race spies 
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a double meaning. 
On one side, it has an obvious scandal, a scandal that only turning a scandal at the sinner is hypocrisy, the Beziehunge between states, the citizens and the press. 
On the other hand, the profound changes at international level, and is a taste of the future dominated by regression. 
But we are in the series. 
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any legislation drafted by a secret service (a) exclusively from any nation newspaper cuttings. 
The "extraordinary" that American revelations about Mr Berlusconi's sexual habits are nothing more than what we have months to read any Journal, anyway (except those whose owners Berlusconi), and the appalling karikaturierte profile Gaddafi's bot Kabarett artists has long been fodder for their skits. 
The rule that the secret dossiers already known only from news must insist, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century. 
If you go into a library, the esotherischen publications, you will see that each work (on the grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) repeatedly exactly what already has been written in previous works. 
This is not only so that the author of occult texts will not publish research (so that he would not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to the Okkultismus, nothing other than to believe what you already know and confirmed what they have learned. 
This is also the success of Dan Brown's mechanism. 
Also, the secret files. 
The informant is lazy, lazy or limited (Spirit) is also the head of the Secret Service (otherwise be whatever he could, for example, editor of Libération), which recognizes only what he regarded as true. 
The top-secret information on Berlusconi, the American embassy in Rome had sent the State squad were the same as those that Newsweek had already published the previous week. 
So why was such a fuss about the revelation of this dossier? 
On one side, which stipulate that every educated person already know, and that the embassies, at least since the end of the second world war, and since then the heads of government will also be able to call each other or an airplane, in order to meet dinner-have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small representation tasks have turned into espionage centers. 
Any viewer from identifying films knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that you pretend to ignore this. 
Nevertheless, the fact that it violated public to repeat the task of hypocrisy and serves to American diplomacy in a bad light. 
My second point: the idea that an X-any hackers geheimsten secrets can tap into the most powerful country in the world, is a major blow to the prestige of the state Dezernats. 
Moreover, the scandal rather than the victims, "the executioner" in trouble. 
But we have to address the profound nature of what happened. 
Previously, Orwell's time, it was all power as a big brother pool, every gesture controlled his subjects. 
Orwell's prophecy could have since proved to be quite right, where every movement you can monitor the telephone made, every transaction, visited the hotel, the elected motorway and so on; the citizens would be the total victims of the eye of the power. 
Bearing in mind what is happening today, however, that even the secret Krypten power can no longer escape the control of hackers, so does the control order to be unilaterally directed and will circle shaped. 
The power control every citizen, but everyone, or at least the hacker acquired experience as the vindicator of the citizen, the secrets of power. 
But how can a power that is no longer in a position to maintain their own secrets? 
It is true, Georg Simmel said that a real secret is an open secret (and an empty can never be revealed secret); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi or Merkel's basically free from Geheimis is a mystery, because it exposes the public sphere; but the styles of WikiLeaks reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty secrets, means that they have no power to deprive. 
WikiLeaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wronged but Clinton and Obama. 
What are the consequences of this affront to be such a great power has been done? 
It is obvious that the States will make no more reserved information online in the future-that would be a angeklebten posting on the street corner. 
But it is equally obvious that the current technology is to be hoped in vain to keep secret, confidential reports on telephone. 
Nothing is easier than finding out whether and when a head of state in a plane moving and has been in contact with one of his colleagues. 
How could in future be private and only for certain ears maintain relations? 
I know very well that my prediction at the moment, science fiction and Roman prison sounds, but I am compelled to imagine the government agents in secret active way to uncontrollable March routes moving, their communications anywhere else than in a mere memory, and, in addition to the few written information you have, shoe (verbergend. 
The information would be stored in single copy in closed drawers: basically, the espionage attempt by Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks. 
I had the opportunity to write that the technology today as a cancer progresses, namely backwards. 
A century after the wireless telecommunications Graf had revolutionized the communication, reconstructed the Internet a Telegraph with (telephone) wire. 
The video (analog) had the film band for researchers, a Band auszukundschaften from the back forward spulen and all could reveal secrets of the installation, while the (digital) CDs now allow nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter in macro-portions. 
With the high-speed trains traveling within three hours by plane from Rome to Milan, while including the switching requires three and a half hours. 
It is not extraordinary that, policy and communications technology in cars and horse to come back. 
One final observation. 
In earlier times tried to understand what the press for secrets between the embassies were forged. 
Currently, there are the messages that confidential information from the press.
