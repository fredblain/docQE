The army has so many install detonators and that there is a Czech umwickeln it could, but only two years 
The Czech Army has 445 kilometers install detonators bought with explosives detonated. 
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defense had already 224 kilometers but delivered to the army camp. 
It is reassuring to know that the forces have ausgesorgt for 225 years. 
The only problem is the durability of the install detonators, two, but no more than four years. 
The army bought the install detonators from the company STV Group, A. S. for paltry 40 million kroner. 
In his justification for the purchase of this huge amount but said the general staff MF DNES that the soldiers would annually to the 60 kilometers but consume. 
According to the research of Army pyro technicians MF DNES raised, it is clear from this indication that the whole army should an intensive pyrotechnic training every year-of all the generals and officers of the army commandos, to the secretaries and boast women. 
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek is no exception. 
Only then could the remarkable annual consumption of 60 kilometers Zündschnüren reasonably justified. 
Incidentally, this length is 25,000 Detonationen. 
Even so, the Army stocks for more than ten years. 
But even the old rule of experts is that any new professional soldiers to train two meters but enough, then the army by this new purchases, and from the point of view of the increased needs of pioneering and special units, a reassuring stockpile for the mentioned 225 years. 
Soldiers of the Rapid Reaction Brigade, complained the defense Vondra recently that they have almost no cartridges for handheld weapons, so more shooting exercises are severely restricted because of the lack of resources. 
Not to mention the lack of underpants. 
"I do not think it is also why they are such huge Zündschnüre buy." 
But in the end, this is your decision, they will already know what they need. " 
"The Army is a good customer for us, which we, as traders largely to meet," says the marketing manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký. 
Jan Pejšek, the defense ministry's spokesman justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometers, but the Army could have been so for at least ten years with this "ammunition". 
Jan Děcký of the STV Group, however, only a four-year duration of the install detonators and use of police and army Pyrotechniker even just two years ago. 
"With perfect storage also mentioned the four years are possible," one of them, but the unnamed wants to be accused of not criticizing the army as a soldier. 
After long-term use of any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether they are reliable and not endanger the lives of soldiers. 
These tests have not been in vain, but cost more money. 
Another argument of the defense ministry is the amount of rebate for the 445 kilometers but. 
"It cost us 60% less than last year's supply of 244 kilometers," spokesman Pejšek tells us the position of the buyers of the Defense Ministry. 
Only by way of comparison, the annual consumption of Zündschnüren of pyro technicians of the police, the ammunition from the second world war or liquidate the Soviet brother army exceeds some years barely 1,500 meters. 
And the police are always such quantities of ammunition, which use it before the end of the period can consume. 
The safety of pyro technicians because, in addition, there is the possibility of a flexible purchases more modern and reliable Zündschnüre open. 
The Defense Ministry has already huge problems in the liquidation of the tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, as the two hundred thousand members Czechoslovak people's army preparing for their campaign to the Rhine. 
The pyro technicians, according to the MF DNES raised, expected the Czech armed forces in the same problem a few years ago in the killing of hundreds of kilometers age Zündschnüre today as "good" has bought.
