Cheshire-based power on Twitter attention 
Half a dozen of them tippten in the riots in the courtroom. 
In the minutes breath verschickten you on Twitter their reports on grausige testimonies. 
In the end, the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the process to rape and beds gekettete children in a house that flare. 
On Thursday, the closely watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was charged with killing three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, to have a formal end, if the ruling on the death sentence, imposed by the jury. 
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already filed motions in court to explain the reasons for an appeal to the courts for years to come. 
Provozierendsten one of the reasons is that the intensive coverage of the process, and the extensive use of Twitter by average reporter, a "circus atmosphere" and such a widespread, swift penetration rebel details came in, so that the jury had been improperly influenced by the public indignation. 
This protest the Appelation courts could lead to new rules to deal with the question of whether the new technologies will be needed in the courtroom. 
"As I have seen during this process, I believe that there is a real danger that the arrival of new technologies in the courtroom on every individual's right to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes's defenders. 
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue by the Supreme Court chamber, said last week the amendments by ruling succinctly when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions. 
But this was certainly not the last word on this matter. 
For decades, Court of Appeals noted that the reporting of notorious cases raising doubts about the fairness of the process. 
In his historic 1966 decision, the Supreme Court of the United States the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Cleveland osteopaths, killed his wife, will be lifted and said in its decision that it would have been because of the "new media" a carnival atmosphere in the courtroom. 
Some believe that the television series and the movie "on the flight" is based on the crime. 
Some lawyers say court of appeals, which Mr. Hayes condemnation could see half a century later, the argument that new rules are necessary to ensure that the channels of communication from the courtroom at the time of the event, Dr. Sheppard was unimaginable to regulate. 
"There is a good reason, on the impact of new media to be in trials of the general public to be concerned," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut, according to his report, it arbitrarily imposed. 
Professor Donohue said, some appelation courts could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of instant communications out of the courtroom could make the process fairer. 
The Twitter issue is just one of many that the lawyers from Mr. Hayes set to debate for years and thus delay a condemnation. 
The defender, for example, claim that Mr. Hayes could have been tried before, Judge Blue did not allow them to test the reactions of potential judges, giving them during the judges selected grausige scene photographs showed. 
Some of the judges said that photos of the victim, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and its TÃ¼chter, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years, they have met with disgust. 
Defenders say it would also call into question the constitutionality of the death penalty is constitutional, and argue that the judge wrongly a jury have exchanged, a critic of the prosecutor's office, and that he was improperly put pressure on the ruling, as he had taken the unusual decision to ask the jury for free over the weekend. 
The judges were not isolated. 
But their arguments about the impact of the detailed reporting about the process, perhaps the greatest interest. 
In a court dispute that they have submitted last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and the American Senate was discussed by the candidates. 
They argued that the new media have continuously re-ignite the flames of emotion on the case. 
"Such a daily crush of media Piepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "we have never experienced before in New Haven, and perhaps even across the country." 
Their focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial. 
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that direct news reports are rabble than be reimbursed more slowly, a technology hostile view is that the report on future processes verarme. 
However, some lawyers said that appelation courts were often faced with the argument that social and technological changes require the adaptation of the courts. 
Mr. Hayers lawyers reinforce that claim. 
In their appeal, they were based on the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, the sentencing of Dr. Sheppard was lifted on the basis of the report and made it clear that the new media require new rules. 
"This case," they wrote, "represented Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21 century."
