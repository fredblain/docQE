Arsenic-resistant microbe could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere 
The discovery of an alien bacteria type of arsenic can live, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth, and elsewhere. 
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, you think it is a sign that a life without the necessary elements so far in life is possible. 
"This organism has two options." 
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." 
"It is something very special, although it is almost a sort of 'foreign' way of life," said C.W. Paul Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears in the online edition of the journal Science on Thursday. 
So far six main elements have been regarded as a vital carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur. 
But, as the scientists discovered the bacterium in Mono Lake, California is growing even further if it phosphor replaced by arsenic. 
"One wonders what else is possible," said the report's co-author Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University. 
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists, its forms have to recognize in Anbar. 
The study deals with microbes that have been found on Earth. 
The announcement of a press conference that no details of the discovery were made known, led to widespread speculation that the report by the discovery of aliens living on the Internet. 
This is not the case. 
The discovery "shows that in other planet systems organisms with the help of other elements can kickstart biochemical processes, and that the 'standard', which, in our opinion, are absolutely vital elements are not necessarily set out," said Charles Cockell, Professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University in Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. 
Cockel was not part of the research teams. 
"This work is a novelty because it shows that in fundamental biochemical processes and structures an element can be replaced by another," added Cockell. 
The discovery was not accidental. 
Felisa Wolfe-Simon by Astro biological Institute of NASA, which led the study, chose the Mono Lake because of the high arsenic content. 
Arsenic and phosphorus, the same chemical that microbes that are both suspended, possibly an element could replace by the other. 
"The toxicity of the Arsens is mainly based on the fact that it is chemically the same as phosphorus." 
"The organisms will find it hard to distinguish one element from the other." 
"But the difference is so great that arsenic is different than phosphorus. it into our bio-chemical system, where almost all covered," said Anbar. 
The researchers, the bacterium GFAJ 1 an increasing concentration of arsenic. It is fit and grew. 
The microbe is growing in phosphorus in arsenic can survive better, but that it also shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on earth or another planet or moon, often on the arsenic. 
According to Jamie S. Foster, believe for microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new, but so far there has been still no functioning example. 
Arsenic was in the early years of the earth more frequently, she says, and that is why the scientists assumed that early forms of life that have been used. 
"There is reason to believe that life may have evolved differently, as in the early was not so," Forster, the member of Wolfe-Simon's research team. 
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and national health authorities.
