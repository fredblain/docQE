A bone House fascinated even after 100 years to look at the Interieure Gaudi. 
The roof seems to like the back of a prehistoric Echse steps, such as the vertebral column of Dinosauriers and Balkone aufgerissene fish MäUler. 
This is the Casa Batlló of Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. 
The local residents received the house with its organic forms the nickname of "Hell House." 
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, Kachel Splittern and Mosaic to shed like facades and ubiquitous soft lines, these are all standard features for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi. 
The façade of the house playing with traumhaften lines, zärtlichen paints and Texturen, reminding of nature and life. 
Only on closer inspection, they noticed that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order. 
In the night, the whole facade is plastic, dramatic and the special Anleuchtung reinforced the glory of the colors. 
The same dynamic lines and devious forms dominate the home of the house. 
Waves of formed wood copied the barriers, ornamental elements of doors, window frames, and even Gucklöcher. 
The House Batlló the quarter Eixample in the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia 43 was created by the restructuring of a house from the years 1877, the architects Emilio Sala Cortese said. 
The reconstruction took two years and 1906 was completed. 
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he voted the idea Gaudís on an unusual and cheaper restructuring. 
The Mietshaus Casa Batlló architect Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone. 
He worked with the architects Josep Maria Jujol. 
It is on the board created the rhetorical flourishes for Representative housing owner of the realities and the use of mosaics in the facade was his idea. 
In the design of the facade, but also worked with a number of other professionals and artists. 
The joint work on the drafts of the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí. 
Jujol was also involved in the construction of Gaudís house Casa Güell Milá in the park, which also contains other works of Antoni Gaudí. 
Shortly after its completion, the house of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for house the nickname of "Bones." 
Others called it the "yawning house" because of the special windows opening mechanism. 
It also says that top of the building is the sword of St. Georg, patrons of Catalonia. 
But other bildhauerische elements also symbolize hidden religious motives. 
Gaudí devised a unique air inlets channels and typical Kaminen central heating system for the time for the house. 
Something weird is already in their 45-degree slope. 
In his create Gaudí consistently ignored all the building regulations and could not be misled by this. 
The start of construction-city of the appropriate planning permission but he repeated the claims made by him on the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers were so horrified by the outcome that they completed two years later on the situation demanded. 
The council members were met, including the fact that the construction of its pillars even in the public pavement intervention. 
Changes, but it was not quite the contrary, only 15 days after the request of the city area, Josep Batlló submitted a request for approval of the rental of the two most situated floors of the house, and he was promptly granted. 
The homeowners themselves, in the lower floors. 
In the gallery in 2. Stock was a society salon, on the third floor were the bedroom and private rooms of housing. 
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry business. 
The entire six-story building is going through a set of stairs right up to the roof terrace. 
The basic elements of the society, all the right corner and alternate lines removed and replaced by Bent and geschwungene walls. 
Gaudí but also worked with a modern approach to the mutual relationship between rooms. 
The society is part of the opening of the salon doors completely link and a larger society more comfortable chatting without confidential talks have to forego a certain intimacy. 
The House received by Gaudís converting into a new façade, a very unusual roof and another two floors. 
Also impressive is Gaudís game with the light and the blue and white glasierten Kacheln, which dressed the courtyard and the Lichthöfe. 
The game these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum of light. 
He is simply exploiting the principle that know the light reflects better than dark colors, on the contrary absorb sunlight. 
The house Casa Batlló, was included on UNESCO's World Heritage list in 2005, everyone can now visit. 
The first stock geräumigste and prächtigste housing is made available to the public. 
The homeowners decided only in years to take this step and this on the occasion of the 150.Geburtstags of the famous designer. 
When it was discovered that this is a very profitable business that it has maintained the visits will also be extended to more common and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace. 
But the price to visit the monument is no trifling matter, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and tourists cards holders get 20 per cent reduction. 
This figure surpasses the entry price to other Gaudí-buildings in the city.
