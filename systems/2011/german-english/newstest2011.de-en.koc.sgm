</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new ratsherren the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously certain language barriers to be overcome in order to maintain their alt-neuen colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and in the stadtvertretung understand at all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The newspaper aktuálně.cz, members of the new Council from the ČSSD time a little "abgeklopft ', as they dominate the notorious slang, the popular in recent years, in which the current coalition partners in Prague were at the helm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The codierte vocabulary, which in the verflossenen era of mayor Pavel bém of the Prague political elite was introduced, is some of the best-known actors, situations and entlehnt causae. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Surprisingly, showed the new councils in relation to these new notions of something in the dark. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At least they say so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "who is voldemort?" </seg>
<seg id="8"> "No idea." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am more of a newcomer in the Prague policy," responded Lukáš kaucký, the new town councillor from for culture, to the test of "paten-wortschatzes." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But the town councillor from Karel Březina - a political veteran, responded in a similar way. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example, to use the word "golfloch." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "This is the only expression of which they are submitting me, which I use now and again." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "otherwise, I believe that not much often infiltrated by slang." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> From the vocabulary of the tageblatt, aktuálně.cz in this year " s June before the electoral congress of the ODS had published, pickte finalizing the six terms, in particular, the notoriously with the Prague Government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Social Democrats should the concepts of 'voldemort,' 'biggest Prague golfloch, "" in the konditorei go, "" stiernacken, "" betrayal of the capital, "and" verblechen. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Three Prague ratsherren agreed to the test, the fourth - Mr weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - first promised his participation in the conversation, but then took no time policemen pick up the telephone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The fifth town councillor from Petr dolínek, rejected the test. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "these things are me, and no matter how the Civic Democrats, each other, about the judgments I not." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "for me, is important, as we understand, within the framework of our programs," he countered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> As already indicated, would have Lukáš kaucký in the above headline allegedly failed to recognize that the influential businessman and friend of the ex-oberbürgermeisters bém, Roman janoušek. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The term "voldemort" says kaucky absolutely nothing and the only one he had on the test correctly erriet, was "the greatest Prague golfloch." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "This is the tunnels," says kaucký blanka, added to its security, but added: "But I know this more out of the newspaper." </seg>
<seg id="23"> And jokingly: "I will be a sprachkurs must show." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The "golfloch" will then not just of matador Karel Březina, but also from the town councillor for the environment Lukáš plachý right as a tunnel entziffert blanka. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Both Democrats also know, however, for whom the notion of voldemort, and Lukáš plachý senses even where this figure is to find and also what it means, "in which to go konditorei." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "I believe that that is, in some kind of Prague company to go," is plachý fairly close to the conundrum solution, if we know that this is the seat of janoušeks firms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> In keeping with Březina, he asserts, however, that this knowledge is more likely to have drawn from the newspaper, that he would embrace this vocabulary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Judging from the testteilnehmern, it appears to be among the Social Democrats, in fact, no similar eingebürgerten slang. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I have asked my colleagues, but there is obviously something we really not." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "We call upon us in the name, and we also use acronym or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr hulínský - by his own party who put "hulda." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "I was in the school bříza (birch), but I do not know whether I am also my colleagues call it," tells us Karel Březina his nickname. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Nicknames are so the only thing that the Social Democrats in the intra-party parlance. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="12"> The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but in the end, he agreed to the idea of gaudís on an unusual and even cheaper reconstruction. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The right mattress and the right bettenrost? women have other wishes than men </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Not the tollste bettrahmen, but the quality of the liegefläche - i.e. mattress and rost, the good bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But they need to be harmonious to complement the desires of the specific user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With regard to the choice of many things - a role to play, the weight, size, health, and, last but not least, the gender of the schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Just as important is the interieur, in the mattress and subordinate rost. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a wochenendhaus, in which not regularly heated, are not well suited latexmatratzen much longer, since they need in order to "warm." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Furthermore, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethan-matratzen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And, they should be turned on a regular basis. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If it is not enough entlüftungskanälchen heart and even to have a solid record,, moisture, so it is not impossible that under their mould. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the election, of course, also plays a role in what you have to get used to. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For long periods of time, who was abroad, where very high mattresses with weichschicht customary practice, will find it hard to a low mattress with hard surface can get. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "probably all hockey players, who have returned from the NHL, have complained to me that they are no longer able to sleep properly." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "for their abgeschundenen shoulders, heels and hüften, they need a simple weichschicht from visco-schaum (memory foam - a formgedächtnis-polymer)." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "This, I recommend including diabetic people under a disorder of the nervous system, so that they are suffering from the" information "from the ligaments and the skin can receive bad," said hadamcziková Sylva, which is on the polstermöbel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> That is why I have many, many years ago eishockeyspielern, but also other customers these mattresses with visco-schaum (memory foam) worried. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses provide tempur among the manufacturers, the Italian company magniflex or the Czech manufacturer tropico." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And it need not necessarily be a famous hockey players, to have the benefits of the visco-schaums will learn to appreciate. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" works really quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The foam optimalisiert his toughness and form, according to the absorbierten heat, in other words, he is a schmiegt on warm body. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Nowhere is there, in the middle of the night shifts we are not as around after a tough fight. </seg>
<seg id="22"> You simply sleep much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The viskoelastische foam also offers protection against dekubitus (wundbrand). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The election of the matratzengröße to body size, it should still be the length of the fußsohlen, is approximately 21 to 34 feet. </seg>
<seg id="25"> As Mrs Mann, of the 180 cm are large need as a 210 to 220 cm long bed. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Each of the schläfer should be at least 90 cm liegebreite available, is a total of 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In einzelbetten, for example in singles, are 120 to 140 feet. </seg>
<seg id="28"> For the sake of comfort, and also for any visitors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise, the following rule of thumb for the ideal bettbreite: "If you are on the back, should still have enough room for the poor," angewinkelten easily traceable. Helena prokopová at ING, the zunftmeisterin the polsterer and raumausstatter, which has for many years the issue of the healthy and makes the ergonomics of furniture is devoting to this issue and nursing schools. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> In a doppelbett each with its own needs and its own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are high too. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise there is nothing, as the roste in different size to fit, and that is not in any bettrahmen possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high with mattresses, federskelett 15 cm, should be at least three centimetres on the formschicht and the feinpolster alone. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "with the hand or sit down, we must in any case, the feathers are," warns Helena prokopová. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Each mattress makes a special rosttyp needed. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Ganzgepolsterte beds with bed and document as zusammengewachsene siamzwillinge have nothing to look in the bedroom. </seg>
<seg id="36"> These mattresses cannot drop and you cannot wash the terms, which today is already. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And because you are in a single night between 0.2 and 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years to an enormous (and congested sieve). </seg>
<seg id="38"> Even so, the experts are opposed werbeslogans mattresses in a lifespan of up to 25 years, and yes even lifelong guarantee promises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Every cause has its ifs and buts. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And it is therefore a practical advice from dealers: mattresses of 120 or 140 feet wide should the hygiene of the waschbaren abziehbaren salary, not be afraid, however, it is recommended that a matratzenschoner, it is easy to use and wash them. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even if today, in the rule matratzenbezüge with rundumreißverschluss be produced, so that after the opening of two halves gets (immensely important for the waschvorgang and the waschmaschinengröße!), it seems the manipulation with larger mattresses, particularly pointed out, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> Have you in bed instead of a rostes a plate? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Get out. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or a maximum for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Also, as you should, rather, the record with lüftungslöchern AAA (if not inside) and mattresses with federskelett and 15 cm floor with so-called taschenfederkern and feinpolster use. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethan-matratzen belong on such a document is not. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For not verstellbare lattenroste with 14 to 18 federleisten (lamellen) are latex- or sandwichmatratzen suited (possibly even combinations of latex and kokos), always pay for it with a larger lattenanzahl roste, 28, and more federleisten, with lordosenstütze in lendenwirbelbereich and the ability to regulate lattenhärte. </seg>
<seg id="48"> On verstellbare lamellenroste include no mattresses with federskelett, because it does not verstellung react to the workplace. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> In addition to the suspension of the stiff the federleisten will also be offered special flexible schultermodule. </seg>
<seg id="50"> This is a specific integration of the federleisten, allowing the federleisten einzudrücken or even to verwinkeln, that it is the specific einsinken the shoulder of the schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Especially for men with broad shoulders of an important matter. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There is even matratzenhersteller have started, "herrenmatratzen" weichzonen to use for the schulterbereich. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Also on the ladies is intended - these weichzonen takes them in the hüftgegend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For ambitious customers are punktelastische flügelfedersysteme (lattoflex) or with punktelastischen roste kontakt-pads with so-called multitorsionsfederung. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure will be distributed on a number of points, which reduces the tension. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But, if you are on the right mattress and correct rost a bad (too large and fülliges), most are used kopfkissen lost benefits. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Here, too, a rule of thumb: the kopfkissen is the head, his tips should only up to the shoulders of rich, so that the schultermuskeln can relax. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Ideal is therefore a 50 X 60 cm big cushion which, as it may, for example, the Scandinavians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In the seitenlage should the kopfkissen (along with the schulterentlastungszone in rost, or the weichzone in the mattress) the schulterhöhe balance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Rather, our modern mattresses have with the former (with hay receptacle) strohsäcken but in common. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern manufacturers increasingly use natural materials, or at least their mixtures. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Also in mattresses is the new magic formula "organic." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of erdölrohstoffen we used for the manufacture of polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturelle oils - for example, rizinus- and soya oil. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soya is aware of all the well-known manufacturers used. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> "organic mattresses, which is, in other words, your heart from materials purely natural origin is there," said Petr vašíček by the firm tropico plus. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Naturstoffe but they are also used in the manufacture of matratzenbezügen - one of the first was thinking of aloe Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> You can also indulge in the sleep mikrokapseln fresh woodland or lavendelduft spread. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Here too there is a difference between a man and a woman. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While the men a "kühlender" pflanzenextrakt from birkenblättern is used, so that the matratzenbezug absorb the heat and cool the body can have the salary for women "wärmende" effect. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Extracts from red paprikaschoten rain of blood, the weaker sex will the sleep wohlig warm words. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> And the current favorites? </seg>
<seg id="72"> Mattresses from kaltschaum (he has greater poren with devastated zellstruktur and is therefore atmungsaktiver than standard polyurethan and also much more flexible). </seg>
<seg id="73"> Through the combination of the various stiff (force) by kaltschäumen and visco-schäumen arise mehr-zonen-matratzen who know exactly where the head, hip and heels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> For a high-end mattress has, however, and 7000 kronor to fork out more. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Gesundheitsmatratzen are, however, usually with a lower value added tax, because they are considered as medical devices. </seg>
<seg id="76"> As the first Czech companies were gumotex this advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> You see, on the bed and on rost save is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="78"> And there is a special offer of manufacturers and dealers, the two mattresses for the price of an offer. </seg>
<seg id="79"> So does the brand and the mattress duofreeze magniflex with in relation verstepptem visco-schaum memory for 11.990 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="80"> The second one gets free of charge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the tempur material, that the era of the viskoelastischen schaumstoffe with open zellstruktur and dense in almost kosmischem pace. </seg>
<seg id="82"> Not surprisingly, they were developed for NASA, however, because the astronauts are with the launch of enormous excessive impositions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83"> Tempur will heat soft, in a cool place, which in turn strengthens it. </seg>
<seg id="84"> So it fits perfectly in the human body and is distributed in an optimal way, the körperdruck. </seg>
<seg id="85"> It is therefore not just ideal for the prevention of druckbrand, but increased schlafkomfort generally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86"> Viskoelastische schaumstoffe but they are not only in mattresses, but also in other gesundheitsprodukten, such as in the case of special fußpolstern, used in the legs and the gefäßen to relief. </seg>

<seg id="5"> "Our results show that the relative length of the finger as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer can serve this specifically for men to 60," said the joint author of the study, Ros eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Centre at the University of WARWICK. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="6"> The finger could help to determine what men is necessarily a prostatakrebs-test should undergo, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors are absent, such as, for example, family health problems, added Mrs eeles added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In the period of 1994-2009 haunted them with their counterparts in Britain more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> For these men was the same likelihood of prostate cancer, such as for 19% of those men, whose 'ring' and finger were the same length of time. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In men, whose finger was longer than the ringfinger this risk, however, fell by 33 per cent for men to 60 even by 87 percent. </seg>

<seg id="9"> But who still want to know more about ice, which is not on the "gelato-university" the Italian firm carpigiani over. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The eis-universität, the manufacturer of eismaschinen set up in 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines around the high Italian ideals. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The three-day grundkurs for future gelatieri has the most numerous and visitors from around the world. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But there is also mehrtägige spezialkurse around the schokoladeneis and work placements in the such thing as eisdiele. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Some in the midlife-crisis dreams of a new career, other cars simply time on the treacherous ice of their vague aspirations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Jacky, kunstlehrer from California, loves the slow-food-bewegung and wants the country to the industrial ice-cream in future, a European quality product offer. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Maestro-gelatiere Luciano Ferrari declared the participants to the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream. </seg>
<seg id="20"> What is crucial is not only good taste, but also the seidige fluidity and the good consistency. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Luciano forgets, in his training but also not the icing on the cake of the national and südländischen überbaus: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still plenty of romanticism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first step to manufacture seems quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Luciano dump the grundzutaten milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilisers in a large mixgerät which, with an electronic programme everything to 85 degrees heated and then immediately to four degrees cools. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Then he shoots a tap on the machine, and out comes a pasteurised White basiscreme, basis for all milcheissorten. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The lecturer will immediately they were all practically crowding me with questions: can one ice cream only with natural substances without stabilising factor? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How can one of their own experimentierlust free rein? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Luciano warns the zeitgeist, led astray. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Who of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" speech, has probably still stabilizers used - usually a product of nature, such as guarkernmehl from the guarbohne. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Of course you can ice without stabiliser, only there must then be sold within a day, otherwise it sackt in together, and the customer eiskörnchen bite on rooftops. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Certain variations in the grundmasse are allowed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> There will be more exciting with the flavourings. </seg>
<seg id="32"> For a taste of the ice is what distinguishes Maestro branded consumer Luciano between the ingredients, the one in the obst-abteilung or the sweets of the supermarket, buy. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Moreover, there are powder and pasten. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "The suppliers will all try to foist onto them dozens of aromatised additions." </seg>
<seg id="35"> "But they should simply time to experiment." </seg>
<seg id="36"> Either the fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruits. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Or just the ice cream from the White grundmasse, with eggs to yellow cream and with kakaopulver became the basis for all kinds of schokoladen-verführungen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Now, the kursteilnehmer to the eismaschinen. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano leaves them four different types of vanille-, schokolade-, mokka- and produce haselnuss-eis - with or without eggs in the grundmasse, with more or less vanillearoma or other natural additives. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The same experiment will also be subject to the fruchteissorten. </seg>
<seg id="41"> More flavourings, more frucht-püree covered - that is not necessarily better. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Haselnuss-eis tastes nussiger, if it is not necessarily more hazelnuts. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The most popular kiwi-eis, the working party, which more fruit, use less water and less stabiliser. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Only a balanced combination would emphasise the taste of a gelato rightly stressed, says Luciano. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: will pfirsich-püree with a lot of sugar used in the grundrezept sugar must be reduced. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For zitroneneis is a extraportion sugar necessary. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano prefers a device with which he stressed that the sugar content of the fruchtsorten (wine fairs so that the oechsle in grape must). </seg>
<seg id="48"> Fortunately, the calculation will facilitate tables. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Ice does not require longer to make so much physical use as before. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is not just the equipment for the automatic production of the grundmasse helps. </seg>
<seg id="51"> There is also a device, in which the final eis-mischung cremig beaten, and at the same time, minustemperaturen cooling. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Despite all the automated remain small glitch. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The Brazilian Gustavo acquitted himself and his kurskollegen from top to bottom with fruchtpüree, when the überdimensionale hand blenders spirals out of control. </seg>
<seg id="54"> "in every course," says Maestro branded consumer Luciano, "it is only a matter of time before such a thing has happened." </seg>

<seg id="2"> The Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The country does, however, to take a position on this - and nor does it controls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> About midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007 to take at least four Israeli F-15 fighter I, a mysterious, würfelförmiges building in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is on the shores of the Euphrates, the next major city, 30 miles away, is as-saur dair. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Her name comes up in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, Syria allegedly with help from North Korea in the quader has built, hidden in a valley by the electricity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing of the us-auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA from the end of April 2008, also would be under the name of Middle village have been well suited el-kibar normal reactor to produce plutonium - from which to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes, by contrast, is hardly the technique from the fifties. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA has led a videopräsentation before with blurred satellitenbildern. </seg>
<seg id="10"> By computeranimation they ignored a, where the components of the reactor, from the destruction, should have been a fell copy of the North Korean model from the atomzentrum Yongbyon. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Moreover, it presented photographs, above, the buildings from the vicinity show or even the innenraum. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor was shortly before the operation, it said, but not yet with brennstäben peppers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombing, is scarcely more aware than it was then, and indeed the mystery at the time were more likely greater. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The former US President George W. Bush has recently in his memoirs, revealed that the CIA before the attack is fairly sure that Syria was in el-kibar built a reactor, but saw little evidence that it is in the country, "an active nuklearwaffenprogramm." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some intelligence officers in Europe, there are rather more cautious and only talk of an "alleged reactor," even if the cia-präsentation for "plausible." </seg>
<seg id="16"> They lack of hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Asked how confident he was of a reactor is to have a high un-diplomat, replied to me only in the summer, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have "enough material, to ask questions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The rubble of the supposed "dormant" militärgebäudes while the Syrians were hastily aside and planierten the site thoroughly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Nevertheless, took place in June 2008, a iaea-team under former chief inspector Olli heinonen, in el-kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Moreover, the IAEA about a Member State of satellite imagery of commercial providers from the period immediately after the attack, which may be more meaningful than, presented by the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But are these recordings, not to get on the market, because of the unknown purchaser - perhaps Israel - it has bought. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The IAEA can therefore not independently verify its authenticity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always asserted, has never been a secret nuclear program, farms or to have built a reactor. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But it warned the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then, refuses to Damascus to discuss - as well as on the satellite pictures. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The inspectors also denied there was a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the rubble of a bombed-out building. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But Israel too Stony silence. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We never comment on the recent," at the time of the attack acting Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, the official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> So, the investigation of the case since June 2008 and fruitless "is becoming an increasingly serious problem of credibility for the office," as a senior Western diplomat in the headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna, authorises - there is a serious violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area on which the IAEA watchdog. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which seems to have three more bodies in "functional link" with the alleged reactor should be - and unlike this still exist. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The inspectors has not disclosed what the assets are, or what they are or what they seem suspicious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are in the IAEA, as-sultan internally as marj masyaf and iskandariayah, in turn, derived from nearby towns. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent institute for science and international security in Washington (ISIS advises) has identified these places and on satellitenbildern masyaf located in a complex, where it is most likely one of the suspects objects. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It is probably in or adjacent to a military base - precisely with this justification, Syria has refused IAEA access to the three locations. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In Vienna, says that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of the United States, in order to vorgeschickt will auszuspähen military equipment. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Because the nukleardetektive goods through a tip of the US intelligence services on the institutions has become. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the quader on the Euphrates material was moved back and forth. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A senior Western diplomat in Vienna, said that at least one of the plants could "in connection with the brennstoffproduktion." </seg>
<seg id="40"> "But there is no evidence to sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes, which are needed for the construction of nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="41"> With the type of reactor will not enriched uranium, which is operated. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But where the uranium would have to come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated on these central issues, there is certainly plausible conjecture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> Also unclear is whether the valuable pieces of debris, traces of mountains, could have been stored at the three locations. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As if the hundreds of stands the face disappeared, no one wants information about where the debris. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Only a few kilometers from el-kibar, on the other side of the Tigris, al-tibni salzmine Syria, 1998 to their suitability as a camp for radioactive waste, the IAEA has investigated as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The former iaea-inspektor Robert kelley had recently in an analysis for the influential magazine from Jane 's intelligence review with the reactor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Recordings from the orbiting show, however, that Syria to the three suspects places erdarbeiten and large containers distant, after the IAEA access had requested. </seg>
<seg id="48"> It may be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped, the suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> In addition, it says the IAEA in diplomatic circles, have used a number of months, a plan for inspections there to develop, which should allow it to Syria, to preserve any confidential - the effort shows how great is the interest of the inspectors. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte also this proposal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Western diplomats in Vienna had even a year ago, soothed the reactor was destroyed, so the matter was not a matter of urgency, bring about US ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months' sonder-inspektionen into the game, one of the strongest tool that the Vienna atombehörde has, to impose controls. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Iaea-chef yukiya Amano, these inspections should propose, has been of "an option, for which I am open in the future," but even then it is. </seg>
<seg id="53"> There is a high risk in this way: it needs for a majority on the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and many of the represented 35 countries are anything other than eager for an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other hand, like a diplomat to: "What is that, if they can find nothing in the end?" </seg>

<seg id="8"> Bakira hasecic from the organization of female victims wrote about the un-flüchtlingshilfswerk UNHCR of Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, now a Bosnian newspaper has reported, Jolie is itself as Ambassador of the un-flüchtlingshilfswerks. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Diplomatically, it is not - it has a few weeks ago the women already held a meeting in Hungary, which rejected the offer, however. </seg>

<seg id="18"> Which is considerably different sounds when the variant "rape victims in verknallt torturer." </seg>
<seg id="19"> Indeed, that Jolie film begins before the war - as is safe. </seg>

<seg id="8"> First, the good mood in Latin America </seg>
<seg id="9"> And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In many countries in the South Pacific coast, the democratic movement increased greatly (S. table 1). </seg>
<seg id="11"> In Peru, for example, where the economy annually since 2002 by around 6% rise in the number of demokratiebefürworter, rose by 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But only half of those polled in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (S. diagram 2). </seg>

<seg id="22"> In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was felt and violent crime have increased, this is less the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Only the second time since umfragebeginn see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country, a bigger problem than in the unemployment (S. graph 5). </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The rising economic performance is reflected in the increased support for the family and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents surveyed cross-regional level, that the private sector is essential for development, in 2007 there were 56% (S. graph 6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> Some 58% said that only the market can bring progress in their country, compared with 47% in the last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela this view is maintained (and 80% are for a private sector), though their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, many private companies nationalized. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil has according to 19% of those polled (18% last year), the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared with 11% last year). </seg>

<seg id="2"> In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband, Argentine President, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy that their beliebtheitsrate by 20 points to more than 50%. This is the highest value since its election in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, whether this is a re-election next year, depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández entertain a compromise than her late husband, your predecessor, Néstor Kirchner and political partner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The signs are not clear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Néstor Kirchner, even after the election, the economic policies of his wife was often on the budgets of tax revenues, growth and inflation does not fully into account. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This allowed the presidential couple then, the extraeinnahmen spend as it sees fit. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On paper, the fernández-regierung lost in the last year, the majority in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is divided and the Kirchners death after a heart attack on 27 October, led to further divisions. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But after chaotic meetings (with a member of a different face to face and others suggested the government of the bribery accused) managed the Congress not to pass the budget for 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I will not discuss it," said the President. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The 2010 budget now applies also to the next year, allowing the President still has more chance of spending money as it sees fit. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy is hot: probably it will this year by up to 9%. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official inflation rate is z.z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - the value of up to almost 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was ridden by economic crises, said growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not the inflationssenkung. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He refused to cooperate with the IMF, singled out for bullying the private sector and säuberte the National Institute of statistics and census indec, prompting the official inflationsstatistiken schönte. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Fernández now can we path? </seg>
<seg id="18"> It has the private sector and the trade union leaders for talks. </seg>
<seg id="19"> According to official statements and wage increases next year are limited to 18%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The high world prices for Argentina agricultural products have a strong boost to the economy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the inflation undercut the burst through a big devaluation in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Perhaps for this reason, Cristina Fernández would like Argentina and economic back to the rest of the world to follow. </seg>
<seg id="23"> At the beginning of this year, the government made an agreement with shareholders holding the previous debt restructuring of the country in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Fernández now appears on an agreement with the other donors from the Paris Club, which she owes about $6.7 billion. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Kirchners have had a review by the IMF, as elsewhere, always rejected. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But in the last month, the economy Minister Amado boudou announced that the fund in drawing up a new national consumer price index will provide "technical support." It looks as if this is the first step to clean up the indec. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not known whether Mr Fernández after the end of their term even without the support of her husband will be politically active. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which is largely has enough from Kirchnerism. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the Argentinians in March to return from their summer holiday, the wave of sympatie, which was shown to be fizzled. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If you want to win another election, which it must decide whether to many political decisions quietly, her husband is lifted. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The discovery of a foreign bakterienart, down by arsenic can live opens up new possibilities for new life forms on earth, and elsewhere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Although scientists this unusual bacterium discovered here on earth, it is their view, a sign that a life without the previously deemed vital elements is possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "This organism has two possibilities." </seg>
<seg id="5"> "He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "It makes it to something quite special, though it is almost a kind of 'alien' way of life is," said c.w. Paul Davies of Arizona State University and co-autor of the report, which the Internet on Thursday in the journal Science. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> So far, there have been six key elements as vital views - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> But, as the scientists figured out the bacterium in the Californian mono lake and then even further, if it phosphorus by arsenic replaced. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "one wonders but what else is possible," the report said the co-autor Ariel that Anbar of Arizona State University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is an important step in the search for außerirdischem lives since scientists need to see life and his forms, such as Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study, which deals with microbes have been found on earth. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet, that the report by the discovery of außerirdischen life could act. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "shows that, in other planetensystemen organisms with the help of other elements of biochemical processes can set in motion and that the 'standardelemente', which in our opinion, are absolutely vital, not necessarily clear are imposed," said Charles cockell, professor at the planetary and space sciences Research Institute of the open university in Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockel was not part of the research teams. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "This work is a first, because it shows that, in fundamental biochemical processes and structures of one element can be replaced by another," added cockell added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The discovery was not accidental. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Felisa wolfe-simon from astrobiologischen Institute of NASA, who led the study, chose the mono Lake because of the high arsengehalts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Since arsenic and phosphorus chemically identical, it started to that microbes, which both are suspended, may be an element by which others can replace. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "The toxicity of the arsens is based above all, that it is chemically similar to behaving like phosphorus." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "by the organisms, it is difficult to distinguish between an element from the other." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "But the difference is so great that arsenic different acts as phosphorus. It reaches into our biochemisches system, where it is almost covered everything," said Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers exposed the bacterium gfaj-1 a rising arsenkonzentration. It is suited to and grew. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The microbe is growing in phosphorus better, but also that it can survive in arsenic, shows that a arsen-basierte form can happen, of course, either on the ground or on any other planet or moon, on the arsenic frequently occurs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> According to Jamie S. foster, female teacher for Microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus by arsenic can be replaced, not new, but so far there is still no functioning example. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Arsenic came in the early erdjahren more common, she says that is why the science assumed that early life forms have used it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> "that gives reason to believe that life may have developed differently than in the early erdzeitalter," Forster, who was not a Member in wolfe-simons research team. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Prosecutors in the justice department, have Senator John Ensign, acquitted of the charges after his case with a former wahlhelferin and his attempt to have her husband, a lobbying to gain, have been filed against him, gave the lawyers of the senator on Wednesday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This decision to end the worst rechtsvorwurf against Senator Ensign, a Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, the nationwide headlines and sparked a drubbing of his career, he was regarded as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As Senator ensigns office announced that he was on the judgment after the year-long investigation "delighted." </seg>
<seg id="5"> The ethikkomitee of the Senate, however, could still impose a disziplarstrafe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to the ensigns lawyers from the justice department, they were informed that the investigations against Senator Ensign were recruited in this matter and that no further charges. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The ministry did not comment on the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The judgment was for many ethik-anwälte outside the justice department, a surprise. Her opinion there was sufficient evidence that the lobbying-verbot Ensign has ignored. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Interviews, e-mails and other documents, which for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times have been revealed, gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election, to lucrative contracts that gave his silence about a case with hamptons wife Cynthia to charity. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Cynthia Hampton ensigns during an election campaign, was working as a treasurer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Ensign, contact with few political friends in order to give Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogation he assumed for them after the cessation of hamptons lobbying. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Since Hampton recently in ensigns wahlteam was, it was not for a year, he was allowed to lobby for his former employer, or the entire Senate. </seg>
<seg id="13"> According to ethik-experten, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, before the case were chummy, against the so-called ban on the drehtür-lobbykratie. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> According to the published evidence "is apparently in order to make an agreement and to the violation of the drehtür-statuten," said Stanley brand, a Washington lawyer, to the defence of clients specialising in the sights of the government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> While the ministry officially rejected it, the reasons for the decision in ensign-fall to announce, said Mr. fire and other ethikanwälten, the department notes include very careful on political charges after a large number of failures, the media have been followed with great interest, including the decision last year that the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens because of malfeasance on the part of the public prosecutor to drop. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Prosecutors "are clearly schreckhaft," said Melanie sloan, the chairman of the association ," citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington" (an organisation whose aim of combating corruption in parliamentary and government circles in the United States is), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr. Ensign has brought before the courts. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "This means, in principle, hochstehende government officials are now able to assume that the laws do not apply to you that," she added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Paul coggins, hauptverteidiger of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview on Monday that he had received a phone call to a public prosecutor and another the next day, in which he was told that the department, no complaints against his client will speak. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Mr. ensigns defenders had cooperated with prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator, as his office in a statement on Wednesday repeated again, "in accordance with the law." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr. coggins refused to take the legal arguments that he had brought to the public prosecutors to explain more. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "I was not, in the gesprächsdetails between the Department of Justice and me to move. Only so much to be said: we believe, to have made the right decision," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Last month, the bundeswahlkommission decided that the investigation for a separate lawsuit by the group, after the payment of $96,000 of Mr. ensigns parents to the hamptons against the bundeswahlgesetz read. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money is anything other than a gift. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> NV energy, a large company in Nevada, which for a long time supported the senator, was one of the companies, in which Mr. Hampton thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyisten-arbeit took place. </seg>
<seg id="25"> An e-mail from December 2008 shows that, after the company Mr. Hampton has helped as a lobbyist, Mr. ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a conversation with Mr. Hampton had, in which he announced that he is in the Interior Ministry for a cause, "anklopfe." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and other customers in Nevada, and allegiant air, agreed to lunch and asked the Transport Secretary, a meeting in the name of the airline to agree, after Mr. Hampton had hired to lobby. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Last year, for the first time, information about this affair to the public, Mr. Ensign flats, apologize for his constituents and gave his position in the Senate, where he is in the order of precedence of the Republicans in fourth place. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Not many months after he was struck, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he seek a third term in the Senate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> In the announcement that Mr. Ensign would no longer be the objective of police investigation, said his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, the senator hope that the ethics committee is very quickly, the example of the justice department and as a result of its investigation einstelle. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Half a dozen of them tippten itself in the riots in the courtroom. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the minutentakt verschickten you on Twitter their reports on grausige testimonies. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the end, so the defense, there were more than 140,000 twitter-meldungen on trial for rape and beds gekettete children in a House, the flare-up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Thursday, the process will be closely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to have been killed, a formal end to find out if the sentence on the death sentence, which the jury has spoken. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted proposals in court, to outline the reasons for an appeal, and the courts in years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> One of the provozierendsten reasons is that, by the intense media coverage of the process, also through the extensive use of Twitter by durchschnittsreporter - to a "zirkusatmosphäre" and such a widespread, swift penetration rebel details, so that the jury in an improper manner by the public outrage had been affected. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This protest could lead the appelationsgerichte, to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules will be required in the courtroom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "as I have seen during this process, I believe that there is a real danger that if the arrival of the new technologies in the courtroom every individual " s right to a fair trial," said influenced Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes hauptverteidiger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The presiding judge, Jon C. blue by the Supreme kammergericht, rejected last week, the applications by ruling, briefly and succinctly when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled," and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But it was certainly not the last word in this matter. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For decades gerichtseinsprüche have found that the coverage of famous cases of doubt on the fairness of a process. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In his historic decision by 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States the judgment against Dr Sam sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland who is supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision, that it is because of the new media, "a karnevalsatmosphäre in the courtroom." </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some believe that the show and the movie "on the flight" on this crime is based. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some lawyers say, gerichtseinsprüche what Mr. Hayes condemnation of half a century later, could see the argument that new rules are necessary, in order to make the communication channels from the courtroom, who at the time of the fall of Dr sheppard to rules that were unimaginable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "There is a good reason, on the impact of the new media in processes, which will be followed by a wider public, to be anxious," said John J. donohue III, a professor at Stanford law school, the death penalty in Connecticut has investigated. According to his report, will it arbitrarily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor donohue said that some of appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restrictions on a prompt communications could have emerged from the courtroom, the processes of fair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The twitter-angelegenheit is only one of many that the lawyers of Mr. Hayes outline for years, in order to discuss and thus a conviction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defenders claim, for example, too, that Mr. Hayes had already been regarded with hostility under any circumstances could be, as judge blue had not allow them to test the reaction of potential judges, by giving them during the jurorenauswahl grausige tatortfotos showed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some of the judges have said that photos of the victim, Jennifer hawke-petit, 48 years, and their tüchter, hayley, 17, and michaela, 11 years, they would have with horror. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defenders say that they would also be the constitutionality of the death penalty to the Constitution in question, and argue that the judge mistakenly a jury have exchanged views, a critic of the public prosecutor 's office, and that he was improperly exerted pressure on the ruling would have been, as he had made the unusual decision, the panel released over the weekend. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The judges were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But their arguments about the influence of the extensive coverage of the process, perhaps the greatest interest to them. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In a urteilsanfechtung, which you have tabled last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the post of Governor and for the American Senate has been discussed by the candidates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They argued that the new media continually fan the flames of emotion on the case would be reopened. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "such a daily crush of medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," his lawyers wrote, "has even beforehand in new haven, and perhaps even have not yet seen nationwide." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Its focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages were rabble-rousing but effective as reports, the slower be reimbursed, a technikfeindlicher view was that the reporting on verarme future processes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> However, some lawyers said, would appelationsgerichte often with the argument that social and technological changes to approve the adaptation by the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr. hayers lawyers reinforce this assertion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> It referred in its opposition to the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, in the conviction of Dr sheppard because of the coverage was lifted, and made it clear that the new media, new rules require. </seg>
<seg id="32"> "this case," they wrote, "represents sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century." </seg>

<seg id="4"> The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress produced no breakthrough on the big issues to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck" session of the meeting at the end of a period in which no decisions will be taken to employ more. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After all this, what one hears, it was neither a polite debate between two sides or an account of their shared responsibility to rule, but rather an empty episode of a biased punktesammelns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meeting of the deficit Commission of the President on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences between the Members to continue. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months, a mutual respect, and the emergence of the ideological divide, which is still the Members divides, disguises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> That is hardly enough to claim that it was a new era of cooperation now upon us, in my opinion. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Both sides are now in a testing phase - in one of the other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise, while it tried to claim, the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters, according to a new parteienkriegsführung weigh. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This was why the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants on a minimum requirements or accusations limited. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep, but rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, might hope. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Regardless of whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or the benefits is concerned, the two sides are miles apart. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Lastly, the novemberwahl Washington, at least for a short time, bribed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "No question, the tone has changed," said pete wehner, a official representatives of the Bush administration, now for the "ethics and public policy center" works. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "It is inevitable after the elections. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elections are partisan passions that again. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And that is good. " </seg>
</p>

<seg id="18"> On some issues, particularly in those who are on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. " </seg>
<seg id="19"> End of the Bush tax cuts at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way to receive some or even all, whether temporary or permanent. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Similarly, it is a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits to be expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that it believes that the supported tax cuts for the rich, while they refuse to help unemployed workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House is the optimism, that it is in these issues during the "lame duck" session of some and, at the same time, the New START Treaty can ratify. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But William glaston of Brookings insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame duck session, "not necessarily to a lasting cooperation between the parties must lead if the new 112. Congress convened in January. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead, he says, is a phase of the nichtübereinstimmens more likely, perhaps even inevitable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "After the things that have to be done is done, this short-term psychology in confrontation reversal," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - the courtesy to real cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "I see from today, much of what happens in 2012, when vorkampf, or posturing, for the main event, from 2012," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons for this have much with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House to do so, and with the teeparty-wählern, which were useful for their education. </seg>
<seg id="29"> How worried the Republican leader also may be that they vie too high, they know that they must try to their promise to cut government spending and health-care reform, to comply with them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> This parteilinien are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the deficit Commission clearly, which is a tax reform and raising some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and reducing government spending. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The Deputy Chairman, Alan Simpson and erskine Bowles, one of the toughest jobs in Washington, and we have accepted, according to their own judgement, so very insisted that the defizitfrage on the public agenda that they no longer can be ignored. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need within the Commission for 14 of the 18 votes to their plan to make the official recommendation and they are very well only in the vicinity of this number. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The greatest opposition is the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters, today at least, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Galston says two stages in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will lead to this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> Public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It has been proved that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties to work together. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If the confrontation is a blind alley, as happened in 1995, then both sides must carefully on the public reaction. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Whoever is doomed to lose the will to change tack and seek the compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> This may in fact be an optimistic outlook. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Partisanship and polarization are greater now than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem to have a wider ideological divide between Obama and the kongress-republikanern than at the time to be between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At the same time, to see the activists from both parties in 2010 as merely prelude to a far wider choice of consistency in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> It may be the courtesy which display this week, will be welcomed by many Americans. </seg>

<seg id="18"> "This is our raw material... we will not make dirty bombs and we will sell it on anyone." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We use it only for research purposes, that is all." </seg>
</p>

<seg id="20"> Belarus, however, approached the United States of America, in a few months ago, when interest in the meetings of the agreement 's eastward. </seg>

<seg id="24"> The US government will pay for this effort is $14 million, with a large proportion of the money in the Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which can be used not for nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "This was extremely carefully coordinated and, in order to build confidence," on the agreement, which was signed by Clinton led, said Andrew bieniawski, a representative of the department, which operates in the global develop. </seg>

<seg id="29"> But the statement on Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1"> Zapatero and the red line of Germany </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin has decided for the keeping of the euro, but at the same time, conditions for the entire European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tension on the markets have a two-fold response of the government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, has put forward new measures, ranging from tax rebate for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary work agencies or the lifting of the 426 euros in support for the unemployed, no unemployment benefit, to the privatisation of 49 per cent for aena, the management of airports, particularly Barajas and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible, along with the current crisis herausbeschwört. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How are these events? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is anticipated that Merkel 's position is not mistakes of their past. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is Germany, a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future, which has ancient traditions with the maintenance of a large part of his partner. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Given the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis spekuliern. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South to leave the euro area. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The second: the restoration of the German mark - although that now sounds more like science fiction - supported by a large proportion of public opinion, around 50 percent of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The third: a transformation of the euro, in accordance with German proposals. That means: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of the countries that the requirements being broken; möglichereweise the failure of some countries, as well as the extension of the costs of adaptation to the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is clear and it is looming for some time. That is why there is now no excuses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First, in 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission incentives for deficits, and the German Government is a constitutional reform, withdrew from the sleeves in order to prevent this from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It was the first signs of the drift between what Germany was thought necessary to (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second sign, the Central European country, as Angela Merkel, the decision to rescue of Greece was painful. </seg>
<seg id="18"> At the time, was heavily criticised. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion absolutely against a bailout of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally, Merkel in the last oktobertagen anew with a clear position. It calls for a reform of the agreement between the European Union, in order to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time, private lender to oblige, part of the cost. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position was interpreted as anti-European, since they irlandkrise and everything the following on. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But your proposal, if somewhat sweetened, has been adopted. In the coming months we will be in the reform of the European Union that these measures should enable from 2013 to participate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has drawn a red line that it intends not to exceed. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It says all that - even if, now, unpopular measures must be taken - it from this date, the old ways of the euro will not be. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In 2013 it will be a new monetary 1854, in which the offender countries severely punished, that can be forced to declare themselves bankrupt and in this case, the private sector a portion of the costs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows us that we must take a hard reviving, with high savings and investment, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The other alternative in the debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments is based, as she was led by Spain in boom times, simply will not be tolerated. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would do it, it is not to understand. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not only a question of the budget deficit by 2013 runterzufahren three per cent. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much tougher. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the worst we could do under these conditions, we even to cheat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the current turbulence in more calm. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And that we need the opportunities offered to us, will use until spring 2013. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero also understands, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, to create its own house in order, in their way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But the from Germany battered red line is here, and it does not seem that would bring about change. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Among the possibilities are contemplating is that we are with little serious countries in the euro area, fully gestopften cannot be ruled out. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In this case Germany might still tell us that it had warned us. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Sport and regelumgehung </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tricks, such as that of Alonso and Ramos in the match against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the desire to avoid a penalty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The supposedly of two players of real Madrid (xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) has instigated exclusion in the game on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League that caused much ink has been shed, about whether it is a unsportliche act and whether or not was probably both players should be sanctioned by UEFA. </seg>
<seg id="4"> As is well known that the two players lost a couple of minutes to go (her team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls, so that the referee showed them the second yellow card. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way, and as the Real Madrid his group would be that the two players the prescribed sanction in the next ligaspiel against auxerre, and so fulfil without playing cards in the next spielphase. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Finally, the disziplinarkommitee UEFA the coach of the club, José mourinho, with two to play, and the parties involved players with different sums of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow card in this or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is so widespread that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport rules - is visible. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of the law debate to outline the case back to a team from the football clubs, Real Madrid (who in his anthem edelmut and honor and, on other occasions, his players had punished for similar incidents), the major role, and in the drama by mourinho, an episode more to its long history as theatralischer and provocative technician has added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case, the debate about whether this is not explicitly banned by the statutes of the principles of the sport, that is to say, whether these actions represent a regelumgehung. Indeed, this approach holds to the statutes of the sport, but appear to circumvent its meaning. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this matter of the sporting spirit damage caused should be investigated. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sporting spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that was put in jeopardy by these activities cannot, because there was no aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="13"> A further aspect of a clean game is to prevent the offender players an unfair advantage from the gegenteam. This, too, was not done. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradox of the plot of the players of real Madrid is that they are not the same as we normally under falschspiel or regelumgehung understand, because the circumvention of the rule was not taken surreptitiously, in order to avoid a penalty, but it should be, so long as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players waited and withdraw the sanction happily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is, what kind of advantage the offender from the deliberate fouls. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This should be stressed that the rival either in a disadvantageous position still has advantages for the feigned game erheischt were, for the obvious result of this action was that the team had to continue, with fewer players. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club has not then on these players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The benefit is clear is that the players for the next spielphase the Champions League without maps, their participation in a future game could begin to threaten. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a long-term, up to a certain extent uncertain advantage, because the team could eventually retire. It gives the players with this approach, a sanction and go in the second kartenzyklus about where they are because of kartenanhäufung with a card less than in the first cycle. </seg>
<seg id="21"> So it is not clear whether it is really an advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Ultimately, such practices are not against the sporting spirit, which is also of strategic decisions are part of the rules, in order to derive maximum benefit. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case, the players wanted to avoid any penalty (this would really be a clear case of regelumgehung), they wanted to vote, when you are on this subject. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They met, without a strategic decision to avoid a penalty before her, or to flee. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Although the border between imagination and regelumgebung blur is, I believe that this issue is a clear case of inventiveness. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because it was two selbstausschlüsse and because of the nature of the unprovoked regelübertragung. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The damage to the principles of the sport by these actions inflicted is less ethical, rather than aesthetic nature. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Yesterday in Cancun, the UN has a plan for the renewal of the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries, with a view to achieving a reduction of the greenhouse gas (CFC) suggested that the nearly a third of the additional reduction is the equivalent, which must be implemented in order to stabilise the earth 's climate by 2020. </seg>

<seg id="4"> After the last of the plan would be the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (GT) because of the lighting on the earth " s CFCs are to be avoided, if the weißglühenden pears, which still has a monopoly of 50% to 70% on the market, are by fluoreszierende or, better still, by light-emitting diodes (led) would be replaced. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. </seg>

<seg id="10"> With the kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs we are once again to these energy needs twice that. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen hold, on average, between 6,000 and 10,000 hours. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The new LED bulbs, such as those of the manufacturer Philips this week has been on the market - this society has also participated in the uno-studie - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80 percent less energy than a weißglühende pear, which is a suggestion the savings of the auswechselungsplanes gives, which is to be applied in 100 countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Besides the fact that iese entirely new incandescent light bulbs, only very little heat, they can also with a regelwiderstand work. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> During more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, kept the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher in Iran for "espionage" was held, the French public in suspense, left the diplomacy on red alert and akzentuierte the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran. </seg>
<seg id="3"> All of this under the attentive eye of the diplomats of the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> From WikiLeaks and received by the newspaper Le Monde durchgesehenen American documents give some background to this crisis. </seg>
<seg id="5"> They describe how the Elysée had stated his strategy of the Americans, who went so far as this advice to deal with their own crisis of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of wanderern). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> They show on, such as the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman not the release of Majid kakavand, one in France and held prisoner by the American justice because of trade with material in favour of the Iranian nuklearprogrammes wanted Iranian to gegeleistung. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Finally, they put the manner with which the French Presidency for the purpose of the media has been trying to manipulate the idea to make them credible, the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss, played in a harsh light. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In truth, he had done nothing in this respect. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> A on 12 August, 2009 in Paris redigiertes diplomatentelegramm bears the title of "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostage taking." </seg>
<seg id="10"> François richier, elysée-berater strategy that is discussed in the company of Patrice paoli, director of the Quai d " orsay to North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen allegrone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> They declared it the French way. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The advised the Americans to do everything possible to rückzuführen their own nationals, who were forcibly detained in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "power of noise," they said, "articulated, loudly and clearly and without letting" the words' grundmenschenrechte, "" innocence ,"" immediate release "in the media. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is necessary to the Iranian regime to embarrass the very sensitive to his image. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> "since this is all the more so given that you ask the Iranians not to do that." </seg>
<seg id="16"> Because "silence solves nothing," over the diskussionsversuche over on unauffälligem ways, the Iranians are "master in ausweichmanövern." </seg>
<seg id="17"> Mr richier adds that the detention of foreigners, "a normal, Iranian tactics" was: "hostage taking for political blackmail." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss, from prison on August 16 (which should come in the days on which they are located in the French Embassy, unstoppable) "demand the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians' (230,000 euros) bail. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And he does state that the Elysée antizipiere further hostage-taking, "a phenomenon that will worsen." </seg>
<seg id="20"> The Iranians could "in the near future, another of the roughly 1,800 French citizens arrested in Iran," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> August 28, 2009. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Clotilde Reiss is 12 days, has been released from prison, but will continue to be held in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="23"> An information was brought into circulation: the Iranians Majid kakavand, whose extradition to the United States because of illegal trade in empfindlichem elektronikmaterial to Iran, demand is after ruling of a judge in Paris, has been released from detention. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The American embassy presents itself, like many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence. </seg>
<seg id="25"> For Washington, which is the illegal Iranian networks of purchases on the nuclear programme planned material, is the release of Majid khakavand bad news. </seg>
<seg id="26"> France has taken a fool? </seg>
<seg id="27"> The liberation of the Iranian against the French woman? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Following a further meeting with Kathleen allegrone on 4 September, François richier assured that this was not the case. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the decision of the judge," but have also tried to revolt against it. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "It has a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Justice Minister, Michèle Alliot-Marie had been" (now), but "the French Government, the judicial decision does not change," he says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Mr richier would also like to point out that Majid kakavand continue to be under "strict" oversight of the French secret service. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The elysée-berater selects a telephone number, is back on, then informed the American diplomat, the Iranians "are currently in the Iranian Embassy in Paris' buildings." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> During the detention of Clotilde Reiss, in Iran, too, the Elysée his efforts are not, by pronouncements and the media organized, "" believe fluchtversuche, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad Games a "significant" and "influential role as mediator." </seg>
<seg id="34"> The Americans are monitoring this activity, not without irony, and I have to say that the manipulation bears fruit, because several articles reflect the official French version. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> A Council on 25 August 2009 datierendes telegram presents "the medienblitz the French authorities." </seg>
<seg id="36"> "so much of what is based dankesbezeugung" towards Mr Assad, wonders the Paris Embassy. </seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg id="39"> The intensive communication activities "aims to Sarkozy policies of opening to Syria to confirm," he analysed. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A 2008 launched policy, which then "by numerous kritikerstimmen in France and abroad as premature and undeservedly was perceived." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> "The Syrian role aufbauschend" attempts by Paris "Syria, which can laud by playing a constructive role in the region." </seg>
<seg id="42"> It is also, "discord between Syria and Iran to sow." </seg>
<seg id="43"> The American embassy knows this from good source. </seg>
<seg id="44"> On 11 August had François richier to her: "of course we do not know whether the Syrians have done whatever." </seg>
<seg id="45"> "but we have, despite everything, is grateful to you." </seg>
<seg id="46"> "This should at least create confusion on the part of the Iranians." </seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg id="8"> The amending budget by 2010, this morning sifted from the Finance Committee of the National Assembly, which contains the measures envisaged, in order to raise money for the first part of this. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The case brings WikiLeaks has a twofold significance. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On one hand, it turns out is as obvious scandal, a scandal, only one scandal in sinner hypocrisy, which is the beziehunge between States, the citizens and the press. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand, it has to be substantial changes at the international level, and gives a taste of the future, dominated by a recession. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But we walk of the series after. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each by a secret service produced acts (one cannot nation) exclusively from press cuttings. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary," American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi 's throw from nothing more than what you for months on end in any Journal to read (except for those whose owners Berlusconi is), and the terrifying karikaturierte profile Gaddafi kabarettkünstlern already provided the material for a long time for their skits are. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule, according to the secret dossier only from already well-known news should insist, is essential for the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not just in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go into a library, which is esotherischen publications, you will realise that each work (on the grail, the mystery of the rennes-le-chateau templer, or the rosenkreuzler) exactly the repeatedly in previous works, which has already been written. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is not only, therefore, that the author occult texts do not want to publish research (still, therefore, that he does not know how, where news about the nicht-existierende to), but because those who are the okkultismus, of anything else other than the belief that what you already know and confirms what you already have learned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the erfolgsmechanismus by Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> As is the secret files. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informant is lazy, and lazy (or restricted spirit) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example, editor at Libération), the only true considering what he acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The top-secret information on Berlusconi, the American Embassy in Rome, had been sent to the staatsdezernat were the same as those who already Newsweek published the previous week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> So why was such a fuss about the revelations of this dossier? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On one side, this is what every literate person already knows, namely, that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the government can call each other or an aircraft can take in order to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small virtue in spionagezentren. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Any old viewers of ermittlungsfilmen knows this very well and it is not for hypocrisy, so that we are doing this to ignore. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Still, the fact that it publicly to repeat, violates the task of hypocrisy and serves, American diplomacy in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In second place: the idea that a business-as-usual hackers of the geheimsten secrets of the most powerful country in the world can tap, involves the substantial blow to the prestige of the staatsdezernats. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, the scandal is less the victims rather than the "executioner" in trouble. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we are giving the profound nature of what happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Formerly, George Orwell " s times, we could all power like a big brother pool, every gesture of his subjects controlled. </seg>
<seg id="23"> George Orwell " s prophecy could have been quite right since then as can highlight any movement, where you can control thanks to the telephone, each made transaction, visited the hotel, the elected highway and so on; the citizens would result in the total victims of the eye of the power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> If it is, however, bearing in mind what is happening today, that even the secret krypten of power is no longer under the control of hackers, so as to escape the kontrollgang listens to unilaterally and will continue to be directed zirkelförmig. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power of controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - acquired as avenger by of the citizen - the mysteries of the power of that. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> But how can a power, which is no longer able to preserve their own secrets? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is true, Georg simmel has already said that a real mystery, a mere secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi or Merkel 's, in fact, a secret free of geheimis is, as it surrenders the public sphere; but in the styles of WikiLeaks reveal that the secrets were empty secrets of Hillary Clinton, is to deprive it of any power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Wikileaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What are the consequences of this affront to be such a huge power has been done? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the Member States in future, no more online information system - that would be put on the street corner angeklebten prominently displaying. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is also clear that there will be disappointed with the current technology is to be hoped, confidential reports about phone to be able to keep secret. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a Head of State is in a plane and fortbewegt contacted one of his colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could in future private and only for certain ears certain relationships? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know very well that my prediction for the moment, according to science fiction and romanhaft sounds, but I am compelled me to present the government agents in secret way to score and uncontrollable marschrouten moving, their communications anywhere else than in a mere memory with order and, moreover, the few written information they received in the schuhabsatz verbergend. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information would be in single copy in closed drawers of stored: basically, the spionageversuch of Watergate had less success when WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity to write that the technology today is like a cancer, namely backwards. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A century after the wireless telegraf had revolutionized communications, the Internet is a telegrafen assignments with (telephone) line. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The (analogue) cassettes had the filmforschern allows, a film band for band auszukundschaften by spulen from back to front, and all the mysteries surrounding the installation, while the (digital) CDs are now nothing more than to make it possible to jump from chapter to chapter, in makroportionen. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should be allocated according to the Copenhagen Treaty "to be" and, in addition, in order to ensure that an additional deployment has been tabled, without, to the detriment of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what to "new and additional" means. </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the Commission had proposed a harmonization, certain Member States, including France, the procedure has been blocked. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today, everyone chooses the benchmark, which he regards as the best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those of the year for 2009: the international funding, and there will be retained in the context of the financing "fast-start" over three years to 150 million. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries have similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or about conditions at the level of public development aid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In contrast, France was of the opinion that the funding of "all new projects" of 2010 were "new and additional." </seg>
<seg id="17"> In other words, there are no references in the spending of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Specifically, the total amount of French support for developing countries remain stable (or decline) - France, his commitment to the "new and additional" financing to comply with them. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="19"> Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is still no rule, and everyone chooses his rechenmodus. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, like France for example, are 1 borrowed €than equivalent with 1 donated €. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Obviously, this is difficult to acceptable: the effort is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often conditional on the emissionseindämmung to projects to be actually technology) can be justified, it is misleading to try to present the euro, known as the equivalent of a donated euro captured... should also only the cost of the loan to be counted as a commitment to the kapitalgeberland (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France has nothing in a different sense than the following consideration: it "respected" its obligation of 420 million euros, by 91.5% of loans (389,8 million euros), and takes 8.5% accorded) 36.1 million euros) - see the EU documents, in order to satisfy itself. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only country in the EU that loans to a large extent. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany is calling for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among other things) with their obligations to 100%, with donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union to fulfil its obligations to €1, France spends a mere 10 cents and understands including a comparable use. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Of beautiful! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> All in all, in his fast-start-finanzierung operates France with a double cheating: to become part of the action with a weiterentwicklkung over time, and the other part of the reality of financial support. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France is to succeed, it is to believe, that it is 420 million "new and additional" million in accordance with its promise and has spent on it saves 36.1 million euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the Treasury Department (as it seems that there probably was Bercy, the arbitrage has carried out a double negative effect) could entail (why drive; even internally within the different Member States with the donations, if it continues to lend enough?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries is not completely fooled... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter of premature funding only a small issue in a relatively short time compared to the entirety of discussions on the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it could be too much of the drop in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> We hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As always, it is essential to his lesson from this first year of premature funding to learn. </seg>
<seg id="36"> First and foremost, France could change in his verbuchungsart for the 2011 and 2012, and in the spirit of respect for his obligations and compensating equity, with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Above all, however, France could the discussions on the subject of a dispute of the long-term financing forward (another, decisive and currently discussed subject): you can escape to the question of the "verrechenbarkeit" or the verbuchungsart its loans was not. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could change its position, as well as progressive in terms of the issues to be, as it is in other things. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The hope is based on the new Minister for the environment Kosciusko-Morizet, the next week in Cancún will arrive. </seg>
<seg id="40"> In a surprising announcement, on the fast-start of France and his vision of the "verrechenbarkeit" as well as the use of loans would increase the international nature of trust, the need for further discussions. </seg>
