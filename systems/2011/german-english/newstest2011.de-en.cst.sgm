<seg id="5"> Equally important is the interieur, and subordinate matratze rost. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a wochenendhaus, which are not regularly heated latexmatratzen not suitable for much longer, as they need to be "hot." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Moreover, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethan-matratzen. </seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The choice is, of course, also a role, in which it is used. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Who, for a long time abroad, where very high matratzen with weichschicht, will be difficult to a low matratze used with hard surface. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "All an ice-hockey player from the nhl have returned to have complained to me that you are not able to sleep more correctly." </seg>
<seg id="14"> 'for their abgeschundenen shoulders, closely and hüften they need simply weichschicht from visco-schaum (memory foam - a formgedächtnis-polymer) '. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I recommend including zuckerkranken people under a disruption of the nervous system, so that the 'information' from the ligaments and skin can receive bad," says Sylva hadamcziková on polstermöbel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> That is why I voted for several years, many eishockeyspielern, but also other customers with these matratzen visco-schaum (memory foam). </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Today, this is no longer a problem, because such matratzen offer including the manufacturer, the Italian company tempur magniflex or the Czech manufacturer tropico." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And it is not necessarily a famous an ice-hockey player, the benefits of the visco-schaums learn to appreciate. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" actually works quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The foam optimalisiert its rigour and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, it is downright schmiegt on hot body. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Nowhere is there, in the night shifts are not around for a serious fight. </seg>
<seg id="22"> We sleep much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The viskoelastische foam also offers protection against dekubitus (gangrene). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In the choice of matratzengröße should still be at the height of the length of fußsohlen to, i.e. approximately 21 to 34 cm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> As Mrs Mann, the 180 cm tall, so a 210 to 220 cm bed. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Each of the schläfer should at least 90 cm liegebreite available, i.e. 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> When einzelbetten singles, for example, 120 to 140 cm. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The own comfort, and also for any visitors. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> In a doppelbett everyone needs its own rost and its own matratze, but be careful when buying products, so that the matratzen too high. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise, cannot do other than roste in different levels to make, and that is not in any bettrahmen possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Schaummatratzen should at least 14 cm high, with 15 cm matratzen federskelett, it should at least three centimeters on formschicht and feinpolster. </seg>
<seg id="33"> 'with the hands or sit down the feathers in no case be felt, "warns Helena prokopová. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Any matratze makes a particular rosttyp required. </seg>
<seg id="35"> With matratze ganzgepolsterte beds and documents as zusammengewachsene siamzwillinge have no place in the bedroom. </seg>
<seg id="36"> These matratzen cannot drop and the respect we cannot wash, which today is already commonplace. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And as a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the matratze after five to seven years, a huge (and congested sieve). </seg>
<seg id="38"> That is also why reject experts werbeslogans in matratzen a lifetime of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee promises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> In any case, your ifs and buts. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And is therefore a practical advice of traders: matratzen of 120 or 140 cm broad should be the hygiene of waschbaren abziehbaren emolument that, nonetheless, it is recommended that a matratzenschoner, easy to use and wash. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even if today in the rule matratzenbezüge with rundumreißverschluss, so it is open to the two halves gets (immensely important for the waschvorgang and waschmaschinengröße!), the manipulation with larger matratzen, particularly, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> Have you in the bed rostes instead of a firm plate? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Out of it. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or, at most, a bed of unloved guests and for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> So they should rather prosaic with lüftungslöchern oversight (if any), and there are already matratzen with federskelett and 15 cm minimum allocation with the so-called taschenfederkern and feinpolster use. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethan-matratzen belong in such a document. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For not verstellbare lattenroste with 14 to 18 federleisten (lamellen) are suitable or sandwichmatratzen latex- (possibly also combinations of latex and kokos), figures are roste with a larger lattenanzahl, 28 and more federleisten, with lordosenstütze in lendenwirbelbereich, and the possibility of the lattenhärte to regulate. </seg>
<seg id="48"> On verstellbare lamellenroste not include matratzen with federskelett, because it does not respond to the ergonomische verstellung. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> In addition to the cessation of rigid the special flexible schultermodule federleisten will also be required. </seg>
<seg id="50"> We are talking about a specific integration of federleisten which allows the federleisten einzudrücken verwinkeln or even to the specific einsinken the shoulders of schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Particularly for men with broad shoulders an important matter. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There are even matratzenhersteller which have started in "herrenmatratzen" weichzonen for schulterbereich. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The President is intended - you off these weichzonen in hüftgegend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For ambitious customers are punktelastische flügelfedersysteme (lattoflex) or roste with punktelastischen kontakt-pads with the so-called multitorsionsfederung. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure will be distributed on a number of points, which reduces the tension. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But, if the right matratze and right rost a bad (too big and fülliges) kopfkissen used the most benefits are lost. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Here, too, a rule of thumb: kopfkissen is the head, its leaders should only to shoulder the rich, so that the schultermuskeln relax. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Ideal is therefore a great kissen 50 X 60 cm, as for example the Scandinavians. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Some have our modern matratzen with the former (with hay EU-US) strohsäcken but in common. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern manufacturers are using increasingly natural materials, or at least their mixtures. </seg>
<seg id="62"> When matratzen means the new magic word 'bio'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Rather than erdölrohstoffen we used to manufacture polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturelle oils - for example, sojaöl rizinus-. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soya is known by all manufacturers. </seg>

<seg id="67"> We can but also mikrokapseln grant the sleep of fresh forest or lavendelduft. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Here, too, there is a difference between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While the men 'kühlender "pflanzenextrakt from birkenblättern used, so that the matratzenbezug heat and cooling can absorb the body, the salary for women' wärmende" effect. </seg>

<seg id="73"> The combination of the various stiff (toughness) kaltschäumen visco-schäumen mehr-zonen-matratzen arise and to know exactly where capita hip and closely. </seg>

<seg id="75"> Gesundheitsmatratzen but are usually burdened with lower VAT, but as a medical aid. </seg>
<seg id="76"> The first Czech company was gumotex this advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> You see, the matratze and on rost saving is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Sometimes there are special offers of manufacturers and traders, the two matratzen for the price of one. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The brand magniflex the matratze duofreeze in relation verstepptem visco-schaum memory for 11.990 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="80"> The second will be free to do so. </seg>

<seg id="21"> Luciano forgets in his training, but not the icing on the cake of national and even südländischen überbaus: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still plenty of romanticism." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Now the kursteilnehmer to the eismaschinen. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano, you have four different types of vanille- schokolade- mokka- haselnuss-eis, and to establish, with or without eggs in the grundmasse with more or less vanillearoma or other natural additives. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The same experiment will also undergo fruchteissorten. </seg>

<seg id="44"> Only a balanced mix will lift the flavour of a gelato right, says Luciano. </seg>

<seg id="46"> For zitroneneis extraportion sugar is a necessary. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano prefers a device, with the sugar content of the intended measure fruchtsorten (winegrowers so that the oechsle in grape musts). </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The country, but to comment - nor is it controls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter, a mysteriöses würfelförmiges buildings in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is on the shores of the Euphrates; the next major city, 30 kilometres away, is dair as-saur. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Your name comes up in the documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor is that Syria supposedly with aid from North Korea in the quader built hidden in a valley of the electricity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing of us-auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA by the end of April 2008 is also under the name of the near town el-kibar normal reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes against the technology from the fifties. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA led a videopräsentation with by means of fuzzy satellitenbildern. </seg>
<seg id="10"> By computeranimation blendete it, where the components of the reactor before the destruction have been a copy of the North Korean model fell from the atomzentrum Yongbyon. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Moreover, it presented photographs, the building of the vicinity or even innenraum. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor is on the verge of operation, it was said, but not yet with brennstäben have been drawn up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more aware than it was at the puzzle with time, a greater. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The former US President George W. Bush has recently in his memoirs, reveals that the CIA before the attack was quite sure that Syria el-kibar a reactor built, but little evidence that the country's nuclear weapons programme 'active'. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some intelligence officers in Europe are rather more cautious and only talk of a 'alleged reactor', even if the cia-präsentation for 'plausible'. </seg>
<seg id="16"> They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> I am sure he was asked as a reactor, replied to have a high un-diplomat only flat in the summer, the IAEA, "enough material to put questions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The rubble of the so-called 'dormant militärgebäudes "surpassed the Syrians are in a hurry aside planierten the terrain thoroughly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Nevertheless, in June 2008, a iaea-team under the former chief inspector Olli heinonen in el-kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by the people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Moreover, the IAEA on a Member State satellite pictures provide commercial operators from the period immediately after the attack, which should be stronger than the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="21"> These, however, are recordings on the market, because of the unknown client - perhaps Israel - it originates. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The IAEA can therefore verify their authenticity is not independent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always claimed that never operated a secret nuclear program or a reactor built. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, declared Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="25"> However, the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss - as well as on the satellite pictures provide. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Moreover, the inspectors denied a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the rubble of zerbombten building. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But Israel remains silent pugnaciously. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We will never comment ', confirmed recently by the time of the attack incumbent Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> It perpetuates the investigation of the case since June 2008 fruitless and "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority ', as a great Western diplomat in the seat of the IAEA in Vienna authorises - after all, it is a serious breach of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area of the IAEA. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA appear to be three other institutions, the 'functional' in connection with the alleged reactor to - and unlike that still exist. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The inspectors have not disclosed the installations concerned, what role they are or what they seem suspicious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are in the IAEA internally as marj as-sultan masyaf iskandariayah, and that, in turn, are derived from nearby towns. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent institute for science and international security in Washington (ISIS advises) has identified these places and a gebäudekomplex masyaf satellitenbildern to identify, which is probably one of the suspects objects. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It is probably in or immediately, in addition to a military base - precisely with this justification, Syria, the IAEA denied access to the three places. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA from the United States vorgeschickt will auszuspähen military equipment. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Because the nukleardetektive were a recommendation by the US secret services to the attention of the institutions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos that between the three places and the Euphrates material quader hertransportiert back and forth. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A large Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the installations could 'in connection with the brennstoffproduktion'. </seg>
<seg id="40"> There is, however, no evidence of sensitive activities', i.e. uranium enrichment and reprocessing; the processes for the construction of nuclear weapons are necessary. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The type of reactor is with uranium, not enriched. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But where the uranium had should come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated, on these central issues, there are only plausible guesswork. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> It is also unclear whether debris, the valuable traces of mountains, to the three places stored. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As if the hundreds stands from the ground disappeared, nobody wants to have any information as to where the rubble. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The only a few kilometres from el-kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, salzmine al-tibni, Syria in 1998 to their suitability as centres for radioactive waste has investigated, the IAEA as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The former iaea-inspektor Robert kelley it had a recent analysis by satellitenbildern for the prestigious journal Jane's intelligence review with the reactor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Starting from the orbit show, however, that Syria to the three suspicious places erdarbeiten untouched and large container distant, after the IAEA access had requested. </seg>
<seg id="48"> This is a coincidence, but hardly contributed to dispel the suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Moreover, it says in the IAEA diplomats, have spent many months, a plan for inspections to develop that Syria should allow any military secrets to preserve the burden alone shows how great the interests of the inspectors. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte this proposal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Western diplomats had in Vienna a year ago have been allayed, the reactor is destroyed, therefore, the matter is not high urgency, around US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a couple of months' sonder-inspektionen, one of the principal means of the Vienna atombehörde to controls. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Iaea-chef yukiya Amano, these inspections should propose, has been of "an option, for which I am open in the future ', but then it is dragging its feet. </seg>
<seg id="53"> There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, there is a need for a majority of the Board of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented there are anything other than eager to an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other hand, as a diplomat to remember: 'what is, if you will, in the end, nothing at all? " </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The democracy movement in Latin America is growing, as the support of private companies. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil's larger than that of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This outcome was latinobarómetro-umfrage in 18 countries and exclusively in the economist has been published. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Since 1995, this survey is being carried out regularly and shows the meinungswechsel in this region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two facts in the poll in September and October of this year, particularly in the eye. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Firstly, the good mood in Latin America </seg>
<seg id="9"> And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In many countries of the South American pazifikküste the democratic movement has risen sharply (S. table 1). </seg>
<seg id="11"> In Peru, for example, where the economy since 2002, at around 6% a year, the number of demokratiebefürworter of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In Mexico, where the economy since the sharp drop in the last year recovers, is such a trend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (S. graph 2). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Around 44% of the respondents said that the democratic practice of their country to be satisfied, as much as in the last year, 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3). </seg>
<seg id="15"> Approximately 34% trust the Congress of your country and 45% of their government. Both values are identical to those of last year, but a sharp increase from 2003 (17% and 24%). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> A decade ago, Latin America's economic crisis undermined the efforts to bring about more democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This also during the Great Depression, thanks is probably due to the fact that the countries of Latin America are only a brief recession, and a speedy recovery. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, the poor by a stronger sozialnetz absorbed. </seg>
<seg id="19">  (according to reports by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America from this week, 2009, the level of poverty in Latin America only slightly, and again this year at 32%.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But from country to country, there are strong stimmungsunterschiede (S. graph 4). </seg>
<seg id="21"> Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread fortschrittsdenken. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more tangible and violent crimes have increased, this is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Only the second time since umfragebeginn see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country is a greater problem than unemployment (S. graph 5). </seg>
<seg id="24"> Some 31% say that they either myself or a family in the last year have been victims of crime, but to 38% in the last year, values and thus achieve the lowest level since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The rising economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and the market economy: approximately 71% of the respondents überregional stated that the private sector is essential for development, in 2007, there were 56% (S. graph 6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> Approximately 58% said that only the market economy your country can bring progress, compared with 47% in the last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela this view maintained (and 80% are in favour of a private sector), even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, many private companies nationalized. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil has, according to 19% of respondents (18% in the last year the biggest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% in the last year). </seg>
<seg id="29"> The respondents in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, see in the United States is the most influential country, and this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela will be accepted. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Whether it is in the next year to a re-election gets depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández compromise than their deceased husband, your predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The signs are not clear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Néstor Kirchner, even after the election of his wife, the economic policy was often budgets in the tax revenues, economic growth and inflation is not fully into account. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This allowed the präsidentenpaar, the extraeinnahmen as it sees fit. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On paper, the fernández-regierung last year, the majority in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October, leading to further divisions. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But after chaotic meetings (where a parliamentarian, another face, and the Government of the bribery accused), the Congress, the budget for 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I will not discuss it," the President. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The 2010 budget is now for the next year, which makes the President more opportunity to spend money as it sees fit. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy is overheating, it is likely that this year by up to 9% increase. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official inflation rate is z.z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and moderation of the trade unions - are the figure of nearly 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner, the 2003 the premiership, as Argentina was beset by economic crises, growth and poverty reduction to its primary objectives, and not the inflationssenkung. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He refused to cooperate with the IMF, has singled out for bullying as the private sector and säuberte the National Institute for statistics and census indec, prompting the official inflationsstatistiken schönte. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Mr Fernández, now we can follow? </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is the private sector and the trade union leader to discussions. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And official statements that wage increases in the next year to 18%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The high prices for Argentina's agricultural products have a strong boost to the economy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the burst of inflation undermined by a great devaluation in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Perhaps, Cristina Fernández for this reason, Argentina and back to the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="23"> At the beginning of this year, the government an agreement with shareholders holding the former restructuring of the country in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Now it seems that Fernández to an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club to which it owes around $6.7 billion. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Kirchners had a review by the IMF, as elsewhere, been rejected. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But in the last month, the Finance Minister Amado boudou aware that the fund in the drawing up of a new national consumer price index "technical support '. It looks as if this were to be the first step towards the cleaning up of the indec. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not known whether Fernández after the end of its term of office, even without the support of your husband politically active. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which is largely the kirchnerismus enough. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the Argentines from their summer holiday back in March, the wave of sympatie it was shown to be fizzled. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If you want to win another election, it must decide whether it many political decisions of their man quietly lifted. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Taiwan's voters are becoming a closer link with the continent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> What does Taiwan of its big brother across the strait? </seg>
<seg id="4"> On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the electorate, in the five city mayors and councillors. This is as broad evaluation of President Ma Ying-jeou. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Through the construction of cutting-edge business contacts, einschl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland, and its policy, the relationship with the Chinese Motherland, for the first time since 1949 sustainably changed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Ma has the test, but only just. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Although his Kuomintang Party was split (KMT), three of the five mayors, it received a majority. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Instead, the democratic fortschrittspartei (DPP), the greater independence of Taiwan, almost 50% of the vote, the KMT was 45%. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In a presidential election, this would have for Ma problems. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Since his election in two years, indeed, his party at around 8%. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For the first time, the DPP, together with the KMT in the councillors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as convoys of lorries, with krawallmachern flaggen-schwenkende massenumzüge and rarely active dancers. </seg>
<seg id="13"> There were even compulsory, mysterious mordversuch. </seg>

<seg id="16"> Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter LIEN kill or settle a dispute with the candidates. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Regardless of the attack tsai ing-wen according to the leader of the DPP, the election and the DPP in a bad light, as the KMT has benefited more votes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> China was perhaps the biggest winners of the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Remarkably, relations with the mainland was not discussed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Instead, the candidates are debated on plans to housing and the creation of jobs. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's militärbedrohung. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This is why the KMT their relations with the government in Beijing to the fore. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But this time, avoiding the DPP, the anti-Chinese feelings too much. </seg>
<seg id="24"> You responded to this new awareness that Taiwan's economy without China cannot survive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Ma, in turn, would like to confirm that the majority of the Taiwanese its China policy. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy, Taiwan, with economic incentives to attract the Community. </seg>
<seg id="27"> China sent a negotiator in Taipei, at a summit on investment and medical cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Certainly, it also wants a political integration, but the most important first. </seg>
<seg id="29"> We therefore prefer to wait until after the 2012 presidential election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The DPP is now reinvented. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Two years ago, it was severely weakened: the former leaders of Chen Shui-bian sat for corruption in prison. </seg>
<seg id="32"> During its Presidency, between 2000 and 2008, he was strongly for the absolute independence. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But under tais reign spans a new generation gemässigter politicians and the DPP is grappling with the voices of the professionals and the young. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Tsai found as a candidate of the DPP consensus as Su tseng-chang under Chen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Your party is doing everything to show that it is capable of close relations with Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Tsai is planning a ideenschmiede as a contact point between the DPP and China. This, however, presupposes open-minded discussion. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Tsai stated publicly that your party is a trustworthy "alternative" to offer MAS vorschneller rapprochement with China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Chen seems very annoyed about this change. </seg>
<seg id="39"> From his he declared that the candidates of the DPP would have done better to Taiwan's independence. </seg>
<seg id="40"> He urged the pragmatists Su even, to run for president. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even without Chen's interference is the DPP, their potential candidates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The KMT will of their own selbstanalyse must undergo. </seg>
<seg id="43"> MAS values are poor, in spite of rapid economic growth; kmt-kandidaten wanted their campaign without it. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The main reasons for his unpopularity, unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="45"> According to one kmt-sprechers it will be cabinet and the local institutions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is a rapprochement, limited. </seg>
<seg id="47"> At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese economic cooperation with China as inevitable. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Although researchers this unusual bacillus here on earth, is it your view, a sign that a life without hitherto regarded as vital elements is possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This body has two options. " </seg>
<seg id="5"> "it needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." </seg>
<seg id="6"> This makes it a very particular, although it is almost a form of 'alien' way of life ', said Paul c.w. Davies of Arizona State University and co-autor of the report on Thursday in the online-ausgabe the magazine Science. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Six main elements have been regarded as essential - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> However, as the scientists herausfanden, increases the Bacillus in the Californian mono Lake still further, if it has been replaced by arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "one wonders what else is still possible," said the co-autor of the report Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is an important step in seeking außerirdischem life, as scientists life and its forms must recognise, as Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The report deals with microbes on earth have been found. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The announcement of a press conference, with no details of the discovery, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet, the report by the discovery außerirdischen life. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery 'shows that in other planetensystemen organisms, with the help of other elements of biochemical processes in motion and that the' standardelemente ', which, in our opinion, are absolutely vital, not necessarily firmly indicated, "declared Charles cockell, Professor on planetary and space sciences Research Institute of the University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockel was not part of the teams. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> This work is a novelty, because it shows that in basic biochemischen processes and structures element by another cannot be replaced ', added cockell. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> This discovery was not accidental. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Institute Felisa wolfe-simon astrobiologischen NASA, the study launched, the mono Lake because of the high arsengehalts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Since arsenic and phosphorus chemically identical, that microbes that both are exposed, possibly a element by the other can replace. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "arsens is based, in particular, were aware of the fact that it is chemically a similar situation as phosphorus." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "It is the organisms, an element of other." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "But the difference is so great that arsenic differently as phosphorus. It into our biochemisches system, where almost all verschmiert," says Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers, the Bacillus gfaj-1 rising arsenkonzentration. It suited to and grew. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The microbe is growing phosphorus better, but that it is also in arsenic can survive shows that a arsen-basierte way of life, of course, can occur, either on the ground or another planet or the moon, the arsenic frequency. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> According to Jamie S., Mrs Foster, dozentin for Microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus by arsenic can be replaced, not new, but so far there has been no functioning example. </seg>

<seg id="10">  (if not differently, are all prices of toys' r 'US.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are plüschfiguren, such as guinea pig, the A grade, if you on your stomach. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> If you do not like their child smartphone entrust it, there are three independent alternatives. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Mobigo of vtech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and benutzerfreundlichste solution with a qwerty-tastatur.

<p>
<seg id="23"> Ixl of Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) is used for the Games and ebooks a system similar to iTunes and, thanks to the family photograph sd-kartenlaufwerks can also be said to be. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Finally, there are still scrabble flash ($30 from hasbro, for children from 8). The five bloc are no more than a matchbox and have their own led-bildschirm. </seg>

<seg id="6"> But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already tabled amendments in court, the reasons for appeal to explain and the courts in years to come. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> One of the provozierendsten reasons is that the intensive coverage of the process, even by the extensive use of Twitter by durchschnittsreporter - a "zirkusatmosphäre 'and a widespread, instant penetration aufrührerischer details have been so that the jury improperly influenced by the public indignation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This protest could induce appelationsgerichte with the issue of whether the new technologies, new rules in the courtroom necessary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> 'I have seen during this process, I believe that it really is a danger, if the arrival of the new technologies in the courtroom every individual " s right to a fair trial influences, "said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes hauptverteidiger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The presiding judge, Jon C. blue from the Supreme kammergericht, last week the applications by decision succinct and, when he said that the new media "carefully controlled ', and that there is no proof that the jury of passions driven. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But this was certainly not the last word on this matter. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For decades gerichtseinsprüche stated that the coverage of famous cases doubts about the fairness of a process gives rise. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In its historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States, the judgment against Dr Sam sheppard, osteopaths from Cleveland, his wife have killed, lifted and stated in its decision that, given the new media "karnevalsatmosphäre in the courtroom '. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some people think that the long-running and spielfilm 'on the flight' in this crime is based. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some lawyers say gerichtseinsprüche what Mr. Hayes condemnation of half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary in order to ensure that the channels from the courtroom at the time of the case of Dr sheppard were inconceivable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "There is a good reason, about the impact of the new media in processes of the general public are persecuted, to be anxious," said John J. donohue III, professor at Stanford law school, the death penalty has investigated in Connecticut. His report, they will be arbitrarily imposed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor donohue said, some appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of an instant communications from the courtroom, could the processes of fair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The twitter-angelegenheit is just one of the many lawyers of Mr. Hayes explain for years to discuss, and thus a condemnation to delay. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defender of claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes already have these could be as judges blue not to allow them to the reactions of potential judges to test, by offering them during the jurorenauswahl grausige tatortfotos showed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some of the judges have said, photographs of victims Jennifer hawke-petit, 48 years, and their tüchter, hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, they would have met with disgust. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The lawyers say they are also the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution in question, and argue that the judges are falsely exchanged a jury, a critic of the public prosecutor's office, and that it is improperly exerted pressure on the judgment than the unusual decision was made, the panel on the weekend freely. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The judges were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But their arguments on the impact of extensive coverage of the process is perhaps the greatest interest. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In a urteilsanfechtung that you have submitted last month, it is clear that the case of the news in Connecticut had dominated and during the campaign for the office of the governor and the American Senate of the candidates have been debated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They argued that the new media continuously the flames of the emotions of the case reopened. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "such a day-to-day surge of medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," wrote the lawyers, "we have previously in new haven and perhaps even nationally or not." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Its focus on the reporting of Twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In interviews said some journalists that the assertion that these direct messages are rabble-rousing but effective trade unionist than reports, the slower to be reimbursed, a technikfeindlicher view, the reporting of future processes verarme. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> But some lawyers said appelationsgerichte would often with the argument, social and technical changes requires the adaptation through the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr. hayers lawyers reinforce this assertion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In its objection they were based on the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, in which the sentencing of Dr sheppard because the reporting has been lifted and made it clear that the new media require new rules. </seg>

<seg id="3"> It is the sign of a real zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion, before we quickly to the struggle of the parties in the capital return? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of the Congress produced no breakthrough in the big issues to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government's policy in which any decision to be taken to deal with. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After all, what we hear that it has not been a polite debate between two different sides of a further consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of partisan punktesammelns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meetings of the deficit Commission of Presidents on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences between the members continue to exist. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months of mutual respect, the emergence of the ideological divide, which continues to the Members divides, concealed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It is not enough to say that it is a new era of cooperation here. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Both sides are now in a trial - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise, while claiming even tried to the limitations of public opinion and the patience of the voters for a renewed parteienkriegsführung arbitration. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants on a minimum requirements or accusations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too low, and that there is a rapid change in the atmosphere in the last two years, might be dominated. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Regardless of whether we are talking about taxes, donations, health or benefits, the two sides are miles apart. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Lastly, the novemberwahl Washington, at least for a short time bribed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> There is no question, the tone has changed, "said pete wehner, an official representatives of the Bush administration, which is now for the 'ethics and public policy center." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "that is after elections inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elections give partisan passions, die. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And that is a good thing. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In some areas, particularly in those that are on the agenda of the 'lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have no other choice than to find a solution. " </seg>
<seg id="19"> Bush's tax cuts ends at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way to receive some or all of them, be it temporarily or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Similarly, a compromise on the increased benefits to be expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that it believes that the recommendation that tax cuts for the rich, while unemployed workers support. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House is the optimism, that it is in these issues during the "lame duck" some session and, at the same time, the New START Treaty, cannot ratify. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But William glaston the Brookings insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of lame duck session 'is not necessarily a lasting cooperation between the parties must lead, if the new 112. Congress convened in January. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead, he says, is a phase of nichtübereinstimmens likely, perhaps even inevitable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "after the things that have to be done is done, this short-term psychology in confrontation reversal," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many, the courtesy to real cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "I see much of what is happening today in 2012, as a vorkampf or further shadow boxing, for the hauptereignis from 2012," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons for this have much with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the teeparty-wählern their education served. </seg>
<seg id="29"> As concerns the Republican leaders, it may be that you too high poker, you know that you must try to their promise to reduce government spending and health-care reform, to be respected. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> These parteilinien are already in the initial reactions on the recommendations of the deficit Commission clear how a tax reform and the raising of certain taxes, as well as the increase in the retirement age and the lowering of spending. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in accordance with its own assessments, pushed the defizitfrage on the public agenda that these could no longer be ignored. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need within the Commission, 14 of the 18 votes with its plan to official recommendation and you are fighting, even in the vicinity of this figure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The greatest resistance will take place in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters, today at least, little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Galston says two stages in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The first battle will next year in the form of parteizusammenstößen take place, if the Republicans Obama in terms of the budget, the taxes and the health system, then followed by a period of more zweiparteilicher cooperation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> Public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties work together. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If confrontation is a blind alley, as happened in 1995, then both sides must be prudent to the public reaction. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Whoever sentenced to lose, will change tack and the compromise must seek. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> This may, in fact, an optimistic view. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Partiality and polarisation today are greater than in the mid-1990's, and they seem more ideological gap between Obama and the kongress-republikanern than at the time between President Clinton and the Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At the same time, the activists of both parties in 2010 as a mere prelude to a far wider choice to 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> So it may be the courtesy of this week on the display of many Americans will be welcomed. </seg>
<seg id="45"> But it will on both sides much more effort requires a common denominator in the questions, the two are still separated. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to global security of nuclear material, the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that they no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The deal was in a joint statement following a meeting with the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister, Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the sicherheitsgipfels. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The US Government has for years sought Belarus to persuade, not more highly enriched uranium to collect and last spring seemed a barrier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But official of the US administration told the Washington Post that in the last two months, two secret agreement with Belarus have been taken 187 pounds weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian forschungsanstalt. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This was the platform for the agreement on Wednesday, the rest of the material to be removed, according to an official staff, because of the sensitivity of the issue of anonymous, roughly £500. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The agreement is one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear summit on security of 47 nations' in April, the Belarus had excluded. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And it was obvious good enough, at the invitation of the former Soviet Republic of the next summit of 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> 'I was truly thrilled about the fact that it has a seat in the nuclear summit on security (2012). " </seg>
<seg id="10"> 'This shows me that it works, "said Ken luongo, President of the partnership of global security, a group on the promotion of nuclear safety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Clinton called it "a very significant step" of Belarus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, within four years precarious nuclear material. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since the US administration has six countries helped their highly enriched uranium to get rid of. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Belarus is the seventh. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A dozen countries did under George W. Bush's administration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At the time of Obama's nuclear summit on security, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that the nation will never abandon their uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally waffenfähig, and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko at the time. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "This is our resource... we will not derive dirty bombs and we will not sell." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We use it solely for research purposes, that is all." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Belarus approached, however, a few months ago, the United States, as there is interest in the meeting of an agreement anzeigte. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The first round of the uranium in Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was easily verstrahlt say official. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It was a spezialzug load, the more than 1 300 miles to a Russian factory for the storage and disposal of, say, official. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The second attempt was decided on Monday and, according to the official by plane. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The US government pays for this effort $14 million, with a large part of the money in the Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which will not be used for nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> 'this was extremely careful and coordinated in order to build confidence "to the agreement which has been signed by President Clinton, said Andrew bieniawski, a representative of the department, the global gefahrenreduzierung works. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The James Martin centre for nichtweiterzugebende Studies calculates that Belarus this year at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium, and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Belarus is, according to the joint agreement camp in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The relations between Belarus and the United States for years been tense, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh respect for human rights. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But the statement on Wednesday suggests a possible rapprochement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> "the progress of this global security welcome heißend, the United States of America and Belarus known that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus is a central theme in improving bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," says it. </seg>

<seg id="1"> To kowtow to the European Central Bank (ECB) </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yesterday, the investors have responded strongly to the threat of the ECB President, Mr Trichet, who warned, "the markets should not underestimate our capacity to react." </seg>
<seg id="3"> The risk premia of euro-peripheriländer are increased dramatically and the stocks of European banks by more than 5%. </seg>
<seg id="4"> We should, however, the possibility that the ECB fooled can hardly points and the euro, which causes for concern, not to be underestimated. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The events of yesterday are typical of a illiquid market, to the extent that it breaks down are recovered, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The institutional investors will not lose its fear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> A month ago, the European Central Bank that our liquiditätmsaßnahmen reversed, whereby the ECB tomorrow, for the fourth time in two years, and probably still a number of times in the future, taking a step backwards. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The Bundesbank, which must plan for the purchase of public debt, as they are ineffective, and the lifting of exceptional temporary liquiditätsmaßnahmen, it should only einwöchiger permanent access to be maintained. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The irland-krise, we expect the current liquiditätsmaßnahmen "at least until March 'extended and the quarterly tenders with unbegrenztem access on quartalsende to ensure the liquidity at least until June to be maintained. </seg>
<seg id="10"> We hope, too, that the programme to purchase bonds to be continued and a stärkendes signal will be spent. </seg>
<seg id="11"> If the expectations are not met, the excellent response of the markets of yesterday are discarded and if halstarrig insistence that we can only withdraw our liquiditätsmaßnahmen, God help us! </seg>
<seg id="12"> Just as with the ezb-sitzung in May, when the Bank affirmed that the purchase of staatschuldpapieren not to take account of the markets and subsequently collapsed, this history tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The ECB must be credible and persevere. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In May, showed the teeth and on Wednesday, she said, much has bought, to have a new collapse of the market. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Yesterday, the auction of one-year staatstiteln in Portugal rather weak. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The state asset management were only 500 million 5,28%, compared to 750 million 4,81% in the previous auction. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Nevertheless, the interest rates fell in Portugal by 30 basis points in the whole of the curve and reflected a wahrnehmungsveränderung the markets after the words of Trichet's. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In Ireland, the figures of the schuldenlochs of allied and Bank of Ireland. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The amount to about 10 000 million in the short term and possible further 15 000 valued. There are time until February, in order to raise private capital or these banks are nationalised. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after the problem with the stress tests are not recognised in July, the figures in the context of the rescue plan, acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, the government next Tuesday the parliamentary assent to the new budget. As they still do not have the sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Angela Merkel has its discourse on the summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, moderate. There is political unity is needed, in order to demonstrate that we jointly play the same score. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries that Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The Spanish regierungspräsident yesterday the action plan, the Friday to be adopted by the Council of Ministers. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions, such as the financial institutions, the dismantling of the staatsdefizits, liberalisation, privatisation and creation measures in the ears of investors as vivaldis four seasons. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The sabbatical year Zapatero and Mr Trichet, explains why the Spanish stock exchange by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European markets. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In comparison with the February was the response of the government and of the Spanish central bank quickly and convincing, and we benefit from a surprise result. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year bond, which might the benefits from trichet-effekt. That is why we are placing a strong demand that all the doubts about our umschuldungsfähigkeit eliminate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> For Spain, the application of a self-sacrifice hilfsplans. </seg>
<seg id="30"> We would receive liquidity, which we need. The Treasury has EUR 40 billion available, three times as much as in March, the interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets without any notice would be closed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Nevertheless, our strategy should meet the motto Caesar's wife: 'now includes not only that, but appearances. " </seg>
<seg id="32"> Only courage that we create. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio olavarrieta yesterday, rejected the possibility that there might be a wave of mergers of savings banks and emphasised the speed with which the industry will be restructured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> As the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, there were a number of savings in the first phase. They retained the second round. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand, assured the Director-General of the Spanish sparkassenverbandes (CECA), José Antonio olavarrieta, this second round would not take place. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> I believe that the majority of mergers is completed, the inclusion of cajasol in the group Banca cívica cannot be regarded as a second round, it was about adjustments. " </seg>
<seg id="6"> "the largest part has been completed, and it may be that we replace siebzehen 13 or 14, but all the major processes are already completed, identified by Banco de España, all of which is strongly supported, controlled." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> One of the directors and managers aragoniens (adea) organised breakfast led olavarrieta that the process of concentration "as quickly as possible and that we should be satisfied with the timely expiry, in former times, not now, in the context of the business plans with Banco de España stipulates," he emphasised. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> 'the transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million vermögensbestand to 17 of the 75 500 million is a historically unvergleichbarer process, the number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62% and they are now much more, and that is what we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement, "he stressed. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="9"> Olavarrieta stated that 'there are a number of unabgebrachter opinions about the slowness of the process, the unseriösität and absurdity "revealed, because" Banco de España reminded us, before the end of the year. " </seg>

<p>
<seg id="11"> The managers pointed out that we are in the current economy 'no' on the situation of the financial institutions, and of the need to make savings, which is a very significant "concentration process have gone through," as quickly as possible 'will be completed. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Mr Zapatero and the red line of Germany </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin has for keeping the euro, but at the same time, conditions for the whole of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tension on the markets have a dual response from the government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation measures, starting with reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of work agencies or the lifting of 426 euro support for the unemployed, the no unemployment benefit, to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of airports Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the national lottery. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, it supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the aid of the former regierungspräsidenten Felipe González, the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis herausbeschwört. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How are these events? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is anticipated that Merkel's position no mistake of their public relations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is Germany a fundamentally new prospects to shape our future, with the preservation of ancient traditions of most of its partners. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In view of the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis spekuliern. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first: a strong euro, with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries in the South to leave the euro area. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Second: the reintroduction of the German mark - even though it currently looks more like science fiction sounds - supported by a majority of public opinion, approximately 50% of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The third: a transformation of the euro in accordance with German proposals, which means: more macroeconomic control and strict financial management and punishment of the countries which are crossing the guidelines; möglichereweise the default of some countries, as well as the extension of the cost of potential adjustments to the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is clear and has been for some time now, which is why there is now no excuses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First of all, in 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission for the deficits, and the German Government, a constitutional reform fairly, in order to prevent it from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> That was the first signs of the polarisation between what Germany was thought necessary (strict steuerpläne and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second signal, a central European country, as Merkel, the decision to save Greece's painful hinausschob. </seg>
<seg id="18"> At that time it was strongly criticised, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published absolutely opposed to the rescue of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally, Merkel in the past oktobertagen anew with a clear position, and it calls for a reform of the Treaties of the European Union, to the rescue of a country and, at the same time, to enable private lenders to commit to a part of the cost. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position was interpreted as anti-European as irlandkrise and all the following. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But your proposal, although somewhat sugared, has been accepted in the next few months we will be on the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures from 2013. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has a red line, it does not exceed. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It says all that - even if now unpopular measures must be taken, from that date, the old workings of the euro will no longer be available. </seg>
<seg id="24"> 2013 will be the geburtsjahr of a new currency zone, in which the zuwiderhandelnden countries be severely punished, this can be forced to declare itself bankrupt and, in this case, the private sector is a part of the costs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows us that we need to take a hard economic growth, with high savings and investment, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The alternative to the indebtedness and construction of massive holes in the balance of payments is based, as was led by Spain in boom times, is simply not acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would be wrong to do so, it is not understood. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not just a question of the deficit until the year 2013 to 3% runterzufahren. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much harder. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, we were to cheat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the current turbulence more calmly. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And that we take the opportunities offered to us by the spring of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero has taken this so well, and his dual announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies, last Saturday, and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, its own house in order to create their way it has been. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Nevertheless, Germany drawn red line is here, and it does not seem that change. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In contemplating means is that the countries with little serious fully gestopften euro area, cannot be ruled out. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In this case, Germany might still say that it has warned us. </seg>

<seg id="6"> Finally, penalising the disziplinarkommitee UEFA the coach of the clubs, José mourinho, with two games and the relevant players with different sums of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is so widespread that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this branch of our rules. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of the debate have arisen in the case to the fact that a team of the club Real Madrid (which in its anthem edelmut and honour and on other occasions its players for similar incidents punished), and the key role played by the dramatisierung mourinho, an episode to its long history and has added theatralischer and provocative technicians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case, the debate about whether this is not expressly of the statutes of illicit behaviour runs counter to the principles of sport, that is to say whether these actions constitute a regelumgehung. Indeed, believes that this approach to the statutes of sport, but its meaning. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this matter, should the sporting spirit ailment be investigated. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sporting spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect which is not threatened by these acts, because it was not an aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid zuwiderhandelnden players an unjustified benefits from gegenteam. This did not happen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradox of the activity of players of the Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally under falschspiel or regelumgehung understand, because the circumvention of the rule has not been secretly executed, in order to avoid a sanction, but they should be as striking as possible, so that they will be punished by the referees. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The gambler waited and the sanction one. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is what kind of advantage the zuwiderhandelnden from the deliberate fouls. </seg>
<seg id="17"> It should be emphasised that the rival either in a disadvantageous position has benefits for the game erheischt gespielte, because the obvious result of this was that the own team with less players to play. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because of the club is not about these players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The advantage is that the players of the next spielphase the Champions League without cards participating in a future game could threaten to begin. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a long-term, to a certain extent, uncertain advantage, because the team will retire. In addition the players with this approach a sanction and, in the second kartenzyklus on, because kartenanhäufung with a card fewer than in the first cycle departure. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Thus, it is not clear whether it is really a advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Ultimately, such practices are not against the sporting spirit, including strategic decisions belong to the provisions of a maximum benefit. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case, the players not a sanction to circumvent (that is, indeed, a clear case of regelumgehung), they wanted more choice, when you of this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They met a strategic choice, without a penalty or to sidestep it. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Although the boundary between imagination and regelumgebung blurred, I believe that this issue is a clear case of inventiveness. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because there are two selbstausschlüsse and because of the type of provoking regelübertragung. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The damage to the principles of sport by these acts, is less ethical rather than aesthetic nature. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Consequently, the American diplomats astonished that the Canadian constituents in the ballot, not the kanadisch-amerikanischen relations in the interests, and they believe that the visit of President Obama, the conservative government helped its budget from 2009. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington, the public have been disseminated yesterday, still offer more juicy details than the mere substantial content, which has a very bad outcome. </seg>

<seg id="6"> The great astonishment of David Wilkins used in Ottawa, the American Ambassador. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Mr Wilkins offers various erklärungsmöglichkeiten this situation. </seg>

<seg id="9"> The United Nations, so he schlußfolgert are thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially to threatening, in order to talk about him." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The Ambassador understands this' deafening silence "even less, when the two countries intensive political and economic relations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> 'logically', he should assess the ability of candidates, a party and much more of a party to hold such an essential relationship that the voters at the ballot box as a key factor in the sense. " </seg>

<p>
<seg id="12"> The other manifestation of this sense of importance reads on 22 January 2009, by Terry breese geschäftsträger in Ottawa, sent communication, the President Barack Obama on his first visit to prepare in Ottawa. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Your visit will help the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, in Canada, his first deficit after more than a decade to announce, is the result of a belebungsprogrammes in the level of 30 to 40 billion dollars ," describes breese. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> A further, from January 2008 and carved from the ambassador Wilkins authored communication agreed by the ever growing image of Washington, on CBC broadcast, dramatic series of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts, such as border, little mosque on the prairie, intelligence and H2O, where little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly-list" or contributions for the purposes of the CIA conducted by muskelprotze interrogations can monitor. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="5"> The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This represents an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust emissions of the global fleets. </seg>

<seg id="16"> The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, is not the kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal-fired power stations that emit more mercury, the weißglühenden pears wasted electricity. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport industry on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it rains billion. </seg>
<seg id="3"> At least in the discussions. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The baubeginn the SGP, the state has a kapitaldotation of EUR 4 billion. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The theoretical scheme is the sum of the SGP then that would allow the markets of the finanzsumme to their dual. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Today it is, after all, the first projections. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The amending budget for 2010, this morning studied by the finanzkommission of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged in the first part of this money. </seg>
<seg id="9"> We are talking here about two measures: the creation of a special tax on erschließund and a higher taxation of offices on the ile-de France. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The former funding, so Article 15 of the law, is in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris. " </seg>

<seg id="13"> How much would it propose? </seg>
<seg id="14"> A puzzle. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This amount is not in the text. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="16"> Of the 4 billion is a long way away. </seg>
<seg id="17"> 'It is stated that the fiscal resources to the EUR 4 billion of kapitaldotation be added by the State will be found and Société du Grand Paris and for the project to be done, "is the explanatory statement. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Rachsüchtige hackers and emsige spies </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The affaire Wikileaks has a twofold importance. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On the one hand, it is an obvious scandal, a scandal that only a scandal in sinner hypocrisy, the beziehunge between the Member States, the citizens and the press governed. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand, it announces profound changes at an international level, and gives a foretaste of the regression dominated by future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Let us get things in the right. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any of a secret service 'acts (an old nation) exclusively from zeitungsausschnitten. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits Berlusconi are nothing more than what we are discussing months in any old Journal anyway to read, (except for those whose owners Berlusconi is), and the frightening karikaturierte profile Gaddafi's kabarettkünstlern already provided for a long time substance for their sketche. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule that the secret dossiers is already well-known news consist, is essential for the dynamism of the secret services, and not only this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go into a library, esotherischen publications, you will recognise that every factory (via the grail, the mystery of the rennes-le-chateau templer or rosenkreuzler) accurately repeats what is already in previous works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is not, therefore, that the author occult texts to publish any research (or, therefore, that he does not know where news about the nicht-existierende to), but because those who devote the okkultismus, nothing other than what you already know and confirmed what you have already learned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the erfolgsmechanismus of Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Also, the secret files. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informer is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise, whatever it may be, for example, editor in Libération), the only true considers what he recognises. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The top-secret information on Berlusconi, the American embassy in Rome, the staatsdezernat cleverly, was the same as those who have already published Newsweek the week before. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> So why was such a fuss about the revelation of this dossier? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On one side is this what every well-educated person already know, that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the government can call each other or a plane, to the dinner on meeting - have lost their diplomatic role, and, with the exception of some small repräsentationsaufgaben spionagezentren have turned in. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Any old viewer from ermittlungsfilmen knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that acting to ignore this. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Nevertheless, the fact, to repeat it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to American diplomacy in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Secondly: the idea that a hacker geheimsten x-beliebiger the secrets of the most powerful country in the world can tap entails the considerable blow to the prestige of the staatsdezernats. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, the scandal less the victims rather than the 'Executioner' is in trouble. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we have the profound nature of what has happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Formerly, Orwell's time, it was all power as a big brother, every gesture of his subjects controlled. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwell's prediction would have been totally right to emphasise, where any movement thanks to the telephone, each made transaction, visited the hotel, the elected motorway and so on; the citizens dignity to the total victims of the eye of power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> However, if you look at bearing in mind what is happening today that even the secret krypten is no longer the control of hackers to escape the kontrollgang listening to be directed at unilaterally, and will zirkelförmig. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power controlled every citizen, every citizen, or at least the hackers - acquired a vindicator of the citizen - the secrets of power in experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> How can a power that are no longer in a position to maintain their own secrets? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is true, Georg simmel said that a real mystery an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed; it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Mr Berlusconi or Merkel's basically a secret free from geheimis, because they reveal the public sphere; but the styles of WikiLeaks to be disclosed that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to deprive them of any power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Wikileaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wronged, but Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What are the consequences of this violation, such a huge power has been done? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the Member States will, in future, no longer be reserved information online - that would be one of the street corner angeklebten aushang. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is equally obvious that the current technologies in vain hope, confidential reports on telephone secret. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a Head of State of a plane moved and one of his colleagues has contacted. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could, in the future, private and only for certain ears certain relations? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I am aware that my prediction at the moment for science fiction and romanhaft sound, but I am forced, I imagine, regierungsagenten on secret and uncontrollable marschrouten active in moving to meet their messages anywhere other than in the mere memory with tragend and, furthermore, the few written information you have been given in schuhabsatz verbergend. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information in one single copy in closed cannot be stored: basically, the spionageversuch of Watergate less success than WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity to write that the technology nowadays as a cancer, namely backwards. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A century after the wireless telegraf communication had revolutionized, reconstructed the Internet with a telegrafen (telephone) wire. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The (analogue) videokassetten had filmforschern, a film bond for bond auszukundschaften by the forward spulen and all the secrets of installation drop, while the (digital) CDS nowadays nothing else, as a chapter to chapter to jump in makroportionen. </seg>
<seg id="39"> With the high-speed trains travelling within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this by air, including the switching three and a half hours. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Therefore, it is not unusual that politics and communications technology in car and horse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> A final observation. </seg>
<seg id="42"> In earlier times, the press to understand what mysteries between the embassies were forged. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At the moment, it is the embassies, the confidential information from the press. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Climate, such as France, its finanzversprechen amount </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to comply with the financing pledge rapidly resolved ("almost start 'or premature funding) to investigate the developing countries. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And the gross French vulnerable to blandishments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With the Copenhagen agreement, the developing countries are committed to $30 billion between 2010 and 2012. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The EU has EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France has promised to 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> At the opening of the COP16, the EU has all the partners of the fact of their commitments regarding fast-start-finanzierungen: detailgetreuer vorgehensbericht to convince the Member States to press conference, that great nebenevents broschürenverteilung. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The operation and extent of transparency is remarkable for its real value is estimated that the developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries do the same for the same präzisionsniveau. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The EU announced, in 2010, EUR 2.2 billion released to what they are on the right road to respektbezollung commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But if we look into detail, things are a little more complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should be according to the Copenhagen Treaty 'and', in order to ensure that an additional use has been tabled, to the detriment of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what 'and' means. </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the Commission had proposed a harmonisation of certain Member States, including France, the procedure blocked. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today, everyone chooses the benchmark that he considers the best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those of 2009 for: the international finance are being retained, and within the framework of funding 'fast-start "150 million over three years. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries have similar benchmarks, either as regards year or in terms of the level of public development aid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In contrast, France was of the opinion that the financing of 'all new projects' of 2010 are "new and additional '. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In other words, there is no indicative in the expenditure of the previous year or at a global level of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Specifically, the total amount of the French support for developing countries remain stable (or discourage) - France gives its commitment to the "new and additional 'financing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another important element is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is still no rule, and everyone chooses its rechenmodus. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some countries, such as France, have lent €1 as an equivalent to 1 donated €. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This is apparently difficult to justify that the effort is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loans for certain profitable investment (and often to the emissionseindämmung tied projects, which actually based on technology) can be justified, it is illusory to present the euro, known as the equivalent of EUR donated to pervade... and only the cost of the loan for the kapitalgeberland be counted as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of interest rate). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France has nothing changed in accordance with the following thought: it 'respect' its commitment of EUR 420 million by 91,5% loans (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% donates) 36,1 million euros) - see the document, in order to convince themselves. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only country in the EU that loans to a great extent. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany is 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands, or Slovakia (among other things) their commitments to 100% of donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In other words, if the vast majority of European Union €to fulfil their obligations, France spends just 10 cents and understands including a similar effort. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Beautiful hocus-pocus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> All in all, operated on France in its fast-start-finanzierung with a dual sham: a part with a weiterentwicklkung of action over time, and partly with the reality of the financial commitment. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France, manages to believe that this 420 million "new and additional 'million in accordance with its promises, and it saves it has spent 36,1 million euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the Treasury (as it appears that it was Bercy the arbitrage has carried out a doubly negative effect) could entail; even internally (why the other Member States with the donations if there is enough to lend?), and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries is not completely misled... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter of premature finance only a small issue in a relatively short time in comparison with the entirety of discussions on the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it may be too much of the drop in the cost of machinery UNFCCC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> We hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As always, it is essential that its lesson from this first year of premature funding to learn. </seg>
<seg id="36"> First and foremost, France may amend its verbuchungsart for the years 2011 and 2012, and in a spirit of respect for his commitments and the counterbalancing fairness with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Above all, however, France could the discussions on the subject of a dispute of long-term financing forward (another decisive and is currently discussing): you can escape the question of "verrechenbarkeit" or verbuchungsart its loans. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could change its position as progressive as regards the disputes, as it is in other areas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The hope is based on the new environment minister Kosciusko-Morizet, next week in Cancun will arrive. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A surprising announcement on the fast-start France and its vision of the "verrechenbarkeit 'and the use of loans would naturally the international trust to raise the need for further discussions. </seg>
