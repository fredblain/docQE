Czech children appreciate with Fernet and rum, beer is out - simply has to slow 
Fernet, rum and vodka, exceptionally, sometimes a good whisky, the father has stolen from the Hausbar. 
These are the drinks, according to which enjoyed drunken Czech teenagers under 15 must be the most notbehandelt. 
No exceptions are children, their hangovers repeatedly have ausschlafen in the hospital. 
This emerges from the experience of the doctors facing similar cases in the inclusion of the Kinderabteilungen of clinics. 
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion, because it simply takes too long to be drunk." 
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Ludk Pelikán, the chief surgeon of the paediatric department Hoovice in the Central Bohemian clinic. 
"Whisky, if it succeeds, the father a bottle from the Hausbar, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka. 
"Vodka has the advantage that it can be blended with Juice, then he smacks not so strong," said the chief doctor. 
The spokeswoman of the Fakultätskrankenhauses Motol Eva Jurinová gives him right. 
"Usually involves Fernet or rum." 
"This is the current alcohol trend, notably at primary schools." 
"Occasionally, there was slivovice one walks from home," Mrs Jurinová. 
Pelikán chief doctor, thirteen or fourteen years of drinkers in the hospital stock long no anomaly. 
Before the clinic in Hoovice, in which he has been working since this year, he was ten years in the pädiatrie department of the hospital Motol act, where ambulances angetrunken students from the Middle and produced effect. 
"A girl had to be four times are." 
"Your career she began 12 years ago, when it is the first time with 3.5 mg alcohol in the blood and even in combination with" Extase "was the crunch provides," described the doctor a particularly difficult case. 
"It was in the exhibition site in Holeovice on any dance party." 
"The interesting thing was that her mother not strange was that her daughter 48 hours was not home," wonders why the chief surgeon. 
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in use with one's offspring is one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism from children. 
In order to have a real addiction in the true sense of the word experts say, children are not. 
"Under alcoholism is a longstanding chronic dependence on alcohol, together with all related phenomenon to understand and that is not the case with these children." 
In those enjoying the repeated alcohol is mostly a negative familiär social background characteristic," said Pelikán chief doctor. 
The spokeswoman of the hospital Motol, according to Ms. Jurinová, by the middle of November approximately 40 drunken children hospitalised in the local department for children and youth medicine. 
However, only the cases with severe alcohol poisoning, which required a hospital a go in the statistics. 
Drunk children after ambulatory care of parents or possibly by the police to be brought home, will not be registered. 
Apart from the cases in which children just by a austrinken bottle of spirits in the school bank after opinion of Mr. Pelikán three seasonal Amplitudes, on the 100%: Walpurgisnacht New Year's Eve and the end of the school year. 
"The latter for two reasons - either from distress because of the poor testimony or from joy at the holidays." 
"In the Walpurgisnacht, I have also been seven drunken children experienced in the reception," stresses Dr Pelikán. 
A drunken child spends the night under medical supervision, paradoxically, is better off than a child in the next day only has to contend with a nasty hangover. 
The headaches in the morning, then the may and the glucose deficiency can be in the hospital with a liquid donation built by the Infusion with glucose and nährst open the organism lack drive. 
"They are clearly better off, because after the 'beautiful' experience in the evening, prick them with good humour, without somewhere hurts." 
"They are only somewhat confused about where they are," Pelikán doctor admits, referring the patients sometimes spoil the good humour, at least by listing by showing them the costs, which will cost them the treatment. 
Because the transportation with the ambulances and the night in an emergency bed well and like to make a few tens of thousands of kronor. 
"Every now and again I did used as educational resources if I directly have calculated the children on the trip, which has cost their drunkenness, and that it can happen that they even look at the whole holiday on to work for the money for a single such Fete deserve," Dr Pelikán added. 
In his opinion, however, the insurance funds are not attacking after Regressverfahren, which costs necessary to cure the intoxicated children demand from the parents.
