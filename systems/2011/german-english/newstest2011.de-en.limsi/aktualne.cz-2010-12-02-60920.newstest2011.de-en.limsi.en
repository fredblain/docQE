A tenant of Bakala: it fuels in the stove - still pays higher rent 
An elderly untersetzter man leaves just the client centre of society RPG Byty of the "Kohlebarons" Zdenk Bakala, the largest Privatbesitzers of rental housing in the Czech Republic. 
Under the arm of a commemorative envelope with three new leases on three homes: on their own and the homes of his daughters and his son, who has just served a prison sentence. 
All three were in the framework of the so-called 'deregulation' has just increased the rent. 
Instead of 3.500 kronor monthly miete is the son next year for a 2 room home with kitchen fork out £3.3bn 4100 kronor in the second category. 
"There are less than fluid in the flat hot water and heat must be in a simple coal," he angrily tippt a finger at the new lease of the son, whose signature he a power. 
"But what - signed and I," he says upset half and half resigned. 
The Citizens' Association BytyOKD.Cz, the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral" advises the tenants, the new contracts are not easy to sign and until 7 December to wait, in which it intends to publish a guidebook, as it fights against such contracts. 
But the man is dismissive. 
"One says this, the other," he makes a grim face. 
The region of Ostrava is so great "deregulation laboratory." 
After the New Year is this deregulation most rental housing in the Czech Republic before, whose tenants pay has not yet been a market-based rent. 
Aktuáln.Cz therefore decided this "laboratory" personal visit. 
The RPG-Warteraum Havíov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning packed on this Tuesday. 
Right beside the door Bodyguards a security agency and in her a aufruf machine. 
"Rent 2011" stands a special Tastfeld on the touch screen. 
In a nutshell touched upon by and already spuckt the device with a numerical list. 
We have almost the number "157" entziffert and already piepst them on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting period. 
Half a second later in the series. 
A little later enters an older couple waiting period, in order to ask for the rent, but the onslaught in the waiting area is apparently not the new rent. 
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - Reparaturanträge, Versicherungsangelegenheiten and similar. 
From the middle of November fly in the region Ostrava Kuverts with the new leases most tenants of a total of 44.000 homes of the portfolio of RPG in the mailboxes. 
The RPG Byty beats them in the letter a rent increase of around 15 to 38 percent. 
The specific date for the new rent in the client centre is opened since 18 November. 
"The action runs a little over a week, which means that is only the beginning" answer the ladies behind the counter for a moment of hesitation, as the "client" emerging as a journalist. 
The deregulation and Bakalas former Bergarbeiterwohnungen are a sensitive issue. 
Before the elections had Parliament's Vice-President originating from Ostrava Lubomír Zaorálek of the SSD quite loudly taken up this issue, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of them. 
"Twenty years, I want a new floor by them." 
"It is not times ne besch. WC-Brille they could change" makes the aforementioned man air. 
Until now, according to the staff face all pensioners on the counter in order to convince themselves whether they really get the promised tenants' moderation, which promises them RPG if they have the specific requirement to sign in time. 
In the enjoyment of a half reduced February miete should come the other tenants, the new lease sign until 15 December. 
Until now, "deregulation" in Havíov but everything else, as overloaded of enquiries. 
"From yesterday's 360 clients were only around 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because here" appreciate the schalter beamtins. 
RPG offers both on their websites, as well as Wandtafeln individual rental agreements where necessary. 
If the rental parties but did not agree to the new rent, they will be set by an independent court. 
"This is not a threat, but as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach to understand," declared RPG on its websites. 
"Here nobody goes to court," says one of the staff of RPG Byty and a man on the street before the client centre gives her at least partly right. 
"I have 13 (kronor) pension, of which I left for lunch 5.000, where I should get the money for a legal dispute," he says. 
Then the employee is uncertain. 
"See time." 
"Mr Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so people prefer to wait and see" them to bear in mind. 
The regulated rent ends in the largest part of the Czech Republic to New Year's 2011 and RPG Byty, the rent hike an economic necessity. 
"The existing level of rent is not enough times to the maintenance of the housing funds from" argues Pavel Klime, the director of the Wohnungs-Portfolios society RPG Byty and - just the angry tenants criticise neglect of the housing fund, according to the homeowners of the main reason for the rent hike. 
While RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010 from one's rent four billion could be invested in the houses in the four years from 2011 until 2014, it should be 5.2 billion. 
In the broadsheet LCD-Display on the ceiling of the polster sessels in the waiting area of Havíov in the meantime, there are always a few red shining information. 
"The rental increases by 15% in 2011 and less concern 31.200 homes, which means more than 90% of the homes of RPG." 
"Time and means that no more than 7,50 CZK per square metre and month" is to read on the LCD-Monitor. 
Only 400 homes from the portfolio of RPG increased the rent by 38 percent. 
"In these cases is increasing extreme lower rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG. 
In 2600 housing remains the rent at the same level in the next year. 
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation rents not erratic drives up, but staged within four and eight years. 
What is more, the company another obligation: all revenue from the rental increase (see graph) wants to keep putting the company back into the homes, especially in Wärmeersparnisse - in new windows and insulation. 
However, this should primarily benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent hike.
