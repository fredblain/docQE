Checkers in the Zwielicht 
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa is from the experimental industry infiltrated with Genpflanzen. 
Thus, this accusation now formulated the expert group testing biotech as independent institute for the impact assessment of the biotechnology understands. 
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well documented," said Testbiotech-Chef Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich. 
The head of the EFSA expertengruppe for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and for years a further EFSA expert are also in the Ilsi lobby organization under contract. 
The corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer paid. 
Kuiper worked on the Efsa-Prüfvorschriften for Genpflanzen authoritative and am thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticised Then. 
The EFSA rules are selling as word equal with position papers of the Ilsi and deceive so that the imprint of the industry, the real authority in the Italian Parma should be controlled. 
It is already the second time that test biotech bemängle an interest collision. 
This is a senior EFSA managerin recently without conditions or transitional period for the Swiss agricultural company Syngenta - and thus have switched sides. 
Even the Central German radio (MDR) had recently unveiled personnel links between EU authority and industrial lobby, which the Environmental Office, as well as sympathetic. 
However, the Efsa can see no conflict of interest. 
It will take on all the serious data back to this industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, says in a statement. 
From the experts who work for Efsa, we do not demand that they have no contact with the industry. 
You should disclose but this. 
Kuiper gives his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States a. 
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from academia, industry and politics - including on the risk assessment of biotechnology without lobbying mission. 
In the matter criticize independent experts such as Then that genetically modified crops currently without any feeding experiments in animals be allowed, and the reaction of Genpflanzen shall not be tested on environmental influences. 
"We want to know what for example makes genetically modified maize on the field," says Then. 
Derzeitige practice is only isolated proteins, but not to test the whole Genpflanze, what am no reliable results. 
"If the risks are not looking, how is it possible to find them?" asks Then accusatory. 
It also includes Angelika Hilbeck. 
The scientist researched in the engineering since 1994 and is currently at the technical university Zurich active. 
The industry experiments in this area as in the United States now in Europe increasingly to influence or to discredit critical scientists. 
There is therefore hardly researchers who were not intertwined with corporations. 
For business critical studies were not published in the rule. 
"The industry controls the security research," Hilbeck claimed.
