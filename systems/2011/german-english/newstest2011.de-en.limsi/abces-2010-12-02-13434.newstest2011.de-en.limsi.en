PP Ma's calls for postponement of the tax agreement 
Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, the chairman of the PPC, yesterday the opportunity Artur Ma's personal their conditions to support his new post as prime minister to submit the Generalitat. These do not differ from the already during the election campaign and the primacy of the economic recovery and the regionalist Unabhängigkeitsabenteuern as a financial compensation agreement, the leaders will propose at the height of his mandate, summarise. 
The leader of the Catalan Popular Party opposing Mas with the security of Artur awarded her the 18 MEPs, which they won on Sunday - a paragraph, which is more than enough to feel indispensable because the candidate of the Civic regionalistischen CiU party is dependent on that at least one of the opposition parties in the vote contains the voice in his new post. 
The future alliances regionalists during the next parliamentary elections in Congress intend to depend on a possible entente with the PP. The talks, Mas is currently conducting with the other party leaders, however, revolve around Catalonia. 
As far as the leader of the PPC, this calls for the support of the new post "all discourses, which affect the sovereignty and independence for Catalonia" and an agreement on the financial compensation between the state and the autonomous region, like in the Basque Country - and the leader of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum, to be employed at the back. 
Both political leaders is common, that they exaggerated political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and want to abolish death duties and gift tax. 
With the details of the negotiations on the new post of Ma's deal on the part of the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat. 
Mas has already spoken with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - which announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV hit) today, he will be with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana) meet.
