Mystery of the komplexgeschüttelten Canada lifted 
The new American Diplomatenleitungen, which have been disseminated by WikiLeaks, reveal the mystery about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of Canadians feel toward the Americans; but they put the the latter superiority with the same blow against Canada open. 
Consequently, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters to the ballot, not the kanadisch American relations in the spirit, and they believe that the visit by President Obama would have helped the Conservative government, their Budget of 2009 to enforce! 
The four new communications between the US Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which have been disseminated yesterday publicly offer even more juicy details than the mere substantive content, in which it has a very bad outcome. 
A previous link on 22 September 2008, i.e. in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage was in full swing, reported from what point the United Nations is not more of the operations involve discussed by their political bosses. 
With regard to the great surprise of David Wilkins of Ottawa deployed American ambassador. 
Mr. Wilkins offers various channels of this situation. 
"One of the Canadians almost inherent inferiority complex conditional leads possibly the Canadian political leaders far more on internal disputes of everyday life to talk as the United States in this election the buck (as in 1988, when the campaign on the free trade) ," as he describes. 
The United Nations, he concludes, are thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially threatening to speak of him." 
The ambassador understands these "deafening silence" especially since the two countries harbour intensive political and economic relations. 
"Logically" excommunicated him, "should the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to drive such processes relationship of voters in the poll as a key factor in the sense." 
The other expression of this sense of importance reads on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business sources in Ottawa, sent communication, President Barack Obama on his first visit in Ottawa to prepare. 
"Your trip will help the continuation of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget in early February to ensure, in the Canada its first deficit after more than a decade will announce the result of a recovery programme is created in the level of 30 to 40 billion dollars," describes Breese. 
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had the parliamentary session before Christmas must be postponed in order to prevent that Parliament would be toppled by the coalition and the conditional continuation of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed Belebungsprogramms. 
Another, from January 2008 dating of the year and written communication from the Wilkins ambassador in Washington agreed the race by the growing image that the dramatic series broadcast on development, spread by the United States. 
The ambassador is worried about programmes such as Border, little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the 'No-Fly-List' or Abführungen for the purpose of interrogation analysis by the CIA Muskelprotze watch. 
Yet another communication reported at length about how Hillary Clinton remarked in their French counterparts Bernard Kouchner during their first bilateral meeting asked whether Europe is ready to include certain prisoners from Guantanamo. 
Mr. Kouchner is expected to answer the question yes, but on the basis of an individual " case to Fall"-Entscheidung. 
Àm at the end of the meeting, as described, "he has the Secretary of State distributed a paper in terms of Omar Khadr, a 15-year Muslims Canadian origin." 
"The Secretary of State has promised the files again." 
Do we finally that the sensibilities on the website WikiLeaks. 
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close standing adviser, explained on development that the people responsible for this massive leak should be "killed." 
He was here on Mike Huckabee just cites from the United States.
