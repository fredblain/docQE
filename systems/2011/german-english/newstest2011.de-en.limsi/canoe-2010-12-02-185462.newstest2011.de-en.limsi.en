The new entity will take place no unanimity 
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new frame unity on the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest many observers continue to call for the creation of a public committee of inquiry on this issue. 
Robert Dutil, minister of public security, claimed this idea come not from yesterday: Quebec had already last January, the New York Department of Investigation consulted on this issue. 
The metropolis has at its disposal for fastest on a standing unit against corruption. 
However, the announcement by Wednesday, more than just a surprise. 
We must say that this measure on the occasion of the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebecer police service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils has not been discussed in the slightest. 
It lacked not due to the fact that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and a member of the Parti Québécois, this announcement in terms of public safety as a "gezaubertes rabbit from the hat 'and' coping in a table of the year cobbled solution" to qualify. 
Minister Dutil had turn appealed to those who fear that the political power too much influence on the challenging agenda for the future unity have. 
"You will see the result if we will announce it," he was to confirm. 
"We realise this problem." 
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public poll. 
"The more M. Charest insisted to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry want, the more people like you and I think that he has something to hide," he said. 
"The only means to be able to form a committee of inquiry, the resignation of Jean Charest" said in turn Yves bois, lecturer in ethics and political systems of the ENA (staatl. high school for the training of senior administrators). 
In order to emerge from this impasse, proposing the Quebec, to give a specific mandate from the financial auditing control, so that those on corruption and collusion appropriate inquiries can. 
"You should be able to extend the mandate of the audit control," as he decided. 
He also takes the view that the Quebec of audit control give the same power as members could, which would allow her to commit people to the statement. 
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project Charest in the drawers of the government. 
The Quebec will also ask Ottawa to amend the penal code in order better to be prepared for this type of crime. 
This demand comes from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, the Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier has informed that the case law is not clear in this type of prosecution. 
Vic Toews, minister for public security confirmed, for its part, his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, committed currently with certain this dossier offending update apart. 
During the operation Printemps 2001, which affected the groups of Motorradpolizisten, were 131 people have been arrested, although the criminal law has not been revived. 
Ottawa has as a result, enforced the law against gangsters.
