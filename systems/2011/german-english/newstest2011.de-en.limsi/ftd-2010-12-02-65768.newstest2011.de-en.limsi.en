Ogoniland is spent 
The water in the rivers is ölbraun, it smells like at the petrol station: billion litres of spillage of crude oil have destroyed nature in Ogoniland in Nigeria. 
The people of theft, corruption and illegal Ölkochen. 
Celestine Akpobari says it well. 
"Plagt not away" reassured the green activist journalists: "You will get in front of the lens oily slime enough today." 
The 37-year-old Nigerians has followed the attempt, one by watenden boy on the chest in the water with him around Schlieres abzulichten: in the regenbogenfarbenen water are being is sapping the scene almost beautiful. 
The fact that tops brown crude oil below the surface, is not to be seen. 
In the past, they have collected buckets and wise shrimps, tells Esther Badom on the shores of the Bodo-Jetty-Flusses. 
In the meantime is the lazy river waters completely dead. 
Before five years from a geborsten pipeline loads of crude oil in the vast wetland. 
Fishermen from the nearby city Bodo must row now six hours in order to get into fish containing waters: the Ogoniland situated in the heart of the Niger Delta is regarded as one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world. 
On the journey through the mangrove sumpfs criss-crossed by rivers is striking the extent of the devastation. 
Instead of murky water brown unsavory brew was wühlt the engine boat, who appears in his hand into the water, prefers ölig finger, it has emerged. 
The roots of the mangrove bäumchen as black Lakritzstangen from the soil, sad isolated trees to hang their Wedel. 
Vogelschwärme, as they are usual in wetlands, looking in vain: as soon as the external border is spreading in the silent as a filling station fragrance end eerily calm from former paradise. 
"What happens is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari sinister: "We live in constant danger for the health." 
The war comparison is appropriate. 
The residential area of the Ogoni is a for decades contested battleground: here, the first Explorateure from Europe in more than 60 years ago, a here organized in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa initial resistance, the shell company here had to stop its production in 1993, because it was too dangerous for its Ölarbeiter. 
Even today, the company denied the return to Ogoniland: while the entire delta region of the triple the size of Switzerland, with more than 5.000 Bohrquellen and 7.000 kilometres donated daily more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped in Ogoniland, the oil fields, are lying idle at the corporation is unstable situation. 
All the few hundred metres steel Gestells as bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christian bäumchen" the heads of the boreholes sunk too lack mentioned. 
They are up to 50 years old, most shook korrodiert. 
It is always such a Bohrkopf apart, says Akpobari, then rinne a constant stream of crude oil into the water. 
More than two billion litres, according to expert estimate in 50 years were spilled into the ecosystem of the Delta: year on year, the quantity of oil, as they are in the wreck of the super tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago into the sea off Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind. 
Who is to blame for the ongoing Öko-GAU about the dispute. 
While the shell company sabotage and organized Öldiebstahl for more than 90 percent of the pollution responsible, environmentalists see berstend Bohrkopfs and leakage pipelines as the main culprit. 
Shell attach in Nigeria much lower safety standards than usual in the world, the US-Wissenschaftler Richard Steiner accused the corporation 2008: alone, the rate of defects in the pipes "that is several times higher than elsewhere." 
At a place from afar as an abandoned, ölverschmiert garage looks under skies are appearing in the Mangroves figures: they are cluster naked and ölverschmiert up to our necks. 
Under one of the many barrels, partly associated with flasks, partly arbitrary scattered on the site to identify flackert a fire: an illegal small refinery. 
The barrel of crude oil on the fire several hours heated, said Michael, the head of the group. 
First of all, gets petrol through the pipes in the detention facility, in the end tröpfelt eventually headed kerosene and diesel, it has emerged. 
Thus produce Michael and four staff on a daily basis to four Fässer diesel à 300 litres: "This brings us 34.000 Naira a ' - around 22 dollars. 
The delta residents use the chronic fuel shortages in the Africa's largest oil state. 
Nigeria only has a single refinery. 
According to the barely 40 euro cents per litre ridiculously low diesel prices can still offer the illegal Kocher: because their raw materials are getting it for free. 
It comes from "Bunkerern," the pipeline network across Ogoniland tap: in this way to go to the country, according to experts in the entire Niger Delta daily lost at least 16 million litres of crude oil. 
Only a tiny part of the provisional zwischengelagerten raw material is illegal: according to the lion's share fill organised criminal networks, including politicians and senior military officers should belong in tankers, and command it on the world market. 
The debate whether the environmental disaster rather activities is due to the population or the lax production methods, the Akpobari activist considers purely academic. 
"If the oil companies are not perceived as invaders and if they had the livelihood of the fishermen not as thoroughly destroyed, there would be neither sabotage or theft and illegal refineries." 
Meanwhile, it is the relationship of the Ogoni above all to Shell but so destroyed that only a withdrawal of the corporation into question would be: "Perhaps other nationalities, such as the Chinese and better out of this mess." 
Since Michael nervous. 
"It is high time that it disappears," says the muskulös Ölmann. 
"Every minute, the soldiers can come." 
If the illegal Ölveredler caught by the special unit of the armed forces face no arrest, but a painful bribe. 
Even the soldiers mainly originating from the land of sisters - want - like all Nigerians, benefit from the raw material. 
"Our country this damned stuff brought in every respect to the dog," says Akpobari.
