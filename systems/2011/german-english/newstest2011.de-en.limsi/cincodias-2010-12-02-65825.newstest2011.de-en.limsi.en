Red Bull triumphs with a secret weapon by Siemens 
The car will be improved with a software in real time. 
Since Red Bull 2004 encroached into the world of F1 is their history in the elite universe shaped the speed of surprises and successes. 
The newcomer at the beginning, no one paid attention and, despite its steep ratings rising record set during the last season in the final sprint last November, all on the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso. 
Without the capabilities of the German pilot and Weltmeisters Sebastian Vettel or performance is to belittle the engine from Renault want is the "secret weapon," the multinational Siemens Red Bull in the hands, and thus created a winning team, has become to the legend. 
In reality is a powerful software to simulate processes, which the German company in 2007 for purposes that do not have to do with motor racing brought on the market. 
This describe as a PLM computer program was for the development of Monday chains in factories around the world, Energiewerken and precise tools. 
Intention is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before this will actually be built so as to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs. 
PLM, the development of the cameras by Canon, the aircraft from Sukhoi and the most famous commercial vehicles from Nissan easier. 
Winning Russwurm, head of the industrial unit of Siemens, said that with the use of this software in the F1 - factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes and improvements on the race and are found in the tests, design and can carry out. 
Russwurm notes that in 1992 in the Rennstalls average ten technicians working in a season to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements here. 
In Red Bull's team now employs 180 highly qualified young people; they lead with powerful EDV-Anlages analyses and all possible changes to the cars through. 
The Siemens manager said that the PLM-Software is in the situation, all components of the Red Bull cars to analyze and improve, with the exception of the engine, which exclusively Renault declared responsible. 
The materials, the fuel for dynamics and safety elements to be changed. 
The changes can thanks to advanced production facilities and Hightech-Autoklaven within less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of the Simulator will be transferred to the reality. 
The only border, which is set to this crazy technically perfect, 40 million dollars, a Formula 1 - team must spend on his race in a season. 
Red Bull has its high-tech factory for the development and production of its cars in a 50 kilometers away from the ground built by London. 
There are two buildings where visits - especially journalists - are severely limited. 
Everything is happening is Top Secret. 
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber. 
But Red Bull's real Formula 1 - hero is zweifelslos the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell. 
Behind the vast technological resources, the Energy drink manufacturers in the service of his participation on the race tracks, there are other players whose support invaluable and whose fame is nil. 
The Technologichef of the plant, Steve Nevey, stresses that you could still say five years ago that the progress in the field of R & D for cars contributed to the victory with 50 per cent and the pilots were responsible for the rest. 
Today, the share values changed. The technology makes 85% of success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated at 15 percent. 
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computers, because they "are not voraussagbare gladiators."
