Police action in China will be milder 
As a training officer stepped on an urban place, Tang Shenbin reviewed his nervous subordinates and gave orders with military authority and subdued voice. 
He wanted his female members of the cheng guan - China's robust urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their tendency to violence - impress the viewers. 
"It is!" 
"Look in front!" 
"Show them," he flüsterte to them, "as beautiful girls!" 
Four girls, barely adolescent age, with white gloves and identical olive green Jackes and trousers were strapping. 
Four pairs of black Pumps were just series. 
Four proper hats were perfect with blue white colored kept hair. 
"For me, they see average," noted Mr. Tang dismissive. 
"Socialites are beautiful."

In a city all new applicants must have a university degree. 
The Guangdong province led instead of the grey green a shining blue uniforms a. 
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence through Lower rigid: 2009 umkreist reports 50 officials a not properly established operator imbiß cars and starrten to einpackte after a half hour before this and left the room. 
Xindu, an urban district in Chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants, would fundamentally change the image. 
Since 2003, strengthen 13 women; they were the urban police areas specifically because of their appearance, its good character and their youth. 
You should crude police a softer, feminine aspect give. 
But, unfortunately, it would also Scarlett Johansson barely manage the bad image that the Chinese people from these urban squads have to improve. 
By law, so the critics. 
Unlike the police should these officials urban laws only with the help of fines or other administrative penalties. 
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture. 
In January 2008 prügelten officials in Hubei Province a bystander to death than those it with his mobile phone and filmed as they defeated a strong protest against a dustbin. 
Last year was a training handbook of the Beijing officials stolen and published on the Internet. It sets described how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.

A violence strotzend video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows in China trained officials in an attack on hawkers. 
"Cheng guan makes the government fear," the national newspaper China Daily lamentierte last year, after further controversy about the tactics. 
The newspaper called a "real thorough cleansing." 
Skeptics find the current approach clearly inadequate. 
When the Distrik in October by reporting eight female recruits searched, a Editorial in the Beijing Evening News the question whether the women real tasks would or only should serve as a visual distraction. 
Probably both. 
According to vacancy notice were women aged 18 to 22, with good figure and "harmonious" sought.

The employment relationship ends with achievement of the 26 years of age. 
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 physically demanding. 
"The most important is its image" was a unbenannter district officer in the Rednet quasi ruling website..com. 
"Whether the candidates to get the job, first depends on their appearance, such as size, weight, Gesichtszüge, etc." 
Then temperament and "inner qualities." 
"Female cheng guan as put," he said, and added, "but they have also other duties." 
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the municipality of the district, would not agree with this description, 
But admitted that China's size targets in advertisements for both genders are not unusual. 
The same applies to evenly. 
Whether that is synonymous with good appearance is controversial in China. 
But people with disabilities or physical need not apply. 
"Here, unfortunately, we cannot use Lahmes or Buckligen," Mr. Zheng. 
"Your image would not be good." 
Liu Yi, the patroliert on the Baoguang-Platz near a monastery, 22, has Apfelbäckchen and a well shaped mouth. 
You empfindetes not as sexist, that great value is placed on their appearance. 
"Do you think, I can see in this uniform sexy?" asks them with wry glance.

"We have so often said to you that!" said Frl. Xu a trader who had fled on foot, and his nudel kitchen attached to a bicycle karre had temporarily abandoned. 
According to the officials, the activity more monotonous than arduous. 
"It is almost every day the same," said Huang Jing, 20, the distribution system studied in the leisure time. 
"Everything routine." 
One reason is that the female officials the goods of merchants not as their male colleagues should confiscate. 
You delinquents can only threaten them to notify their male superiors. 
This is intended to protect them from public harassment that those officials are often exposed in China. 
Hundreds of residents rioted outside in this year, Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, after the rumour stock-market boom, Chengguan-Beamte would have killed a trader. 
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan-Beamte were injured in the late-night incident, 14 government vehicles were upset or burned. 
Xindu of these Gewaltausschreitungen have so far been spared. 
But unrest are not to be excluded. 
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang-Platz, in which the female officials this morning, patroulierten gathered about 50 people on a street corner. 
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, contrary to the rules on the pavement, rather than in a garage was repaired.

Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male Streife, stayed back. It was his white name tag in order to remain anonymous. 
As their female colleagues play the coordinators - men over 40 - a purely supportive role. 
But they were not trained to present a clean image. 
"We are sometimes verbally." 
"Sometimes but also physical," said Mr. Li sober. 
"The majority of the time people start with the dispute."
