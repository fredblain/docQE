2018 2022 World Cup: the FIFA appoints the ausrichter country 
In a chaotic frenzy because of corruption suspicions appoints the executive committee of FIFA on Thursday, the ausrichter countries of the World Cup 2018 and 2022, a highly political election, in which the Rangeln influence and lobbying the technical criteria are threatening to push into the background. 
One thing is certain: the royal discipline of the FIFA edition 2018 in Europe, its traditional stronghold held (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain Portugal, between belgien). 
The edition 2022 will then be somewhat exotic; the International Football Association hopes after the premiere on the African continent in the year 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) to win, or its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to pursue. 
The list of personalities for the delegation accompanying (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch leader, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) is the degree of economic and political use of a World Cup. 
In other words, the machinations behind the scenes as a threat to the last minute to stop. 
Otherwise it is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates. 
After the evaluation report of the FIFA, offer the English, Spanish portugiesische (2018) and American (2022) Act bessseren arguments than their competitors. 
But these considerations for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees on the hour of choice is not so important. 
The Sunday Times, with the establishment of the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, could just as well the opportunities for their own country, cradle of football, can ruin, only a single time was allowed to take the World Cup 1966. 
The BBC had the ground again on Monday by making a own report was broadcast, the three influential members of the Kommitees, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou takes under fire. 
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and the English responsible to embarrass primarily with David Cameron had pursued an intense lobbying in recent weeks. 
The Government hopes for a repeat of the gambit fine by his predecessor Tony Blair in London in 2005 had reached the organisation of the Olympic Games in 2012. 
Dignity of these intensive use enough image England appearance before the Kommitee again? 
Nothing is less safe, because the duo Spain Portugal has no shortage of trump cards, with its already finished stadiums, his expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, the Olympic Games in 1992 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture. 
But the economic and financial downside of the two countries could dampen its ambitions. 
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal the chances of Russia, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become the influential outsiders rise. 
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided the straightforward suggestion on the Bezichtigungs of the English press "an unfair competition in the runup to the vote" denounced by the Kommiteemitglieder. 
"You bewirft it with dirt, trying to compromise," Putin lashed out. 
The United States, for 2022 strengthened by the experience of 1994 to be the logical favourites. 
First economic superpower, seat of the FIFA-Hauptsponsoren, the country seems a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have drawn up a very beautiful project separately. 
But this new nominations seem premature for two countries, which had co-organised the competitions in 2002. 
Another threat: the long-awaited approval of the FIFA World Cup 2026 for China, the Asian opportunities for 2022 lapses. 
With Australia and Qatar, with the Aufwartung futuristischer stadium had drawn all registers, extending its scope in the FIFA direction of new areas, but these two countries a greater risk for certainty. 
Australia may as well as Japan and South Korea from the weakness of television rights akquittierten by the European countries (because of the time shift) to suffer FIFA's sensitive nerve.
