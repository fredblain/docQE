Arsen-resistente microbe could new life forms on Earth or elsewhere permit 
The discovery of a foreign variety of bacteria, including arsenic can live, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere. 
Although scientists this unusual bacterium discovered here on earth, their view, it is a sign that a life without the hitherto considered as vital elements is possible. 
"This organism has two options." 
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." 
"That makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'fremde ' way of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University and Co-Autor of the report on Thursday appears in the online edition of the journal Science. 
So far six main elements considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur. 
But as the scientists figured out is growing the bacterium in the Californian mono Lake even further if phosphorus replaced by arsenic. 
"One wonders what else is possible," said the report's Co-Autor Ariel D. of Anbar of Arizona State University. 
The discovery is an important step in the search for outside earthly life, since scientists life and must recognize its forms of Anbar. 
The study addresses microbes have been found on the planet. 
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were announced about the discovery was cause for widespread speculation on the Internet that the report of the discovery could act au√üerirdischen life. 
This is not the case. 
The discovery "shows that in other Planetensystemen organisms with the help of other elements biochemical processes can set in motion, and that the 'Standardelemente ', which, in our view, are absolutely vital, are not necessarily fixed prescribed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University in the United Kingdom from Milton Keynes. 
Cockel was not part of the research team. 
"This work is a new thing, because it shows that in an element of fundamental biochemical processes and structures can be replaced by another," added Cockell to add. 
This discovery was not accidental. 
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the Astrobiologischen Institute of NASA, who led the study, chose the mono Lake because of the high Arsengehalts. 
Since arsenic and phosphorus chemical equal, they thought that microbes that are both suspended, possibly an element can be replaced by the other. 
"The toxicity of the Arsens above all is that it is chemically similar phosphorus." 
"It is difficult, the organisms to distinguish an element from the other." 
"But the difference is so great that arsenic pans unlike phosphorus. It ends up in our biochemisches system, where there have been virtually everything verschmiert ', said of Anbar. 
The researchers used the bacterium GFAJ-1 rising arsenic concentration. It wanted and grew. 
The microbe grows in phosphorus better, but that they also can survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic standard form can happen, of course, either on earth or another planet or moon on the arsenic occurs more frequently. 
According to Jamie S. Foster, believe in microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new; but so far there was no functioning example. 
Arsenic came more frequently in the early Erdjahren, she says, so the science assumed that early life forms have used it. 
"The reason for the assumption that life may have developed differently than in the early geologically important," so Forster not sat in Wolfe-Simons research team. 
The research were from NASA, the Energy Department and supported the national health authorities.
