A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. If you look at the Interieure of Gaudi 
The roof is like a prehistoric Echse, the back stairs, such as the vertebral column of dinosaurs and behind Fischmäuler. 
This is the Casa Batlló by the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. 
From the local residents got the house with his organic forms the nickname of "bone house." 
Organ forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, Kachelsplittern and Mosaiks, which covered posture facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of the youth style of Antonio Gaudi. 
The facade of the house plays with fantastically lines, lack paints and Texturen remind the nature and creatures. 
It was only on closer inspection, we noticed that everything will be dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order. 
During the night, the whole facade still of plastic, dramatic and the special Anleuchtung reinforced the glory of the paint still. 
The same energetic lines and tortuous forms dominate the interior of the house. 
Wave type of shaped wood copied the window frames, support, Zierelemente doors, even Gucklöcher and. 
The House Batlló in the quarter Eixample in the busy shopping road Passeig de Grácia No 43 was created by the refurbishment of a house from the year 1877, the architects Emilio Sala Cortese said. 
The reconstruction two years took and completed 1906. 
The investor, the wealthy industrialists, Josep Batlló, originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but he ultimately voted Gaudís the idea of an unusual and even cheaper restructuring. 
The rental house Casa Batlló was an architect, Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone. 
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol together. 
The Dekorations created for the representative apartment on which ruler of the Realitätenbesitzers and the use of Mosaiks in the facade was his idea. 
At the design of the facade but also many other Bildner and artists. 
The joint work on the drafts of the Casa Batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí. 
This Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá in Güell Park, where other works are by Antoni Gaudí. 
Not long after its completion was the home of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the nicknames for "bone house." 
Others called it the special window opening mechanism for the "yawning home." 
It also says the top of the building is the sword of sacred Georg, presented the Patron of Catalonia. 
But also other bildhauer elements symbolize hidden religious motives. 
Gaudí was an architect of the House a unique central heating system for the time with Entlüftungskanälen and typical Kamins. 
Something bizarre is its 45 degrees inclination already. 
In his creation Gaudí consistently ignored all former building codes and in no way anyone could be led astray by these. 
Before start, he was one of the city proper permission but he made claims about the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers in the completion of two years later were so appalled by the result that they remedy demanded. 
The Ratsherrs were also among other things, that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk. 
With regard to changes, however, there was no longer quite the opposite - just 15 days after the relevant invitation of urban neighbourhoods asked Josep Batlló a request for approval of the property of the two maximum situated floors of the House - and it has given him promptly. 
The homeowners themselves pulled into the lower floors one. 
In the gallery on the 2nd floor was a company showroom, on the third floor were the bedroom and private rooms of the apartment. 
The ground floor has been leased to a juwelier business. 
The entire sechsstöckig building undergoes a ladder up to the dachte race. 
The basic elements of the restructuring were all right corner and just lines removed and replaced by bent and waved walls. 
Gaudí also worked with a modern approach to the mutual combination of spaces. 
The social part is quite connect through the opening of the Salontüren and so could comfortably chatting, without a larger society in vertraulich more talks will have to give up on a certain intimacy. 
The House received by Gaudís conversion except a new facade is also a rather unusual roof and two other floors. 
It is also impressive Gaudís game with the light and the blue and white glasiert Kachels with which the courtyard is dressed and Lichthofs. 
The game of those two colours gives all floors of the House a maximum amount of light. 
In doing so he became simply the principle to turn that white light reflects better than dark colors, the sunlight on the contrary to absorb. 
The House Casa Batlló, the 2005 was included in the welterbe list of Unesco, everyone can now visit. 
In the first floor is accessible to the public geräumigste and prächtigste home. 
The homeowners decided only in the year to this step and the cause of the famous Creator 150 birth day. 
When we found that this is a very lucrative business reserved the inspections to be extended even further joint and the Dachgeschossräume, including the dachte race. 
The price for the inspection of the monument is no trifling matter, he stands at 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get 20 per cent reduction. 
This amount exceeds the entry price to other gaudí estates in the city. 
Who the real atmosphere of the House, with its drache door mchen wants to learn should try friendship with one of the house dwellers to close and him visit at home.
