The trail of stones 
Uli Gsell which concerned, a total of around 400 kilograms. 
On Monday evening he stood from Stuttgart station, the Tuba on the back. 
It was Demo. 
It snowed heavily. 
The story is well-known: the excavators were angerückt in September and had started to cut a big slice of the northern wing. 
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands marched against S21, the station's multi-billion deep erlegung. 
When it came to freeze, a large part of the wing in ruins. 
Zerbrochen 6.000, 7.000 pieces. 
Crailsheimer mussel shell, a soft rough stone between 1914 and 1920. 
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old. 
He has a couple of scraps guaranteed. 
"These stones are Reliquien." 
"You cannot disappear." 
He schwärmt: "A cheap and poor Stein, simple and detention." 
When he a aufsägte, was the rat after cigarette smoke. 
What he will do with the headache, he still do not know. 
Stones have time. 
Uli Gsell. 
The trail leads the Stuttgart stones in a forest in Tübingen on a former munitions deposits of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his empire. 
The 44 year-old person with old stones. 
He has bought all fell in the demolition in Stuttgart. 
"It would be a shame, they would Schotter or disappear in the hole," he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen, which was once a guard häuschen. 
Beschimpft and threatened to have him, he tells than in September in the newspapers that he bought the remnants of the northern wing of the demolition contractors have. 
But he talked with the S-21-Gegnern for days. 
And he told them that he now nothing for the demolition could. 
And if it is now, then it is surely the right thing when the stones were reused. 
About 200 S-21-Gegner then took an average 80 kilos heavy Quader with unit prices 6,50 to 14 euros. 
As the memory, some but also in the hope it to be able to return a reconstruction. 
500 tonnes had bought Rongen, 25 major Lkw-Ladungs. 
About half is still in the forest, the rest is long sold. 
Garden owners, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer. 
From everywhere they arrived and had weggeschleppt, which could bear boot space and supporters. 
The Stuttgart stones of contention have long turned into "Mäuerle" or limits of Kräuterbeeten. 
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen. 
"If not the political component." 
He is rising in his SUV makes a tour through his 20 hectares great empire. 
Law, he has studied and discontinued later biology, then he cares for computers and eventually stone dealers have become. 
And Stone lovers. 
40000 tonnes of stones he eclipses. 
For the whole Germany karrt his treasures together. 
He says he is the biggest Altsteinhändler of the Republic. 
He slows down. 
In the snow are skillful fitting sand stones. 
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marie Bridge," he told me. 
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he schwärmt. 
"My favourite stone." 
It is the way high through the forest. 
It shows a bunch: red sand stone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station. 
And further. 
"Schöner Travertin." 
The Quader once belonged to the gallery of the Stuttgart Neckarstadien. 
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart police headquarters, rötlich stone is complemented with from the cathedral of St. Blasien, Tuff from Heilbronner hospital. 
What work the effort, which sweat. 
If Rongen remembers how the stones earlier by hand and with simple Flaschenzugs and karren were moved, he is quite reverential. 
"It would be a scandal if we were a little schreddern." 
Reich is he not become immensely rich even less. 
But 14 people today the stone dealers, also above the forest Steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a Glasbläser and a horticulturalists settled. 
"We are working hard, but it is satisfactory," says the residual those who exploit. 
He must soon after Cologne. 
There are stones there to save.
