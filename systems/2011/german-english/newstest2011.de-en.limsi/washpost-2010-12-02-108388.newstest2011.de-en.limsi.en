Durchgesickertes US-Dokument Moscow as a port of corruption 
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and they are a part of the bribes and protection money that they einsammelt on the Kremlin. This reported in February, the US Embassy in Russia in a memo. 
Both police and the state security service blackmail high protection money, so that they can keep their expensive living in Moscow, it says. 
They collect money not only from legitimate business, but also by organized criminal gangs. 
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as a "vertical authority" - takes its part of the money that the head to the top. 
The memo under the name of the Ambassador John Beyrle was sent to Washington, was on Tuesday by Wikileaks published on its website. 
The memo was based on sources whose names have been edited. 
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov still Moscow's mayor was, and it accused him of corruption. 
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that had been cleaned up in the meantime. 
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, a well-known construction company owns over years makes rejected again and again, and he won numerous libel actions against such accusations. 
He told a Russian TV channel in September, when he was asked after a documentation, which suggests that he was corrupt: "It is crazy, it is dirty, it is dirty." 
An unbelievably large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. The surveys show. 
But it is unusual that, as happened in the report of the ambassador, individual persons, and it is heard that this is happening through a diplomat of a foreign country. 
"The direct link with the government in Moscow with the crime has meant that some of them as" disrupted "and come to the conclusion that the government is acting as a Kleptokrat rather than a government," the memo. 
"Criminal elements enjoy a" kryshna " (a term from the world of criminals and the mafia, which literally" roof " or protection means) on the police, the State Security (FSB), the service supervisor (MVD) and extends to the office of the prosecutor, as well as by the entire Moscow government bureaucracy. 
Experts have discovered a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow. 
"Luzhkov is paramount." 
"FSB MVD and the militia stand on the second stage." 
"Finally follow the perfectly ordinary criminals and criminal inspectors at the bottom." 
"This is an incompetent system, where criminal groups fill a gap in some areas, because the city offers no help." 
The report says further that the FSB money received by the biggest companies and the police small businessmen have been arrested. 
A source says, "said that Moscow shopkeepers to understand that it is best to protect the MVD and FSB to get (and not by the organized crime), because they are not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law." 
"For this reason, the protection by criminal gangs no longer asked as before." 
The memo noted that while the collection of the money is fully protected even very modest no; even those who pay are sometimes arrested. 
The do not pay, find their business very quickly closed - on the basis of one or other pretext. 
Medvedev has talked several times to combat corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress. 
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men with suitcases, which were presumably full with money, go in the Kremlin. 
"In his fight against corruption must Medvedev rely on the bureaucrats," said named Georgy, who Satarov, director of by a Moscow experts recently in an interview. 
"But it is part of this tape." 
"It is not a part of the political class, because a political class no longer exists in Russia." 
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, as he says, corruption is inevitable. 
Nationwide, as estimated by the corruption is costing Russia, more than 300 Dollar billion per year. 
The country ranks below 154, a recent study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparence International (countries of "least corrupt" to "most corrupt" listed). 
The revelation of the Memos of the American Embassy, which after Moscow time late in the evening, happened will certainly disapproved trigger within the Russian government, though, because Luzhkov can be blamed for the mistakes of Moscow, the Kremlin can also be an opportunity to claim that the problems. 
In an interview with Larry King on CNN stated Putin that the WikiLeaks-Dokumente might be a forgery and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats him Batman and Medvedev Robin mentioned. 
"The truth is that it involves our interaction, which is an important factor is the internal policy in this country," he said. 
"But to be honest, we had not expected that this would happen with such arrogance with such a pressure and so unethical way, you know."
