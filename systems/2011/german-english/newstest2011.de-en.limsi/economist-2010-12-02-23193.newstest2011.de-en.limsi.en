An election weak 
Nobody had expected that the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect. 
But the facts exceeded the fears of the polling officials who rushed to help the beleaguered country, far from it. 
Overcrowding Wahlurnen multiple votes, electoral notes in the Rinnstein destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only a part of the problems. 
Wahllokale opened with hours of delay. 
Many Haitians, many of whom became displaced by the January earthquake were built against mountain slopes in search of a choice. 
Finally, some gave quite. 
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected leader, demanded on the basis of an alleged fraud the lifting of the election results. 
In the whole country was partly violent protests. 
However, Edmond called Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, the election "as quite good in many issues."

In other words, the show goes on. 
The electoral authority, the alleged the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate is committed Jew Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December. 
The expected runoff is scheduled for January. 
There is still hope in the election. 
The two leading opposition candidates, the Rap-Musiker Michel mart elly and the former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial ungültigkeit claim. 
If Célestin Jew in the electorate little or no support from the Wahlberhörde declared the winner of the runoff, this could lead to problems. 
As a result of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million for the earthquake victims are still living in tents, feared a low turnout. 
Many Haitians on election day were hindered by a lack of organisation of the vote.

There is much at stake. 
The donor countries consider a legitimate recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti. 
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
