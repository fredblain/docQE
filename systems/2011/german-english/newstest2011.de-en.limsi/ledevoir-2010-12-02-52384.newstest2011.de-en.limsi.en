450 million in contracts without tender 
Hydro-Québec mutual understanding Projektplanungsfirmen 450 million dollars in contracts approved for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project. 
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, the main portion of the project pipeline, has received a sum of 295 million dollars without tender. 
This consortium, known as "Énergie gérance" was in 2004 as a corollary of the decision by Hydro-Québec, the private sector for their accountability, this important hydroelectric project a sum amounting to 5 billion dollars to entrust formed. 
At the beginning of 2005 ergatterte the consortium "Énergie gérance" the lucrative contract, without that there had been a public tender. 
For the Parti Québécois is resorting to Unternehmenskonsortien a serious ethical problem, which evokes the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung and a price increase. 
"This is a new way of a stitch-up and distorted the competition." 
"This means that rather than fix games rather than secret way now conducts in open form," said yesterday Sylvain Simard, a delegate of the PQ, at the press conference. 
In the early morning Simard raised the issue before the National Assembly, because it seems to him hard to understand how the interest of the public can be served in this way. 
Resource minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon by they vehemently deny, that it is a stitch-up in this treaty would have acted. 
"I am sticking to my faithful" by supporting strengthened, they lashed out at the PQ was proceeded "dishonest" and lacked toughness. " 
She said it "is the least" that the PQ apologize. 
The model of the consortium is worldwide standard practice. 
It is usually such a temporary alliance that two or more companies allowed their expertise on a commandment to concentrate on a tender for a complex project. 
The project " East main ' a high komplexität level indicates about his Arbeitsausmaßes. 
This is underway and construction techniques should be established by 2012. 
However, the contract was awarded without a competition had can take place; it had already negotiations. 
It also represents the model of the consortium in Quebec even relatively simple projects by no means an exception. 
As the newspaper 'Le Devoir' last week noted that in the field of civil engineers and Beratungswesens applied model of the consortium are the subject of Regierungsermittlungen. 
A brief overflying the Quebecer Unternehmensregisters allows more than 200 consortia to appoint, some of which seem to be steady duration. 
In this way works, for example, the company Dessau in partnership with the majority of its key competitors, CIMA, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or even Roche and Tecsult count together. 
Any link, and there are several dozen leads to a and the same legal person back to Dessau. 
As far as the consortium "Énergie gérance ', Minister Normandeau stressed that" the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special Arbeitskräftedynamik and Hydro-Québec this fact since the 1970s, taking into account pays special way. " 
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ) has issued a statement that the nose has right now on the fact that the treaty was approved after agreement on the project pipeline. 
"If you makes a tender, and there are only a few candidates, your prices soar." 
"So you have two options: either you nimmst the people who find themselves in this Mart and saying: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price." 
"The idea is, however, that it is not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," confirmed Laporte. 
This consortium "Énergie gérance" approved contract is part of a long list of contracts on more than 50.000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois. 
The contracts were either Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ approved for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project. 
After reviewing the newspaper 'Le Devoir' more than 100 Ingenieurs and advisory contracts, the companies or their branches, including, in particular Ressourcenlabors, between 2002 and March 2010 have been awarded. 
SNC-Lavalin had 22 contracts, Génivar received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without here their participation in "gérance" count Énergie. 
All these treaties have been negotiated. 
In total they amount to 449.783.344 dollars, including the treaty with "Énergie gérance" about 295.131.564 dollars. 
Sylvain Simard had indicated that the four companies, which form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Quebec well-known." 
Minister Normandeau had let slip the PQ is equally associated with the firms they "finance" before she clarified that it is acting contrary to their leaders.
