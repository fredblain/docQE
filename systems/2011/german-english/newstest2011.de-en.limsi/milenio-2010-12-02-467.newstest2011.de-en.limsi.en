China upheld its targets to reduce greenhouse gases 
The representative of China stated at COP16, his country had made huge efforts to reduce the carbon toe and it would maintain its offer until 2020 40 to 45 percent to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. 
China keeps its offer the emission of greenhouse gases by 2020 to reduce by 40 to 45 percent, assured Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16. 
In his first public appearance at the 16th world climate summit of the United Nations (COP16) assured Su Wei, his country had enormous efforts to reduce the carbon toe and made to switch its industry. 
He led from that in the last four years his country 245 million dollars have been invested to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. 
On the other hand, he said that China would not change its goals, but together with the international community would work on this matter. 
He said that the Chinese strategy on climate change in four aspects sub-parts: dialogue, capacity-building, institution building and support of pilot programmes. 
In all aspects, we have made progress, including the adoption of a new energy law in the last year, the objectives in terms of reducing the emission of gases delivers, he said. 
On the other hand, he stressed that the authorities of the federal states in China with those of the central state and local authorities had worked at the targets for energy saving, an efficient use of energy and to achieve the reduction of emissions. 
He also led several multi-annual plans launched or completed, both those who were funded by the Chinese government, as such, the money received from other countries. 
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy, which was introduced in the last five years and investment of the United Nations (UN), the government and had received from private hands. 
It also runs a project at provincial level on climate change, a long exchange of traditional incandescent light bulbs with energy-saving birnes and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said. 
Martin Krol, scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that the efforts of China are much greater than commonly understood would. 
He showed that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China since six tons per person, while in the United States 100 tonnes were. China is for a nine percent total contribution to environmental pollution. 
Similarly, it make unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. The energy efficiency has increased by 20% in the last five years and by the year 2020 should happen a misconduct, he said.
