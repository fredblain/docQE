Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain their buying of government securities 
The final assembly of the Governing Council of the ECB in the past year should provide an opportunity to explore ways to show how it can emerge from the crisis, or at least the orders of a large number of unconventional announcements of monetary policy, which should come to its conclusion by the end of the year. 
The crisis obliges the European government debt, the Central Bank in Frankfurt can afford no doubt today, more than tense situation on the European bond markets ambitions, not their worsening to cause. 
The political cost would be far too high. 
The French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde had yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference by the European Central Bank has adopted an active role in favour of the resolution welcomes Europe's state budget deficits. 
It has not dared to say whether they thought the central bank can do more, for example, by reviving its program of buying of government bonds. 
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...) ." 
Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the ECB had in the previous day in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament is not very articulate about his project has shown, but rather to point out that the programme of purchases of government securities on the secondary market "continuing enterprises" would and that we in the Assembly on Thursday "will see how the decisions will emerge." 
The only certainty: the ECB is its key interest rate untouched at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009. 
In practice, the bond purchases were the treasure chamber last week by the ECB to approximately 1,35 billion doubled. 
Some traders, according to leaks and let them yesterday new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government securities. 
Overall, the central banks of the Eurosystem since May 2010 made purchases amounting to 67 billion euros. 
Among the dealers is the anticipation of a follow-up of the Kaufkurses questioned under any circumstances (see page 29). 
Already, the economists do not expect any notable change more. 
If the Anleihengeschäfte of more than three months already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter to create still at freigiebige type in the full Geldmittelreserven, and over a period of one week up to three months. 
The economists are already taken that this measure will extend even for a few months. 
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will amend its programme on fundamental way." 
"Otherwise they would risk provoking new tensions in the short term" suspected Michael Schubert, economist of Commerzbank. 
"One for the course of the first quarter of 2011, progressive exit seems likely" anticipates, in turn, Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal. 
Oppenheim. 
In the area of its interventions in the market for sovereign debt, "the ECB should such a purchase volume of bonds to maintain that stimulates the sluggish market," Norbert Bräms adds. 
In view of the relevance of the exposure of European banks on the markets of public debt in the euro zone, the Central Bank has no other choice than to maintain their presence in the market. 
"At any price, you must come to the Steller of the lack of investors in the market and so act to prevent the premature enthusiasm about the paid returns to the most vulnerable states," bezeugte yesterday, an important bond holders. 
Because if interest rates start to the exuberance would prevent more states to reduce their debt or even just to stabilize. 
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
