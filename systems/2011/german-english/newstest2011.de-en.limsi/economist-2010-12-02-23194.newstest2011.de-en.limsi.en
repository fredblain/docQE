Secretly in the middle 
In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband told Argentina's President Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, their popularity rate by 20 points to more than 50% upwards. This is the highest value since her election in 2007. 
Whether her this, however, carries a re-election next year depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández kompromissbereiter than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Nestor Kirchner. 
The signs are not clear. 
Nestor Kirchner, who also directed the economic policy after the election of his wife, often budgets on tax revenues, the economic growth and inflation are not fully incorporated. 
This allowed the presidential couple, the extra revenue to spend as they see fit. 
In the paper last year Mr. government lost the majority in Congress. 
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further clashes. 
Some dissidents from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten rallying behind Cristina Fernández. 
But after chaotic meetings (in which a parliamentarian another hit in the face and others lying to the government of corruption), the Congress failed to adopt the budget for 2011. 
"I will not discuss" the President. 
The budget for 2010 now also applies to the next year, which the President has more opportunity to spend as they see fit. 
The economy runs hot: it is likely this year to grow up to 9%. 
The official inflation rate is for Z. at 11,1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the unions - drive the value of almost 30%. 
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was racked by economic crises, said its main objectives for growth and poverty reduction, and not the inflation reduction. 
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, schikanierte the private sector and the national institute for statistics and census säuberte INDEC, then schönte the official inflation statistics. 
Fernandez can now follow a path? 
It has the private economy and trade union leaders called for talks. 
And, according to official statements are supposed to wage increases next year will be limited to 18%. 
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy. 
But the inflation undermined the growth spurt by a great devaluation in 2002. 
Perhaps would like to Cristina Fernández for this reason Argentina financial back to join the rest of the world. 
At the beginning of this year, the government took an agreement with the former restructuring of the country had rejected in 2001. 
Fernandez seems now to an agreement with the lenders to push from the Paris Club, which it owes approximately 6,7 Dollar billion. 
The Kirchners had a review by the IMF, as elsewhere usual always rejected. 
But in the last month, the economy minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund in the preparation of a new national consumer price index "technical assistance" it looks as this would be the first step towards the cleansing of the INDEC. 
It is not known whether Fernandez after their term even without the support from her husband will be politically active. 
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of Kirchnerism. 
If the Argentinians in March to return from their summer holidays, the wave of Sympatie, it has been shown to be fizzled. 
If they want to win another election, they must decide whether they many political decisions to lift her husband's quietly.
