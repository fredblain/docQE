Schwacher applause for China 
Taiwan's voters are coming slowly to a closer connection to the mainland. 
What is stopping Taiwan from his big brother across the Straits? 
On 27 November made more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all voters in the five Stadtbezirken to elect mayors and councillors. This is as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou welcomed. 
By building cutting-edge business relations, einschl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma even a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland. His policy has the relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949 sustainable change. 
Ma insisted the test, but only barely. 
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) three of the five mayors, they did not receive a majority of votes. 
Instead, received the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates a greater independence of Taiwan, almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%. 
In a presidential election would have meant this for Ma problems. 
Since his election two years ago, the share of his party has fallen by approximately 8%. 
For the first time the DPP even pulled together with the KMT in the councillors a. 
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as Lastwagenkonvois with Flaggen-schwenkende Massenumzüge and rarely are. 
There was even the obligatory mysterious assassination attempt. 
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT felt on the eve of the election with a speech at a KMT-Kandidaten 
When he shot a man from the crowd face. Lien was wounded and killed a umstehend spectator. 
Most bizarre wiser is not clear whether the shooter Lien kill or wanted to settle a dispute with the candidate. 
Regardless of the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, affected the election and the DPP in a bad light brought what the KMT has brought more votes. 
China was perhaps the biggest winner of the campaign. 
Remarkably, the relationship has not been addressed to the mainland. 
Instead, the candidates discussed here plans to social housing and the creation of jobs. 
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat. 
This is why the KMT its relations with the government in Beijing is not like in the foreground. 
But this time the DPP, the anti-Chinese sentiments to stir up too. 
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy can not survive without China. 
Ma, in turn, would confirm that the majority of Taiwanese supported its China policy. 
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy, Taiwan attract with economic incentives in the community. 
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei for a summit to prepare investment security and medical cooperation. 
It also wants to see the political integration. But first things first. 
It therefore prefer waiting until after the 2012 presidential election. 
The DPP has now reinvented. 
Before two years ago it was severely weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was convicted of corruption in the prison. 
During his presidency from 2000 until 2008 he vehemently for the absolute independence a. 
But under Tais reign has developed a new generation of gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of professionals and young people. 
Tsai was held as a presidential candidate of the DPP great approval, as Su Tseng-chang under Chen. 
Your party does everything in order to show that it is capable of building close relations with Beijing. 
Tsai is planning a of think tank as a contact point between the DPP and China, but this requires an unbiased discussions ahead. 
Tsai said publicly that their party will offer a "trustworthy alternative" to Ma's hasty rapprochement with China. 
Chen seems very angry about this change. 
From his cell, he said, the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan independence. 
He urged the pragmatists Su even to renounce the presidential candidacy. 
Even without Chen's interference does the DPP difficult to choose their potential candidate. 
The KMT will undergo must own self-analysis. 
Ma's values are poor, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT-Kandidaten wanted to conduct their campaigns without him. 
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem unemployment and the increasing gap between rich and poor. 
According to testimony, he will be a KMT-Sprechers cabinet and revamp the local facilities. 
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan supports only limited a rapprochement. 
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese see the economic cooperation with China as inevitable. 
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no turning back."
