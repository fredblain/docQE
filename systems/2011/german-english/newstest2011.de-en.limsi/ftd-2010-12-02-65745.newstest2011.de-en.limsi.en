Have cleverly campaign High-Potentials 
There is a lively crush at the buffet. 
Sixteen students push for salmon something, tomato soup and trick. 
The Technical University brown schweig and the car manufacturers Volkswagen invited the engineering and Designstudenten at a workshop. 
In a kind of contest of ideas, they should together with VW-Entwicklern fachsimpeln on the car of the future - and incidentally Volkswagen acquaintance. 
In the scramble for the brightest minds are now many companies in the Nahkampf and, as VW, in cooperation with the universities.

"This is like a game with band," says Kriegler.
