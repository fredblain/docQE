What should they do the SSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "Konditorei." 
The new Ratsherrs of capital from the ranks of the SSD will obviously need to overcome certain language barriers to their alt-neu colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and the city representation even able to understand. 
The newspaper Aktuáln.Cz members of the new Council from the SSD times a little "abgeklopft," as they dominate the notorious slang that has become common practice in recent years, in which the current coalition partners have been at the helm in Prague. 
The encoded vocabulary in the elapsed era of Mayor Pavel Bém was introduced by the Prague political elite, some of the best-known actors, situations and Causae. 
Surprisingly, showed that the new councils in relation to these new notions somewhat in the dark. 
They claim that at least. 
"Who is Voldemort?" 
"No idea." 
"I am more a newcomer in the Prague policy," responded Luká Kaucký, the new town councillor for culture, on the test of "Paten-Wortschatzes." 
But the town councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran, responded in a similar way. 
As an example of the term "golf hole." 
"This is the only expression of which you present me here, I occasionally use." 
"Otherwise, I do not think much of slang." 
For the vocabulary, the daily newspaper Aktuáln.Cz in this year's June had published before the election Congress of the ODS, pickte editors six concepts, it turned out, especially those notoriously associated with the Prague government. 
The Social Democrats should the terms "Voldemort," "greatest Prague golf hole ',' go in the Konditorei ',' bull nacken ',' betrayal of the capital" and "verblechen" define. 
Three Prague Ratsherrs agreed the test on the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - first promised his participation at the meeting, then less than the listeners. 
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, the test was rejected from the outset. 
"These things are not mind and how the Civic Democrats talk among themselves about it, I am not passing judgement." 
"For me is important, as we understand in the context of our programmes," he countered. 
As indicated, would have been Luká Kaucký in the abovementioned headline allegedly not realised that the influential businessman and friend of the Ex-Oberbürgermeister Bém, Roman Janouek of the speech. 
The term "Voldemort," Kaucky says nothing at all and the only word that he was at the test correctly, erriet "the greatest Prague golf hole." 
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, to safety but added: "But I know that more from the newspaper." 
And jokingly: "I will probably need to show a language course." 
The "golf hole" will not only of matador Karel Březina, but also from the town councillor for the Environment Luká Plachý right as a tunnel Blanka entziffert. 
Both Social Democrats also know for whom the term Voldemort and Luká Plachý idea even where to find this figure and thereby also what it means, "to go in the Konditorei." 
"I think it is to go into any Prague catering industry" is pretty Plachý close to the solution to the problem, if you know that this is the seat of Janoueks firms. 
In accordance with Březina but he claimed that this knowledge to have drawn from the newspaper rather than for him this vocabulary would own. 
According to the Testteilnehmern judging by, it seems really under the Social Democrats no similar popular slang. 
"I asked my colleagues, but obviously there is something we are really not." 
"We call upon us by name, occasionally we use acronym or colorful names," says the chairman of the Prague SSD Petr Hulínský - from his party peers casual 'Hulda'. 
"I was in the school Bíza (Birke) mentioned, but I do not know whether my colleagues so call" tells us Karel Březina his nickname of. 
The newspaper Deník Aktuáln.Cz has tried out the name and behold, it works. 
Weinert councillor for the party peers friendly "one's grandfather" or less friendly to the "old" Representative Miroslav Poche before the elections by machinations in the party sponsorship drew attention from some colleagues "Igráek" (famous Czech do figure) mentioned. 
Colorful names are the only the Social Democrats in the intra-Party parlance permit. 
Hulínský, it may not be alleged if it "Hulda," but Deník Aktuáln.Cz registered yet another nickname of the Prague chairman. 
His nickname of "doctor Gummiknüppel-Rechte" was supposed to do that Petr Hulínský its title Doctor juris has acquired in the Bratislaver police academy.
