Belarus agrees not continue to collect weapons-grade uranium 
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to global security of nuclear material, the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it no longer will collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. 
The deal has been in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarussian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov announced in an additional article of the Sicherheitsgipfels. 
The US government had been trying for years to persuade Belarus, not to collect more highly enriched uranium and appeared last spring reached a hurdle. 
But officials of the US government told the Washington Post, that in the last two months, two secret agreements have been reached with Belarus, 187 pounds weapons-grade uranium to remove from a White Russian research centre. 
This was the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material, according to an official staff, which remains anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue, approximately 500 pounds. 
The agreement seems one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear security summit of 47 nations" to be in April ruled Belarus. 
And it was obviously good enough at the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012 to secure. 
"I was thrilled by the fact that they have a seat in the nuclear security summit (from 2012) want." 
"This proves that it works for me," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership Global Security, a group for the promotion of nuclear safety. 
Clinton called the agreement " a very significant, important step ' of Belarus. 
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009, within four years to secure all vulnerable nuclear material. 
Since then, the US government helped six countries, its highly enriched uranium to disappear. 
Belarus will be the seventh. 
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush. 
At the time of Obama's Nuklearem security summit, the Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up their uranium. 
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamental weapons-grade, and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko at the time. 
"This is our raw material... we will not make it a dirty bombs and we will sell it to anyone." 
"We use it solely for research purposes, that is all." 
Belarus still approached a few months ago the United States than interest anzeigte meeting an agreement. 
The first attempt to remove the uranium in Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was irradiated, perhaps, say officials. 
It was loaded in a Spezialzug of more than 1.300 miles on a Russian factory for storage and disposal, say officials. 
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the officials by plane. 
The US government will pay for these travails dollars 14 million, with a large part of the money in the Belarussian research goes with low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons. 
"This was very carefully coordinated and concerted confidence" to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton led, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Energy Department, which operates in the global risk reduction. 
The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende Studies estimates that Belarus this year at least 88 pounds waffenf√§hhigen uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus wants, according to the joint agreement dissolve his camp until 2012. 
The relations between Belarus and the United States were strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harschen disregard for human rights. 
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement. 
"According to the progress of this global security issues welcome liable to cancel out the United States of America and Belarus know that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she says.
