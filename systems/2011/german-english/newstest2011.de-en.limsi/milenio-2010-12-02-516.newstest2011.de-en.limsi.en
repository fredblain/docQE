Rubén Omar Romano looks at three defeat in Endspiels back, he has Aufs and Abs experienced in his career, but he has three crucial games had, and he has so far kept well why this opportunity is of particular importance for him. 
The Argentines has played with the medal for the second champion, he has remained a step behind the victors and amazingly, he fought successive Endspiels with the same team. 
The santistische strategist reached the first final as a coach in the 'Torneo Apertura 2002 ' than del Morelia had the reins in the hand with which he against Toluca learned a great defeat with 4-2; later, in the 'Clausura 2003 ' he reached the decisive match, which he also lost against Rayados with 3-1. 
Back in with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010 ', in which it against Los Diablos, played Rubén again had to share a setback because the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros equalised after 210 Spielminuten, but he came to the penalty kick with 3-1 forward and got two options, accepting his title, but ultimately missed three of his players and the game 11 steps on a 4-3. 
Rubén already had two Endspiele with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, lost; that is why he would not again be pursued by the disaster and rid themselves of the bad attention in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirmed that the most important thing for him, the game itself. 
"I would like to be champion, I would like to break no statistics for a club, for my affection, I am hingebe, and therefore the title will come to me, but what previously happened, is the most important thing," commented the helmsman when they questioned him about the lost Endspiels. 
The last endgame he is still strong in the recall, he assured to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from this is that until the referee is not the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players, because the last time we were with two Elfmetern already prepared early, and I think that is a lesson until the game is not finished, there is no cause for celebration." 
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shoot-out, concerned him not because he trusted his players: "You never want to arrive at the penalty shoot-out, we would like to finish in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is no alternative, and we must be prepared, we were prepared in the previous Tournee, but unfortunately gave us the fate a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the fierce desire to keep the title already in the hands, which left us something for this endgame, and we hope that it will not happen this time." 
It is in Romanso power, not just its second champion and costs for the first time the glory with the title.
