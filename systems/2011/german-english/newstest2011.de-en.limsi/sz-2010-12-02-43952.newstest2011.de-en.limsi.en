Love in times of war 
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer with the work of their still anonymous government deb端t has begun, there is anger. 
She has even written the script, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man. 
We know much more about not - but it is sufficient for unrest. 
There is the rumor, the woman, a Muslim woman, verliebe during the Yugoslav war in her Serb rapist. 
Bosnian women's groups immediately protested, and some Drehtags planned in Sarajevo were transferred in the short term to Hungary. 
In the meantime, the film marginalised in Hungary and in the postal production, but it is still protested in Bosnia. 
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN-Fl端chtlingshilfswerk UNHCR, Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has reported a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is even ambassador of UN-Fl端chtlingshilfswerk. 
It is not Diplomatisch - she has the women weeks before a meeting in Hungary offered what but refused. 
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic. 
Liebesgeschichten in Vergewaltigungscamps, it was not given, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims would not be betraying her enough about the script. 
Your organisation has recommended, according to the UN-Fl端chtlingshilfswerk to dismiss Jolie as ambassador, reported the Guardian. 
But what exactly Jolie wrote for scenes? 
The Bosnian Culture Ministry, which was to read their script, after some to-ing and fro-ing issued a permit for Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie then not yet came. 
The young author even claimed to have no political intentions with their film was incorporated into the Yugoslav conflict with much difficulty, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all interested parties. 
As for the content, however, it remains vague. 
Still, a second Synopsis has been circulating for film in the network, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew before war broke out and meet again, a Bosnian Muslim woman when she is kidnapped at a Serb camp, where he works as a guard. 
What sounds considerably different than the variant "rape victims verknallt torturer." 
The fact that Jolie film actually starts before the war - so much is safe. 
The pressure on them, as Jolie is "unfair and based on misinformation." 
She can now probably just give the hackers of Hollywood peace: in dismissing the script, like so many before illegal online.
