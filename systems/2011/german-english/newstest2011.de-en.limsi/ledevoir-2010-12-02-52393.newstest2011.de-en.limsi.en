Bond for the takeover of eXcentris 
The Quebecer government of Société Angus, as well as the company Parallèle invited financially to participate in the adoption of the eXcentris Kinokomplexes agreed to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive loan. 
The entwickler company Angus, as well as the company Parallèle a donation amounting to seven million dollars from the Ministry for the adoption of Daniel Langlois belonging Kinokomplexes eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint laurent had hoped to bring this back its real cineastischen function to entrust doesn't seem to get what they demanded. 
The government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, but on their own terms. 
Instead of the expected donation offers the Quebecer Government rather a loan in less than the initial hoped-for level, a viable solution to create favorable conditions could, at least according to the entnehmbaren sources from the state-owned scaremongers. 
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million are already last spring by the Quebec rejected further request was for the renewed sum excessive downwards. 
One proposal, along with an action plan has been the President of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, sent to St-Pierre Minister, who chairs the eXcentris act. 
Before several days, he had an send last factual report. 
The counter-proposal of the cabinet was sent to SODEC, however, on Wednesday. 
Parallèle and Angus now have time until 31 December to respond to this. 
In any case, it seems the premise of the state donation really been pushed to the side. 
Let us remember that the Quebecer ownership community cinemas and cinema complexes against a direct public investment had revolted to support the takeover of eXcentris by making the argument, the Culture Minister have no financial help for real estate projects there, he did not have other cinemas to send. 
Several other market participants, however, the segment by contrast substantial economic aid one. 
Cinema chief Daniel Langlois had after the self-financed construction of the cinema over ten years under great difficulty the authors' cinemas presented in the premises of his Kinokomplexes, which could justify the exception from the public purse. 
The lack of cinemas showing independent films, in Montreal more than obvious, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients in the bar. 
The Société Angus and the company with Christian Yaccarini Parallèle at the top, taxes in turn a privately funded Campagne, of which they are a sum 700.000 dollars hope to stimulate the purchase. 
Since the spring of 2009 goes only a single screen so that continues to show films in eXcentris, Le Parallèle. 
The aim of the future acquirer, the three Kinosäle on 27 February next year with the spectacle of a very fine film by Xavier Beauvois " I hommes et des dieux ' to reopen. 
Christian Yaccarini, however, the newspaper 'Le Devoir' not recalled and ignore what he and his group of the revised downwards proposals to keep them.
