Green, but clearly skeptical. 
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence the main protagonists of sustainable growth, but neither the marked brands or the Öko-Kennzeichnungen should steer his election. 
It is a shame, while swimming in a media universe, where information only in favor of a responsible more consumption: the barometer responsible consumption has to complain about a lack of credible information, a failure as a brake makes his commitment displayed as the first reading showed, which was held yesterday. 
Although they use of the so-called social friendly products have driven in the year 2010, the Quebecer still seem those who try to sell them to pay little credit. 
Two thirds of the Quebecer population is in fact the environment-friendly companies to pay as little faith as the green corporate advertising, so does the responsible Consumer Centre of the University administered brooke sophisticated measuring instrument. 
Another record: half of consumers doubts the credibility of the official alleged fair products accompanying certificates, but also the credibility of the products and brands as environmentally aware as the barometer. 
Following the same pattern is the discourse of the politicians on this issue of only 14,6% of Quebecer population seriously. 
The information about responsible consumption seems nevertheless important to stimulate this Konsumsegments, which is currently approximately only one-third of Quebecer users crowded. 
In fact dämpften emptiness and dubious nature of the information the zeal of 46% of consumers. 
After the higher price of the product, this is the second obstacle identified by the barometer. 
In addition, a third of the Quebecer of the specified performance of green products and services that they are trying to put in the hand, leery of. 
According to a different communication had already more than half of consumers have changed their habits in 2010 and predominantly the brand of or several products defected to express their conviction. 
According to barometers, they were also 61% preferred purchases with dealers in their districts, and the purchase of food grown favours in their region. 
Green and responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had this year a 64 reached the maximum value of 100 - the Homo consumus of Quebec, it loves to present itself as the king of recycling, which is trying to reduce left traces in the environment by he cares about animal welfare. 
But the social and ecological consciousness still seems to stop his car, so the barometer: just 28% of the Quebecer have indicated that in the year 2010 public transportation or the Mitfahrzentrale preferred to have in order to demonstrate their ecological interest. 
The walking and cycling were also 39,1% of the participants of this comprehensive behavioral survey supports the stereotypes.
