Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediating role for Syria 
More than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, considered the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher in Iran has been detained for "espionage," the French public in suspense, upsetting akzentuierte diplomacy in alert and the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran. 
All this under the attentive eyes of the diplomats of the United States. 
The WikiLeaks received and by the newspaper 'Le Monde' seen American documents give some background to this crisis price. 
You describe how that display the Americans had declared its strategy, which went as far as this advice for dealing with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of Wanderers). 
They show how the French responsible have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman not the release of Majid Kakavand, a French prisoner and of the American justice system because of trade with material for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme ' Iranians have to Gegeleistung. 
Finally, they put the manner in which the French Presidency to manipulate the media for the purpose has tried to convince the idea of Bachar Syrian President Al-Assad have a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a harsh light. 
In truth, he had not done anything in this regard. 
One in Paris on 12 August 2009 redigiertes diplomatic telegram of condolences bears the title "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostage-taking." 
François Richier Elysée adviser in strategic question kept accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone. 
They told her the French method. 
The advised the Americans to do everything possible to make their own nationals back to bring the violent in Iran would be recorded. 
"Power noise," they said, 'articulated loudly and clearly and without letting up "the words' fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release" in the media. 
This is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime respects very sensitive to his image. 
"Betreibt all the more so, especially if you ask the Iranians not to do it." 
For "silence solves nothing" over the discussion experiments on unobtrusive way, the Iranians are "masters in prevarication." 
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is a "normal, Iranian tactic:" kidnapping for the purpose of political blackmail. " 
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from the prison (which should come on 16 August, on the day on which it takes refuge in French embassy) "demand the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (230.000 million bail). 
And he can disclose the Elysée antizipiere further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will worsen." 
The Iranians could "in the near future another roughly arrested 1.800 French citizens living in Iran," he said. 
28 August 2009. 
Clotilde Reiss is 12 days have been released from prison, but will continue to be detained in Iran. 
An information was circulated: the Iranians Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States due to illegal trade with sensitive electronics materials to Iran, demand after ruling by a judge in Paris has been released from detention. 
The American message is how many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence. 
For Washington, which the illegal Iranian networks followed the acquisition of the material provided for the nuclear programme is a bad news for the release of Majid Khakavand. 
France has taken a horse-trading in purchase? 
The liberation of the Iranians against the logic of the Frenchwoman? 
During another interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September assured François Richier that this was not the case. 
The display, as he says, was not only "quite surprised by the decision of the judges," but also tried to resist. 
"It has a lively exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister for Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he says. 
Mr. Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand still under 'strict' supervision of the French secret service. 
The Elysée adviser chooses a telephone number, sets back on, then informed the American diplomat, the Iranians "is currently in the buildings led by the Iranian embassy in Paris." 
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss display in Iran spares not his efforts, through statements and of the media organised "flight testing" believe Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential mediation." 
The Americans are watching this activity is not without irony and note that the manipulation is bearing fruit as several articles reflect the official French version. 
A telegram datierendes on 25 August 2009 evokes "the media blitz of the French authorities." 
What is based so much "thanks" towards Mr. Assad, wonders the Paris embassy. 
"Lobpreis defiant their statements, the French authorities privately admit that they only have a vague idea about what the Syrians have actually done." 
The document then deals with the reasons which have led the Elysée to plumb this fiction. 
The intensive communications "aims to Sarkozy's policy of openness towards Syria to confirm," he analysed. 
A 2008 launched policies, then "many critical votes in France and abroad as premature and undeserved perceptions." 
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" testing Paris "Syria to remember what laud you can achieve by it plays a constructive role in the region." 
The aim is also "discord between Syria and Iran to sow." 
The American Embassy knows this from good source. 
On 11 August Francois Richier had entrusted her: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians what have always done." 
"But despite all we have thanked them." 
"This should at least create confusion on the part of the Iranians." 
Clotilde Reiss is returning to France on 16 May 2010 back. 
Nicolas Sarkozy receives them in the Elysée. 
In a statement, he would like to thank the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for its "active role in favour of the release of our compatriot."
