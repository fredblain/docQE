The US is changing the rules for obtaining a visa 
Before their meeting at the consulate, the people must present at the services for visa; costs are waiting times are shorter. 
From 10 January 2011 are changing the procedures for applying for a visa at the Embassy of the United States and the consulates. 
The new procedure, most applicants before their meeting at the consulate in the services to visa (ASC, the initial buchstabes in English) imagine. 
The staff of the ASC takes the biometric data of the applicants to be reviewed by the consulate in the conversation. 
The new procedure has certain advantages for the Aspirants, including: 
The total cost for the processing of visa will fall because there is no longer necessary futures meat, the processing of the Visumsantrags and the transport service with which the document will be handed over to pay separately. 
The applicant makes only a single payment, which covers the three services. 
The current price remains unchanged: the Gegenwerit 140 Dollar for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with request (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for Händer and investors. 
Those who only want to extend their visas must lead any conversation in the consulate, they must only at the nearest ASC imagine where they present their records and their fingerprints are taken. 
Since the biometric data will be collected in ASC remain the applicants, who need a second date for the meeting at the consulate there less time than previously. 
Those visas in consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo request, the service mark-up of 26 dollars should not pay more.
