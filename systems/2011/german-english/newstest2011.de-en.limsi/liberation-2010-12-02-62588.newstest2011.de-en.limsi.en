Rachsüchtige hackers and industrious spies 
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a dual significance. 
On one side, it turns out as an obvious scandal, a scandal that only a scandal in the Sinner hypocrisy is the Beziehunge between states, ruled the public and the press. 
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level, and gives a taste of the future dominated by recession. 
But we are taking the series. 
The first aspect of Wikileaks is the confirmation of the fact that each act produced by a secret service (an old nation) composed exclusively of newspaper cuttings. 
The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits Berlusconi's throw anything further than what we have months anyway to read in any old journal received (except those whose owners Berlusconi) and the terrifying karikaturierte profile rebuffed offered Kabarettkünstlern for a very long time substance for their Sketchs. 
The rule, after which the secret dossiers should only consist of already well-known news is essential for the dynamic of the secret services, and not only in this century. 
If you go into a library devoted to esotherischen publications, you will see that each work (on the grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, Templer or Rosenkreuzler) repeated exactly what has been written in previous works. 
This is not alone, therefore, that the author occult texts will publish any research (nor, therefore, that he is not knew where to find would be news to report on the non existierende), but because those who devote themselves to the Okkultismus, nothing else than to believe what they already know and confirms what they have already learned. 
This is also the most mechanism of Dan Brown. 
Similarly, the secret files. 
The informer is rotten and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (he could otherwise whatever it may be, for example, editor in Libération), the only considered true what he acknowledges. 
The Top-Secret information on Berlusconi, the American Embassy in Rome was sent to the Staatsdezernat, were the same as those that Newsweek had published a week earlier. 
So why such a fuss was made by the revelations of these files? 
On one side they say what any educated person already knows, and that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the government leaders can call each other or can take a plane to take on the dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small classed have transformed into spy centres. 
Every old viewers of investigative movies knows this very closely, and it does not happen from hypocrisy, that it is doing so to ignore this. 
However: the fact to repeat it in public, violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put the American diplomacy in a bad light. 
Secondly: the idea that an ordinary hacker secret most secrets can become the most powerful country in the world, carries the significant blow to the prestige of the Staatsdezernats. 
It also brings the scandal less victims, rather than the "executioner" in trouble. 
But we address the profound nature what happened. 
Ehemals, Orwell's time, it was all power as a Big Brother pool, which controlled every gesture of his subjects. 
Orwell's prophecy had since then as a completely right can point out where you can control every movement, thanks to the telephone, each site's transaction visited hotel, the elected motorway and so forth; the total victims of citizens would be the eye of power. 
However, if you look in mind, what is happening today that even the secret Kryptas of power can no longer escape the control of a Hackers hears the control transition to be unilaterally directed and zirkelförmig. 
The power controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - chosen as citizens - can discover the secrets of power. 
How can stick but a power which is no longer able to protect their own secrets? 
It is true, Georg Simmel said that a real mystery is an empty secret (and an empty mystery can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the character Berlusconi's or Merkel's basically free of Geheimis is a mystery, because the public sphere price; but in the style of WikiLeaks to reveal the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty secrets were means to deprive them of any power. 
Wikileaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wronged, however, Clinton and Obama. 
What are the consequences of this injury, which has caused such an enormous power? 
It is obvious that the states no reserved information in future will face more Online - that would be tantamount to a posting added on the street corner. 
But it is equally obvious that it is frustrated with the current technologies to hope confidential reports to be able to keep secret via telephone. 
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a Head of State move in a plane and one of his colleagues contacted. 
How could in future private and only for certain ears certain relationships? 
I know very well that my prediction at the moment for science fiction and Roma confinement sounds, but I am forced to imagine the government agents preoccupied on secret nature and moving to uncontrollable road routes, their messages anywhere else than in a mere memory key, and also the few written information they received in the shoe marketing verbergend. 
Only copy the information would be stored in locked drawers: basically had the spy attempt of Watergate less success, as WikiLeaks. 
I had the opportunity to write that the technology nowadays like a cancer progresses, namely backwards. 
A century after the wireless telecommunications had revolutionized communications, the Internet with (telephone) a Telegrafen Wire. 
The (analog) Videokassetten had allowed the Filmforschern, auszukundschaften a film gang on gang, by one spulen from the back forward and was able to reveal all the secrets of Montags, whereas the (numerical) CDs allow nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter, in other words, Makroportionen. 
With the high-speed trains travel within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this by plane, including the switching requires three and a half hours. 
It is therefore not exceptional, policy and communications technology come back on car and horse. 
One final observation. 
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages. 
At present, the messages demanding confidential information from the press.
