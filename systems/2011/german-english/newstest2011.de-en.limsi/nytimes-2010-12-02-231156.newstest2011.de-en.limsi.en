Cheshire Twitter draws attention 
A half-dozen of them tippten in the riots in the courtroom. 
The last-minute verschickten them on Twitter their reports on gruesome testimonies. 
In the end, the defense, there were more than 140.000 Twitter-Meldungen on trial for rape and beds gekettete children in a house, the flare-up. 
On Thursday the closely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was indicted, three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, killed an official end to find if the judgment on the death sentence, the jury pronounced falls. 
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already enquires in court, explain the reasons for an appeal and employing the courts for years. 
One of the provozierend most reasons is that it through the intensive reporting on the process, including through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporter - a "circus atmosphere" and a widespread immediately penetration aufr端hrerischer details came, so that the jury in an improper manner had been influenced by the public outrage. 
This objection could lead the Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question whether the new technologies will need new rules in the courtroom. 
"As I have seen during this process, I believe that it is really a danger, if the arrival of the new technologies, the right of every individual in the courtroom influenced to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes main defenders. 
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue from the Supreme Chamber Court, rejected the requests last week by ruling succinct back when he said that the New Media "carefully controlled" would, and that there is no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions. 
But it was certainly not the last word in this matter. 
For decades Gerichtseinspr端che have noted that the reporting on notorious cases doubt on the fairness of a trial. 
In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States the ruling against Dr Sam Sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, which is supposed to have killed his wife, lifted and said in his ruling that because the new media a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" would have been. 
Some people believes that the TV show and the movie "on the run" based on this crime. 
Some lawyers say, Gerichtseinspr端che, which Mr. Hayes conviction be seen half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary for the channels from the courtroom at the time of the case, Dr Sheppard were unimaginable to regulate. 
"There is a good reason, about the impact of new media in processes, which will be followed by a broad public to be concerned," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut, but his report, they arbitrarily imposed. 
Professor Donohue said, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction immediately communications from the courtroom, it turned out, could make the processes of fair play. 
The Twitter affair is just one of many who set out by Mr. Hayes lawyers to discuss for years and thus delay a condemnation. 
For example, the defenders also say that Mr. Hayes could be already have been vorverurteilt as a judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential Jurors by giving them showed gruesome Tatortfotos during the juror selection. 
Some have said the Jurors photographs of the victims, Jennifer hawke petit 48 years, and their T端chter, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, they would have met with disgust. 
The defenders say that they were also questioning the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judges had mistakenly exchanged a jury, which has been a critic of the prosecutor, and that he had exerted undue pressure on the ruling, as he had taken the unusual decision to ask the jury free over the weekend. 
The Jurors were not isolated. 
But their arguments about the impact of the detailed reporting about the process prefers perhaps the greatest interest. 
In a judgment anfechtung have submitted it last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and was discussed by the candidates for the US Senate. 
They argued that the New Media continually had rekindled the flames of the emotions on the case. 
"Such a daily crush of media piepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," wrote the lawyers, "it has been previously in New Haven and perhaps even not seen nationwide." 
Your emphasis on reporting by Twitter is controversial. 
Some journalists have said in interviews that the assertion that these direct messages are rabble-rousing but as reports, which will be reimbursed at a slower rate, a technikfeindlicher look is the verarme reporting on future processes. 
But some lawyers said, Appelationsgerichte would often faced with the argument, social and technological changes requires the Adaptation through the courts. 
Mr. Hayers lawyers reinforce this assertion. 
In her appeal, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the condemnation of Dr Sheppard was lifted because the reporting and made it clear that the New Media new rules require. 
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
