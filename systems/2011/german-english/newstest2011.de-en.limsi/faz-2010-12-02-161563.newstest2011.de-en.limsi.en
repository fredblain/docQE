The Eis-Universität 
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna Eiskonditoren be prepared for better seasons. 
The three-day basic rate for future Gelatieri has the largest pool of recruits and visitors from all over the world. 
Why is actually the whole ice? 
From the Gelatiere and the Gelataio. 
The Gelatiere German somewhat archaic Eiskonditor, represents the cream after all the rules of the Italian Eisma royal art ago. 
The Gelataio old with a Spachtel ice cream from the freezer counter, deletes them in the Waffel and then sells them. 
In order to know that we must not after Anzola dell'Emilia drive in the province of Bologna. 
But who would like to know more about ice, which is not in the "gelato university" the Italian firm Carpigiani over. 
The Eis-Universität, the manufacturer of Eismaschines set up in 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines everywhere the high Italian ideals. 
The three-day basic rate for future Gelatieri has the largest pool of recruits and visitors from all over the world. 
But there are also started Spezialkurss around lost their Schokoladeneis and internships in the domestic Eisdiele. 
Some dreams in the midlife crisis of a new career, others simply dare repeat the treacherous ice of their vague aspirations. 
This time, it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil on Hungary to Saudi Arabia. 
Jacky, art teachers from California, loves the Slovenian food movement and will in future in the country of industrial Ice-Cream to offer a European quality product. 
Anke from Berlin is corporate adviser and wants after years in a nerve-wracking job eintüten a little discretion. 
Two young Egyptians dream to open a Eisdiele in Cairo. 
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housewife Yulia, because Italian ice cream love their children. 
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari told the participants initially the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream. 
The key is not only good taste, but also the seidig fluidity and good consistency. 
Luciano forgets his training but not the icing on the cake of national and even südländischen superstructure: ' By Gelato is simply the best - and then is still plenty of romanticism." 
The first step towards the manufacture seems quite simple. 
Luciano repeals the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a large Mixgerät with an electronic programme everything at 85 degrees heated and then immediately to four degrees cooler. 
Then he turns on the machine a Hahn, and a white basic lotions, it became clear basis for all milk eiss varieties. 
Bestürmt as the teacher with questions: can you ice cream only produce with natural substances without stabilizer? 
How can you own experimental free course? 
Luciano warns the Zeitgeist mislead. 
Who of ice cream "only" speech from natural ingredients, has possibly yet stabilisers used - usually a natural product, such as Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne. 
Of course you can ice also produce without stabilizer, it should only be sold within a day, otherwise sackt together, and the client bites on loud Eiskörnchen. 
Certain variations on the basic chips are allowed. 
It will be more exciting with the flavours. 
For the taste in ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes the ingredients in the fruit department or buy in the sweets in the supermarket. 
In addition there are bullets and Pasten. 
"The suppliers will all try you dozens of aromatic additions try to foist on." 
"But you should simply experimenting." 
Either in the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruit. 
Or just on the ice cream from the white basic chips with eggs on the yellow cream and cocoa powder on the basis for all potential Schokoladen-Verführungen. 
Now we can change players in the Eismaschines. 
Luciano leaves them each four different types of vanille, chocolate, Mokka and Haselnuss-Eis produce - with or without eggs in the basic material, with more or less whatsoever aroma or other natural additives. 
According to the same experiment will be subjected to the fruit eiss varieties. 
More flavourings, more fruit puree, taste is not necessarily better. 
Haselnuss-Eis tastes not necessarily nut palm, if it contains more hazelnuts. 
The most popular Kiwi-Eis is the working group, and used more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer. 
Only a balanced mix will highlight the taste of a Gelato clear from says Luciano. 
Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: if used peach puree with a lot of sugar, the sugar share must be reduced in the basic recipe. 
For Zitroneneis an extra oats sugar is needed. 
Luciano prefers a device chaplain, with whom he the sugar content of fruit varieties certain (winemakers measure so that the Oechsle grape must). 
Fortunately facilitate charts the calculation. 
Ice requires no longer so much physical use as before. 
It is not only helps the device for the automatic production of basic chips. 
There is also a device in which the finished Eis-Mischung at the same time cremig will be beaten and chilled to freezing temperatures. 
All automation despite remain small mishaps are not enough. 
The Brazilians Gustavo late and its stock price colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree than him outsized hand blenders control. 
"In every course," says Luciano Maestro, "it is only a matter of time before something happens."
