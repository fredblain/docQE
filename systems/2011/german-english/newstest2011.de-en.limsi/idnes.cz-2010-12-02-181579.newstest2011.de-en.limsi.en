The right mattress and the right bed rost? Women have other aspirations than men 
It is not the tollste bed frame, but the quality of the surface - mattress and make good bed. 
However, this must complement each other in harmony, in order to meet the wishes of the specific user. 
Many things during the selection play a role - the weight, size, health and not least the sex of the Schläfer. 
Equally important is the Interieur, in which mattress and belittle. 
A typical example? 
In a weekend house in which will not be heated on a regular basis, Latexmatratzen are not good, because they need a lot longer, "warm." 
In addition, they are clearly more difficult than usual Polyurethan-Matratzen. 
Finally, they should be turned on a regular basis. 
If they do not have enough Entlüftungskanälchen in the core and still lie on a solid record humidity, the movement: it is not excluded that stems from its mold. 
In the election, of course, also plays a role in which it is used. 
Anyone who takes longer time abroad, where very high Matratzes with soft layer are normal, hard to get used to a low mattress with hard surfaces can. 
"Benefit all ice-hockey player returned from the NHL have complained to me that they cannot sleep more right here." 
"For their abgeschundenen shoulders, they simply need Fersen and Hüften a soft layer of Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam, a Formgedächtnis-Polymer)." 
"I commend this including sugar sick people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they" information "from the joints and the skin can receive bad," said Sylva Hadamcziková, which specialises in polster möbel. 
That is why I have years ago many ice-hockey players, but also other customers this Matratzes with Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam) concerned. 
"Today, this is not a problem any more, because such Matratzes offer, among other things the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian firm Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico." 
And we should not necessarily be a famous ice-hockey player, in order to appreciate the benefits of the Visco-Schaums. 
This "miracle" works really quite simple. 
The foam optimalisiert his toughness and form in accordance with the absorbed heat, or in other words, he is downright schmiegt on warm body. 
There's nowhere in the night shifts are not around, such as after a heavy battle. 
We simply sleeping much better. 
The viskoelastische foam also provides protection against Dekubitus (fire). 
In the election of the matratze size to body size, we should still include the length of the football sohles, i.e. approximately 21 to 34 inches. 
Men like Mrs of the 180 cm wide, need a 210 to 220 cm long bed. 
Each of the Schläfer should at least 90 cm width available together then 180 cm. 
In single beds, for example, in Singles, 120 to 140 cm are appropriate. 
I comfort side and also for any visitors. 
Otherwise the following thumb for the ideal bed band: "If it is on the back, should still enough room for the easy angewinkelt poor," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the zunft model of Polsterer and Raumausstatter, who for many years the issue of healthy sleep and devotes the ergonomics of furniture and this issue presents technical schools. 
Everyone needs a separate in a double bed and his own mattress, but be careful with the purchase, so that the Matratzes are equally high. 
Other than that, nothing else other than the Rosts assembling in different levels, and that is long impossible in each bed frame. 
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with stroke skelett 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should cover the formal class and the fine cushion. 
"In the hand or in the Hinsetzen you can feel the feathers in any case," warns Helena Prokopová. 
Every mattress requires a special Rosttyp. 
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document how together increased Siamzwillinge in the bedroom to find nothing. 
These Matratzes are not strip and you cannot wash the reference, which is already commonplace. 
And since we are in a single night between 0.2 to 0,75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years slowly to a huge (and clogged sieve). 
This is also why experts Werbeslogans reject Matratzes a lifespan of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee promise. 
Every cause has its if and buts. 
And so a practical advice from the dealers: in Matratzes of 120 or 140 cm diameter should be the hygiene of the waschbar, not shy away from abziehbaren salary, nevertheless, it is recommended to use a Matratzenschoner, you can easily drain and wash. 
Although today are produced in the rule with Rundumreißverschluss, Matratzenbezüge so that you get two sides after the opening (immensely important for the washing process and the waschmaschine size!) seems the manipulation with larger Matratzes, especially alone said, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. 
Do they in bed instead of a Rostes a solid record? 
So! 
Or, at most for a bed for unpopular guests and for a single night. 
Even so, they should install the record would rather Lüftungslöchern (if already not included) and mattresses with stroke skelett and 15 cm minimum level with so-called pocket stroke nucleus and fine cushion use. 
Polyurethan-Matratzen belong on such a document is not. 
For not verstellbar latte rosts with 14 to 18 stroke play (Lamellen) Latex or sand emphasis mattresses suitable (possibly combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay Roste with a major latte number, then 28 and more stroke play, with Lordosenstütze in the lende vertebral area and the ability to regulate the latte härte. 
At verstellbar Lamellenroste does not include Matratzes with relevant skelett, because they do not respond to the ergonomische pretexts. 
In addition to the suspension of the Steife stroke play will be offered special flexible shoulder modules. 
This is a particular stroke play, enabling the stroke play einzudrücken or even verwinkeln so that they allow the occasional Einsinken of the shoulder of the Schläfer. 
For men with broad shoulders an important matter. 
There are even matratze manufacturers, which have started with "Beatles' mattresses" soft zones to use for the shoulder area. 
It is thought also to the ladies - they might these soft zones in the Hüftgegend. 
For demanding customers are scoring burden large guidance systems (Lattoflex) or Roste with scoring burden Kontakt-Pads with so-called Multitorsionsfederung certain. 
The pressure will be distributed at several points, which reduces the tension. 
However, if you're on the right mattress and correct a bad (too big and fülliges) head bed used to get the most benefits will be lost. 
Here too a thumb: the head bed should be based on the head, its leaders should only go to the shoulders, so that the Schultermuskeln can relax. 
Ideal seems a 50 x 60 cm big cushions, as for example the Scandinavians may. 
In the situation should head bed (along with the shoulder discharge zone in or the soft zone in the mattress) offset the shoulder level. 
Something our modern Matratzes with the former (with hay filled) Strohsäcken but common. 
Modern manufacturers increasingly use natural materials, or at least their mixtures. 
Even Matratzes is the new magic word 'bio'. 
Instead of Erdölrohstoffen used for the manufacture of Polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturell oils - for example Rizinus and soya oil. 
Soy is used by all the well-known manufacturers. 
"Bio says in Matratzes, her heart is pure natural materials," said Petr Vaíek of the company Tropico Plus. 
Naturstoffe but are also used in the manufacture of Matratzenbezügen, was one of the first Aloe Vera. 
We can but also kapseln, spreading fresh wood or Lavendelduft in the sleep, Mr. President. 
Here too it makes a difference between man and woman. 
While the men a "cooling in the existing" plant extract from birke sheets will be used so that the matratze relationship can absorb the heat and cool the body, the salary for women "current mend" impact. 
Extracts from Red Paprikaschotes blood circulation suggest the weaker sex is wohlig hot during the sleep, Mr. President. 
And the current favorites? 
Mattresses from cold foam may (he has more Pores with devastated cell structure and is therefore breathing more active than normal Polyurethan and much more flexible). 
The combination of the various Steife (toughness) arise from Kaltschäumen and Visco-Schäumen Mehr-Zonen-Matratzen who know exactly where located head, hip and Fersen. 
For a quality mattress, but 7.000 Crowns and more to fork out £3.3bn. 
Health mattresses but are usually burdened with lower value-added tax, because they are considered to be medical aid. 
As the first Czech companies this advantage Gumotex has been given. 
You can see on the bed and on to save is not so easy. 
Every now and again there are special offers from manufacturers and distributors, the two mattresses on the price of an offer. 
Indeed, the brand offers the mattress Duofreeze Magniflex verstepptem Visco-Schaum Memory for 11.990 CZK. 
The second will get one free. 
It was the material Tempur, the era of viskoelastischen foam with open cell structure and high density began in almost cosmic speed. 
Small wonder, then, they have been developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed at the landing huge excess loads. 
Tempur is in heat soft, cool milieu entrenched it again. 
It fits perfectly in the human body and distributed in an optimal manner the physical pressure. 
It is therefore not only ideal for the prevention of printing brandy, but increased general sleeping comfort. 
Viskoelastische foam but not only Matratzes but also in other health products, such as special Fußpolstern used to facilitate give the legs and the equipment. 
Local manufacturers use, for example, the foam Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
