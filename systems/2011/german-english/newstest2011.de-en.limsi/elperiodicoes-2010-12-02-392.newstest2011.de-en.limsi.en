On the hunt for Wikileaks boss 
Obama will appoint a senior person responsible for the antiterrorism campaign on the prevention of new revelations. 
Interpol is a red warning to persecution and location of Assange. 
Everything with WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, connected, constitutes a complicated maze in which the facts only difficult to investigate. 
Yesterday Interpol a "red warning" to "locate and persecution" of Assange. 
However, it is not a traditional orders to arrest. 
In addition, it is not new, it comes from the 20 November. 
It has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States to do, but with the allegations of sexual abuse, which the Australians must face in Sweden. 
It also assured the lawyer of the founder of WikiLeaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they contact with Mr. Assange could absorb." 
As early as 20 gave the international police agency located in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden orders, but until yesterday after receipt of the power it has not been announced by the Swedish authorities. 
That is how things stand. The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify Assange and, presumably, "to provisionally arrest him and hand them over." 
Although Interpol for the arrest of a person hit by a red warning may not see many member countries according to the organisation of the red warning as a licence for a Arrestierung - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreements, as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange probably finds himself. 
The action empörte Assanges lawyers, the gestures published a letter in which it about it that the 39 year-old founder of Wikileaks is prepared by video conference to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities. 
They also recall that Assange sought the departure from Sweden and the prosecutor with the Pavlovich Beria shrouded Lavrentiy, security chief of Stalin, compared to the corresponding approval was given. 
"This is like a hunting, not as a legal persecution," will be charged in the letter. 
While the world it seeks, and his mother of Australia from the innocence of their son, Assange clings to an unknown location, but not silent. 
On Monday he was the head of the magazine Time via Skype from an unspecified location in an interview. In the conversation, he requested the resignation of US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. 
"If it can be proved that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the United Nations and therefore against the United States to sign international agreements infringed, they should resign," he said. 
His opinion was yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, condemned the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd." 
"I am not sure why we value on the opinion of a guy with a website should," he told CNN. 
Obama himself has a highly responsible for the antiterrorism campaign, Rusell Travers, charged with the prevention of new Dokumentenenthüllungen. 
The attempt by the spokesman of the side that those responsible for Barack Obama, Assange to pay less attention, is contrary to the views, the conservative politicians and commentators proclaim in these days. 
The Congressman Peter King, from January the chair of the House of Representatives in national security kommitee, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility to put Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organisations, "in order to seize their money, and everyone who supported or contributes to follow." 
Tom Flanagan, adviser to the Canadian President Stephen Harper, has gone even further, and he had to his statement, Assange must "be murdered" revoked. 
"Obama should transform him into a target and a not manned aircraft or so what use." 
Anyone who does not apologized, was Mike Huckabee, baptistischer minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate. 
"Who else was in the government information leaked, he is the treason and everything that is not an execution is eiine mild punishment," he told the broadcaster Fox.
