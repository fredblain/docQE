The army has so many Zündschnurs that you could umwickeln the whole Czech Republic keep you but only two years 
The Czech army has 445 kilometers Zündschnüre bought with weapons. 
In the year before, the Defense Ministry had 224 kilometers Zündschnur supplied to the army camp. 
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have ausgesorgt for 225 years. 
The problem is just the durability of the Zündschnur - two, at most, but four years. 
The army bought the Zündschnur from the company STV Group, others for paltry 40 million kronor. 
In his justification for the purchase of these huge amount Zündschnur said the General Staff MF DNES, the soldiers would annually consume about 60 kilometres Zündschnur. 
According to the research of Armeepyrotechnikern, according to the MF DNES emerges from this indication that the whole army annual an extremely intensive pyrotechnical training should, by all the generals and officers of the army command, to the Sekretärins and cleaning women. 
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded. 
Only in this way could be considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometres Zündschnüren reasonably justified. 
This length corresponds 25.000 Detonationen. 
But even this army stocks would be sufficient for more than ten years. 
But if the old rule of experts is still, for training every new professional soldier two meters Zündschnur quite sufficient, then the army by these Neueinkaufs, also from the point of view of the increased demand of pioneer and special teams - a reassuring stockpile for the above-mentioned created 225 years. 
It complained soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade recently in the Defence Minister Vondra, they would have almost no look for hand-held weapons more so that Schießübungen the lack of resources are limited due to strong. 
From the same shortage demure. 
"I am not a why they are buying such huge Zündschnüre." 
But it is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need." 
"For us, the army is a good customer, we as traders want concessions to as much as possible," says the sales manager of STV Group Jan Dcký. 
Jan Pejek, the spokesman of the defence ministry justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres Zündschnur, so that the army would, at least for ten years with this "ammunition" rangers covers. 
Jan Dcký of the STV Group, however, only talks about a four-year span of the Zündschnur and the police and Armeepyrotechniker even just two years ago. 
"With perfect storage are probably also the four mentioned years possible," admits one of them, but wants to remain unnamed, as a soldier not accused the criticism of the army. 
After the expiry of the utility of validity any ammunition must be tested thoroughly, whether it is reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers. 
However, these tests are not in vain, but costs further money. 
Another argument of the Defense Department is the quantitative rebate for 445 kilometers Zündschnur. 
"It cost us 60% less than any year's supply of 244 miles," Pejek spokesman us shares the position of the buyers of the defence ministry. 
Only for comparison: the annual consumption of Zündschnüren of Pyrotechnikern of the police, the ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Army, liquidate exceeds some years barely 1.500 metres. 
And the police always ordered such quantities of these weapons, which they still can consume before the expiry of the period of utility. 
It is wonderful for the safety of the Pyrotechniker, is also keeping the possibility to flexible purchases more advanced and therefore reliable Zündschnurs open. 
The Defense Ministry has already huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, as the two hundred thousand members Czechoslovak People's Army on its campaign was on the Rhine. 
According to the Pyrotechnikern, MF DNES, expects the Czech armed forces in a few years, the same problem in the killing of hundreds of kilometres of old Zündschnurs, which they now so has bought "favourable."
