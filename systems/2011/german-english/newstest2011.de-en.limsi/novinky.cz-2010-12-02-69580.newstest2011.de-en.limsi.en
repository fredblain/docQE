Pilsner Soil Fund - arrests of police in a public tender 
In the building of the land fund in Pilsen took the anti-corruption police in recent days arrests. 
It was the local media entrepreneur and property dealer Lubo G. Detektivs in handcuffs. 
This was allegedly attempted a just underway public competition on the handling of ways claims to manipulate so that the competition offered land a specific model zufielen. 
This is Lubo G. paid half a million. 
"At this stage, I can only confirm that the police a person being persecuted for the offence of fraudulent practices in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner prosecutor's office of the newspaper "Právo," further details in relation to the ongoing investigations, they could not provide. 
Twenty-four hours later, the 46 year-old businessman was released by the police. 
In what way he could manipulate the public competition, we can speculate on only in the face of the scarce official information. 
The spokeswoman of the land fund Lubomír erná led to the related issue of Právo, the police have in the Pilsner subsidiary body of the land fund actual arrests made and this during a public competition. 
"It was a client and not one of our staff," she konkretisierte. 
The public competition had Mrs erná, according to the correct designation "call for tenders of claims on the transfer of land under the land law" and would take place in cases in which several applicants interest in the offered land bezeigen. 
"These persons offer within the framework of the request a higher value of their through the transfer to awaiting disbursement ways rights than the land value." 
"In accordance with the offered claims will set the order of the potential acquirer, then gives the land fund land on the person with the highest offer," said the spokeswoman of the fund. 
Lubo G. were obvious information available to anyone who had registered on the invitation, and because he was even eligible person, since he has had bought a number of ways claims, he offered a property interest that he is withdrawing from the competition. 
Obviously against a fat compensation. 
It would also be a sufficient explanation for why he his arrest such a large sum was. 
Lubo G. was already in the past too good contacts with the Pilsner land fund. 
For example, he also played in the issue of the former head of the land fund Vaclav Sankota a role, which was prosecuted because he issued in Ersatzrestitutionen land, which already location decisions had been taken to construction. 
At the time Lubo G. acquired the land fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, to the point where the construction of the magistrale pole Borské for the industrial area was planned. 
He later exchanged this very favourable directly with the government against a house in the historic centre of the city a the far exceeded the value of the land. 
The town hall had to reluctantly small works not to jeopardise by blocking the land.
