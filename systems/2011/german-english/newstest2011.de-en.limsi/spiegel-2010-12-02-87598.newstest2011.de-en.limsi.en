With regard to the hell warrior! 
The art cinemas Splatter assimilate? 
The director Nicolas Winding Refn lotet with his combatant saga "Walhalla Rising," new from old the genetic borders. 
The Danish director at which audience may Nicolas Winding Refn thought when he "Walhalla Rising," revolved around? 
A captured wikinger warriors with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) freed itself from its Peinigers and sets with almost superhuman forces order as his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero like rough killing methods used and its enemies before the Gedärms snaps from the alive if he bad mood. 
On the other hand says Einauge as he is called, in fact, the whole film on any word, and the other characters are at most times on one or two sentences or a few painful Todesschreis. 
Otherwise kept quiet and gruselig beautiful hill landscape of Scotland have feasted upon the wikinger world of about a thousand years provides the backdrop. 
More ideal for adult Cineasten with interest of Existentialismus and very quiet camera journeys. 
Fine, if a film has several target groups, only a pity if they are mutually exclusive. 
Director Winding Refn has been in force for his wild and gestylt drogendealer trilogie 'Pusher' as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoical refuses to acknowledge his works with a little more humour the mainstream or a little less brutality to make the Arthouse available. 
Most Kunstkino-Freunde are likely from around spritzend brain mass and the Gedärms be deterred. 
The Action-Fans will then be able to die from boredom, if Einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons with a bunch of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and Waterloo. an eternity in slack and fog before the team apparently arrives in America and remain silent. 
Little wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising," has found no cinema in cinemas in Germany and is now only appeared on DVD. 
This is particularly because of the magnificent images of a shame, but also because behind the grandiose until blood triefend facade hiding a sometimes exciting piece of cinema, which has earned a little attention. 
In this film is not about dialogue or a coherent plot, it is all atmosphere, a film had fever dream. 
And for which there is no escape for the spectators. 
Refn he might barely a moment of relaxation and undertakes him with his icy images and the sinister Trance-artigen sound track very slowly, but above all with the unspeakable hatred of him has anti-American from the hearts of the characters. 
Only a small blonde boy, the Einauge faithful to the side, retains something like innocence, all others are driven by rage. 
Most of the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but for enemies and temporary allies sometime on the warrior from hell, possibly on the ambassador of the devil himself. 
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the already Verdorbenen. 
"Walhalla Rising," is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire the Ärgers, Aufregen and next. 
An experience.
