Zapatero and the red line in Germany 
Berlin has opted for the of, keeping the euro, but at the same time conditions set for the entire European Union. 
The tension on the markets have sparked a dual response of the government. 
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation measures presented, ranging from tax rebates for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the lifting of the 426 million support for the unemployed, not unemployment benefits, referring to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery. 
On the other hand supports the Deputy Head, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former government Minister Felipe González criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible, evokes have to the current crisis. 
How are these events to understand? 
It is anticipated that Merkel's position no errors of their publicity. 
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro. 
It takes Germany a fundamental new perspective on the shape of our future, with the maintenance of the ancient traditions of a large part of its partners. 
Given the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways to spekuliern from the crisis. 
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro area. 
The second: the reintroduction of the German mark - although that is currently more sounds like science fiction - supported by a majority of the public opinion, around 50% of the population. 
The third point: a transformation of the euro, according to German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries which overstep the specifications; möglicher as the default of certain countries, as well as the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures on the private sector. 
The German position is clear and has been looming for some time; that is why there is now no excuses. 
First of all, 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission incentives for deficits and the German government is a constitutional reform drew from the sleeves in order to prevent this from 2016. 
This was the first sign of the divergence between what Germany saw fit (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. 
The second signal suspended the Central European country, as Merkel the decision on the rescue of Greece by delaying painful. 
It was then that the strong criticism; but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion were totally against a rescue of Greece. 
Merkel is finally in the last Oktobertags again with a clear position; it calls for a reform of the agreements between the European Union in order to facilitate the rescue of a country and at the same time to commit the private lender to bear a part of the cost. 
This position was interpreted as anti-European because they Ireland crisis and propelled everything the following. 
But her proposal, albeit slightly sweetened, has been adopted; in the next few months, we will be in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures from 2013 should participate. 
Germany has drawn a red line, which is not to exceed it intends. 
It says all that - even if now unpopular measures must be taken - from this date the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist. 
2013 will be the birth year of a new monetary area in which the offender countries be punished harshly, can be forced to declare itself insolvent and in this case the private sector must take a share of the cost. 
Germany shows us that we must take a tough growth with high saving and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances. 
The other alternative on debt and construction based with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it from Spain was cited in boom times, will simply not be tolerated. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would do wrong to not understand it. 
It is not just about the public deficit to three percent by the year 2013 runterzufahren. 
The demands are much harder. 
And the worst, what we could do under these conditions is to cheat ourselves. 
I hope that the current turmoil to move into more calm. 
And that we have the opportunities that are available to us, until spring 2013 will use. 
It seems that Zapatero has interpreted, and its dual announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) suggests that despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis to create order in your own home, is preparing its way. 
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not seem that it would change anything. 
Among the options taken into account is that the euro area packed with little serious countries would have to leave, not be ruled out. 
In this case, Germany could still tell us, it warned us.
