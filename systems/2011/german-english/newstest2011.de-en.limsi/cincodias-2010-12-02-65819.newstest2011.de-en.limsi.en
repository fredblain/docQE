The European Central Bank (ECB) 
Investors reacted yesterday sharp on the threat of ECB President Trichet warned that "the markets should not underestimate our capacity." 
The risk premia have risen dramatically in the Euro-Peripheriländer and the shares of European banks by more than 5%. 
However, we should have the possibility that the ECB can deceive themselves and the euro has appreciated hardly points, which led to concern, not underestimate. 
The events of yesterday are typical for an illiquid market in the deal, in which he collapses recovers, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions. 
The institutional investors will still not long lose his fear. 
Today, the European Central Bank demanded a month on us to reverse our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen, according to which the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably still many times in the future, must make a U-turn. 
The Bundesbank called for the lifting of the plan for the purchase of government debt, because they are ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures - only a week's indefinite access, it should be maintained. 
After the Ireland crisis, we expect that the current liquidity measures "at least until March" extended and the quarterly tenders with unlimited access on quarterly of the year in order to guarantee the liquidity will be maintained until at least June. 
We also expect that the programme for the purchase of bonds continued and will spend a reinforcing signal. 
If the managed expectations are not met, the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday back and if halstarrig insistence that we withdraw our liquidity measures, can only God help us! 
As with the EZB-Sitzung in May, in which the bank confirmed the purchase of government debt securities not to take into account and then collapsed, the markets could repeat this history tomorrow. 
The ECB must be credible and tenacious. 
In May, it showed the teeth and on Wednesday, she said to have bought a lot, by which they provoked a new collapse of the market. 
Yesterday was the auction of one-year government permits in Portugal pretty weak. 
The state asset management were only 500 million at 5,28%, compared with 750 million 4,81% in the previous auction. 
Nevertheless, fell 30 basis points interest rates in Portugal in the whole curve and thus reflected a perceptual change the markets after the words Trichet's reflect that. 
In Ireland were the figures of the debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland published. 
The amount is approximately 10.000 million short-term and possible further 15.000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized. 
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after failing to recognize the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures are acceptable in the context of the rescue plan and help to reduce the uncertainty. 
However, the government Tuesday must receive parliamentary approval for his new budget, but the fact that they still do not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty. 
Angela Merkel has its discourse in relation to the summit of Heads of State and the government of moderate shaped on 14 December where it needed political unity in order to show that we shared the same score to play. 
The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries which Beethoven's ninth symphony. 
The Spanish government minister hovered above yesterday's action plan should be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday. 
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reduction of the deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures in the ears of investors such as Vivaldis sound four seasons. 
The dual effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4,5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges. 
Compared to February was the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank quickly and convincingly, and we benefit from the surprise result. 
Today there is an authoritative auction of a three-year bond will reap the benefits from the trichet effect; that is why we put on a strong demand, which remove all doubt about our debt-restructuring capacity. 
For Spain would be the application of an aid plan a self-sacrifice. 
We get liquidity, which we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion available, three times as much as in March. the interest rates are very expensive and would get access to the markets closed. 
Nevertheless, our strategy should comply with the motto "Caesar's wife:" now counts not only his, but also of appearances. " 
Only courage that we create!
