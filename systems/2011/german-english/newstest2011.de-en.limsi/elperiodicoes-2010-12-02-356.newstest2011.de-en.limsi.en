Sport and regulatory tax evasion 
Tricks like Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax of show inventiveness, but not the desire to circumvent a sanction. 
The alleged by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) exclusion in the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League meant that has been shed a lot of ink about whether it is an unsporting act or not acted and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA. 
As is well known, lost two players for a few minutes of the game of the year (her team had already clearly won) time and played several Fouls, so that the referee them showed the second yellow card. 
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would cite his group, the two players the prescribed sanction against the Auxerre meet in the next league game and so without cards enter into the next room for phase. 
Finally, the UEFA punished the disciplinary kommitee, José Mourinho, the coach of the club with two games and the participating players with different sums of money. 
The provocation of a yellow card in this or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football. 
It is so widespread that they form part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed rules in this sport -. 
Part of the debate about the portrayed event is due to the fact that a team of the football club Real Madrid (the find and honor claims in its national anthem and on other occasions punished for similar incidents had his players) played the main role, and the drama by Mourinho an episode more on his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician has added. 
In any case revolves around the debate about whether this is not explicitly prohibited behaviour by the statutes contradicts the principles of the sport, which is to say, whether these actions constitute a regulatory evasion. Indeed, this approach will abide by the statutes of the sport, but seem to circumvent its meaning. 
In this matter should damage caused to the sporting spirit to be investigated. 
The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect which was not jeopardized by these acts, because it was not an aggressive game. 
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the offender players an unwarranted benefit from the team, and this did not happen. 
The paradox of the plot of the players of Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally understand under false game or regulatory evasion, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly completed in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as visible as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. 
The players waited and the sanction happily attended. 
Another question is what kind of advantage the offender from the deliberate Fouls. 
This should be stressed that the rival neither was put in a disadvantageous position still benefits were erheischt for the played game, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue to play with a few players. 
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, then the club lacks these players. 
The benefit is obvious that the players the next ground phase of the Champions League without cards, which could threaten their participation in a future game begin. 
But it is a long-term, to a certain extent uncertain advantage, because the team could also leave at some point. Moreover received the players with this approach, a sanction and go in the second card cycle on where they are because card acquisition disappeared with a card less than in the first cycle. 
In this way, it is not clear whether it is really an advantage. 
Ultimately, such practices are directed not against the sporting spirit, which includes strategic decisions, in order to derive from the rules a maximum benefit. 
In this case, the players did not want any sanction deal (that would be really a clear case of regulatory evasion), they wanted to elect more when they undergo this. 
They met a strategic decision to duck without a penalty or to flee before her. 
Although it is blurring the line between inventiveness and regulatory environment, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness. 
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because it involved two Selbstausschlüsse and because of the nature of the provoked regulatory transfer. 
The damage inflicted on the principles of sport through these actions was less ethical rather than aesthetic nature.
