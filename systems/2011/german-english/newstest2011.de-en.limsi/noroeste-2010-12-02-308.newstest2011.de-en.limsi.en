The NASA announces the discovery außerirdischen life 
The American space agency called a press conference a vorzustelle a Fund for tomorrow, the impact on the search for living creatures in all. 
The national air and Space Agency (NASA) of the United States tomorrow, Thursday, a astrobiologische discovery known, which could confirm the theory of the existence außerirdischen life. 
The Fund will tomorrow at 1pm at a press conference in the headquarters of the NASA in Washington presented by experts from the Astrobiologie. It is a science which the origin, development, distribution and the future of life in the universe investigated. 
In convening the press conference, the NASA assured they will be "a aufsichts of regulatory built by the Fund for the search for outside earthly life" imagine what speculation in experts from other countries. 
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments, which has so far been deemed unbwohnbar human-like creatures can exist. It raised the hypothesis that these are intelligent creatures - as people - could turn if their living conditions improved. 
It would appear that it is a microbe at the bottom of the mono Lake in Yosemite-Nationalpark, California, has been found. You live there in an environment of toxic was kept for all possible forms of life, because the sea is severely arsenhaltig. 
In any kind used Mikrobie the arsenic than survival resource. Taking into account this ability to increase the chances that it on other planets, which do not possess our protective atmosphere may be similar lives. 
If these organisms verstoffwechseln the arsenic, according to the Astrobiologen demonstrated that "there is indeed a different way of life, a second way of life, we know different." 
The space agency is tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference known about the actual scope of their discovery. 
At the conference, the Geobiologin Pamela Conrad are participating, which investigated the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, the Titan (the largest moon Saturns) under the question of whether its chemical composition is similar to that of the Earth, studied.
