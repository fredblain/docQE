The demokatrische routine 
The democracy movement in Latin America will be stronger, such as the support of private companies. 
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment. 
In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil larger than the United States. 
These results came the Latinobarómetro-Umfrage, which conducted in 18 countries and exclusive was published in The Economist. 
Since 1995, this survey will be carried out on a regular basis and demonstrates the freedom of change in this region. 
Two facts fall in this year's survey in September and October particularly in's eye. 
First, the good mood in Latin America 
And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions. 
In many countries, the democratic movement in the South American Pacific coast has increased sharply (Table 1). 
In Peru, for example, where the economy since 2002 is growing by approximately 6% per year, increased the number of democracy activists by 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. 
Even in Mexico, where the economy since the sharp fall in the last year recovered, is to see such a trend. 
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the world's two most populous countries in the region are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (graph 2). 
Approximately 44% of respondents said that they are satisfied with the democratic practices of their country. That as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3). 
Approximately 34% trust the Congress of its country and 45% of their government. Both values are equivalent to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%). 
Before a decade undermined Latin America's economic crises efforts for more democracy. 
It also continued during the global economic crisis is probably due to the fact that the Latin American countries experienced only a brief recession, and have recovered quickly. 
In addition, the poor were absorbed by a stronger social network. 
(According to reports by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week rose in 2009, the poverty rate in Latin America only slightly and has again fallen by 32% this year.) 
But from country to country there are strong Stimmungsunterschiede (graph 4). 
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread progress thinking reflect that. 
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case. 
It was only the second time since polling began to see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country a greater problem than unemployment (graph 5). 
Approximately 31% say that either themselves or a family member in the past year victim of a crime was. But compared to 38% last year fell the values and thus achieve the lowest since 1995. 
The rising economic performance is reflected in the greater support from the private sector and the market economy is mirroring: approximately 71% of respondents trans-regional that the private sector is essential for the development in 2007, there were 56% (graph 6). 
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared with 47% last year. 
Interestingly, 62% of respondents maintain this view in Venezuela (and 80% are for a private sector), even though her leftist president, Hugo Chávez, many private companies nationalized. 
Brazil has loudly 19% of respondents (18% last year) the greatest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year). 
The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, however, see the most influential country in the US, and this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua from Venezuela.
