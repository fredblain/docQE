Saba dell wants to its rival in three years a million customers 'klauen ' 
The caretaker board member of Banco saba dell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers; he believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but a new liquidity crisis initially rejects and predicts the end of the Schuldenkriegs. 
Nevertheless, he sees a collapse of the banks with interest margins ahead to offset increases the fees and prices for loans to try. 
Saba dell expected in three years a million retail customers - a remaining specialist. 
Saba dell has found the way to exploit the next three years, and so in a very difficult economic environment to survive. 
In 2011, the bank will introduce a new three-year flagship plan. 
The goal is not only to survive without public aid to claim from the FROB, but also the market share for a million retail customers - 700.000 if the customers, the bank will lose - to increase. This is the great challenge facing this bank, because until now it has its business customers more attention than their private customer. 
This year it has 250.000 private customers and 50.000 companies extract. 
Your market share in retail is at 3.5 percent, while the business customers constitute more than 10 percent. 
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase of productivity, i.e. Austerität cost reductions. The challenges faced by the bank so that, they will present along with annual Summary. 
Only a few banks dare in these difficult times set targets and to publish as a result of the financial crisis worldwide all plans of the banks are disrupted. 
Saba dell this year its guiding plan established four years ago Optima conclude. This was designed initially for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended for a business year. 
The customers will leave the savings banks are the main objective of the bank. 
At a breakfast organised by the APIE Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great scope." 
The manager expects Spain would only "slow" out of the crisis. 
In addition, it would be "very difficult" in two or three years "work to create" - essential for the survival of the banks. 
Even if he assumes that the war for liabilities - the interest margins punished - will wane, raise risk premia, banks and thrifts must pay for their emissions to the maintenance of liquidity, as compensation for declining profit margins already shifted to the price for loans. 
"The issues liquidity and funding are structural in nature and they will exert pressure on the loans." 
"We have not marginalised Hahn, but the Zinsdifferenziale are very high," Guardiola admitted. 
Banesto was on Thursday ordering its subsidiary network to restrict the allocation of long-term loans and to increase the Zinsdifferenziale (cf. Cinco Díaz report on 22 and 27 November). 
The manager also acknowledged a currently pursued the banks of the Stategie, "to increase the fees," but "within a framework characterised by competition." 
Saba dells flagship plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business. 
It is not for nothing that he assured that in Spain "larger companies are necessary." 
"In the coming year will change everything," he assured. 
He stressed that the need for capital is currently "huge increases" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions are slipping into red figures. 
He is of the opinion that the FROB could replace with Kaptitalaufstockungen the money market. 
After he assured that saba dell also could survive a temporary closure of the markets, he refuted the argument of some bankers, who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis. 
He stressed that nothing can be put into circulation, but in contrast to the events in June, could be short-term funding beyond Repogeschäfte reach and so that the crisis.
