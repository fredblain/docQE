No objections from the Spanish government against CIA 
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida-Gefangenen on Spanish territory after Guantanamo, as from a telegram from the ambassador, S.A. emerges in Madrid. 
This reflects the enhüllten of Wikileaks and the daily newspaper El País " (cable) passed on documents, but it adds that the former deputy leader María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, the Spanish Government should be informed," to prove that foreign planes flying over Spain, will be monitored properly. " 
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, where the aid to human rights practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, has been indicted, discussed the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega. 
The deputy leader admitted that the report of the Council, "Zapatero met on the sidelines" and reiterated that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter. 
"De la Vega stressed that Spain had no objections to the Geheimdienstflüge on Spanish territory." 
"You simply want to be informed," not "unprepared to be surprised," reported Aguirre cable. 
Even the former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the ambassador pointed out that the Spanish government "wants to give this matter does not pay great attention, even though the government had little influence, because they would be in the hands of the judges." 
The prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez was in turn in January 2007 to understand the message that he is the judicial initiative, the declassification of documents from the Spanish intelligence headquarters (CNI) and the defense minister to request about the CIA would not block. 
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," said the ambassador after a conversation with the prosecutor. 
Nevertheless, it was not the United States on the "apparent coordination between the Spanish state prosecutor and the German prosecutors" more than the CNI and the Defense Department about the deklassifizierte information. 
"This coordination between independent Untersuchern our efforts will complicate to discreet handling between governments," laments Aguirre. 
At a lunch in March 2007, in which the ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, describes the latter that "although the Spanish judges are considered incredibly strong on their independence and do what they deem appropriate," he indicated his staff was "blown to avoid rhetorical comments to let the tension wane." 
The ambassador also expressed its concern about the approach of the PP in this matter. 
"Despite their generally proamerikanischen attitude our experience shows that the PP will not doubt from an indication that the government of the United States Zapatero's acts as a possible human rights violations could be interpreted, tolerated or have deliberately ignored capital, even if these revelations will have a negative impact on the government of the United States could," he stresses.
