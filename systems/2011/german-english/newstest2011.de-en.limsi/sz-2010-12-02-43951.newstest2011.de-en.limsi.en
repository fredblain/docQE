Puzzle Erdarbeiten 
The International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria. 
The country does, however, to comment - still leaves it controls. 
As an antidote to midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007 will jump at least four Israeli F-15 i warplanes a mysterious, würfelförmiges building in Syria. 
It is on the shores of the Tigris; the next major city, 30 miles away, is Dair as-Saur. 
Your name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, which Syria allegedly with help from North Korea has built in the Quader, hidden in a valley of the stream. 
According to a briefing of the US-Auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA by the end of April 2008 would be under the name of the near village el-Kibar familiar reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium, which could be employed to build nuclear weapons. 
For other purposes hardly worth the technology from the fifties. 
The CIA has led a video presentation with vague satellite imagery. 
Per computer they ignored a animation where the components of the reactor should be have been before the destruction of a smaller copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyong nuclear center is. 
They also presented photographs showing the building from the vicinity or even the interior space. 
The reactor was briefly stood before the operation, it was said, but not yet been drawn up with fuel rods. 
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more well-known than then, were the mystery even wider with the passage of time. 
Former US President George W. Bush has recently unveiled in his memoir that the CIA was fairly safe before the attack that Syria has built a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly evidence saw that in the country, "an active nuclear weapons program" existed. 
Some intelligence officers in Europe are still prefer more cautious and speak only of a "alleged reactor," even if they CIA-Präsentation find "plausible." 
You lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. 
What is needed, how safe it is to have a reactor, replied only bland a high UN-Diplomat in the summer, the IAEA was "enough material to ask questions." 
According to the rubble of the alleged "ungenutzten Militärgebäudes" the Syrians eager to one side and thoroughly planierten the terrain. 
However, there was an IAEA team in June 2008 under the former chief inspector Olli hein in el-Kibar traces of uranium had been produced by people. 
The IAEA also received commercial providers on a Member State satellite images directly from the time after the attack, which should be more meaningful than the CIA. 
However, these recordings do not have to get on the market because of the unknown purchaser - perhaps Israel - she has bought exclusive. 
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify their authenticity. 
Syria has always declared, never pursued a secret nuclear program or a reactor built. 
The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus. 
But it rejected the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely back. 
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss - as on the satellite imagery. 
In addition, it denied the inspectors access to a second inspection in el-Kibar and the rubble of the bombed-out buildings. 
But Israel says iron. 
"We will never comment on the ', recently reiterated to the time of the attack incumbent Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, the official position. 
The investigation of the case thus dragging on since June 2008 inconclusive, "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority," as a senior Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna - after all, a serious breach of the NPT in the area, about which the IAEA monitoring. 
As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA appears to be three more bodies, "functional contact with the alleged reactor" should - and unlike those still exist. 
In this context, the inspectors have not revealed what the assets are, nor what role they have or what they can appear to be suspicious. 
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they will be on the IAEA internal as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah called, in turn, derived from nearby towns. 
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and at satellite images tracked down a building complex in Masyaf, where it is most likely is one of the suspicious objects. 
It is probably in or adjacent to a military base - exactly with this justification denied Syria the IAEA access to the three places. 
In Vienna, it says, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be vorgeschickt by the United States, auszuspähen at military installations. 
Because the Nukleardetektive were carefully through a tip from the US on the facilities have become. 
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the Quader on the Euphrates material out and was transported. 
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could "in connection with the fuel production." 
But there is "no evidence of sensitive activities," i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes which are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons. 
The type of reactor is operated with uranium is not enriched. 
But where the uranium could have come from and where we draw from this later should be separated plutonium for the bomb on these central issues if anything, there are plausible assumptions. 
It is also unclear whether debris that could pose a valuable clues in the three places were stored. 
When would the hundreds Lastwagenladungen disappeared from the ground, nobody wants to have information about where the rubble remained. 
The only a few kilometres from el-Kibar located on the other side of the Tigris al-Tibni salt mine, which Syria in 1998 on their suitability as a camp has investigated for radioactive waste, the IAEA is unlikely. 
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley she was recently in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor in mid-afternoon. 
Photographs from orbit show, however, that Syria to the three suspicious places Erdarbeiten and large containers removed after the IAEA access had requested. 
This cannot be coincidence, but has hardly helped to dispel the suspicion. 
In addition, it says in diplomatic circles, the IAEA have spent many months to develop a plan for inspections there, Syria should allow to maintain any military secrets - just the tape shows how great is the interest of the inspectors. 
Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte this proposal. 
Although Western diplomats in Vienna soothed even a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, so the matter did not have any urgency, brings about US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months ago so-called special inspections into the game, one of the harshest means that has the Vienna nuclear authority to enforce controls. 
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano should propose these inspections, has already " an option for which I am open in the future ', even though he hesitates. 
There is a high risk in this way: first, it needs for a majority in the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented are anything but eager for an escalation. 
Secondly, as a diplomat to consider: "What if they find nothing in the end?"
