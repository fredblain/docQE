Climate: as France is talking about his financial promises 
A year after the Copenhagen treaty, it is time the observance of the fast gelösten funding promises ("Fast Start" or premature funding mentioned) to investigate which have been implemented by the developing countries. 
And already have revealed the rough French vulnerable to blandishments. 
With the Copenhagen Treaty have committed themselves to developing countries, 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012 will be set aside. 
The EU has 7.2 billion euros over three years promised France 1,26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year). 
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16, the EU has taken all register their partners from the fact of their commitment to convince about the Fast-Start-Finanzierungen: accurate course report of its Member States, press conference, large side events, broschüre distribution. 
The operation transparency is remarkable and appreciated for their actual value: the developing countries and civil society would look like if all developed countries the same made on the same precision levels. 
The EU announced, 2.2 billion euros in 2010 to have released what they are on the right path to Respektbezollung their commitment of 7.2 billion brings in 2012. 
If one looks in detail but are things a little more complicated. 
This money should be according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional deployment was introduced to benefit, without detriment of public development aid. 
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means. 
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonisation, certain member states, including France, the procedure has been blocked. 
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark, which he considers to be the best. 
The European Commission, for example, as a benchmark for the person of the Year 2009: the international funding will be maintained, and in the context of "fast start" funding over three years of 150 million. 
Other countries have similar benchmarks, either on year or about conditions elected at the level of public development aid. 
In contrast, France has been of the opinion that the financing "of all new projects" of 2010 were "new and additional." 
In other words: there is no benchmarks in the spending of the previous year or public development aid at a global level. 
Specifically, the total amount of French support can remain stable developing countries (or decrease) - France gives its commitment with regard to the "new and additional" funding must be respected. 
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. 
There is still no rule, and everyone elects its calculation mode. 
Some, like France, for example, 1 borrowed as equivalent with 1 donated. 
Obviously, this is only serious reasonable: the effort is not comparable. 
If the use of loans for certain profitable investment (often projects tied to emission mitigation based on effektivster technology) can be justified, it is wrong to present the euro as the equivalent of a donated euro captured... let only the cost of loans for the capital donor country to be counted as commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate). 
But France has nothing else in mind as the following thought: it "respected" his commitment of 420 million euros by 91,5% loans (389,8 million) resumes and 8,5%) 36,1 million euros) - see the EU documents to convince themselves. 
France is the only EU country uses in large measure that loans. 
Germany urges 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) their commitments to 100% to follow up with donations. 
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union 1 spends to fulfil their obligations, France just 10 cents and meant a similar commitment. 
Schöner! 
Everything operates in all France in his fast start with a double deception: a part with a Weiterentwicklkung of action over the period and partly with the reality of the financial commitment. 
France will be able to believe that 420 million "new and additional" million has been spent in accordance with its promises, it will save 36,1 million. 
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it would appear that Bercy was carried out of the arbitrage) a double negative effect could entail; even internally (why continue with donations from the other member states if it is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries do not completely fooled... 
The chapter of the premature funding only a small issue in a relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions on the climate. 
But it could drop too much in the huge machinery of the UNFCCC. 
Let us hope that this will not be the case. 
As it always is, it is essential to its lesson from this first year to learn verfrühter funding. 
First and foremost, France could be a change in its Verbuchungsart parade for the years 2011 and 2012, and in the spirit of respect for its commitments and the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union. 
France could but, above all, the discussions on the contentious subject of long-term financing forward (another crucial and current topic): you can escape the question of the "Verrechenbarkeit" or the Verbuchungsart of its loans are not. 
France could change its position, as advanced in terms of controversy, as it is in other things. 
The hope is the new Minister for the Environment Kosciusko-Morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun. 
A surprising announcement on the fast start of France and its vision of the "Verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loans would increase by nature of the international trust needed for further discussions.
