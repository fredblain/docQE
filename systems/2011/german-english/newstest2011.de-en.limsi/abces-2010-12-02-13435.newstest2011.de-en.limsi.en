The elderly nursing home confirmed that the deaths were not due to "lack of action" 
The owners of the old people's home in Olot does not preclude their carers on 11 elderly people killed 
Officials of the elderly nursing home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which she highlighted what damage the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the carers during his work at least 11 old people, for which he was responsible, was killed, had caused the institution. 
The head of the elderly care home, Joan Sala, came with his lawyer, Joan Cañada, court and announced, "La Caritat would like to thank the people responsible (for the deaths) accuse," but "the right and our liability oblige us to make the process and the civil liability" to be adopted. 
The institution must not only accept a social prestige lost, because they are the criminal activities of the carers had not discovered in time, but now also pay a high compensation sum of the legal representatives of the families of the victims will be calculated. 
Joan Vila Dilmé acknowledged that the first crime originates in August 2009 and that he had murdered since then further. 
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight Körpern former patients of the elderly nursing home - because he suspected that no doctor examined the dead personally, but the formalities for age and disease have been handled by telephone. 
The head of La Caritat prominent writers have expressed this point flatly and declared that "lack of action in no time the reason might have been for the incidents." 
The lawyer of La Caritat added that it "in the legal dispute is no evidence for negligent acts were a different person than the defendant." 
The already as "Angel" Getaufte confessed the day before 11 killings and said the first crimes committed on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later to have killed the second old lady. 
In this case he killed with an overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first crime, in which he is a mixture of various sedatives had. 
The head of La Caritat, said the staff access to the drugs is difficult to control. 
The insulin injections and the sedative middle cocktail suspended the carers in six of the nine crimes a to liberate the patients with the death of their suffering. 
But the results of laboratory tests will point out whether Vila is lying and for its first victims actually chose a less cruel death, or whether he ausbrannte them from the inside by offering bleich lauge forecast was, as it had done, according to confession in three women he murdered between 12 and 17 October. 
In La Caritat listens to the statements of the carers no faith, not even as regards the number of confessed murders, which could be more perfectly. This attitude is justified that Vila very different statements made in court and that it make no sense, his approach after eight successful murders suddenly change. 
They say they were for this reason and investigating the scope of these incidents of justice available.
