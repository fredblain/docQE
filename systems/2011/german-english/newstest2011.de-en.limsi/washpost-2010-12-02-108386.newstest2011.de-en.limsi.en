Civility can connect the division? 
After a campaign of dirty words and negativity this week erupted little civility in Washington. 
It is the sign of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion, before quickly returning to fight the parties in the capital? 
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and Congressional leaders brought no breakthrough on the big issues during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government session, in which no decisions will be taken more had to employ. 
After all, what we hear, it was not a polite debate between two different parties to govern even a consideration of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partisan Punktesammelns. 
The public meeting of the deficit commission the president on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences that still exist between the members. 
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months arise leaves a mutual respect, the ideological gulf separating the members still veiled. 
This is hardly enough to claim that it is a new era of cooperation. 
Both sides are now in a testing phase, in which a voice from the other signs of cooperation and compromise, while even tried the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters weigh after a renewed partisan warfare. 
This was why the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants limited to a minimum of demands or accusations. 
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep, and that a rapid change in the atmosphere which prevailed in the past two years, could be expected. 
Whether it involves taxes, donations, health or Anwartschaften, the two sides are miles apart. 
Lastly, the November election Washington, at least for a short time bribed. 
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, now for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center" works. 
"It is inevitable after elections. 
Elections appear partisan passions die again. 
And that is good." 
In some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the "lame duck session" Republicans and Democrats hardly any other choice than to find a solution. " 
Bush's tax cuts end up at the end of the year, and no one advocates. 
Both sides want to find a way to some or even all receive, whether temporarily or permanently. 
It is also necessary to expect a compromise on the increased unemployment money, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that it believes the preferred tax cuts for the rich, while unemployed workers refuse a support. 
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House has increased the optimism that these issues during the "lame duck session" to reach an agreement and at the same time the new Start treaty can be ratified. 
But William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame duck session " not compelling must lead to a lasting cooperation between the parties, if the new 112. Congress will convene in January. 
Instead, he says, is a phase of failure for huge likely, perhaps even inevitable. 
"After the things that need to be done, done, will turn these short-term psychology in confrontation," he said. 
Wehner is also sceptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - the politeness leads to real cooperation. 
"I see many things from now on until 2012 happens, as Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event from 2012," he said. 
The reasons for this have a lot with the presentation of the new Republican majority to do in the White House and with the Teeparty-Wählern were conducive to their education. 
As the Republican leaders also expressed concern may be that they vie to high, they know that they must try to reduce their promises, the expenditure of the government and the health care reform to set aside to adhere to. 
This party lines are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the deficit commission clearly what a tax reform and the state of some taxes and raising the retirement age and include the planting of government spending. 
The stellvertretends chairman Alan Simpson and Bowles Erskine an inherited the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, so pressed to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored. 
But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes in order to make its plan for the official recommendation, and they are fighting very well to come only in the proximity of this figure. 
The biggest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters, at least today, little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises. 
Galston says two stages in the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress ahead. 
The first fight next year will take place in the form of Parteizusammenstößen, when the Republicans Obama on the state budget, taxes and challenging the health care system, then followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation. 
What will lead to this change? 
The public opinion. 
It is shown that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties to work together. 
If confrontation in a blind alley, as happened in 1995, then we must respect both parties carefully on the public reaction. 
Whoever is doomed to lose, will change the course and must seek compromise. 
This may in fact be an optimistic view. 
Partisanship and polarization are now greater than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem to have a greater ideological divide between Obama and the Kongress-Republikanern to be at the same time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. 
At the same time see the activists of both parties in 2010 as a mere prelude to a consequence far broader election in 2012. 
So it may be the courtesy display this week will be welcomed by many Americans. 
But on both sides, it will require much more effort to find a common denominator in the issues that the two still separated.
