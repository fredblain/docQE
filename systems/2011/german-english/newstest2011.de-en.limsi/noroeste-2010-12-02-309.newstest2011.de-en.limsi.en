Gesta PRD, PT, Convergència and Patrón form an opposition bloc 
With the reform of the Organgesetzes on the Congress will introduce the two-party system, they complain. 
The 60th legislature had begun, and already installed an opposition bloc, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergència and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented themselves as Independents. The four posed the following question: the arrival of the 'Zweiparteiensystems ' in the chamber. 
Before the start of the introductory session in the 60th legislature wetterten Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergència, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo against the reform of the Organgesetzes, because they were excluded. 
With this reform, repeated it would be a 'Zweiparteiensystem ' introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties who controlled the Congress. 
These four MEPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only against the Panisten Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as deputy chairman cited Bureau agreed. 
Corvera Quevedo said that the parties PRI and PAN institutional with these reforms had been introduced their political fringe equality. 
He led that they speak in the next few days with the representatives of PAN and PRI would be to change the pattern. They went out of its political will and if they hadn't, they would again be subjugated by both parties, by which the opposition coalition would put an end. 
"Far I (the opposition coalition), which is what I see, because we are excluded from all Entscheids, not even Rücksichte, to take into account the opinion of the rest." 
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergència said there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed. 
It cannot be permitted, he continued, that the Congress after he was monopolistic now should be "duopolistisch." 
"It is not the spirit of legislative reform in Congress an eternal two-party system will prevail." 
"For the early starts this group with five Members and they are talking with other colleagues, so that they will be more," said the convergencia member. 
Ezequiel led Reynoso Esparza of the PT in allusion to PAN and PRI, that the Congress is currently in a 'Beute ' have turned for two. 
"Before, it was just a party, they now share this second." 
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the members and give them their place at the negotiating tables. 
"It should not be on the basis of five top choices, which will probably be nine Members will ignore. The five, which is currently seen as broken up into different groups have decided to unite seduce our place at the negotiating table, because he reform of the others was carried out and agreed that we are out there remained and we do not agree with this reform."
