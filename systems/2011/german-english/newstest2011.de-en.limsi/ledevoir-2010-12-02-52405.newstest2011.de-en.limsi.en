Global plan for the renewal of the lighting 
The UN has a plan yesterday in Cancún for the renewal of the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in terms of achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (CFC) proposed, almost a third of the additional reduction, which must be implemented in order to stabilise the Earth's climate until 2020. 
This ambitious plan takes his position in the step of specific major projects a the UN hopes to implement in Cancun for the absence of compelling reduction commitments to compensate for the industrial countries. 
After the yesterday raised plan would be the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFCs emitted as a result of the lighting on the planet to be avoided, if the White fervent pears, which still has a monopoly of 50 to 70% of the market, by fluoreszierend or better still, by diodes (LED) would be replaced. 
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. 
This equates to an equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet. 
In Copenhagen last year had the big exhaust emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada was committed to voluntary Reduktionsplänen, the global fckw emissions from 53 to 49 Gt downsized Gt should. 
From this record, we should withdraw even 5 Gt, however, from now until the year 2020 climate increases to stabilize 2 degrees Celsius to prevent this control. 
In the White fervent pears 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% to produce the light. 
With the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, reduced with the new LED bulbs this energy once again twice. 
The Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen hold on average between 6.000 to 10.000 hours. 
The new LED bulbs, such as those which the manufacturer Philips has brought this week on the market - this society has participated in the study undertaken - have a life expectancy of 25.000 hours and 80% less energy than a weißglühende pear, which auswechselung plan gives a hint of the savings, which should be applied in 100 countries. 
Apart from the fact that iese novel light bulbs only make very little heat, they can also work with a regulatory widerstand. 
And they do not contain any mercury. 
Several specialists have shown that Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves to run because they mercury and that they therefore need as a toxic waste dump, which is not always possible in the developing countries, a Bring Centre available except producers. 
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, according to the report, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit far more mercury, the electricity wasted by the White fiery oranges to produce. 
Alone in the United States encounter these coal plants 25.000 tons of mercury annually. 
The report sets out detailed the profits, which would generate each country thanks to this international programme. 
Indonesia would, for example, a billion dollars a year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2 emissions, which means an equivalent of 3.5 Kohlekraftwerken, whose spiritual Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
