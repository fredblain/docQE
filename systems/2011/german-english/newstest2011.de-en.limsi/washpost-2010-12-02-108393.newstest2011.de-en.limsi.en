Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confrontation with the past 
In a weak brake betoniert class area with dirty and abblätternd walls, reminds the director of the Anlong Veng High School in the man it has built in the subsequent Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok. 
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok." 
"He was a good leader and he cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years. 
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butchers" remains the commander in this remote former Khmer Rouge hochburg popular in the north-west of Cambodia, where he hospitals and bridges built, the infrastructure has developed and where thousands of former soldiers still live. 
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge towards the government, are longtime supporters challenged in Anlong Veng. 
In April a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime. 
In June, the government circulated a school book for the first time children of former soldiers told the story of the Khmer Rouge. 
And in July condemned a Community Tribunal of the United Nations and Cambodia for the first time a former member of the Khmer Rouge, as the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, was sentenced to 35 years in prison. 
With each of these developments, the fear among the Khmer Rouge grew Alnlong veterans Vengs, complicating their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration into the society of Cambodia. 
"There is still disagreement and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime. 
"It was the life under the Khmer Rouge glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." 
"It is dividing even families." 
During the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or they died from disease, overwork or starvation. 
When the Vietnamese invaded and 1979 overthrew the Pol Pot-Ied government, fled the remnants of the regime and its military to the border of Cambodia to Thailand. 
Here it until December 1998, when the last movement surrender unrest. 
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary guerrilla war from its base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok withdrew the next generation in Anlong Veng. 
But in the middle of the 1990s, when a peace agreement promoted by the United Nations in 1993 led to the first democratic elections in the country, began large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, with the government, resulting in the Kapitulationen of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998 led. 
Pol Pot died in 1998, a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not given, was in 1999 by government forces arrested Mountains in the Dangrek. 
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he was awaiting his trial. 
When their benefactors they no longer protected, fled most former Khmer Rouge fighters in the grinding poverty of the rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory. 
Even if a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts, because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers. 
"These people have benefited only very little of the capitulation," said Sok Leang from the Centre for justice and reconciliation throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng, public forums 
"They are enshrined in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime." 
"They are growing up without any professional knowledge." 
Sor Lim, 55 years, 1974, joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager, had fought in the jungle at Anlang Veng before he 1998 Lower left a life to lead as poor rice farmers. 
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said. 
"Ta Mok has everyone something to eat." 
"But now, life is difficult, because we have to care for ourselves." 
The current Khmer Rouge tribunal has also fomenting here concerns. 
At the beginning of next year, the court will try, Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge ministers to put before the courts. 
The mandate of the court, the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities to condemn, but it has not said whether it over these four cases will pursue further action. 
This has contributed little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng. 
Recent media speculation on the Chaem, 64 years concentrated during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's, district chief in the province of Manteay Meanchey have been. 
In 2007, it was representative of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia told they have the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms led a project in which thousands of forced labourers probably died. 
At a hot evening came in the Chaem of the work in the fields with their wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng back. 
When the sun long shadow on the dried grass threw in the Chaem to discuss their past with the Khmer Rouge. 
If the court vorladen them, so they would refuse to go, she said. 
"Cambodia is living in peace and stability," she said. 
"If there were no prosecutions more is war." 
Prime Minister Hun Sen, in 1878 fled from the Khmer Rouge, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, would accuse the court more suspects, although experts and historians discuss. 
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said. 
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to be able to go forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation. 
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means to collect the broken pieces," he said. 
"It is our duty, this broken parts together, so that we can understand how everything." 
The centre has created the first school paper approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, 75 pages "history of Democratic Kampuchea." 
It circulated the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history textbook for the High School of the Education Ministry, less than four pages contains about the Khmer Rouge. 
How often in Cambodia know the young people in Anlong Veng little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections to the regime. 
Touch Valeak, 19 years, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps the student to understand an important part of their history. 
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read it. 
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said. 
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people will be condemned by the court." 
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang. 
But the public forums, the school paper, and the court gain after and for influence," he said. 
Still owns the Khmer Rouge here a powerful attraction. 
Mountains in the Dangrek likely leads a Strauchs is rampant and with plastic waste verdreckter route to a Rechteck of black soot covered with a rusty tin ceiling. 
Pol Pot's body was here after his death in 1998 have been burned on a Reifenhaufen. 
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a phone verkäuferin the roadside, said she does not know much about the man who had been burned here. 
"But he has a strong spirit and many people are here to pray to him," she said. 
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later in the day, they wanted to Pol Pot's final resting place to go where they will take a bush mature bananas - in the hope that it brings her luck.
