The government wants to stop the torture of "hexes" and handed over a brochure 
Women who are stamped as hex in Burkina Faso normally show some common social features. 
You rather belong to the older generation, they do not find any work - for example for sanitary reasons, they are single and do not have any children. 
If one of these women "becomes" the witch, she is isolated severely, in this way they the rest of the village not dangerous can become. 
"Men are quite rarely affected by this fate." 
"Also young and healthy women have this saved since they help with the work and "give birth to children" a nun describes the situation that takes care in the capital of the west-African Burkina Faso state in a special home of more than a hundred women that were expelled by their communities. 
The local government decided now, to proceed against this abnormal "social measure." 
And a brochure that is supposed to stop the "witch pursuit" handed over for this reason. 
The thing has, however, a hook. 
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can not read," the newspaper "derStandard" referred to the dilemma of the written clarification. 
To be accused of the witchery is, however, also in other African countries gang und gäbe. 
In Ghana, the neighbor country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year old Ammy Hemmahová was tormented by three women and two men to death - they poured petroleum over it and simply lit it. 
Also the servers' BBC reported about this incident among other things. 
The culprits said, however, the thing would have been only a concurrence of unhappy circumstances. 
According to your version oil ignited which is used to ritual anointings. 
And indeed, after the group attempted "to drive out" "a bad spirit" from the woman. 
The people support the isolation of "hexes" here without regard for their education. 
"The standard one" summoned a 42-year old entrepreneur to that from Burkina Faso: "Mug gutters of human souls are formerly as today a danger," he said. 
While the government is making at least an effort in Burkina Faso for defusing the witch-hunt, the president himself mixed the gambianische president in the last year tidily. 
"Präsident Yahya Jammeh provoked a monstrous witch-hunt after the death of his aunt since these supposedly had part onto their deaths and would attempt now to kill also the president even through black magic." 
"It called Schamane for this purpose from the near Guinea to help that in company women randomly arrested by policemen, soldiers and the lifeguard of the president and men carried off violently from gambianischen villages and brought onto the farm of the president" in Kanilai" the organization Amnesty International mentioned in their report. 
On the farm the incarcerated people were forced, a decoction from plants with hallucinogenic effect drink, that but also intestine and kidney problems caused. 
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm. 
First due to the international pressure the almost a thousand were released prisoners again.
