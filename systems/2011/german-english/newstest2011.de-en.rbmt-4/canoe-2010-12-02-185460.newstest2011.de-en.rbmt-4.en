The secret immigration could be pursued without problems 
The draft of the conservative that is supposed to control the problem of the ships loaded with secret immigrants according to the government pulls down all foresight after after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they can not approve the proposal. 
"I revolt with emphasis against this charter." 
"I hold with a party which put you fetters onto the feet," declared Michael Ignatieff, head of the liberals, after the weekly Caucus-meeting in front of the gathered representatives. 
The liberals claimed, the draft that allows everyone of one than identified by illegal immigrants to the transportation to hold sea-going vessel coming person up to a year, the Canadian right and freedom constitution hurts so as suggestedly. 
It pointed out to Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, in the same way not to be able to support the draft since it opposes the wrong target group. 
"On the other hand we are and it seems that all opposition parties on the other hand are therefore we become" M. Duceppe declared "to wait, which the government undertakes." 
The criticism with regard to the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, expelled the critics from the hand that demand their party would not behave steadfastly enough opposite the secret immigrants. 
"We are the neo-democrats so that understood that one takes measures against the stowaways, and now this attempt through mediation of another draft, the C-35, put through," Chow mentioned. 
We do not approve the draft of the conservatives therefore because he searches the fault with the refugees and "detains children" for at least a year," declared Chow. 
The immigration minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties, to play with the politics and to ignore the will the Canadian. 
"The Canadians inform the representatives insistently that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration these criminal processes that affect Canada and that treat the country as a foot doormat." 
"You expect the reaction so that Canada takes hard measures" minister Kenneys. 
"The government did not announce any vote of confidence concerning their draft which could have led the country to choices which would have refused the government. 
A conservative expressed, however, opposite the agency QMI, the government would call a vote so that every opposing representative declares himself immediately opposite his voters.
