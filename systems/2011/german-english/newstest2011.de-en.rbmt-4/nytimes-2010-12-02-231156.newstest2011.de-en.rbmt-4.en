Cheshire-appointment makes attentive on Twitter 
Half a dozen of them typed in the riots in the courtroom away. 
In the minute time they sent their reports above Twitter about horrible testimonies. 
At the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140.000 Twitter-announcements about the process around rape and children chained to beds in a house which opened in flames. 
On Thursday the attentively pursued process of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused, finds three members a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to have killed, an official end if the judgment falls about the death sentence that the jury expressed. 
However, Mr. Hayes attorneys submitted already requests near court which reasons for an appointment explain and which will employ the courts onto years. 
That one is one of the provozierendsten reasons, that it has come through the intense reporting about the process - also through the extensive use of Twitter through average reporters - to a "circus atmosphere" and one so far spread, going around penetration incendious details', so that the jury was influenced by the public indignation in improper manner. 
This objection could lead the Appelationsgerichte to occupying oneself with the question whether to made the new technologies new rules in the courtroom become necessary. 
"So as I experienced it during this process, I believe that it is really a danger if the entry of the new technologies into the courtroom influences the right of every individual to a fair process," Thomas J. Ullman, Mr, said. Hayes main defender. 
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Uppermost Chamber Court, rejected last week the requests by decision succinctly, than he said, that the New Media carefully would become, and that it would not give any proof of that that the jury was driven from passions. 
However, that was not the last word with security in this thing yet. 
Since decades court objections have stated that the reporting makes about famous-notorious cases doubts about the fairness of a process arise. 
In his historical decision of 1966 the Uppermost court of justice of the United States canceled the judgment to an osteopath from Cleveland that is supposed to have killed his wife against Dr. Sam Sheppard, and it said in his decision that there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the New Media. 
Some believes, that the TV series and the feature film "on the Run" based on this crime. 
Some lawyers say, court objections, which Mr. To consider Hayes later condemnation half a century, could follow the argument that new rules became necessary in order to control the communication paths from the courtroom that were still inconceivable in the case's Dr. Sheppard times. 
"There is a good reason to be worried about the influence of the New media in processes that are pursued by a wide public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at the Stanford Law School that examined the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report it is imposed arbitrarily. 
Professor Donohue said some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated from the idea that the restriction of an immediate communication could make out of the courtroom the processes fairer. 
The Twitter matter is only one of many, that the lawyers of Mr. Explaining Hayes in order to discuss onto years and to put off a condemnation thus. 
The defenders also claim for example, that Mr. Hayes already would be condemned could, than judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential Juroren when one showed them horrible scene photos during the Jurorenauswahl. 
Some of the Juroren said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and their TÃ¼chter, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, would have given her disgust. 
The defenders say, they would question also the constitution moderateness of the death penalty constitution, and they argue, that the judge exchanged by mistake a Juror that a critic was to the prosecution and that it would have carried out improper manner pressure on the judgment, than it had made the uncustomary decision to reserve the jury over the weekend. 
The Juroren were not isolated. 
Maybe the greatest interest draws nevertheless their arguments about the influence of the detailed reporting about the process onto itself. 
In a judgment contestation that they submitted last month they stated that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American Senate. 
You argued, that the New Media would have provoked the flames of the emotions again continuously about the case. 
Maybe "one" did not experience "such daily crush of the media beeps, cameras and reporters outside of the courtroom" even nationally yet "before still," the lawyers wrote, "in New Haven and." 
Your emphasis onto the reporting through Twitter is controversial. 
In interviews some journalists said, that the claim, this direct news is aufwieglerischer as reports that are refunded more slowly a technique-hostile look is that the reporting about future processes becomes impoverished. 
Nevertheless some lawyers said Appelationsgerichte would be confronted often with the argument, social and technical changes would need the adaptation through the courts. 
Mr. Hayers lawyers intensify this claim. 
In their objection they related themselves to the decision of the Uppermost court of justice of 1966, in which the condemnation was canceled by Dr. Sheppard due to the reporting and did clear, that the New Media require new rules. 
"These case, so they wrote, Sheppard represents against Maxwell of the 21st century."
