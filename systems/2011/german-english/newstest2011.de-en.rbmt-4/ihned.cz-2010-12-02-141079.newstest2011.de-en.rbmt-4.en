Until today the contacts which I gained thanks to the competition come to me sitedly 
Lukás Pytloun with the sale helped the victorious placement in the competition "Small entrepreneur of the year" the franchise of his hotel. 
Winner of the last age-group of the competition "Small entrepreneur of the year" became Lukás Pytloun from Liberec. 
The history of his success seems as a film scenario. 
Lukás Pytloun traveled gladly. 
First abroad it became conscious to him that good overnight stay possibilities to reasonable prices are missing in Liberec. 
It arose from the savings of his vacation works abroad and with the aid of a bank loan a dilapidated house with five apartments. 
If one considers that he was a college student then in the sixth semester, this was surely a courageous venture. 
"The former price-quality-relation annoyed me and so I attempted to undertake something against that," says Lukás Pytloun. 
He let out the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers. 
He invested the whole profit immediately again in the house which it encircled with 54 beds afterwards step by step to the retirement. 
Since then he succeeded only in seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec in opening four pensions, two style-just restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of more than 300 beds of all accommodation categories. 
The most convenient of them was until recently the four star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel." 
This year a further first-class hotel joined. 
"Just we signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to whom we sold our franchise draft and have further prospective customers at the franchise of the Pytloun hotels already reported," the entrepreneur says number One of the last year. 
"The victory just had "great part of this license sale for the operation of hotels in the competition "Entrepreneur of the year," Mr Pytloun matches recognizing in addition. 
The victory imported to him greater fame popularity in Liberec and surroundings. 
"The people recognized me on the street, often they even subsequently congratulated me and I must say that did correctly well," he remembers. 
I really recommend all who want to create something to participate in this competition. 
One does not need to win either now, every viewing is good. 
He says that it profits from the contacts and acquaintances until today to which otherwise at all it would not have come. 
"With some people who I met thanks to the competition I maintain until today regular business relations." 
The fame combined with the success beats in his opinion also a little onto each of his employees low. 
And there he wears the seventy. 
"I notice with them greater loyalty and pride on their being a part of something to which general recognition zuteil becomes." 
I do also really not regard this only as personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of us all." 
"My name moved only something into the foreground," thinks Lukás Pytloun modestly.
