Sport and rule avoidance 
Tricks as those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show invention spirit, however not the will, to avoid a sanction. 
The exclusion supposedly instigated by two players of the real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of the 23rd November against the Ajax in the champions League led to a lot of ink being spilled about that whether it around an unsporting action or not acted and whether possibly both players of the UEFA should be sanktioniert. 
As is generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before time Playing (their team had won already unequivocal) and several fouls played so that the referee showed them the second yellow card. 
In this way, and since the real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will fulfill the stipulated sanction during the next league game against the Auxerre and get so into the next game phase without cards. 
Finally the Disziplinarkommitee of the UEFA punished the coach of the club, Jos√© Mourinho, with two games and the shared players with different amounts of money. 
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is to be found rather frequently in the world of the soccer. 
You are so widespread, that she is a part of the Ethos - the rules unwritten, but followed in this event. 
Part of the arisen debate around the represented case goes back, that a team of the soccer club played real Madrid (that sets noble-mindedness and honor in his hymn and had punished his players on other occasions for similar incidents) in this case the title role, and onto the dramatization through Mourinho that more added an episode to his long history as a theatrical and provoking technician. 
That is in Any Case the debate turns around whether this behavior not forbidden expressly from the statutes contradicts the principles of the sport, whether these actions represent a rule avoidance. In fact this approach sticks to the statutes of the sport, to seem to avoid his sense, however. 
With this matter the damage caused to the sport spirit should be examined. 
The sport spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect which was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game. 
A further aspect of a clean game consists in avoiding that the contravening players draw an unjustified benefit from the Gegenteam. Also that did not happen. 
The paradoxical thing of the action of the players of the real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we usually mean by wrong game or rule avoidance, because the avoidance of the rule was not carried out secret in order to avoid a sanction but it should be as striking as possible so that she is punished by the referee. 
The players waited and accepted the sanction gladly. 
Another question is which kind from advantage the contravening ones drew from the deliberate fouls. 
Here should be emphasized, that neither the rival was not brought into a more detrimental situation still advantages for the played game were demanded, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to play with less players. 
It is not also a useful strategy for the next game, because the club is not in charge of these players then. 
The advantage consists obviously, that the players begin the next game phase of the champions League without cards that their participation in a future game could threaten. 
But it is a question of a long-term one, to advantage uncertain to a certain degree, since the team could also drop out sometime. In addition the players with this approach receive a sanction and change into the second card cycle in which they drop out because of card accumulation with a card less than in the first cycle. 
In this way it is not so clear whether it is really a question of an advantage. 
Finally direct such approaches not against the sport spirit which also strategic decisions appertain to in order to draw a maximum benefit from the rules. 
In This Case the players did not want to avoid any sanction (that would be in fact an unequivocal case of rule avoidance), they rather wanted to choose, when they subject themselves to this. 
You made a strategic decision without evading a punishment or fleeing from it. 
Although the border is blurred between inventiveness and rule surroundings, I believe that it deals itself with inventiveness with this matter around a clear case. 
I have the impression that the polemic arose due to two factors: Because it was a question of two selfexclusions and because of the kind of the intentional rule transfer. 
The damage that was added to the principles of the sport by these actions is less ethical as rather aesthetic kind.
