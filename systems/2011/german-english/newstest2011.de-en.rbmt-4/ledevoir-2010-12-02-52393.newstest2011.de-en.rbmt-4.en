State loan for the takeover of eXcentris 
The Quebecer government that was asked to participate in the takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris financially by the Société Angus as well as the enterprise Parallèle declares itself with a cooperation understood, however, only in shape a competitive loan. 
The developer society Angus as well as the enterprise Parallèle that eXcentris had hoped for a donation of cinema complex belonging from the Ministry of Education at the level of seven million dollars for the takeover of the Daniel Langlois on the boulevard Saint-Laurent around this again his actual cineastischen function überantworten, do not receive apparently, which they demanded. 
The government accepted indeed to involve oneself, however, in this thing for their own conditions. 
Instead of the expected donation offers the Quebecer government rather a loan in smaller than the height initially hoped for that could start up a viable solution to useful conditions at least in opinion of the sources entnehmbaren from the state rumor kitchen. 
A first plan as well as an inquiry for 12,8 million were rejected already last spring by the Quebec, the petition was corrected since that renewed sum-moderately down. 
Was sent already onto minister St-Pierre that leads the acts eXcentris a proposal together with a plan from the president of the "Société de développement of the entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola. 
Several days ago he had made a last feature be attributed their. 
The counterproposal of the cabinet was sent to the SODEC, however, on Wednesday. 
Parallèle and Angus answered now this up to the 31st December. 
Anyway the premise of the state donation seems to really have been pushed to the page. 
We call ourselves into memory, that the Quebecer owner community of the cinemas and cinema complexes had revolted against a direct state investment to the support of the takeover of eXcentris when she put forward the argument, the cult minister does not have to give any financial help for immovable projects there, that it has been able to receive cinema halls not also other. 
Several other market participants of the segment demanded, however, in contrast substantial, economical help. 
Cinema leader Daniel Langlois had presented the author cinema to the construction of the cinema in an own way financed for more than ten years under great difficulties in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exception position on the part of the treasury. 
The lack of cinema halls which show independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to hold his clientele near the pole. 
The Société Angus as well as the enterprise Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top of, head for her part for a privately financed Campagne, of which they a sum 700 000 $ to hope in order to stimulate the acquisition. 
Since the spring 2009 only a single canvas leaves with showing films in eXcentris Le Parallèle indeed. 
Objective of the future acquirers is it, the three cinema halls at the 27 February of next year with the demonstration of the very succeeded film of Xavier Beauvois Of "the hommes et the dieux" to open again. 
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not recall the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what it and his group of the down corrected proposals which one made them hold.
