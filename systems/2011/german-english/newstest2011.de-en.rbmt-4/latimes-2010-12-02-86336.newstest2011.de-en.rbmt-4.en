The lion roars again according to judicial permission of the MGM-restructuring 
According to 18-month long turbulences and insecurities MGM got now at last green light for a new start. 
A New-Yorker bankruptcy judge blessed on Thursday that one offiziel Gläuberplan "prepares" off, around which to pay off debts at the level of $5 Mrd and to smooth the way for the 86-year long conversation enterprise for new films and variety shows. 
According to the statements of the Thursday the plan meets the requirements of the US bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the management of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass entertainment, nothing more in the way stands. Barber and pear tree will protrude to the studio a little slimmed down as main managers. 
The employee number is lowered by more than 400 on approx. 320. 
For MGM Chapter 11 comes into force first in fact if JPMorgan Chase has finished a planned loan of $500 Mio for the financing of the new MGM-productions. 
At the moment a consortium of the investment bank which brings in even $75 Mio, the enterprise, leads. The financing is supposed to stand until middle December. 
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the task onto the investment bank Mölis & Co to help the management which fought with interest payments at the level of $300 Mio/year at the solution of their financial problems. 
In August the manager Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO with Enron and restructuring expert that became known through his activity with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts. 
The efforts of Mölis & Cooper to solve the finance worries MGMs and to pay out the more than 140 Gläuber of the studio lasted longer than expects. 
After discussions lasting for months the parties decided at the end of 2009 on offering the enterprise for the purchase. 
Nevertheless the auction attracted only few bidders and Mrd did not want to pay any the $2 demanded by the believers. 
In the spring this year's all of front began, than the MGM team began with the redesign plan that was signed by the believers after debates lasting for months and internal quarrels at the end of October at last. 
If MGM has survived the bankruptcy officially in the next weeks, Mölis and Cooper for their work receive a bonus at the level of several millions of dollars. 
The part for Mölis & Co., that already kept $1,2 for Mio, amounts to $9,5 Mio. 
Co-opera, to whom for the management of the enterprise $375.000 was paid monthly, Mio receive a "success bonus" of $4. 
Barber and pear tree to intend to resume the production at MGM. This year the studio brought out only a film and created a year plan with seven or eight films that are supposed to come into the cinemas at the beginning of 2012. 
Further they plan two films after "The small Hobbit" in co-production with warner Bros. 
The studio needs for this purpose a separate loan for his financial part of these two films which are supposed to arise under the direction of Peter Jackson between $265 Mio to $275 Mio. 
The investor Carl Icahn that financed approx. 18% of the MGM loan attempted a fusion of the studio with Lions gate entertainment whose tallest stockholder he is. 
Nevertheless the last negotiations between the two enterprises did not lead to any result.
