The internet-activists had accessed to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) during the publication of the secret diplomatic dispatches in order to be able to overcome the high access numbers onto the documents. 
By Twitter Wikileaks kept on declaring as the step: "Excellently - our dollars are spent now in order to be preoccupied people with in Europe." 
If Amazon has such problem with the freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books." 
Amazon stopped the use of his servers through Wikileaks, after employee of senator Joe Lieberman Nachforschungen would have started, the television broadcast station told CNN under appointment on the office Liebermans.
