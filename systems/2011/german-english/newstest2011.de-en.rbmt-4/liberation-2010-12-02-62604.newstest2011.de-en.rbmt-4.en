Climate: how France talks his finance promises beautifully 
A year according to the Copenhagen contract is it time, the compliance of the quickly solved financing promises (also "Almost start or mentioned too early financings) " examine, that were realized by the developing countries. 
And already the coarse French beautiful chatter is uncovered. 
With the Copenhagen contract the developing countries committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars in between 2010 and 2012. 
The EU promised 7,2 billion euros over three years, France 1,26 billion euros (that is 420 million per annum). 
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16 the EU drew all registers in order to convince their partners of the fact of their engagement concerning the fasting-start-financings: detail-true procedure report of their member states, press conference, great secondary events, brochure distribution. 
The operation transparency is estimated remarkably and currently for their actual value: the developing countries and the civil society would see gladly if all developed countries did the same one on the same precision level. 
The EU announces to have released 2,2 billion euros in the year of 2010, which gets her onto the correct way to the Respektbezollung of their engagement from 7,2 billion in the year 2012. 
If one, however, looks into the detail, the things are a little bit more complicated. 
This money should be "new and additional" according to the Copenhagen contract in order to guarantee that an additional use was brought in without gereichen to the detriment of the Public Development Aid. 
Unfortunately there is not any consensus over what "again and besides" means. 
While the EU commission had been suggesting a harmonization, certain member states have, under that France, the procedure jams. 
Today everyone chooses the standard value which he takes as best. 
The EU commission has itself for example as a standard value for that one of the year 2009 chosen: keep to becoming the international financings, and contributes within the framework of the financing "Fasting-start" above for three years 150 million. 
Other countries chose similar standard values either with regard to year or concerning conditions on level of the public development aid. 
In the corresponding train for this purpose France thought the financings of "all new projects" of the year 2010 are "new and additional." 
Differently squeezed out: There are not any standard values with the editions of the preceded year or on global level of the public development aid. 
Actually said the total amount of the French support of the developing countries can remain stable (or also to lose weight) - France pretends to keep to his obligation with regard to the "new and additional" financings. 
An other, decisive element is the breakdown in donations and loans. 
Yet no rule dominates that, and everyone chooses his rake mode. 
Unites, as for example France, 1 lent € as equivalent with 1 donated € are. 
Obviously this is only hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable. 
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (projects often tied to the emission embankment that are based on most effective technology) can be justified, it is treacherous to present the euro that one vereinnahmt as an equivalent for a donated euro... Furthermore only the costs of the loan should be charged as engagement for the investor country (that is the equivalent of an interest rate). 
But France does not have anything differently in the sense as the following consideration: his obligation "respects" it of 420 million euros, when it incorporates 91,5% of loan (389,8 million euros) and he donates 8,5%) 36,1 million euros) - see also the EU document, in order to convince oneself even of that. 
France is the only one land the EU that loan starts in great measure. 
Germany demands 46%, during Denmark, that Netherlands or to follow Slovakia (among other things) to their obligations to 100% with donations. 
Differently said if the predominant majority of the European Union 1€ for the fulfillment of their obligations distributes France just gives 10 cents once and means by that a comparable use. 
Beautiful hocus-pocus! 
All in all France operates in his fasting-start-financing with a double giddiness: to a part with a Weiterentwicklkung of the action about the time and to the other part with the reality of the financial use. 
France succeeds in making believe that it has distributed 420 million "new and additional" millions in agreement with his promises and saves in this case 36,1 million euros. 
The manipulation of the Exchequer could involve (since it presumably seems that it was Bercy that carried out the arbitrage) a twice negative effect; once EU internal (why the other member states leave with the donating if nevertheless it suffices to lend?) and then in the negotiations not completely deceive the developing countries there make... 
The chapter of the too early financings only a small question onto relatively short time in comparison with the entirety at discussions about the climate. 
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC. 
Let's hope for this not being the case. 
As is to that ever, it is indispensable to learn his lesson of financings anticipated from this first year. 
In the First Place France could announce a change in his posting kind for the years 2011 and 2012, and in the spirit indeed the respect's for his obligations and the balancing justice's with the other countries of the European Union. 
Particularly, however, France could bring the discussions forward about the quarrel object of the long-term financings (an other, decisive and currently discussed topic): one does not escape the question of the "Verrechenbarkeit" or the posting kind of his loans. 
France could change his position in order to be just as advanced with regard to the disputes as it is that near other things. 
The hope is based therefore on the new environmental minister Kosciusko-Morizet that will arrive next week in Cancun. 
A surprising announcement about the fasting-start of France and his vision of the "Verrechenbarkeit" as well as the use of loans would raise by nature the international confidence basis which is necessary for weiterführende discussions.
