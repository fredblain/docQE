Two training airplanes L-159 for the first time in foreign hand - in Spain 
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 of in total five that the Czech Ministry of Defense exchanged for the airliner Casa C-295M flew on Tuesday into the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish airplane manufacturer Casa - EADS settles. 
It is the first time that there are machines of this type in possession of a foreign army. 
Abroad they were to be seen up to now only with maneuvers or flight shows. 
It is a question at that of the airworthy two-seater version L-159T1 which was practiced by the Czech army. 
The remaining three airplanes are single-seated L-159. 
These stand currently still conserved in the Äro Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the company Omnipol - it took over last week. 
When they the airplanes physical from Vodochody expediert, Jan Pejsek is, not confessed according to the speaker of the Ministry of Defense yet. 
The single-seated fighter aircraft L-159 were removed in turn from on a long-term basis intercalary airplanes and this without further insertions and investments on the part of the department of the ministry. 
"The doppelsitzigen L-159T1 were exchanged in present state and appearance," said Pejsek of the newspaper Právo. 
He added, the army will not have to manage without zweisitzige fighter aircraft, signed there the Ministry of Defense in May 2009 with Äro Vodochody a 200-million-contract above the reconstruction from four superfluous L-159 for the zweisitzigen version. 
A new airplane took over the army in July, the second wants to take it over until end of this year. 
According to Pejsek EADS committed itself to putting through the fighter aircraft into the outfit of one of the NATO-countries. 
"In the contract it is klipp and clearly mentioned that the enterprise EADS is customer of the airplanes L-159 and that these are supposed to be used for the training of pilots of the NATO-countries. 
"It is therefore a thing of the customer in which way he realizes the thing," mentioned Pejsek. 
The economic newspaper (HN) reported vordem, that the Spanish government does not have any interest in the L-159. 
The barter of five L-159 against an airliner Casa and the purchase of further airplanes for 3,5 billion crowns had still been approved of in the last year by the government from Mirek Topolánek. 
The Ministry of Defense had not written out then any announcement procedure for the purchase, but that spoke TO EADS directly. 
The former defense office argued, this exchange will support the future export of the L-159 abroad. 
The Czech army bought Äro from 72 machines from which she uses only 24, she wanted to dispose of the rest. 
The purchase of the airplanes Casa might have after all also still a judicial consequence. 
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defense indeed at the European Court of Justice. The reason? The airplanes due to a whole-European announcement would have had to select it and by no means through addressing of an only manufacturer. 
The army took over already three airplanes Casa, the last one is supposed to land within fourteen days on the Airport Kbely.
