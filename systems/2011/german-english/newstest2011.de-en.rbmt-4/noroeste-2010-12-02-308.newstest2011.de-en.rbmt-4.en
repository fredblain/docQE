The NASA announces the find of extraterrestrial life 
The North American space travel agency called a press conference, around tomorrow a find vorzustelle, the effects' on the search for living beings in the space will have. 
The National air and space travel authority (NASA) of the United States gives tomorrow, Thursday, confessed an astrobiologische discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life. 
The find is presented by experts of the Astrobiologie tomorrow at 13.00 o'clock on a press conference in the seat of the NASA in Washington. In this case it is a question of a science which examines the origin, the development, the distribution and the future of lives in the universe. 
The NASA insured with calling of the press conference, she will present "a supervision-exciting find for the search for extraterrestrial living," which activated speculations with experts of other countries. 
The discovery could prove the theory, that to be able to exist it in hostile surroundings that one held for unbwohnbar up to now like a human being creatures. The hypothesis was raised, that these could change into intelligent living beings - so as people - if their living conditions improved. 
Apparently it is a question of a microbe which was found on the reason of the mono brine in the Yosemite national park, California. It lives there in some surroundings which was held for too poisonous for all imaginable ways of life since the lake is strongly arsenic-containing. 
The Mikrobie puts the arsenic into some kind as a survival resource. Considering this ability the chances that there could be similar life on other planets that do not have our protecting atmosphere increase themselves. 
When these organisms the arsenic verstoffwechseln, is according to the Astrobiologen proved, that "it actual another way of life, a second way of life to distinguish from the one known to us gives." 
The space travel agency announces tomorrow, on Thursday, the actual range of their find on the press conference. 
At the conference take the Geobiologin Pamela Conrad teil, that examines the possibility of lives on the Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, that titanium (the biggest moon of Saturn) under the question formulation, whether his chemical composition resembles that of the earth, studied.
