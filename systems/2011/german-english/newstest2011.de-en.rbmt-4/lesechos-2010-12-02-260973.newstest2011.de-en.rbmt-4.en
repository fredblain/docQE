Euro: the EZB is forced to retain their purchases of state papers 
The last meeting of the central bank council of the EZB in the last year should offer occasion to show possibilities, as one from the crisis comes out, or to announce at least the order of a great number at unconventional measures of the monetary policy that is supposed to come at the end of the year to their end. 
The crisis of the European state indebtedness engages, the central bank in Frankfurt can not afford it undoubtedly, in order not to cause their aggravation, also the present, more than strained situation on the European loan markets too verwirken. 
The political costs in this case would be by far too high. 
The French finance minister Christine Lagarde had welcomed yesterday the role taken by the EZB, active on the occasion of a press conference for the benefit of the solution of the national budget indebtedness of Europe. 
She did not dare to say, whether she thinks the central bank can do still more for example through boost of their program of the purchases of state loans. 
"I keep my considerations for my European trading partners before (...) ." 
Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the EZB had not shown himself very volubly on day before in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing through the economic and currency sow shot of the European parliament concerning his intentions, but had rather been satisfied, to refer to that, that the program of the purchases of state papers on the secondary market "would be practiced" and that we "will see" with the meeting on Thursday, "as the decisions turn out." 
Only certainty: The EZB will leave their leading-interest at 1% as before, the historically lowest level since May 2009. 
In the practice the obligation purchases of the treasury were doubled by the EZB last week on about 1,35 billion euros. 
And according to indiscretions of some traders she is supposed to have made yesterday new purchases at Irish and Portuguese state papers. 
In total the central banks of the euro system since May carried out 2010 purchases at the level of 67 billion euros. 
Among the traders the Antizipation of a follow-up of the buying rate is not doubted under any circumstances (see page 29). 
The economists do not expect already any remarkable course change anymore. 
If the loan businesses will already have disappeared from more than three months from the arsenal of the EZB, does latter still to get in free way at the unlimited resource reserves, and indeed over a period of a week up to three months. 
The economists already set themselves off grabbedly today on that that this measure will still spread around some months. 
"I can not imagine that the EZB will change their program in essential way." 
"Otherwise she would accept the risk, to provoke new tensions in the short term," so Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank, presumes. 
"An exit planned for the course of the first quarter 2011, progressive seems more probable to me," Norbert Bräms, economist, anticipates for his part at Sal. 
Oppenheim. 
In the field of their interventions on the market of the state indebtedness "the EZB should maintain such purchase volume at obligations that stimulates the sluggish market," Norbert Bräms adds. 
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of the European banks on the markets of the state indebtedness in the euro zone the central bank does not have any other choice than to retain their presence on the market. 
"It must go for every price onto the Steller of the lacking investors on the market and act in such a way in order to prevent the rash enthusiasm about the net yields paid to the weakest states," testified an important obligation holder yesterday. 
Because when the interest rates prepare for the high-altitude flight, the states would be hindered that still more, to reduce their indebtedness or only also to stabilize. 
This is the price to the protection of the euro.
