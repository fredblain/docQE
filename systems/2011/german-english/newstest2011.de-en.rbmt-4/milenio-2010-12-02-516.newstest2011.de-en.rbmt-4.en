Rubén Omar Romano looks back upon three defeats in finals, he has on the and Abs in his career experiences, but three times he had decisive games, and up to now it held itself well, for which this occasion of very special importance for it is. 
The Argentine blew up with the medal to the second champion, he fell behind the winners a step and strange to say he delivered with the same team consecutive finals. 
The santistische strategist achieved the first final as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when del Morelia with which he found out a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2 had the reins in the hand; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' it achieved the decisive duel that he lost to Rayados also with 3-1. 
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010' at which they played against Los Diablos Rubén had to put in a setback again since the game with 2-2 ended undecidedly against Los Choriceros after 210 game minutes, however, during the penalty it got on with 3-1 and got two possibilities to put in his title, however, ultimately three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to one 4-3. 
Rubén had lost already two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his tall rival. Therefore he would not like yet to be followed once from the misfortune and to free from the bad charm in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time although he confirms that for it the most important thing is the game itself. 
The helmsman commented, "I would like to become champion, I would not like to break any statistics, that is for a club, for my affection which I devote myself to, and therefore the title to me will come, but what happens before, is the most important thing," when one questions it about the lost finals. 
He had the last final still strongly in the memory, he assures to have learned a lot from that: "The only lesson that we can draw from that is, that until the referee does not whistle the end, we can not celebrate, we are not at the line prepared, the players also, because we were already the last time with two penalties it prepares for that to drop out, and I believe that that is a lesson until the game is not ended, there is not any reason to the celebrating." 
Knowing that this series could be decided on by penalty-firing does not worry him, because he trusts in his players: "One never during the penalty-firing wants to arrive, one would like to close in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is not any alternative and one must be prepared for that, above tour were we prepares, however unfortunately the fate prepared a bad game for us, sometimes due to nervousness or the vehement aim to hold the title already in the hands that left something to us for this final, and we hope for its not resulting in that this time." 
It suits in Romanso Macht not to be only a second champion anymore and to taste the fame that the titles with themselves bring for the first time.
