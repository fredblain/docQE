Threatening-gestures of the European central bank (EZB) 
The investors reacted yesterday sharply to the threat of the EZB president Trichet that warned, "our capability of reacting should not underestimate the markets." 
The risk impacts of the Euro-Peripheriländer increased dramatic and the stocks of the European banks around more than 5%. 
Nevertheless we should not underestimate the possibility that the EZB can deceive herself and the euro hardly increased points, which leads to the worry. 
The events of yesterday are typical for a frozen market, that in the measure, in which it collapses again recovered, however due to the closing of short and highly speculative positions. 
The institutional investor will long yet not lose his fear. 
Today a month ago the European Central Bank asked us to cancel our Liquiditätmsassnahmen after what that EZB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably still many must do Male in the future, a moving-snag. 
The Federal Reserve demanded the ending of the plan for the purchase of national debts since these are ineffective as well as the cancellation of all extraordinary limited liquidity measures. Only a one week long unlimited access is supposed to be retained. 
After the Ireland crisis we expect, that the present liquidity measures "at least extends "until March" and the quarterly announcements with unlimited access at the quarter end to the guarantee of the liquidity until at least June will retain. 
We also expect, that the program to the purchase of obligations continued and will distribute a strengthening signal. 
If the created expectations are not met, is reverberated the excellent reaction of the markets of yesterday again and if halstarrig that is insisted on, that we to take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us! 
In the same way as not to take the purchase of state fault papers into account during the EZB meeting in May in the case of which the bank confirmed and collapsed the markets then, this history could be repeated tomorrow. 
The EZB must be credible and persistent. 
In May it showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said to have bought already a lot with which it provoked a new breakdown of the market. 
Yesterday the auction of one year long state titles was quite weak in Portugal. 
The state property administration distributed only 500 million to 5,28%, opposite 750 million to 4,81% in the preceding auction. 
In spite of that the interest rates fell into Portugal around 30 base points in the entire curve and reflected in this way a perception change of the markets according to the words Trichets. 
In Ireland the numbers of the fault hole were published by Allied and Bank of Irish country. 
The sum becomes at short notice on about 10 000 million and possible wider 15 000 estimated. There is time until February, in order to get private capital or to become these banks nationalizes. 
Although Ireland completely lost his plausibility after the problem with the stress tests had not recognized it in July, the numbers are acceptable within the framework of the rescue plan and help with reducing the uncertainty. 
However, the government must receive on the coming Tuesday the parliamentary approval for his new budget. Since it does not have the sufficient support yet, Ireland is also furthermore sources of the uncertainty. 
Angela Merkel formed their discourse with regard to the peak of the heads of state and the government on 14th December moderater. There is political unit in demand in order to show that we play together the the same score. 
The problem is, that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethovens. 
The Spanish government president presented yesterday the measure plan which is supposed to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday. 
Pension reform, transparency in the Autonomous regions as at the finance institutes, disassembly of the state deficit, liberalization, denationalization and work procurement measures. Measures which ring in the ears of the investors as Vivaldis Four Seasons. 
The double effect explained to Zapatero and Trichet why the Spanish stock exchange put on about 4,5 percent doppelt so viel as the rest of the European stock exchanges. 
In the comparison to February the reaction was fast and convincing to the government and to the Spanish central bank, and we profit by the surprise effect. 
Today there is a leading auction of a three year long state loan which will profit from the Trichet-effect. Therefore we back on a strong demand which will remove all doubts about our debt rescheduling ability. 
For Spain the ordering of an auxiliary plan would be a self-sacrifice. 
We would receive liquidity which we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros availably, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and the access to the markets would be locked without notice. 
In spite of that woman should correspond to the motto of Caesar our strategy: "Now not only the existence, but also the appearance counts." 
Only courage we create that!
