The architects saw - to the office also a kindergarten belongs 
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of the enterprise Arch.Design. 
But who would expect here already a minikindergarten, with everything something for this purpose belonged: colorful walls, creative furniture, an amount toy and even a miniplayground on the exterior terrace. 
This kindergarten is available since last year to the employees of Arch.Design. 
Avriopoint charged the project planning and architecture office Arch.Design whose studios a whole series of constructions in a more of repute way Br√ºnner come from from the first drafts for the new building with the premises for his company mini kindergarten. 
In wise foresight, because most of his 90 employees (inside) are in the baby boom age and it suited to the company at that that the Projektantinnen and architects return as quickly as possibly onto their job. 
Together with the possibility, it shortens to work, the kindergarten is a further bonus that Arch.Design has to offer to his employees in the draft of their social program. 
The construction engineer and architect have it so more easily to bring their pretentious profession and the child welfare under a hat. 
The minikindergarten is an initial idea of the employees (inside) of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they succeeded in extracting supporting-money of the European Union and the ministry for work and social one for their project. 
The company internal minikindergarten is financed to humane resources and to employment politics from means of the European Social Ground and from the state budget through the operation program to the Czech Republic. 
Thanks to this financing (Subsidies at the level of 2 8 million CZK) the necessary facilities and the equipment could be gotten and for the duration of 2 years is worried for qualified personnel and for the company. 
According to the exhaustion of the promotion means (2 years) the society Arch.Design is obliged to keep on practicing the minikindergarten 3 more years onto own costs. 
The preparation of this project used a whole year at which the society Economy Rating gave active help during the request handling. 
Of the children takes care whole-active qualified personnel - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, children without age-moderate restrictions can go to the kindergarten although most of them are more than three years old. 
And since it is a question of a mini-kindergarten at that, only 5 children may be simultaneously present, change, however, the day over several children mutually off. 
The kindergarten company is synchronized with the need of the parents flexible, the children of all employees have the same rights with respect to the use of the kindergarten - without regard for the company hierarchy and their respective position. 
Although it is a question of individual education and care, nevertheless the program contents are comparable in the mini-kindergarten with the general-purpose program of the preschool education. 
The children do only not play here, particularly excellent instruction is offered to them - of basic findings up to the preschool instruction, incidentally they also still learn English. 
The classroom is endowed not only with toy and creative games, but also with a computer which is available to the children. 
Which more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment. 
The parents can fling at any time a look onto the children and so the stress is dropped while fetching late the children from a far remote kindergarten. 
The parents use therefore their working time more productively. 
No miracle, that also natural and loyal employer Arbeitnehmer-Beziehungen develop here. 
Arch.Design joined so under the Czech companies that offer clear Benefits with the recruitment of new employees that are family-friendly and confirm their personnel-marketing through such programs.
