Khmer rouge forced to veterans for the confrontation with the past 
In a weakly illuminated, concreted classroom with walls dirty and flaking off, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds leaders Ta of the man that uplifted it at the later Khmers Rouge Mok. 
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok." 
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years. 
Confessed because of his brutality during Khmer Rouge domination as "the butcher," the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in the north-west of Cambodia, where it hospitals and bridges built, which developed infrastructure and where thousands' of former soldiers still always live. 
Nevertheless this year, of 12 years according to the capitulation of the Khmers Rouge opposite the government, long-standing supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng. 
In April a local truth and conciliation forum allowed the victims the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime. 
In June the government distributed a school book which for the first time the history of Khmers Rouge tells to children of former soldiers. 
And in July a community tribunal of the UNO and Cambodia condemned for the first time a former member of Khmers Rouge, than it the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng Folterkammer, Kaing Khek Iev, better known than Duch, to 35 years of prison condemned. 
With each of these developments the fear increased to veterans Alnlong Vengs under Khmer Rouge, complicated their endeavours towards conciliation and re-integration into the society of Cambodia. 
"There are still refusal and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they do not have any power to do something," said Chhang Youk, conductor of the documentation center of Cambodia, an independent organization that investigates the regime. 
"For them the life was glorious under Khmer Rouge, but the regime became a symbol of the evil." 
"It divides up even families." 
During the Khmer rouge domination in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1,7 million people were exekutiert or they died of illnesses, reworking or for hunger. 
When the Vietnamese came in and in 1979 those ones flung pole Pot-Ied Regierung, the remains of the regime and his military fled onto the border of Cambodia according to Thailand. 
Here they spread noise until December 1998 when the last movement capitulated. 
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their basis in the west of the mountains and jungles from Cambodia, Ta Mok drew the next generation in Anlong Veng. 
However in the middle of the 1990th years, when led a peace agreement supported through the UNO in 1993 to the first democratic choices of the country, great groups of Khmer Rouge Fighters began to overflow to the government, which led to the capitulations from Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998. 
Pol Pot died in 1998 a natural death's, and Ta Mok that had not given in was arrested in 1999 of government strengths with the Dangrek Mountains. 
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he waited for his process. 
When their patrons did not protect her longer more, most former Khmers fled rouge fighter into the zermürbende poverty of the rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory. 
Also when of a few kept elitist official of Khmers Rouge their local government posts because they laid down their arms the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers. 
"These people profited only very much little by the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the center for justice and conciliation which holds public forums in whole Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng 
"You are anchored into the utopian Agrarideologie of the regime." 
"You grew up without any professional knowledge." 
Sor Lim, of 55 years, who had connected himself in 1974 as teenagers of the Rhmer Rouge, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he sat down in 1998 in order to lead a life as a poor rice farmer. 
"The life under Khmer Rouge was good," he said. 
"Eating something gave everyone Ta Mok." 
"However now the life is difficult because we must take care of ourselves ourselves." 
The walking Khmer rouge tribunal called worries also here in an awake way. 
At the beginning of next year that attempts court's, Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to put in court. 
It is the task of the court to condemn the old leaders and those ones that are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further actions beyond these four cases. 
That helped little to moderate the fears in Anlong Veng. 
Current media speculations are had on In the Chaem, 64 year, concentrated, which during the Khmer rouge domination in the late 1970th years district leader had been in the province Manteay Meanchey. 
In 2007 she had told to representatives of the documentation center of Cambodia it led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms a project, at the thousand of mandatory workers presumable died. 
At a hot evening came back In the Chaem from the work to the fields to their wooden house at a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng. 
When the sun flung long shadows onto the verdorrte grass In the Chaem it leaned, to discuss about their past with Khmer Rouge. 
If the court should summons her, she would refuse so to go, she said. 
"Cambodia lives in peace and in stability," she said. 
If "there were not any pursuits anymore, war would be here." 
Prime minister Hun Sen in addition repeated that fled in 1878 of Khmer Rouge warned against the situation becoming unsure the court would accuse more suspects although experts and historians discuss this. 
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said. 
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia must do in order to be able to go forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center. 
"Conciliation with the Khmer-times means collating of the broken pieces," he said. 
It is our duty so to set these broken parts together that as everything can understand." 
The center created the first school book approved by the government about Khmer Rouge, the 75-sided "history of the Democratic Cambodia." 
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the history book for the High School of the education ministry which contains less than four pages about Khmers Rouge. 
To know as often in Cambodia the young people in Anlong Veng only little about the Khmers Rouge, in spite of the connections of the city to the regime. 
Understanding an important part of their history said to Touch Valeak, of 19 years, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, that the new school book helps the students. 
But his parents reacted sceptically, in order to read it, than it the book with home brought. 
"My family leans many parts of the book and the court off," he said. 
"You are mistrustful because they are not sure as many people are condemned by the court." 
Such resistance does the conciliation process in a complex way and complicatedly, said Sok Leang. 
He said "To attain the public forums, the school book and the court, however, after and after influence." 
Still Khmer Rouge has a powerful attraction here. 
Above in the Dangrek Bergen a way überwucherter from shrubs and dirtied with plastic garbage leads to a rectangle from black soot, covered with a rusty sheet roof. 
Pol Pots body had been burned here after his death 1998 on a tire heap. 
Nuom Sothea, of 31 years, a mobile vendor at the street edge, said she does not know much about the man who had been burned here. 
"Aber he went a strong spirit and many people here to it in order to pray," she said. 
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later on day it wanted to go to Pol Pots last resting-place, where she will lay down a bush of ripe bananas - in the hope that it brings their luck.
