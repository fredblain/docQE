Tech Toys holds your present budget in the balance 
The this year's favorite among the presents is the iPad, possibly followed from a Microsoft Kinect Videokonsole. Both games can tear a considerable hole into your present budget. 
An iPad tastes so much as five BMX wheels for $99, during the price for a Kinect game about 10 classical jumping-ropes or approx. 48 cans Play-Doh corresponds. 
But you can protect your present budget. 
Recently I visited three national toy traders in search of three electronics toys under $80 - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Of Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club. 
I realized immediately that Moores law had come into force. This year the technology toys are more efficient and cost simultaneously a little less than in the last year. 
And although less new toys with own web page appear, a wider offer is found on the best known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin. 
Comes more and more button cell-practiced toys onto the market, and many contain wiederaufladbare accumulators. 
Here unites recommendations. 
(If not different indicated, all prices of Toys are "R" Us.) 
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are plush figures, as big as guinea pigs that sing a note if one presses onto their stomach. 
To press once corresponds to a note, through repeated pressing one can play a song. 
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony. 
Respect: If you have begun with the pressing once, you can not stop anymore. 
For a combination of Gesand and dance the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice. 
On basis of the Elmo Live-Technologie developed in the last year the animatronische doll offers interplay as 'Simon says', and thanks to the novel hinge feet with wheel blocking it dominates the Moon-Walk. 
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. Your parents complained, however, about the missing volume control. 
If you are a child of the eighties, you remember certainly Alphie, one of the first computerized learning-toys. 
Now it is again there (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole heap question cards, with which a drive can become a lesson, with a smart aleck with selfcorrection function as teachers. 
If you did not like to entrust your child Ihr Smartphone gladly, three independent alternatives are here. 
The cheapest and most user-friendly solution is, equipped with a qwerty-Tastatur, to MobiGo of VTech ($60 for children of 3 to 8). The games contained on that are not, however, as informative as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children of 3 to 12) who is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrogs of first great reworking of the Leapster-row are. 
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes. 
iXL of Fisher-Price ($90 for children of 3 to 7) uses a system for the games and eBooks similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD card disk drive also family photos on that can be looked. 
In the End there is still Scrabble Flash ($30 of Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not bigger than a matchbox is and have an own LED-screen. 
During the game it is a question of putting together the blocks to word before the time elapses. It is suitable for an improvised spelling-competition splendidly. 
To have toys more and more a kind online connection. 
If one goes only to the offer in the toy shops, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important. 
In order to give your child an online animal in the club Penguin, you can "e.g. a Disney Club Penguin 2" 'to buy' Mix 'N match figure parcel ($5 for children of 6 to 12) that contains a coin with a hidden code. 
If you enter the code Online, your child receives Penguin Store of sufficient Credits in the club for two more parts. 
Those ones can be roller skates or a Puffle soft toy animal. 
The newest head cell-practiced microrobots, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not larger than the head of your toothbrush is. 
The beetle moves quickly in every arbitrary direction on 12 vibrating silicone legs. 
It does fun, to send it through a maze from chunks. 
And it resists some. 
Ours fell from the kitchen table and survived even some time in the mouth of our dog.
