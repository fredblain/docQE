Moscow portrays seeped US document as a harbor of the corruption 
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "Kleptokratie" and she passes on a part of the bribes and the protection money which she collects to the Kremlin. So the American message told in February in Russia in a Memo. 
Both police and the Staatssicherheitsdienst extort high protection money so so that they can hold their expensive standard of living in Moscow it is said. 
You collect money not only of legitimized businesses, but also of organized criminal bands. 
Every shift of the bureaucracy - what prime minister Vladimir Putin referred to as "A perpendicular of the authority" - takes his part of the money that the ladder moves up. 
The Memo which was sent to Washington under the name of the ambassador John Beyrle was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his home page. 
The Memo is based on sources whose names were revised. 
It was written, during Yuri Luzhkov Moscow's mayor was still, and accuses him of the corruption. 
It was fired in October by president Dmitry Medvedev, however, there is not hardly a proof of people having tidied up in the meantime. 
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a known building firm, rejected corruption reproaches again and again over years, and he won numerous slander complaints against such accusations. 
In September it declared a Russian television broadcast station it is corrupt when he was asked for a documentation which suggests: "It is mad, it is dirty, it is dirty." 
> An incredibly great number at Russians believe, that their society is corrupt. Inquiries showed that. 
But it is unusual that, happened as in the report of the ambassador, single persons are named, and it is unheard that this happens through a diplomat of a foreign country. 
"The direct connection of the government of Moscow with the criminality it resulted for this purpose in the government rather acting as a Kleptokrat that some designate it as "faulty" and come to the conclusion than a government," according to the Memo. 
"Criminal elements enjoy one "kryshna" (a concept from the world the criminals / the Mafia, what in a word for word way means "roof" or protection), that above the police, the state security (FSB), the service inspectorate (MVD) and the office of the public prosecutor just as extended as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy. 
Experts discovered a three-layered structure within the criminal world of Moscow. 
"Luzhkov stands at uppermost place." 
"FSB, MVD and the militia stand on the second stage." 
"Last the vulgar criminals and the criminal inspectors on the lowest stage follow." 
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some fields because the city does not offer any help." 
The report passes on, that the FSB money of the biggest companies takes the money and that the police arrests small businessmen. 
A source, so is called, "declared that Moscow's proprietors understand that it is best to get the protection of the MVD and FSB (and not of the organized crime) since they have not only more arms, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected through the law." 
"For this reason the protection is through criminal walk's no more as in demand as formerly." 
The Memo notices, that, while the compiling of the money is being comprehensive, to be the protection itself very modest no; even the ones who pay are arrested sometimes. 
Those that do not pay find their business very quickly closedly - due to the one or other pretext's. 
Medvedev talked repeatedly about opposing the corruption, said, however, simultaneously that it did only little progress. 
The Memo of the message contains descriptions of men, that go with with suitcases that were presumably full of money into the Kremlin. 
"In his fight against the corruption Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of when, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview. 
"But he is a part of this bureaucracy." 
"It is not a part of the political class because a political class does not exist in Russia anymore." 
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of the powers, so he says, corruption is inevitable. 
National, so estimates when, the corruption Russia costs more than $ 300 billion per annum. 
The country shunts on place through the nonstate organization Transparence International in 154 of a newer investigation for the global perception of the corruption (countries are performed of "the least corruptly" too "the most corruptly"). 
The disclosure of the Memos of the American message that happened after Moscow time late in the evening will activate disgust with security within the Russian government, although it can be also a possibility since Luzhkov can be accused for the errors of Moscow for the Kremlin to say that one solves the problems. 
Claimed in an interview with Larry King for CNN Putin, that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and reacted furiously to the disclosure, that American diplomats mentioned it Batman and Medvedev Robin. 
"The truth is that it is" a question "of our communication which is an important factor of the inside politics in this country," he said. 
"Aber in order to be honest, we would not have expected that this happened to such arrogance with such pressure and in so unethical way, you know."
