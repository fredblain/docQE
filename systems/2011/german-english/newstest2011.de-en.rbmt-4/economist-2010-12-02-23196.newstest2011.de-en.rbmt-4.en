Weak applause for China 
Taiwan's voters come closer slowly to a narrower connection to the mainland. 
What holds Taiwan of his tall brother beyond the straits? 
On 27th November more than 7,5 million voters did themselves, those ones are open 70% of all elective, in order to elect mayors and town councils in the five municipal districts. This is evaluated as a wide evaluation of the president Ma Ying-jeou. 
Through the construction of epoch-making business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma is even a symbol figure for the relationships to the mainland. His politics changed the relation into the Chinese land of origin lastingly for the first time since 1949. 
Ma passed the examination, however only just. 
Although his Kuomintang-party (KMT) sets three of the five mayors, she did not receive any majority of votes. 
Instead of this the Democratic progress party (DPP) which approves a greater independence of Taiwan received almost 50% of the voices, the KMT received 45%. 
At a premiership choice this would have meant problems for Ma. 
Since his choice two years ago the voice part of his party has fallen around approx. 8%. 
For the first time the DPP moved in even together with the KMT in the town councils. 
During the choice it resulted in the incidents usual in Taiwan as truck convoys with rioters, flag-waving mass moves and only sparsely dressed dancers. 
There was even the compulsory, mysterious murder attempt. 
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT kept a speech to the eve of the choice onto a KMT candidate, 
when a man fired to him from the amount into the face. Lien was wounded and killed a spectator overleaf. 
Bizarrerweiser is not clearly whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or attach a quarrel with the candidate. 
Independently of that the assault influenced the choice according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, and moved the DPP into a bad light, which brought the KMT more voices. 
Possibly China was the tallest winner of the campaign. 
Remarkable proofs became the relationships to the mainland not thematisiert. 
Instead of this the candidates debated on plans to council houses and the job creation. 
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and refuse China's military threat. 
For this reason the KMT does not put their relationships to the government gladly into the foreground in Peking. 
However, this time also the DPP avoided to stir up the anti-Chinese feelings too very much. 
It reacted to the new consciousness, that Taiwan's economy without China can not survive. 
Ma for his part would like to be able to confirm himself that the majority of the Taiwanese approves his China-politics. 
The government in Peking will keep on pursuing his strategy, to lure Taiwan with economical stimuli back into the community. 
China sent immediately an agent to Taipei in order to prepare a summit conference to investment security and medical cooperation. 
Certainly also a political integration wants it. But the most important thing first. 
It maintains in this way more gladly to the premiership choices in 2012. 
Meanwhile the DPP invented herself again. 
Two years ago it was strongly weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was because of corruption in the prison. 
During his premiership of 2000 to 2008 it kicked in vehement for the absolute independence. 
Nevertheless under Tais regency developed a new generation of moderate politicians and the DPP fights for the voices of the working one and the youth. 
Tsai found great approval, as Su Tseng-chang, as a premiership candidate of the DPP among Chen. 
Your party does now everything in order to show that also it is in the situation to establish narrow relationships to Peking. 
Tsai plans an idea forge as a contact point between the DPP and China. This presupposes, however, unprejudiced discussions. 
Tsai declared in public that their party offers a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas of rash approximation to China. 
Chen shines about this change very annoyedly. 
From his cell it declared the candidates of the DPP would have done better at insisting on Taiwan's independence. 
He even asked the pragmatist Su to renounce the premiership candidacy. 
Also without Chens interference the DPP is for herself heavily to elect their possible candidate. 
The KMT will have to subject herself to an own selfanalysis. 
Mas values are bad, in spite of the rapid economic growth; the KMT-candidates wanted to lead their election campaign without it. 
Seeming to be unemployment and the increasingly further scissors between arm and empire the main reasons for his unpopularity. 
According to a KMT-speaker it will reshape his cabinet as well as the local facilities. 
The strong appearance of the DPP lets to presume that Taiwan approves a re-approximation only restrictedly. 
Most Taiwanese see the economical cooperation with China as inevitable simultaneous. 
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there "is" not "already any back anymore.
