What she is supposed to do, the SSD? Neither the Czech social democrats in Prague do not know Voldemort, yet the "cake shop." 
The new councillors of the capital from the rows of the SSD will have to overcome obviously certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues anyway from the ODS in the Prager council and in the city representation. 
Member of the new council "knocked" the newspaper Aktuáln.cz out of the SSD once a little bit as they dominate the notorious slang which was established in the last years in which the present coalition partners were in Prague at the oar. 
The coded vocabulary, that in the passed era of chief burgomaster Pavel Bém of the Prager was introduced political elite, is to some of the best known protagonists, borrowed situations and Causae. 
Surprisingly showed, that the new councils with respect to those ones these new concepts a little in the dark grope. 
They claim that at least. 
"Who Voldemort is"? 
"No presentiment." 
"I am rather a newcomer to the Prager politics," reacted Lukás Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, onto the test of the "godfather vocabulary." 
But also the councillor Karel Bezina - a political veteran - reacted to similar manner. 
For example onto the concept "golf hole." 
"That is the only expression of those which you present to me here which I use occasionally." 
"Otherwise I do not hold much of slang." 
From the vocabulary, that the day leaf of Aktuáln.cz in this year's June in front of the choice congress of the ODS had published, the editorial staff pecked six concepts out, particularly such that are notorious united with the Prager municipal council. 
The social democrats should the concepts "Voldemort," "biggest Prager" golf hole," "to go into the cake shop," "Bull nape, Betrayal of the capital" and "verblechen" define. 
Three Prager councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prager school being - promised his participation in the conversation first indeed, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prager school being - did not pick up then the listener once, however. 
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, refused the test from the beginning. 
"These things are to me regardless and as the Middle Class democrats under each other talk, I do not judge that." 
"For me it is important how we get on within the framework of our programs" it countered. 
Pointed out as already, Lukás Kaucký would supposedly not have recognized in the above-mentioned headline, that of the influential entrepreneur and friend of the ex chief burgomaster Bém, Roman Janousek is the speech. 
The concept "Voldemort" does not say anything to Kaucky at all in that and the only concept which he guessed during the test correctly was "the biggest Prager golf hole." 
"That is the tunnel Blanka," Kaucký says added for the security, however, still: "But I rather know that from the newspaper." 
And jocular: "I will have to do presumably a language course." 
The "golf hole" is deciphered to Lukás Plachý correctly then not only by matador Karel Bezina, but also by the councillor for environmental questions as a tunnel Blanka. 
Both social democrats also know, however, for whom the concept Voldemort stands and foresees Lukás Plachý even, where this figure is to be found and through that also, what means it "to go into the cake shop." 
"I believe, that is, to go into some Prager gastronomy company," it is quite close to that to Plachý at the puzzle's solution if one knows that it at that around the seat Firmen deals with Janouseks. 
In agreement with Bezina he declares, however, to rather have drawn this knowledge from the newspaper than that this vocabulary would be particular to him. 
It seems among the social democrats not to give any similarly adopted slang in fact to judge according to the test participants. 
"I asked also to my colleagues, but obviously there is really not something like that with us." 
"We calls us with the name, occasionally we use also abbreviations or nicknames," the chairperson of the Prager says SSD Petr Hulínský - mentioned "Hulda" by his party comrades casually. 
"In the school I was mentioned Bíza (Birch), but I do not know, whether me also my colleagues so nominal," Karel Bezina betrays us his nickname. 
The newspaper Deník Aktuáln.cz tried out the name and see there - it functions. 
The "grandpa" or little is councillor Weinert in a friendly manner in a friendly manner for the party comrades the "altos'," the representative Miroslav Poche that made attentive before the choices through machinations during the party Sponsoring on themselves is mentioned "Igráek" (Czech Lego figure confessed) by some colleagues. 
Nicknames are so the only one which the social democrats admit in the internal party usage. 
Hulínský does not like it supposedly if one mentions him "Hulda," but Deník Aktuáln.cz registered still another nickname of the Prager chairperson. 
His nickname "Doctor of the truncheon-rights" has to do alleged with Petr Hulínský acquiring his title of Doctor juris at the Bratislaver police academy.
