The new unit does not find any unanimity 
In spite of the announcement of the possible foundation of a new, standing unit for the fight against corruption and collusion on the part of Jean Charest numerous observers keep on demanding the education of a public investigation committee on this topic. 
Robert Dutil, minister of the public security, claims, this idea does not come from yesterday: Quebec would have consulted already last January the New Yorker Department of Investigation concerning this topic. 
The metropolis is in charge of a standing unit since 1870 against the corruption. 
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday surprised more than only one. 
One must say with regard to that that this measure was in the least not discussed on the occasion of the meeting of the constant committee of the Quebecer police service on 29th October last year in spite of the presence Robert Dutils. 
It was not missing either, that this announcement as regards "rakes" Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, public security as "a rabbit conjured out of the hat" as well as "at a table end made solution" qualified. 
Minister Dutil had turned for his part in turn to those ones who fear that the political power has too much influence on the unit standing into consideration, future. 
"You will see the result if we will announce it" he was satisfied confirm. 
"One is conscious of this problem to oneself." 
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the realization of a public inquiry. 
"Per more M. Charest on wanting to prevent the education of this investigation committee persists the more the people become as she and I think that he has to hide something" declared it. 
"The only means to be able to form an investigation committee is the resignation of Jean Charest," so Yves Boisvert declared for his part, university lecturer for ethic and political systems at the ENA (staatl. College for the training of high administration officials). 
In order to come out of this dead end, he suggests to the Quebec to grant a specific mandate to the finance examination control in this way this enquiries corresponding about corruption and secret agreements can start. 
"One should be capable to expand the mandate of the examination control," so he decided. 
He represents in the same way the opinion that the Quebec of the examination control could grant the same power as superintendents which would allow her also to oblige the people to the statement. 
The education of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the government Charest. 
The Quebec will demand from Ottawa in the same way to change the criminal law in such a way in order to be employed better in this way of crimes. 
This demand comes from the senior public prosecutor of the operation Marteau that informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier of the jurisdiction not being unequivocal in this kind of the prosecution. 
Vic Töws, Minister of State for public security confirmed for his part, his colleague of the justice, Rob Nicholson, sits down at the time of with amendments certain, affecting this dossier from each other. 
During the operation Printemps 2001 that affected the groups of the motorcycle policemen 131 persons had been arrested, although the criminal law not novelliert was. 
Ottawa put through the law due to that against Gangstertum.
