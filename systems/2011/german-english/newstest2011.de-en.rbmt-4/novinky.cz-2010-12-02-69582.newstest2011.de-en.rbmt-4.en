Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it simply seems too slow 
Fernet, rum and vodka, by way of exception also once a good whiskey that one stole from the father from the house bar. 
Those ones are the drinks, according to whose pleasure drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen most frequently are need-treated must. 
Children that must sleep off their tomcat repeated in the hospital are not an exception. 
This follows from the experiences of doctors which are confronted with similar cases by clinics in the photo of the child departments. 
"Beer or wine are complete from the fashion because it long lasts simply too until one is drunk." 
"The present trend is unequivocally hard alcohol," said Právo Ludk Pelikán, the medical superintendent of the child department, in the middle-Bohemian clinic Hoovice. 
"Whiskey, when succeeds in stealing a bottle from the father from the house bar, and otherwise, then at least Fernet or vodka. 
"Vodka has the advantage that one can mix it with Juice then it does not smell so strongly," the medical superintendent declares. 
The speaker of the department hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives to him right. 
Most "frequently it is a question of Fernet or Of that." 
"That is the present alcohol trend, in particular at elementary schools." 
"Occasionally it was a question also of Slibowitz that one takes along from home" Ms Jurinová mentioned. 
According to medical superintendent Pelikán alcoholics thirteen or fourteen year old are not an exception appearance in the hospital photo for a long time. 
Before the clinic in Hoovice which he works on since this year it was for ten years active in the pediatrics department of the hospital Motol, where the rescue cars tipsy pupils from near and far from delivered. 
"A girl had to be hospitalisiert four times." 
"She began your career with 12 years, als sie the first time with 3,5 per mille of alcohol in the blood and still for this purpose in combination with "Extase" was delivered," the doctor described an especially difficult case. 
"It was in the exhibition grounds in Holesovice on some dance party." 
"That was interesting, that it occurred their mother not at all strange, that their daughter" did not "come" home 48 hours, the medical superintendent is surprised. 
Just the missing interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance while activating with the own grafts is regarded as one of the main causes for the wachsenden alcoholism of children. 
It is not a question of a real dependence in the true sense of the word according to experts with children. 
"Under alcoholism a long-standing chronic dependence on the alcohol along with all in this way is hanging together phenomenon understand and that is not the case with these children." 
At those who enjoy alcohol repeatedly mostly a more negatively familiar-social background is characteristic," declares medical superintendent Pelikán. 
The speaker of the hospital Motol, according to Ms Jurinová, were sent until middle November approximately forty drunk children in the local department of child and youth medicine. 
Yet only the cases with difficult alcohol poisoning that required a stay in hospital come in into the statistics. 
Drunk children are not registered who are brought home by the police after out-patient treatment of the parents or where appropriate. 
Except for the cases, in which children only it gives to drink up such a bottle of liquor once in the school bench in opinion of gentlemen Pelikán three seasonal amplitudes onto which in an one hundred percent way Verlass is: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year. 
"The last-named one for two reasons - either from grief because of the bad report or from joy onto the vacations." 
"In the Walpurgisnacht I already saw seven drunk children at the same time in the photo," stresses doctor Pelikán. 
A drunk child that spends the night under medical supervision is switched on paradoxically better, as a child that has to fight only with an unpleasant tomcat on the next day. 
One can market the headaches at the morning after that that stem from the dehydration and from the glucose lack in the hospital indeed with a liquid-donating drip with glucose and nutrients that the organism lacks. 
"You are switched on unequivocal better, because after the "marvellous" experience at the evening, they wake up with good mood without something doing sorely somewhere." 
"You are only a little confused about that where they are" doctor Pelikán adds with which it spoils the patients the good mood sometimes at least through that when it counts them the costs, that will cost it to the treatment. 
Because the transportation with the rescue car and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly to a few zig a Thousand Crowns. 
"Occasionally I have that than education means uses if I have vorgerechnet to the children directly during the doctor's round, what cost their drunkenness and that it can absolutely happen, that they once the whole vacations over" doctor Pelikán added "to have to work in order to earn the money for an only such party." 
In his opinion the health insurances do not reach, however, for recourse procedures, to demand around the costs of the parents necessary for the cure of the drunken children.
