To the hell, warrior! 
Does splatter fit to the art cinema? 
The director Nicolas Winding Refn plumbs old genre-borders again with his fighter-epic "Walhalla Rising." 
Which public does the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn like to have thought of when he turned "Walhalla Rising"? 
A caught Viking warrior only with an eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees from his tormentors and kills his opponents in rows with almost superhuman strengths - rings ideally for young masculine spectators in search of bloody Action, just because our hero uses gladly aggressive killing methods and tears his enemies the bowels already once from the live body if he has bad mood. 
On the other hand it does not tell Einauge the whole film about any word how in fact it is called, and also the other figures can be forced at most into one or two sentences or a few very painful death screams once. 
Else is kept quiet and feasted in the weirdly beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, that the Viking world of about a thousand years ago the scenery offers. 
Ideal rather for grown-up film makers with interest in existentialism and very quiet tracks. 
Beautiful if a film has several target groups damages only if they exclude themselves mutually. 
Director Winding Refn is regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and gestylten drug dealer trilogy "Pusher," refuses, however, stoically to make to the main stream or a little to little brutality his works with something accessible to the Arthouse more humor. 
Most art cinema friends might make be deterred from the around splashing brain mass and the bowels. 
The Action-fans die at the latest from boredom then if Einauge opens for freely interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and pins an eternity in lull and fog before apparently the team arrives in America and keeps on being silent there. 
No miracle therefore, that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any cinema rental company in Germany and appeared only on DVD now. 
That is a misery especially because of the splendid pictures, however also, because behind the prätentiösen one to blood-dripping facade a piece of cinema exciting occasionally hides, that earned some attention. 
In this film it is not a question of dialogs or a stringente action, it is everything atmosphere, a film-become fever dream. 
And from that there is not for the spectator any escaping. 
Refn does not grant him hardly a moment of the relaxation and ties him up the throat very slowly with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack, vor allem, however, with the incomprehensible hate that entgegenschlägt to him from the hearts of the figures. 
Only a small fair boy who stands loyally to one eye to the page preserves himself something as innocence, all others are driven from anger. 
Most most of all the one-eyed hero whose that, however, become from the hell sometime for enemies and allies in a temporary way to the warrior motives are never explained possibly to the ambassador of the devil himself. 
It means ruin, one maybe, however, also only for those ones anyhow Spoiled. 
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film which one can hate and admire to the annoying, annoying and astonishment. 
An experience.
