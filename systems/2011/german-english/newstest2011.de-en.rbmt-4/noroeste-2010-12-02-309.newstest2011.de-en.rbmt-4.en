Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block 
With the reform of the organ law about the congress the two party system is introduced, they lament. 
Just the 60th legislative period had begun, and already installed an opposition block, led by the representatives of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who introduced himself as an independent. The Four of them questioned following: the entry of the 'two party system' into the chamber. 
Before beginning of the introductory meeting into the 60th legislative period cursed Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo against the reform of the organ law, since they would be excluded by that. 
With this reform, they repeated a 'two party system' would be introduced, because now it would be two persons, the same number as parties that controlled the congress. 
These four representatives, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones, that against that of the Panisten Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his property than deputy chairpersons mentioned executive committee tuned. 
Declared to Corvera Quevedo, that the parties of PRI and PAN with these reforms institutional their political edge position would have introduced. 
He exported that they would speak of PAN and PRI in the next days with the representatives in order to change the pattern. In this case they went out of derem political will and if they did not have that one, they would be subjugated by both parties with which an end would be set to the opposition coalition again. 
"To here I (the opposition coalition) come, that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, those ones do not take Rücksichte even on considering the opinion of the remaining ones." 
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia declared PT and Patrón there would be correspondences with PRD and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed. 
It can not be approved, he went on, that the congress is supposed to be now "duopolistisch" after it was monopolistic. 
It is not the spirit of the law reform that there is supposed to be an eternal two party system in the congress." 
"For the beginning this group begins with five representatives and they speak with further colleagues and colleagues so that they become more," declared the Convergencia-member. 
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT exported in allusion on PAN and PRI, that the congress at the time of into a 'booty' for two has changed. 
"Before it was only a party, now they split themselves up these two on." 
Patrón Montalvo proposed to respect the representatives and to assign their place to them at the negotiating tables. 
Five who will probably be nine representatives must not be let due to top decisions outside. The Five, that at the time of than split into different factions are seen, decided to unite around our place at the negotiating table to charm, because due to it we remained reform that was carried out by the others and agreed outside and we do not agree agreed with this reform."
