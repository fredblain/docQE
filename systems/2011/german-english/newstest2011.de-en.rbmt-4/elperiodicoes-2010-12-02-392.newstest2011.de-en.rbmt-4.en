On the hunt according to Wikileaks head 
Obama appoints a high person responsible the prevention of new disclosures for the antiterrorism fight. 
Interpol gives a red warning to the pursuit and finding from Assange. 
All which is associated with Wikileaks and his founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts in an only difficult way can be cleared up.

Further the attorney of the founder of Wikileaks, mark of Stephens, assures "the police would know where and how it can contact Mr Assange." 
Already at the 20th the international police with seat distributed the order in Lyons (France) on request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday according to receipt to the authority through the Swedish authorities. 
The things are like this. The 188 Interpol countries are dependent, to identify Assange and to discover "in order to arrest him temporarily and to hand over." 
Although Interpol can not order the arrest of one of individual affected by a red warning, many member countries consider according to statements of the organization the red warning as a charter in particular for an Arrestierung - that must be carried out by the national police - if they have a bilateral delivery agreement, where Assange presumably stays, as it is the case of Sweden and England. 
The procedure indignant Assanges attorneys, the gesten ones a letter published, in which they informed of the 39-year old founder of Wikileaks being ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference. 
You also remind of Assange applying for the departure from Sweden and obtaining the corresponding permission from the state attorney that is compared with the sagenumwobenen Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, chief safety officer of Stalin.

"I am not sure, why we should put value onto the opinion of a type with a web site," it declared to the CNN sender. 
Obama himself charged a high person responsible the prevention of new document disclosures for the antiterrorism fight, Rusell Travers. 
The attempt of the speaker of the Pr√§sidenden Barack Obama to give Assange less attention conflicts too the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators in these days announce. 
To examine the congress representative Peter King that will chair from January in the Nationalen Sicherheitskommitee of the parliament, the state department asked, the possibility to put Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "in order to confiscate their money and everyone, that supports her or achieves a contribution pursue." 
Tom Flanagan, consultant of the Canadian president Stephen Harper, had gone even wider, and it must his statement Assange must revoke "to be murdered." 
"Obama would have to change it into a target and use a not manned airplane or something like that."
