Controllers in the twilight 
The European food authority Efsa is unterwandert by the industry experimenting with gene plants. 
The expert group of Testbiotech which defines itself as an independent institute for the consequence estimate of the biotechnology formulates this reproach now. 
"It rings as a conspiracy theory, but we documented it well," said Testbiotech-leader Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich. 
The conductor of the Efsa expert group for gene-technical changed plants, Harry Kuiper, and Ilsi under contract are a further Efsa-expert for years also with the lobbyist association. 
That one is paid by company groups as Monsanto, Nestle or Bavarian. 
Kuiper cooperated in the Efsa-specifications in a leading way for gene plants and stands in this way in a clear interest conflict, criticizes Then. 
The Efsa-rules are word-identical sale-wisely with position papers to the Ilsi and would bear in this way the handwriting of the industry which actually is supposed to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma. 
It is already the second time that Testbiotech criticizes an interfood collision. 
So a hochrangige Efsa manageress is youngest without editions or transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta - and changed in this way the pages. 
Also the Central German radio (MDR) had revealed recently staff connections between controlling EU authority and industry lobby, which made the Federal Office for Environment Protection poorly soundproofed just the same as EU parliamentarians. 
Meanwhile the Efsa can not recognize any interest conflict. 
One falls back to all serious data, also onto such of the industry as long as they are from high professional quality it is called in a comment. 
One does not demand of the experts who work for Efsa that they do not have any contacts to the industry. 
You would have to disclose these, however. 
Kuiper grants his work for the International Life Sciences institutes (Ilsi) in the USA. 
This calls himself neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for the risk estimate for biotechnology without lobby task. 
In the thing independent experts as Then criticize, that gene-technical changed plants are approved currently without any feeding attempt at animals and is tested the reaction of gene plants to environmental impacts not. 
"We want to know what for example gene-technically changed corn does on the field," says Then. 
Present practice is it, only isolated proteins, not to test the whole gene plant, however, what does not supply any dependable results. 
"If one does not search the risks, as one is supposed "to find" it then"?, Then asks accusing. 
Also Angelika Hilbeck sees that like this. 
The scientist researches since 1994 in the gene technique and is currently active at the Technical Zurich College. 
The industry attempts on this field as in the USA now also in Europe more and more, critical scientists to influence or to discredit. 
There are hardly yet therefore researchers that did not intertwine with company groups. 
For enterprises critical studies would normally not be published. 
"The industry controls the security research," says Hilbeck.
