Métro Grand Paris: first financial rough drafts 
Since the debate is on the Ile-de-France in full progress around the modernization of the traffic economy, it rains billions. 
At least in the discussions. 
One calls in particular the 23 billion at that into memory for the metro gravel of Paris, that of the Société you are supposed to be built gravel Paris. 
In order to lead the start of building of the SGP into the ways, the state called out a capital donation of 4 billion euros. 
In the theoretical pattern this is the sum which would make to give their twofold one a part of the finance sum too on the markets for the SGP possible then. 
Finally today it resulted in first projections. 
The supplement budget of 2010 ones, checked by the finance commission of the national assembly this morning, contains the planned measures in order to raise the first part of this money. 
It is a question at that of two kinds of measures: the creation of a special tax to the Erschliessund and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France. 
Erstere, so one takes articles 15 of the draft, goes "for the benefit of the public-legal institution Société du Grand Paris." 
This is numbered: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per annum." 
Zweitere is a reorganization of the already existing enterprise taxation: "in order to modernize these, to increase around the product resulting from it and this rise of the Société you to überantworten gravel Paris." 
How much would be that worth? 
A puzzle. 
This sum is not numbered in the text. 
From the 4 billion one is far away. 
It is exported that the tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the capital donation that are annoyed through the state and that Société are achieved you" gravel of Paris little by little for the project," so is to understand from the explanatory explanation. 
At the SGP one does not find this system offensive at all. 
"Since the moment in which one credits gains (the two taxes, through R.) one can cover the project planning for more than three years and draw it then first from the 4 billion," so is declared. 
"This is noted down in the budget and deducted little by little." 
The SGP estimates, that in 2013 will be begun, to note down the 4 billion for the budget 2014. 
This measure, to whose 4 promised billions one still long becomes can search, danger to cause a discussion quite in motion, parliamentary runs. 
The first public meeting occurs on 7th December.
