American soldiers have a new "intelligent arm." 
The American troops fitted in a new "intelligent" arm which up to now is confessed only under their code designation XM-25 into Afghanistan for the first time. 
The generals hope for this new automatic arm influencing the nonlocal conflict with the Taliban and changing the balance of power for their advantages. 
The new arm is something, as a superexact cannon. 
Your projectiles are steered indeed into the objective by lasers with an accuracy only of of a few meters. 
The specific projectiles of caliber 25 mm that were developed for this rifle and contain highly explosive explosive function practically as small shells. 
The projectiles can be programmed so to their being able to explode not only during the strike onto the objective, but at an arbitrary point of their ballistic flight path. 
That is, one can use it against an enemy, that behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench hides. 
From above it is not usually indeed protected, the murderous steel splinter rain of above can set it therefore easily except for combat. 
According to Richard Audett, that the XM-25 participated in the development, the new combat rifle is the first infantry arm, that "intelligent" technologies too Nutze does. 
"The soldier goes ahead basically so: he aims for the objective and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an exact visor point to which it corrects the angle of elevation then he only still needs to fire. 
"Let's say one measured 543 m." 
"If one fires, the arm is charged and the projectile fires 543 meters onto the distance plus minus one, two or three meters from.
