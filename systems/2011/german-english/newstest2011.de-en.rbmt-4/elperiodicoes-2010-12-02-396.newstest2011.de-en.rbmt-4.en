Puigcercós searches the Carod too with a wink peace Being Close in the ERC 
The republican leader allows the party a secret vote about his living on in the office. 
Huguet suggests a more pluralistic government and the end of the plenary session principle. 
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a prescription, around for the zigsten time one internal riot to avoid in the rows of the ERC direction-free to the loss of 11 representatives and half of the votes. 
The party chairperson is conscious that his resignation threat does not suffice to those being close of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is today as weakened as their mentor himself and will not bring him the same head fragmentation as other former currents do. 
Therefore the leader of Esquerra attempts with a wink to win the new critics, which would safeguard his position up to the next local choices. 
For the beginning told yesterday at, that the more than 200 regional councilors of ERC could comment on his remaining secretly in the office. 
With choice notes, not with higher hand. 
If the Carodisten wanted to give a ticket to the Präsidenen, they could do this without having to fear reprisals. 
In fact the head would like to avoid both the impression of split and that of subjection under his person. 
It strengthened in several interviews, it would not be confirmed with half of the voices plus one feel, and he added without specification of percentages a result "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good either. 
The Carod Nahestehenden demand more from the president than to provide his office only for the party. An inadequate gesture, since Puigcercós controls the uppermost organ of the congresses. 
But since they are not in charge of a sufficient majority for the promotion from resignations, they will agree a procedure plan of now until May with the executive board. 
For that they expect, at the preparation of the document about strategic reorientation, that the management will present to the council to be able to participate for the vote at the 18th. 
It is your intention to vouch for Puigcercós. In the corresponding train this is supposed to promise, the congress to bring forward into the fall 2011, which the party top already holds for a fact. 
The party chairperson of the ERC thinks, the "polyphony" damages the stability and he strives once and for all for washing their dirty laundry behind closed doors to bring the organization into the situation. 
In this sense the article which the current Conseller Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic. 
Faced with the one that Puigcercós is an ideologist the holder of Innovació held it for a fact that the party chairperson is supported "in the exchange against different objectives." 
He counted five from which two stand to the fore. 
Firstly, the "restructuring" of the executive board, in this way these at least 90 percent's of the party members represents, that is called the inclusion of new faces from Carods environment. 
The Second could be the great piece of news. 
Huguet suggests, ERC is supposed to give up the plenary session principle at last as a mode of operation. 
In this way it defend a reform of the statutes, to keep off that is supposed to facilitate it the congresses with elected delegatees. 
From the termination of the plenary session model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós is 'Team that fought for that already on the last two congresses obsessively. 
In fact the party leadership was charged the inspection of the plenary session principle on the trembling meeting by 2008 on a congress which should deal with the reformation of the statutes. 
This appointment is pending still, there infogle the internal Aufruhe of the last years the starting of this matter not advisable was. 
Now, without which critical sectors are on the lookout, the time could have come in order to pick up this matter again and to finish forever.
