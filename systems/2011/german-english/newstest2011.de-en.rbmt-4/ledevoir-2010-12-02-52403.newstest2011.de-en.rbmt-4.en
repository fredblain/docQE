Secret of the in a complex way joggled Canada ventilated 
The new, American diplomat lines that were spread by WikiLeaks ventilate the secret about what the United Nations judge under the inferiority complex of the Canadians opposite the Americans; they lay, however, the superiority feeling with the same stroke last-named open opposite Canada. 
Subsequently the American diplomats were amazed about the Canadian voter not having the Canadian-American relationships during the ballot in the sense, and they believe, that the visit of president Obama would have helped the conservative government with putting through their budget of 2009! 
The four new communications between the American message in Ottawa and Washington that yesterday was spread in public, still more piquant details as the bare substantial contents offer which one has to puzzle over. 
One of the 22nd September 2008 connection dating back, that is reported in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage was contained in the full walk over from which point the United Nations do not participate in the actions discussed by their political heads anymore. 
For the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the ambassador's employed in Ottawa, American. 
Mr Wilkins offers different declaration possibilities of this situation. 
"One the Canadians almost inherent inferiority complex necessitates arranges possibly the Canadian, political managers a lot rather in order to talk about internal disputes of the everyday life as the United States during this choice the black Peter shut (as 1988 during the campaign about the free trade) ," so he describes. 
The United Nations, so he concludes, is "the proverbial Goliath of this choice" thus: omnipräsent, but potentially too alarming, in order to speak of it." 
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" even less since the two countries have intense political and economical relationships. 
"Logically," so assessedly it, "it "should be the ability of a candidate, a party and still much more a party leader for the leading of one such essential relationship, that of the voters with the urn walk as a key factor in the sense has." 
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads itself in that on the 22nd January 2009 of Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, sent communication, that is supposed to prepare president Barack Obama for his first visit in Ottawa. 
"Your journey will help with guaranteeing the wide heir stand of the government with the vote of confidence about the federal budget at the beginning of February in the case of which Canada" will announce" "his first deficit after more than one decade to arise due to a stimulation program in the height of 30 to 40 billion dollars," Breese describes. 
Nowhere he had not mentioned that the government had had to adjourn the sitting of parliament before Christmas in order to prevent that the parliament would be flung from the coalition and the so conditional wide heir stand of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the suggested stimulation program. 
Another, communication dating back of January 2008 and written on the part of the ambassador Wilkins notifies to Washington of the always negative becoming picture, that the series radiated over CBC, dramatic spread from the United States. 
The ambassador is worried about broadcastings as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one can observe few subtle allusions at Maher Arar, the "No-Fly cunning" or also payments for the purpose of through muscleman of the CIA of examinations carried out. 
Again another communication reports to receive certain prisoners fully about that as Hillary Clinten asked with their French colleagues Bernard Kouchner during their first bilateral meeting for whether Europe is ready from Guantanamo. 
Mr Kouchner should the question with yes have answered, however on the basis one individual "case to case" decision. 
Àm at the end of the meeting, so described, "Omar Khadr gave a paper as regards to the state secretary it, to one 15-year old Muslims of Canadian origin." 
"The state secretary promised to check the acts once again." 
Finally still let's say that the feelings are aroused with regard to the web page WikiLeaks. 
Tom Flanagan, an old one and Stephen Harper of consultants standing very closely, had declared over CBC that those ones should "be killed" to persons responsible for this massive leakage. 
He had reported here on Mike Huckabee from the United States.
