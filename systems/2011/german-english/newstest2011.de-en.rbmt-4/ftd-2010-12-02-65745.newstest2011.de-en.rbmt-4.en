Talent fight for High-Potentials 
There is it reger crush at the sideboard. 
16 students push themselves around salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweet. 
The Technical Brunswick University and the car builder Volkswagen invited the machine building and design students to a Workshop. 
In a kind of idea competition should they together with VW developers about the car of the future fachsimpeln - and to become acquainted with Volkswagen very incidentally. 
In the contest around the cleverest heads many enterprises go in the meantime into the infighting and set, as VW, on co-operations with the universities. 
Your mission: To recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the lecture halls before they come to the labor market and are umworben by others. 
And because the universities no installations over the services of their students hand over, attempted to spot one the exception talents in practice projects and to tie to himself. 
On the second day of the Workshops at the TU Brunswick the car company group solicits the talents. 
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ball-point pens, rubber bears and folders with VW-logo. 
It tells the hopeful young talents about practical training programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the company group. 
Nico Selle of the TU Brunswick is in charge of the project with VW. 
He sees the advantages for both pages: "The students get into contact to the industry and gain experiences." 
Students can become acquainted with VW simultaneous, interesting candidates look at themselves nearer and consider who as employees into consideration would come." 
Such co-operations are not, according to Selle, unusual. 
It is new that the students are wooed so offensively. 
"Otherwise the emphasis rather lay on the professional project," Selle says. 
The fight for those ones fresh to graduates will become presumably even harder. 
In many branches the enterprises can not select themselves their employees more from a big crowd of applicants. 
But they must recommend themselves and especially around highly qualified workers croon. 
There are particularly graduates from the engineer disciplines in an excellent negotiation position in this case. 
According to the association of German Engineers VDI more than 40.000 engineer places remained in October vacant. 
And the so-called engineer gap will become even bigger according to VDI-predictions. 
For the economic examination and consultation enterprise KPMG Roman Dykta goes onto the talent hunt. 
He organizes extensive Recruiting-events as about the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern escalope hunt, at which the participants must find their way by means of GPS-coordinates. 
The enterprise wants to send eight promising students so in the next year through the USA crossways. 
Very incidentally the participants can have a look at KPMG-branches and become acquainted with the enterprise. 
Who with may, decides in two selection rounds previously. 
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies into the USA. 
In the case of the blanking and twinge around the High Potentials at the universities the guns become increasingly bigger according to Dykta. 
"We want to remove ourselves with the Race from the mass." 
"Only one simpler Segeltörn was us too little." 
For talent hunter Dykta the bill seems to open. 
"We have until today contact with all participants of a similar action in the last year." 
"Some stand shortly before their end and want to apply soon to us," he says. 
Next to the direct beloved at the campus particularly small and medium-sized enterprises go also very classically onto the deerstalking in the case of professional fairs. 
"We attempt to reach graduates on trade fairs." 
"About on the Intersolar," Sitha Stübe, personnel head, tells with the heliotechnology manufacturer Solarworld. 
The Bonner enterprise employs about 1500 employees in Germany. 
Stübe knows about the junior staff problems. 
Currently 35 places are advertised on the enterprise web site. 
"It is just very heavy to fill vacant positions." 
"That costs a lot of time and money," she says. 
A further way is the contact about the uni-professors. 
Solarworld co-operates with different colleges, about the university, in Freiberg. 
"The professors give tips, that one can do practical trainings with us or write his master's thesis." 
Expensive advertising campaigns are not announced with the solar specialist. 
For that the enterprise attempts with other advantages to advertise itself: Personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and slight communication. 
"A big concern can often not offer that," says personnel head Stübe. 
Money does not play the title role anymore for a long time during the job search. 
Flexible working times, child care or good rise possibilities are further decisive factors. 
Solarworld occupied the 55th place with a study of the Great Place to Work Instituts among the 100 best employers of Germany. 
The institute creates an annual Bestenliste of German employers. 
For this purpose employee consults it as in a satisfied way they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the general conditions for the employees. 
Personnel head Stübe expects also pluses from the placement at the job-searching ones. 
"I think that applicants look about a potential employer especially according to external evaluations," she says. 
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Akademie advises enterprises which want to establish themselves a good call with a long-term strategy as employers. 
He recommends his customers more authenticity. 
And that means, aloud Kriegler, particularly internal measures. 
"The best way to make oneself attractive as an employer leads about the own employees," he says. 
In the branch jargon that is called internal Employer Branding, that is employer brand education, within the own staff. 
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors." 
If one treats his people well and they identify with the enterprise, then they would advertise their employer very by oneself with friends and acquaintances. 
"That is as a game with gang," says Kriegler.
