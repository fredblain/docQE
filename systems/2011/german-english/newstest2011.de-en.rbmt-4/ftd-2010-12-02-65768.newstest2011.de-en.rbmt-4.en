Ogoniland burned down 
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells as at the service station: Billions of liters of crude oil run out destroyed the nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland. 
The people live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking. 
Celestine Akpobari means it well. 
"Does not trouble you off," the eco-activist calms the journalists: "You will get today still enough oil sludge before the lens." 
The 37-year old Nigerian pursued the attempt to photocopy one up to the breast in the water of wading boy with the striaes surrounding it: In the regenbogenfarbenen water shine the scene seems almost pretty. 
That under the surface brown crude oil swaths float is not to be seen. 
Formerly it collected here bucket-wise prawns, tells Esther Badom at the shore of the Bodo-Jetty-river. 
Meanwhile the sluggish fluent waters are completely dead. 
Five years ago vast quantities poured from a burst pipeline crude oil into the gigantic wetlands. 
Fisherman from the small town seemed likely now six hours must row Bodo in order to reach fish-containing waters: The Ogoniland sited in the heart of the Niger delta is regarded as one of the most badly verpesteten regions of the world. 
On the journey through the mangrove swamps durchzogenen of courses the whole extent of the devastation becomes obvious. 
Instead of the motorboat churns up bright water brown gravy who his hand dives into the water, pulls out oily fingers. 
The roots of the Mangrovenbäumchen jut out as black licorice poles from the ground, sadly palms to be found occasionally leave their whisks. 
Bird flocks as they are usual in wetlands otherwise one searches in vain: As soon as the outboard motor keeps quiet, spooky rest expands in the former paradise smelling as a service station. 
"What happens here is an ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari darkly: "We live in constant danger for the health." 
The war comparison is made. 
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battlefield umkämpftes since decades: Here the first Explorateure penetrated from Europe more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance organized itself in the 80er-Jahren with the later exekutierten writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the shell company group had to stop in 1993 his production because it became too dangerous for his oil workers. 
Still today the return is refused to the enterprise according to Ogoniland: During from the entire delta region of the triple size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling-sources and 7000 kilometers of pipelines daily more than two million barrel of the black gold are pumped, the oil fields are fallow in the Ogoniland, the situation is too unstable to the company group. 
All paar a Hundred Meters jut out stählerne frames as bizarre sculptures of the water: "Christbäumchen" is mentioned the heads of the boreholes much too gently. 
You are up to 50 years old, most to in the mark corrodes. 
Again and again such a chuck breche auseinander, thinks Akpobari, then a constant stream crude oil runs into the water. 
More than two billion liters flowed into the ecological system of the delta after expert estimates in 50 years: Year for year the amount of oil, as it penetrated the sea with the average of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago before Alaska - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of the mankind. 
Who is to be made responsible for the continuous ECO-DISTRICT, people argue about that. 
While the shell company group is making responsible sabotage and the organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting chucks and leaky pipelines as main causers. 
Shell lays down considerably lower security standards in Nigeria than else in the world usual, the US scientist Richard Steiner reproached to the company group in 2008: Only the rate of defects at the lines is "higher around a multiple than elsewhere." 
At a place, that from the distance as a left, oil-blurred workshop in the open looks, emerge from the mangroves figures: You are splinter-naked and oil-blurred up to the neck. 
Under one of the many barrels, that in part with tubes united, to define in part arbitrarily scatteredly on the ground are, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery. 
In the barrel the crude oil is heated up above the fire for several hours, declares Michael, the head of the group. 
First gasoline penetrates the absorbing-pot through the tubes, later kerosene and finally diesel trickles at the end of the management out. 
So Michael and four employees produce daily up to four barrels of diesel à 300 liters: "That is 34.000 Naira to us worth" - about 22 dollars. 
The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel scarcity in the biggest oil state Schwarzafrikas. 
Nigeria is in charge only of a single refinery. 
The diesel price ridiculously low with just 40 euro cents per liter the illegal cookers can undercut still: Because they get their raw material for nothing. 
It comes from "Bunkerern" who tap the pipeline net right through Ogoniland: In this way daily at least 16 million liters of crude oil disappear to the country according to experts in the entire Niger delta. 
Only one disappearing small part of the provisionally interbedded raw material is refined, however, illegally: Organized criminal networks which also politicians and hochrangige militaries are supposed to belong to into tankers and verscherbeln it on the international market fill the lion's share. 
The debate, whether the environmental disaster is owed to the machinations of the population or the lax production method rather, the activist Akpobari holds for academic in that. 
"If the oil societies would not be perceived as intruders and if they would not have destroyed the base of life of the fishermen so thoroughly, neither there would not be sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries." 
Meanwhile the Ogoni particularly to shell is the relation but in such a way it destroys that only a withdrawal of the company group would come into consideration: "Maybe other nationalities as the Chinese turn out than better." 
There Michael becomes nervous. 
"Highest time, that you disappear," the muscular oil man says. 
"Every minute the soldiers can come." 
The illegal Ölveredler are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, indeed no arrest threatens them, presumably however a painful bribe. 
Also the soldiers coming from the country north above all want to profit - as all Nigerians - by the raw material. 
"This condemned stuff brought our country in every respect to the dog," says Akpobari.
