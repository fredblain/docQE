Can politeness combine the separating thing? 
After a campaign at swearwords and Negativität little politeness broke out this week in Washington. 
Is it the omen of a real two party cooperation or a factor of the illusion before one returns quickly again for the fight of the parties in the capital? 
The meeting on Tuesday between president Obama and spitzes of the congress did not bring any breakthrough in the great questions which one had to occupy oneself with during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government period in which no decisions anymore are made. 
After all to the, what one hears, was not to rule over it either a polite discussion between two different pages or an observation of their divided responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a party dot compiling. 
The public meeting of the deficit commission of the president on Wednesday was likewise civilized, in spite of the political differences that keep on existing between the members. 
It seems to be clear that a narrow communication makes over a period of months a mutual respect that the ideological fissure that keeps on separating the members from each other veils arise. 
That is not hardly enough in order to say a new era of the cooperation broke. 
Both pages are now in a test phase - in which one of the other sign of the cooperation and compromise willingness demands while one himself is attempting to consider the borders of the public opinion and the patience the voter after a renewed party warfare. 
Therefore the meeting on Tuesday itself and his assessment were restricted through the participants onto a minimum of demands or accusations. 
The philosophical differences between Obama and the republicans are too great and too deep, than that one could expect a fast change of the atmosphere that predominated in the last two years. 
Identical whether it is a question of taxes, donations, health or candidacies, the two pages are away of each other in a miles long way. 
In the End the November choice Washington tuned at least for short time mild. 
"No question, the accent changed itself," Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government that now for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center" works, said. 
"That is after choices inevitable. 
Choices raise party passions which again die. 
And that is good so." 
In some questions, especially in those which stand on the agenda of the "lame duck session" republicans and democrats do not have hardly another choice than to find a solution." 
Bushs tax abatement ends at the end of the year, and nobody approves that. 
Both pages want to find a way, around some or quite all too keeps, it is now temporary or durable. 
In the same way a compromise is to be expected concerning the increased unemployment pays, when also only, because the republicans can not afford it, that one believes, the favored tax abatement for the rich men, while they are refusing unemployed workers a support. 
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House the optimism increased, that one can agree in these questions during the "lame duck session" and contract ratify also the New START simultaneously. 
However William Glaston des Brookings Insitution warns against the lame duck session" not having to lead "a successful cooperation" to a durable cooperation of the parties compellingly "in urgent questions" if the new 112th congress will call in January. 
Instead of this, so he says, a phase of the Nichtübereinstimmens is more probable, maybe even unavoidable. 
"After the things which must be done are done, this short-term psychology will change in confrontation," he said. 
Wehner is also sceptical - and this skepticism is divided by many - that leads politeness to true cooperation. 
"I see as Vorkampf, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012 many things which happens from today to 2012," he said. 
The reasons for that have to do a lot with the getup of the new republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters, that those one education were useful. 
To know, as gotten the republican leaders like to be also over their playing poker too highly, it that they must attempt their promises, to lower the editions of the government and to annul the health reform, to stop. 
These party lines already in the first reactions concerning the recommendations become clear to the deficit commission which a tax reform and the emphasis of some taxes as well as the increase of the retirement age and the lowering of the government expenditures contain. 
The Deputy Chairpersons Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles took over one of the most difficult jobs into Washington and have, according to their own assessment, so very much close on that to put the deficit question on the public agenda. 
To need it, however, within the commission 14 of the 18 voices, around their plan to the to do official recommendation and they fight very much in order also to come only into the proximity of this number. 
The biggest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the committee, there in finance questions, at least today, only little elbow room or little sympathy for compromises is. 
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the republicans in the congress. 
The first fight will occur next year in the form of party collisions, when the republicans challenge Obama with regard to the national budget, the taxes and the health system, later then followed from a phase of greater two party cooperation. 
What will lead to this change? 
The public opinion. 
It is proved, that, in spite of the partiality of the current choice, the majority of the Americans still always wants, that the two parties work together. 
If confrontation leads to a dead end as it happened in 1995 then both parties must pay attention to the public reaction carefully. 
Who is condemned to the losing will change the course and will search will have the compromise. 
That likes to be in fact an optimistic viewpoint. 
Partiality and polarization are today greater than in the middle of the 1990th years, and to seem it to be a bigger ideological fissure between Obama and the congress republicans than at that time between president Bill Clinton and the republicans. 
Simultaneously the activists of both parties see as a pure prelude by far in 2010 for one at consequence more comprehensive choice 2012. 
So seen the politeness which is borne this week for the show likes to be welcomed by many Americans. 
However very much more effort will require on both pages, to find a common denominator in the questions that still separate the two from each other.
