Sabadell wants 'to steal' his rival in three years one millions of customers 
The managerial board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers are. He believes that in 2001 a hard year will be for the banks, at first, however, a new liquidity crisis rejects and the end of the fault war prophesies. 
In spite of that he foresees a burglary of the interest margins which the banks attempt to compensate for with rises of the fees and the prices for loans. 
Sabadell expects, in three years one to catch millions of private customers - a compartment to still be withstood. 
Sabadell found the way to empty the coming three years and to survive so in a very complicated economical environment. 
The bank will introduce in 2011 a new Dreijahresleitplan. 
The objective does only not say to survive without using the public aids from the FROB but in addition the share of the market about one millions of private customers - 700 000, if one removes the customers that the bank will lose - increase. That is the great challenge before which this bank stands, because until now she dedicated more attention to their business customers than their private customers. 
This year she has to manage 250 000 private customers and 50 000 enterprises. 
Your share of the market with private customers is near 3,5 percent while the business customers are forming more than 10 percent. 
A further principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the rise of the productivity, speak Austerität, cost reduction. She will present the challenges which the bank in this way faces together with annual account report. 
Only few banks dare in these difficult times of objectives to define and to publish since through the financial crisis all plans of the banks got messily worldwide. 
Sabadell will finish this year their four years ago defined leading-plan Optima. This was initially laid out onto three years, but due to the market it was prolonged around a business year. 
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main aim of the bank. 
Guardiola accentuated at a breakfast organized by the APIE, in 2011 a "difficult" year "with great range" would become. 
The manager starts from that, Spain would come only "slowly" out of the crisis. 
In addition it would be "very difficult" to create Work in two or three years - basic for the survival of the banks. 
Even if it goes out of the war around passives - that punishes the interest margins - fading, the loadings, the banks and savings banks for their emissions for the receipt of liquidity will have to pay, shifted as a compensation for profit margins fading away already onto those ones price for credits. 
"The topics of liquidity and financing are more structurally kind and they will exert pressure on the credits." 
"We did not wring the cock, but the interest differentials are very high," admitted Guardiola. 
Banesto distributed on Thursday already the order onto their branch net, to restrict the allocation of long-term loans and to increase the interest differentials (cf. Cinco Días of the 22nd and 27th November). 
The manager also admitted to increase the fees, however, the banks currently pursued the Stategie "within an embossed from the competition frame." 
Sabadells leading-plan is based on an organic growth even if the group does not exclude corporate businesses, as always. 
Not for nothing he assures that in Spain "greater enterprises are necessary." 
"In the coming year everything will change," he assures. 
It stresses, that the need for capital at the time of "enormously climbs" and it does not exclude that some Spanish finance institutes will slip into red numbers. 
He thinks the FROB can replace the money market at Kaptitalaufstockungen. 
After he assuring that Sabadell can survive also a temporary closing of the markets, it invalidates the argument of some bankers who prophesy already a new liquidity crisis. 
Stressed it one can not bring anything into circulation, however, unlike the incidents in June, one can achieve short-term financing above Repogeschäfte and catch the crisis in this way.
