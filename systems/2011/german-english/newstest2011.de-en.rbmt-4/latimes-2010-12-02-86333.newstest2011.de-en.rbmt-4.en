Arsenic-resistant microbe could facilitate new ways of life on the earth or elsewhere 
The discovery of a foreign bacterium kind which can live on arsenic among other things opens new possibilities for new ways of life on the earth and elsewhere. 
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on the earth, it is according to their opinion a sign for a life also without the elements up to now taken as vital being possible. 
"This organism has two possibilities." 
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic for the increasing." 
"That turns it into something very Special in spite of its being almost a kind of foreign way of life," declared Paul C.W. Davies of that one Arizona State University and co-author of the report that appears on Thursday in the online edition of the magazine Science. 
Up to now six main elements were considered as vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur. 
However, as the scientists found out, the bacterium also still keeps on growing in the Californian mono brine if it replaces phosphorus by arsenic. 
"Nevertheless there one wonders what otherwise still is possible," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar by that one to Arizona State University. 
The discovery is an important step during the search for extraterrestrial life since scientists must recognize lives and his forms, according to Anbar. 
The study deals with microbes which were found on the earth. 
The announcement of a press conference in which no details for the discovery were announced gave reason to widespread speculations in the Internet, that the report could deal with the discovery of extraterrestrial life. 
This is not the case. 
The discovery "it "shows" declared Charles Cockell that in other planetary systems organisms with the aid of other elements biochemical processes can get going and that" the 'standard elements' that are completely vital in our opinion "are" not "absolutely firmly set," professor at the Planetary and space Sciences Research institutes of the Open university of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. 
Cockel was not a part of the research team. 
"This work is a Novum, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures an element can be replaced by another" added Cockell. 
This discovery was not accidental. 
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiologischen Institut of the NASA which led the study chose the mono brine due to the high arsenic salary. 
Since arsenic and phosphorus resemble chemically, she picked up that microbes which are exposed to both can replace an element by the other one possibly. 
"The toxicity of the arsenic is based particularly on its behaving chemically similarly as phosphorus." 
"Through that it falls to the organisms heavily to distinguish an element from the other one." 
"Nevertheless the difference that arsenic works differently than phosphorus is so great. It reaches our biochemical system, where it smears everything as it were," declares Anbar. 
The researchers released the bacterium GFAJ-1 of an increasing arsenic concentration. It was adjusted and increased. 
The microbe grows indeed into phosphorus better, however, that it can survive also in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based way of life can occur of course either on the earth or on another planet or moon on which arsenic occurs more frequently. 
According to Jamie S. Foster, university lecturer for microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by Arsen is not new. However, up to now there was not yet any functioning example. 
Arsenic occurred in the early earth years more frequently, she says, therefore the science assumed that early ways of life had used it. 
"That gives" Forster, who was not a member in Wolfe-Simons research team, "reason for the assumption that life can have developed also differently than in the early earth age" so. 
The studies were supported by the NASA, the energy ministry and the National Health Authorities.
