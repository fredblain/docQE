Dupont partially zurechtgewiesen 
The Quebecer radio presenter Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback just the same before the Canadian supervisory board for radio norms (CCNR) because of his controversial comments above social welfare and Haitian as because of his aggressive speech manner above radio. 
FM team represents the opinion, M. Dupont and his CHOI 98,1 to the CCNR indeed the right to own opinion comment would have, however, certain comments would have "inaccurate information about the social welfare and without authorization negative representations of the Haitians as well as also a so rough speech manner that is not measured to the during the day broadcast broadcastings for contain." 
The supervisory board had also end-deduced that a discussion about suicide that contains the circulation of the names of two persons that committed suicide offends against the codex of the radio broadcasting. 
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments done during the broadcastings broadcast by 2008 and 2010 in the period. 
The first decree was inserted "commun" due to a complaint of the "front the personnes assistées sociales you Québec." 
The activist organization had complained, that the amounts mentioned in the broadcasting are inaccurate. 
The presenters should give information rather sound than misleading. 
With regard to presenter Stéphane Dupont had represented the opinion to the topic's suicide, the suicide is an expression of cowardice. 
The majority of the supervisory board members had drawn the conclusion, the provided message is at that that suicide must not be regarded as solution of life crises. 
"The majority of the supervisory board considers that the consequences of the broadcasting "Dupont le midi" standing into consideration would have touched a sensitive topic in family-oriented and suitable kind and manner." 
Therefore it was not reserved with any reproach opposite his person. 
The last quarrel point affected the statements that had referred to the earthquake in Haiti. 
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had given a media-effective quarrel conversation concerning that, that an amount of reactions caused. 
The CHOI-presenter had declared not to have donated for the benefit of the Haiti-help since one would not know with security whether the needy also really received the money donations. 
The supervisory board thinks that these comments of character not improper were, that, however, their cumulative effect presents a without authorization negative representation of the Haitians. 
"I atoned for already my three day long suspension punishment in this thing." 
"My file is since one years virgin," the presenter declared. 
In all decisions the supervisory board denounces the circulation of a rough diction. 
In all cases the CHOI-FM radio announcer acted "beyond his obligations." 
The consequences for the radio station which had been supposed to inform of his decisions among other things uniquely during the prime time within a period of time of three days are insignificant.
