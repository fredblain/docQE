I wish my successors a quieter year than we had it in Farmet 
The victory euphoria was dissolved quickly of the consequences of the crisis. 
Thanks to his consistency Farmet has the worst thing behind itself. 
Karel Žárský, the owner of the firm of Farmet, took the price for the first rank of the competition Vodafone Firma the year in the last age-group towards. 
The jury acknowledged then the efforts with which it stamped an enterprise from the small tool construction in eská Skalice from the ground that hundreds of millions of turnovers does. 
"I can say that this assessment encourages not only me myself, but also all my employees and confirmed our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," says the previous year winner. 
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet the effort to do something useful stood. 
And when then the state offered his father Karel Žárský as compensation for the property confiscated by the communists a small workshop to the lease, he did long not hesitate, his career in the company in which it was until then busy made whistle and an own company for the production of plastic tubs founded with a few comrades of his father. 
Short time later it began to concentrate on vegetable oil presses. 
Within 18 years they are to the tallest manufacturers of automatic presses in whole Central Europe climbed up. 
But first through the success in the mentioned competition and his Medialisierung it kicked in also into the consciousness of the non-compartment public. 
"Not only, that our customers perceive the brand Farmet now clearly more intensely, to be able to cooperate with a company that achieved the maximum success in their country, also our foreign partners began the circumstance to attach bigger value," Karel Žárský says. 
The last year did not stand at Farmet, however, only in the sign of the victory euphoria. 
The assessment went out of 2009 from the economical results of the enterprise in the year 2008 and a part. 
And in just 2009 the most difficult year was for the sale of tool construction products. 
The crisis, that then still less the citizens, but particularly enterprise shook, reached just their climax - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and to restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies. 
"We could not escape this situation of course either." 
"The turnovers fell off about 40 percent, we had to restrict the production and catch even to dismissals," declares Karel Žárský 
A viable enterprise must take also such unpopular measures sometimes. 
Succeeded, however, in getting the situation into the grip and holding the company in the black also when with smaller profits, than before the crisis. 
At one the enterprise was not willing to do cutbacks - with the investments in the research and development. 
"From the subsidy we built a research and training center, we confirmed our presentation on international fairs and we gained main prices in the case of domestic exhibitions," says Žárský. 
Everything shows that we had overcome the crisis. 
The turnovers also increase again and with them the number of new employees. 
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy of the victory - however in quieter atmosphere, Karel Žárský makes be orientated."
