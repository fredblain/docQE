Pilsner ground grounds - arrests of the police at a public announcement 
In the building of the ground ground in Pilsen the anticorruption police carried out in the last days arrests. 
In this case the local media-entrepreneur and estate agent Lubos G. was led away to handcuffs by the detectives. 
This had attempted supposedly to manipulate a just occurring public competition for the handling of restitution claims so that the plots offered in the competition fell to a concrete prospective customer. 
Half a million is supposed to have paid this Lubos G. for that. 
"To this time I can only confirm that the police follow a person because of the offense of fraudulent machinations at a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner one prosecution of the newspaper "Právo," it can not give further details with regard to the current investigations. 
24 hours later the 46-year old entrepreneur was released by the police again. 
In which way it could manipulate the public competition, one can only speculate on that faced with the sparse official information. 
The speaker of the Lubomír erná ground ground led onto the related question from Právo, the police carried out arrests in the Pilsner branch of the ground ground in fact and this during a public competition. 
"It was a question around a client and by no means of one of our employees," it concretized. 
The public competition had followed woman erná the correct denomination "Request to the offer delivery of claims to the transfer of plots according to the ground law" and would occur in cases in which several proposers express interest at the offered plot. 
"These persons offer within the framework of the request a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled through the transfer, as the property value called out." 
"According to the offered claims the precedence of the potential acquirers is defined, afterwards the ground fund transmits the plot to the person with the highest offer," the speaker of the ground declares. 
Information were available to Lubos G. obviously, who had enrolled himself there onto the request and since he himself was an entitled person since it a series of restitution claims had been bought he offered one plot interests, that he withdraws from the competition. 
Obviously against a fat compensation. 
That would be also a sufficient declaration for why he had such a great amount of money during his arrest with himself. 
Lubos G. had already in the past far too good contacts to the Pilsner ground fund. 
So he played also in the Causa of the former head of the ground ground Václav Sankota a role which was pursued legally because he handed over in replacement restitutions plots to which already location decisions to projects had been made. 
Then Lubos G. of the ground fund acquired for example also plots that were certain to the construction of public streets, in a more exact way said, at the place where the construction of the Zufahrtsmagistrale to the trade area Borské poles was planned. 
Later he exchanged these very favorably with the municipal council for a house directly in the historical center of the city which climbed over the value of the plots far. 
The city hall had to endanger then heavy Herzens Kleinbeigeben in order the project not through the blocking of the plots.
