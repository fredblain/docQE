A choice setback 
Nobody had expected that the choices would be perfect on the 28th November in Haiti. 
But the facts surpassed the apprehensions of the election officers that were urgent for the shaken country for the help by far. 
Full ballot boxes, multiple given voices, voter registration cards in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidations were only a part of the problems. 
Polling stations opened with delay lasting for hours. 
Many Haitians from whom many had become homeless through the earthquake in January roamed in search of an option. 
Finally some completely gave up. 
A dozen premiership candidates, under that unites supposed top riders, demanded due to an alleged fraud the cancellation of the election results. 
In the whole country it resulted in in part violent protests. 
Nevertheless Edmond Mulet, the conductor of the UN-mission in Haiti, referred to the choice "as quite good in many interests." 
According to a cautious statement of observers of the organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "these irregularities" do not "make the process necessarily invalidly" to like to be so seriously it also." 
In other words, the show goes on. 
The choice authority which is supposedly obliged to the unpopular parting president René Préval and to his candidate, Jew Célestin, will announce the provisional results on 7th December. 
The expected second ballot is arranged for January. 
There is still hope into the choice. 
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap-musician Michel Martelly and the former ridge-Lady Mirlande Manigat, pulled back their initial nullity complaint. 
When Jew Célestin, that at the voters only small or no approval at all finds, declared as the winner of the second ballot by the Wahlberhörde, this could lead to problems. 
Due to the cholera-epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents a small poll was feared. 
Many Haitians were hindered the choice day through lacking organization at the voice delivery. 
Shortly before choice beginning approx. 250.000 identity cards which are needed for the choice were not distributed yet. 
It stands a lot on the game. 
The giver countries consider a legitimate, acknowledged government as an important step during the reconstruction of Haiti. 
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
