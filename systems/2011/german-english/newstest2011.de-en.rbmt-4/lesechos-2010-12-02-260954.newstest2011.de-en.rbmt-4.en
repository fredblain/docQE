Second mandate: the obviousness 
De Gaulle had really hesitated. 
Mitterand had made be believed, that he hesitates. 
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the least hesitation. 
And Nicolas Sarkozy still little as these. 
The next one calls a mandate in the Elysée. 
The current head of state will be a candidate ergo in the year 2012. 
But the obviousness does not stand to the page of the mystery which sticks to the premiership function well to face. 
Therefore one must do as if the doubt would exist from now on. 
In the one, as also in the other sense. 
In 2006 Jacques Chiracs set the supporters, a third mandate is not impossible without believing even in that. 
On 15th November Nicolas Sarkozy assured in serious clay to make his decision "sometime in the fall of the year 2011." 
That it remember at the Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of that one UMP parliamentarians the perspectives of "two mandates" would let, feverishness had spread accordingly a little bit. 
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy? 
Far lackedly. 
The president made be reminded only of the constitution change of 2008 restricting the number of the five year long terms of office only to two. 
It did not do a determination, any announcement. 
It is not the first time that he mentions the premiership choice on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous clay. 
"You have in the worst case another seven and a half years with me, or at best," it declared to them in July 2009. 
Onto a new one in May 2010: Does not "believe that I do not think about the phase after that." 
His words of the day before yesterday do not turn him more into the candidate than on day before; but neither little. 
They should cause comments, then for a twofold reason. 
The acceleration of the race around the candidacy with the hp on a page. 
The photo of the competition with Ségolène Royal, who drives Nicolas Sarkozy for this purpose, is not to be revealed, however, itself. 
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in the year 2012, that many members of the hp earlier than accepted exhort to the challenge. 
The bad inquiries on the other hand. 
The voters would prefer to the first Male the rights a candidacy of François Fillon that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to inquiry of the BVA-L'Express). 
"We have a candidate, and there are not with the UMP any discussions about that," immediately and cautiously the environment of the prime minister reacted. 
"When it would be a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre informs of gathering-aryne. 
"He will believe always in being able to triumph," Alain Juppé, who came with the obviousness to terms, corrects.
