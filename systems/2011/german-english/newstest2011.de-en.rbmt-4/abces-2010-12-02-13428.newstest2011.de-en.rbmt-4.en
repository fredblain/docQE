No objections of the Spanish government against CIA-flights 
The Spanish government did not have any objections to the CIA flights with Taliban- and Al-Qaida-caught about Spanish state field after Guantánamo, as from a telegram of the ambassador of the USA. in Madrid follows. 
The documents seen of Wikileaks enhüllten and onto the daily paper "El País" (by cables) reflect that. It is added that the former deputy head of the government María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded the Spanish government is supposed to be informed "in order to prove that foreign airplanes which fly over Spain are controlled adequately." 
In June 2006, after the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the aid to human rights-despising practices in a Duzend was accused countries, under that also Spain, the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed. 
The deputy head of the government added, the report of the council affected Zapatero in the offside and confirmed, Spain does not have to hide anything in this matter. 
"De la Vega underlined Spain does not have any objections to the secret service flights about Spanish state field." 
"You" would only simply like "to be informed" in order not to be surprised in an unprepared way, tells Aguirre by cables. 
Also the former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government of "this matter does not want to give any great attention although the government has only few influence possibilities since these would lie in the hands of the judges." 
The public prosecutor Vicente González made to the message understand for his part in January 2007, that it the judicial initiative which to apply for would not block Deklassifizierung of the documents of the Spanish secret service headquarters (CNI) and the defense minister about the CIA flights.

In spite of that the USA about the "apparent coordination were more worried "between the Spanish public prosecutor and the German public prosecutors" than about the deklassifizierte information of the CNI's and the Ministry of Defense's. 
"This coordination between independent lower seekers becomes our efforts for the discrete use between governments verkomplizieren," Aguirre laments. 
At a lunch in March 2007 which the ambassador of the USA and the Spanish Minister of the Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated in latter commented, that "although the Spanish judges are concerned about their independence insanely strongly and would do what they hold for appropriate" it his employees instructions has given, "to avoid in order to make the tension fade "blown up rhetorical comments." 
The ambassador expressed also his concern on the approach of the PP in this matter. 
"In spite of their in general pro-American attitude our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt about that from a tip, that the government Zapateros tolerates actions of the USA that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights or ignored them deliberately, capital will beat even if these disclosures could affect the government of the USA negatively" he emphasizes.
