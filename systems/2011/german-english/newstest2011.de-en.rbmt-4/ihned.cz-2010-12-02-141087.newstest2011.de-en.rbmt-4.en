An opinion poll which tidies up senseless rules 
The opinion poll around the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneur competition for the fourth time. 
Some senseless rules it succeeded already, to obtain from the world. 
The duty became the doubtful winner of the next age-group of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the year," to get documents onto authorities, to be available the online ones. 
So more than one third decided of not completely four thousand voice-giving entrepreneurs. 
So the social security administration demanded a paper departure from the commercial register, even if the official would have been able to call it up through two mouse clicks. 
Thanks to the opinion poll this is changed now. 
"The Czech Social Security Administration will not demand in future in the case of controls any departures from the commercial register anymore from social security payers," mentioned the speaker of SSZ Jana Buraová. 
It is sense and purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the year" to take all rules and orders under the magnifier to have to be given to the entrepreneurs in Czechia and to disconnect the senseless ones. 
This is a part of an entrepreneur competition this year already for the fourth time, that of the tsch. Economic newspaper (HN) is organized and delighted popularity increasing in public. 
When in the last year onto the three thousand persons at the vote involved, it was this year already four thousand. 
No miracle, because still there is an amount of legal duties that only and only for this purpose serve for hindering the enterprise activity. 
"What affects for example the number of the income tax forms, we take a front rank in the world one," Karel Havlíek of the union of small and centrally located enterprises and traders of the Czech Republic notices. 
The simplification of the entrepreneurial activity is in the last years the proclaimed objective of all governments. 
In the comparison to the world the situation hardly improved in Czechia, however. 
According to information of the World Bank Czechia takes the 74th rank with respect to the enterprise conditions, in the comparison to the previous year one around eight places worse placement. 
The competition absurdity of the year was called out for the first time in the year and happens every year according to same scenario. 
Everyone can announce administrative and bureaucratic nonsense of April up to the copy deadline of the competition at the end of September. 
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used for the registration. For that the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "antiprice" and the public makes vote on the Internet on the web pages www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz. 
It the absurdity that gets most voices triumphs. 
Already more than a hundred were said to the this year's opinion poll in a more exact way, 105 senseless rules and orders announced. 
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists. 
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are so for example also regulations, that maintenance vehicles have to pay toll for motorways and expressways or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must do every two years. 
The list of the this year's "seven" is published on the pages of the competition. 
The proclamation of the competition in each case at the beginning of November on the Prager Wenzelsplatz is part of a happening which also personalities of the political and public life participate in regularly. 
This year was for example Eva Svobodová, the directress of the association of small or centrally located enterprises and traders of the Tsch. Republic as well as Petr Kuel, the president of the chamber of commerce of the Tsch. Republic near the climax of the competition with of the lot. 
"Where the state flings the entrepreneurs sticks between the legs, there can not be any real economical upswing, therefore it is my objective to pick up every year of at least thirty Paragrafen that today complicate their enterprises for the entrepreneurs still unnecessarily," Martin Kocourek, the minister of industry and trade with, split up. 
The efforts to obtain senseless orders from the world show effect. 
In the year 2007 the duty imposed on entrepreneurs disturbed the people the most, to have to announce to the trade office at the place of their constant firm three days in advance the intention to want to go with a booth to an exhibition or kermess. 
This duty was canceled by virtue of a novelette of the trade law. 
The duty, that 2007 the second-largest number the voices' kept - the duty, to have to announce official trips of employees to the labor office in the extent up to 30 days - so-called "Green Party member Karte" was eliminated through the law about them. 
And - all good things' are three: 
The regulation that imposed it on physiotherapists was chosen for the absurdity of the year 2009 in the consulting room a mirror, a refrigerator and two scales have stood. 
This regulation was quite moderated by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare this year - the refrigerator duty was omitted.
