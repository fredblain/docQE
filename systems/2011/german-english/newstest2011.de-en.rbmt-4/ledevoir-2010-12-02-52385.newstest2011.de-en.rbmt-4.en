Barometer of verantworungsbewussten consumption - The "green" label is not confidence-raising 
Greener, but frankly sceptical. 
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence in the main protagonists of the lasting growth, however, in the same way little for the labeled brands or the eco-markings which are supposed to control his choice. 
Damage although it swims in a media-effective universe, where it teems from information for the benefit of a more responsible consumption only so: the barometer of responsible consumption has to lament a lack of credible information, an inadequacy showed that looks recognizable as a brake of his engagement as the first reading that yesterday was kept off. 
Although they drove forward the consumption of the so called socially compatible products in the year 2010, nevertheless the Quebecer seem to express credit little to those ones which these attempt to sell. 
Two thirds the Quebecer population admits to give little belief to the environmental engagement of the companies just the same in fact as to the green enterprise advertising so the instrument worked out from the responsible consumer center of the university Sherbrooke betrays. 
Another discovery: half of the consumers doubts about the trustworthiness of the certificates official, added to the supposedly fair products, but also the plausibility of the products and brands which declare themselves as ecology-minded, so the barometer. 
To same pattern the discourse of the politicians is taken on this topic only by 14,6% of the Quebecer of population seriously. 
The information with regard to responsible consumption shines nevertheless importantly for the stimulation of this consumption segment which is stimulated in approximately only a third's of the Quebecer consumers times. 
In Fact emptiness and doubtful character of the information subdued the eagerness of 46% of the consumers. 
This is the second according to the higher price of the products, on the part of the barometer brake identified. 
In addition a third of the Quebecer of the indicated efficiency of the green products and services that one is bothered to them to put onto the hand stands mistrustfully opposite. 
According to another communication over half of the consumers their habits had already changed in the year 2010 and changed mainly the brand of a or several products in order to give Ausdruck to their conviction. 
According to barometer they had favored also to 61% of purchases with traders of their quarter and favored the purchase of food built on in their region. 
Greener and more responsible - the index of the ecology-minded consumption had reached this year one 64 of the maximum value of 100 - the homo consumus the Quebec's loves it, to present oneself as a king of the recycling that attempts to reduce his tracks left behind in the environment in his seeing to the animal protection. 
Nevertheless the social and ecological consciousness seems nevertheless to stop for his car, so the barometer: just once 28% of the Quebecer declared to have used 2010 public means of transportation in the year or to have preferred the going-headquarters in order to demonstrate their ecological interest. 
Were approved also by 39,1% of the participants of this comprehensive behavior inquiry that feeds the stereotyped ideas the resting-walking as well as the bike driving.
