Worldwide plan for the renewal of the light 
The UNO suggested yesterday a plan for the renewal of the light in Cancun from budget, trade and industry in 100 countries with regard to the obtaining of a decrease of the hothouse gas (FCKW) that corresponds to almost a third of the additional reduction that must be realized in order to stabilize the earth climate to 2020. 
This ambitious plan takes his position in the step of the concrete large projects which the UNO hopes for rendering into Cancun in order to compensate the absence of compelling reduction obligations of the industrialized countries. 
According to the yesterday proposed plan the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1,8 billion tons (Gt) of the FCKWs passed on due to the light onto the earth, when the white-hot pears that up to now still of 50 to 70% represent a monopoly on the market through fluorescing or better even, through LED (LED) would be replaced. 
The light is responsible for 8% of the worldwide emissions. 
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the waste gases of the worldwide vehicle fleet. 
In Copenhagen last year had themselves the tall waste gas emitters as the United States, China, Europe and others under which also Canada counted, obliged to voluntary reduction plans that 49 Gt should turn down the global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt. 
From this balance one would have to deduct, however, another 5 Gt in order to stabilize the climate rise from today up to the year 2020 around 2 degrees centigrade in order to prevent that this gets out of control. 
In the white-hot pears escapes from 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light. 
With the compact phosphor pears the energy consumption reduces by 75%, with the new LED electric bulbs one reduces this energy demand again around the twofold thing. 
The compact phosphor pears hold on average between 6000 to 10,000 hours. 
The new LED electric bulbs, as for example the ones that the manufacturer Philips launched this week - this society participated after all in the UNO study - have a durability of 25,000 hours and 80% of little energy use as a white-hot pear, which a hint of the saving-possibilities of the exchanging plan provides that is supposed to be used in 100 countries. 
Next to the fact, that iese completely novel electric bulbs only to give very little heat, they can function also with a rheostat. 
And they do not contain any mercury. 
Several specialists showed that compact phosphor pears show reserves since they contain mercury and that one must dispose it therefore as a requires special disposal, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except for to set the producers a counter availably. 
The compact phosphor pear does not represent the main sources at mercuric emissions on the planet, however, according to the report, but rather the coal-fired power stations that emit more mercury considerably in order to produce the electricity wasted by the white-hot pears. 
Only in the United States these coal-fired power stations emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually. 
The report explains in detail the profits which every country would erwirtschaften thanks to this international program. 
Indonesia would save so for example a billion dollars annually CO2 during the purchase of electricity and eight million tons, that means an equivalent of 3,5 coal-fired power stations whose edification Indonesia would cost 2,5 billion.
