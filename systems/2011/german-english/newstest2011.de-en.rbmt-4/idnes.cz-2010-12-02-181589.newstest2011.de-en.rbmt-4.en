The army has so many fuses, that one could completely wrap around Czechia you to hold, however, only two years 
The Czech Army bought 445 kilometers fuses, to be ignited with Sprengsätze. 
Per year before the Ministry of Defense had provided with already 224 kilometers onto the army warehouses fuse. 
It is already calming know, that the armed forces for 225 years have worried. 
The problem is only the durability of the fuses - two, at most, however, four years. 
The army bought the fuses of the limited company STV Group, a. see for foolish 40 million crowns. 
In his reason for the purchase of this tremendous amount fuse the general staff MF DNES answered, the soldiers would consume annually fuse onto the 60 kilometers. 
According to the investigations of army pyrotechnists, that spoke TO MF DNES about that, it follows from this specification that the whole army would have to complete an extremely intense pyrotechnic training annually - of all generals and officers of the army command, up to the secretaries and cleaning ladies. 
Defense minister Alexandr Vondra and army general Vlastimil Picek not excluded. 
Only so the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers fuses could be justified to some extent. 
This length corresponds after all to 25.000 detonations. 
However, these army supplies would suffice for more than ten years also so. 
When, however, still the old rule of experts is valid, that for the training of every new regular soldier two meters completely suffice fuse, then the army got a calming stock through these new purchases - also from the viewpoint of the climbed need of the engineer and special units - for the already mentioned 225 years. 
In this case soldiers of the quickness use brigade complained recently with the defense minister Vondra, they would not have almost any cartridges for small arms anymore so that firing-exercises are strongly restricted because of the missing means. 
To completely be silent from the pants lack. 
"I do not understand either why they buy such vast quantities fuses from us." 
But finally that is their decision, they will know already what they need it to." 
"For us the army is a good customer, that we would like to come as traders largely towards," the marketing manager of the STV Group Jan Dcký says. 
Jan Pejsek, the speaker of the Ministry of Defense establishes the purchase with that Hunderter kilometer fuse, the army would have provided itself with this "ammunition" so at least for ten years. 
Jan Dcký of the STV Group even speaks, however, only of two years only from a four year long service life of the fuses and police and army pyrotechnists. 
"In the case of perfect storage also the four mentioned years are presumably possible," adds one of them who, however, wants to remain unnamed in order not to be accused of the criticism as a soldier at the army. 
After the service life any ammunition must be tested thoroughly whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the life of the soldiers. 
These tests are not, however, for nothing, but they cost further money. 
A further argument of the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers fuse. 
"You cost us sixty percent less, as the last year delivery of 244 kilometers," speaker Pejsek informs us of the point of view of the buyers of the Ministry of Defense. 
Only for the comparison: The annual consumption of fuses of pyrotechnists of the police that liquidates ammunition from the second world war or the Soviet brother army does not exceed hardly for already some years 1.500 meters. 
And the police order always only such amounts of this ammunition which can still consume it before course of the service life. 
Already because of the security of the pyrotechnists, in addition one holds the possibility to flexible purchases so more modern and thus also reliable fuses' open. 
The Ministry of Defense has anyhow gigantic problems during the liquidation Zehntausender tons of ammunition from times of the Warschauer contract, when the two hundred thousand-headed Czechoslovak nation army prepared itself for their campaign to the Rhine. 
According to the pyrotechnists, who spoke TO MF DNES, the same problem expects the Czech armed forces in a few years during the liquidation Hunderter kilometer old fuses, that bought it today so "favorably."
