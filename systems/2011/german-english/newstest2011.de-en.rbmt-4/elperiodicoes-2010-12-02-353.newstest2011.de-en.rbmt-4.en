Zapatero and the red line of Germany 
Berlin decided for the Beibehalt of the euro, but made conditions for the entire European Union simultaneously. 
The tensions on the markets activated a double answer of the government. 
On the one hand José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero presented new adaptation measures, begun with tax reductions for Small- and Kleinstunternehmen, the regulation of time work enterprises or the cancellation of the 426 euros of support for unemployed persons that do not get any unemployment pay, up to the denationalization of 49 percent of AENA, of the administration of the airports Barajas and El Prat as well as 30 percent of the state lottery. 
On the other hand the deputy head of the government, Elena Salgado, supports the criticism with the aid of the former government president Felipe González at the chancellor Angela Merkel as persons responsible, that the present crisis has sworn. 
How are these processes to be understood? 
It is anticipated, that Merkels is position no error of their public relations. 
On the contrary, it is a question of a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro. 
In this case Germany takes a basically new perspective for the organization of our future which collides with the maintaining of the traditional traditions of a majority of his partners. 
Faced with the resistances in Europe one begins more than three possible ways out in Germany from the crisis too spekuliern. 
The First: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries during which south would have to leave the euro room. 
The Second: The Reintroduction of the German Marks - although that rings at the time of rather according to Science Fiction -, supports from a majority of the public opinion, approx. 50 percent of the population. 
The third parties: A conversion of the euro according to German proposals. That means: more macroeconomic control; severe housekeeping; Penalization of the countries which infringe the handicaps; möglichereweise the failure of some countries as well as the expansion of the costs of potential adaptation measures onto the private sector. 
The German position is unequivocal and emerges already for some time. Therefore there are not now any excuses. 
First 2009, than both the IWF and the European commission created stimuli for deficits and a constitution reform pulled the German government out of the sleeve in order to prevent this from 2016. 
That was the first sign for the drifting between the, what Germany held for necessary (severe tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of his European partners, including France. 
The Central European country put the second sign when Merkel postponed the decision for the rescue of Greece painfully. 
Then that was criticized strongly. But fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public one and the published opinion were absolute against a rescue of Greece. 
Finally Merkel comes in the last October days again with an unequivocal position. It demands a reform of the descendants of the European Union in order to facilitate the rescue of a country and to engage the private lenders simultaneously to bear a part of the costs. 
This position was interpreted as anti-European, there they the Ireland crisis and following everything drove forward. 
But their proposal, although something sweetens, was accepted. In the next months we will participate in the reform of the European Union which is supposed to facilitate these measures from 2013. 
Germany drew a red line which proposes not to cross it. 
It says it to all of them that - even if now unpopular measures must be taken - there will not be the old mode of operation of the euro from this appointment anymore. 
In 2013 the year of birth of a new currency room will be in which the contravening countries in a hard way are punished, can be forced to that to declare oneself in an insolvent way and in this case the private sector must take over a part of the costs. 
Germany shows us that we must break a hard growth course with high saving and investment rates, moderation of the consumption, improvement of the productivity and competitive capacity as well as positive aussen-economical balances. 
The other alternative that is based on indebtedness and building trade with gigantic holes in the balance of payments so as it was mentioned by Spain in boom times, will not be accepted simple. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would do badly at not understanding it. 
It is not a question only of driving the state deficit up to the year 2013 on three percent. 
The demands are much harder. 
And the worst thing which we could do under these conditions is to deceive us ourselves. 
I hope for the present turbulences changing into more rest. 
And that we will use the possibilities which are offered to us up to the spring 2013. 
It seems that Zapatero understood that also so, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the discussion with the large-scale enterprises on the last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) refers to that, that in spite of the criticism at Merkel the hypothesis, to create order in the own house, their way has prepared. 
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look like this that something would be changed at that. 
Under the possibilities taken into account that one is that we would have to leave the euro room crammed with few serious countries not to exclude. 
In This Case Germany could say still to us it warned us.
