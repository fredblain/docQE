The correct mattress and the correct bed rust? Women have other wishes than men 
Not the most fabulous bed frame, but the quality of the sunbathing area - therefore mattress and rust form the good bed. 
These must complement themselves harmoniously, however, in order to be raked to the wishes of the concrete user. 
During the selection many things play a role - the weight, the size, the health state and last but not least also the sex of the sleeper. 
Also the interior in which Matratze and rust have to subordinate themselves is just as important. 
Typical example? 
In a weekend house in which regularly does not give a good heat latex mattresses are not well suitable since they need much longer in order to become warm. 
In addition they are clearly heavier than usual polyurethane-mattresses are. 
And - they should be turned regular. 
If indeed they do not have enough Entlüftungskanälchen in the core and still lie on a firm plate for this purpose, moisture builds up: It is not therefore impossible that mold forms itself under it. 
During the choice it plays of course also a role what one is used to. 
Who was longer time abroad, where very high mattresses with soft shift are usual, will be able to become accustomed to a low mattress with hard surface heavily. 
"Presumably all ice hockey players that came back from the NHL complained with me, that they can not sleep here more correctly." 
"They simply need a soft shift for their mistreated shoulders, heels and hips from Visco foam (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)." 
"I recommend these among other things also to diabetic people who suffer from a trouble of the nervous system so that they can receive the information badly of the hinges and the skin," declares Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes on upholstered furniture. 
Therefore I got already before years to many ice hockey players, however, also other customers these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam). 
"Heute is not this any problem more, because the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico offer such mattresses among other things." 
And one does absolutely not have to be a famous ice hockey player in order to learn to estimate the advantages of the Visco-Schaums. 
This "miracle" actually very simply functions. 
The foam optimalisiert his hardness and form according to the absorbed heat, differently said he cuddles up downright to the warm body at. 
Anywhere it does not press, in the night one does not roll over as after a difficult fight. 
One sleeps simply much better. 
The viskölastische foam in addition offers also protection from Dekubitus (Wound fire). 
During the choice of the mattress size one should still add the length of the soles of the foot to the height, therefore approx. 21 to 34 cm. 
Man as woman that is large onto the 180 cm need such a 210 to 220 cm long bed. 
At least 90 cm of chaise longue width should be available to each of the sleepers, together therefore 180 cm. 
Near single beds, for example with singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached. 
For the sake of the comfort and also for possible visitors. 
Otherwise the following rule of thumb is valid for the ideal bed width: "When one lies on the back," still enough place should "be" for the slightly bent arms," Ing. guesses Helena Prokopová, the guild master of the upholsterers and interior decorators that dedicates herself to the problems of the healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture already for years and presents this topic also on technical schools. 
Near a double bed everyone needs an own rust and his own mattress, to look out, however, during the purchase so that the mattresses are high also now. 
Otherwise nothing else remains, to mount as the rusts in different height and that is not for a long time possible near every bed frame. 
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, from that at least three centimeters should be allotted to the form shift and the detailed cushion. 
"With the hand or while putting down one must not sense the feathers in any case," Helena Prokopová warns. 
Every mattress requires a specific rust type. 
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and pad as Siam twins grown together do not have to search anything in the bedroom. 
These mattresses can not be ventilated and one can not wash the purchase, which today yes already gang und gäbe is. 
And since one loses sweat in a single night between 0,2 to 0,75 l is, clear, that the mattress after five to seven years becomes slow to a gigantic (and were blocked sieve). 
Also therefore specialists refuse advertising slogans, that near mattresses a lifespan of up to 25 years, to promise even lifelong guarantee. 
Every thing has their if and Aber. 
And therefore a practical council of the traders: Near mattresses of 120 or 140 cm of width one should not shun from the hygiene of the washable, strip-off purchases, nevertheless it is recommended to use a mattress schooner which one can remove easily and wash. 
Even if mattress covers with Rundumreissverschluss are today normally manufactured so that one gets two halves after the opening (immensely important for the scrubbing-process and the washing machine size!) the manipulation with bigger mattresses mutet, particularly only taken out, often as the different fight between David and Goliath at. 
Do they have a firm plate in the bed instead of a rust? 
From that in this way! 
Or at most for a bed for disliked guests and for a single night. 
Also so they should put ventilation holes on the plate more gladly (provided that already none are in that) and to use mattresses with feather skeleton and 15 cm least height with so-called bag feather core and detailed cushion. 
Polyurethane-mattresses do not belong onto such a pad. 
For grilles not adjustable with 14 to 18 spring contact strips (Lamellae) latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable (where appropriate also combinations of latex and coconut palms), always rusts with a greater slat number are paid in this case, therefore of 28 and more spring contact strips from, with Lordosenstütze in the lumbar vertebra field and the possibility to adjust the slat hardness. 
Onto adjustable lamella rusts no mattresses with feather skeleton belong since they do not react to the ergonomic change. 
Next to the attitude of the starch of the spring contact strips also specific flexible shoulder modules are offered. 
At that it works in order to push in a specific fixing of the spring contact strips that it facilitates the spring contact strips or really so too verwinkeln, that they facilitate the punctual sinking in of the shoulder of the sleeper. 
In particular for men with wide shoulders an important thing. 
There are even mattress manufacturers which started using Soft zones for the shoulder field near "gentleman mattresses." 
Also onto the ladies is thought - one grants them these soft zones in the hip area. 
For most pretentious customers point-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or rusts with point-elastic contact-pads with so-called multitorsion resilience are certain. 
The pressure is distributed onto several points through which the tension is reduced. 
But - when one to the correct mattress and used a bad (too large and plump) pillow correct rust, most advantages disappear again. 
Also here a rule of thumb: the pillow is supposed to support the head, his tops should reach only up to the shoulders so that the deltoid muscles can relax. 
Ideal appears therefore 50 x 60 cm big cushion, as for example the Scandinavians like it. 
In the side situation the pillow (together with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height. 
Our modern mattresses had something with the former (filled with hay) straw bags nevertheless common. 
Modern manufacturers always use frequent natural materials or at least their additions. 
Also near mattresses the new charm word is called "Bio." 
Instead of oil raw materials one uses increasingly more frequently naturelle oils to the production of polyurethane foams - for example castor-oil plant and soya oil. 
Soja is used presumably by all known manufacturers. 
"Are called Bio near mattresses, that their core withstands of materials in that of natural origin," declaredly Petr Vasíek of the company Tropico Plus. 
Natural materials become but also during the production of mattress covers uses - one of the first was in this case aloe Vera. 
One can treat oneself, however, also on microcapsules which spread fresh forest or lavender fragrance while sleeping. 
Also here one does a difference between Mann and woman. 
While with the men a "chilling" essence is being used from birch leaves, so that the mattress cover absorb the heat and it can cool off the body, the purchases have for effect "warming" women. 
Extracts from red peppers stimulate the blood circulation, the weaker sex becomes while sleeping therefore wohlig warm. 
And the present favorites? 
Mattresses of cold foam (he has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and also much more flexible). 
More-zone-mattresses that know exactly, where there are head, Hüfte and heels, arise through the combination of the different starch (Hardness) of cold foams and Visco-foams. 
For a high-quality mattress one has to fork out, however, 7000 crowns and more. 
Health mattresses are burdened with smaller value added tax, however, usually since they are regarded as medical aids. 
As first Czech enterprise Gumotex became this advantage zuteil. 
One sees to economize on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy. 
Occasionally there are special offers of manufacturers and traders who offer two mattresses for the price of one. 
So the brand Magniflex offers the mattress to Duofreeze with Visco-foam Memory quilted in the purchase for 11.990 CZK. 
One gets the second free for this purpose. 
It was the material Tempur which introduced the era of the viskölastischen expanded plastics with open cell structure and high density in almost cosmic speed. 
No miracle, nevertheless they were developed for the NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the starts. 
Tempur becomes with heat soft, in cool environment it consolidates in turn. 
So adjusts it to the human body perfectly and distributes the body pressure over optimal manner. 
It is not therefore only ideal to the prevention of pressure fire, but it increases the sleep comfort generally. 
Viskölastische expanded plastics are supposed to provide, however, not only near mattresses, but also with other health products as uses e.g. near specific foot cushions that the legs and the vessels relief. 
Native manufacturers use for example the expanded plastics Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
