A longer forefinger than ring fingers means a lower risk, to fall with cancer ill 
Men, whose forefinger is long, as the ring finger, are obvious one exposed to smaller risk, to fall with prostate gland cancer ill. 
That is the surprising result of a study which was published by the British Journal of Cancer on Wednesday. 
That is supposed to be associated indeed with the mirror of the masculine hormone testosterone. 
"Our results show, that the relative length of the fingers can serve for the risk of prostate gland cancer as a simple test and this in particular with men to sixty," the Mitautorin of the study, Ros Eeles, declared professor at the oncology institute at the university in Warwick. 
The finger could help so to determine which men should absolutely subject themselves to a prostate gland cancer test particularly, if genetic risks or other factors of risk are available, as for example familiar sanitary loads, Ms Eeles added. 
In the period of 1994-2009 she hunted more than 1500 patients with prostate gland cancer with their colleagues in Britain, simultaneously however also 3000 healthy men. 
With more than half of the participants of the study the forefinger was shorter to the right hand than the ring finger was. 
The same probability of prostate gland cancer was valid for these men, as for 19 percent of those men, whose struggling and showing-finger were now long. 
With men that Zeigefinger was longer than the ring finger this risk sank, however, around 33 percent, with men to sixty quite about 87 percent. 
The relation of the length of the two mentioned fingers that form themselves already in the pränatalen age reflects obviously the different mirrors of sex hormones to which the child was misfired in the womb. 
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer forefinger. 
Former investigations showed that the testosterone just speeds up the growth of prostate gland cancer. 
Václav Paes, leading Czech geneticist and former chairpersons of the academy of the sciences, TK said, this study is fleetingly known to him, nevertheless he does not hold the relation for "completely proven" between the finger length and the cancer risk up to now.
