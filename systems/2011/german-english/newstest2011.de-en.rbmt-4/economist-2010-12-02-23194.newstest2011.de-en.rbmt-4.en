Secret in the middle of 
In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, found out a wave of sympathy which drove their popularity rate up onto more than 50% around 20 points. That is the highest value since their choice in the year 2007. 
Whether this helps her to a re-election, however, in the next year depends on whether the Cristina Fernández mourning visibly is more willing to compromise than their late husband, their predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner. 
The signs for that are not unequivocal. 
Néstor Kirchner, who controlled the economic policy also after the choice of his wife, made frequently budgets which did not consider the tax yields, the economic growth and the inflation fully. 
This allowed it the president pair, to distribute the extragains according to own discretion. 
On the paper the Fernández-government lost in the last year the majority in the congress. 
Nevertheless the opposition is divided and Kirchners death after a heart attack on 27th October led to further disagreements. 
Some dissidents from the rows of the ruling Peronisten positioned themselves behind Cristina Fernández. 
However, after chaotic meetings (in the case of which a parliamentarian beat to another into the face and others accused the government of the bribery) the congress did not succeed in adopting the budget for 2011. 
"I" will not "discuss" about that," according to the president. 
The budget 2010 is valid now also for the next year, through what the president has distributed still more occasion money according to own discretion. 
The economy run hot: probably it will increase this year around up to 9%. 
The official inflation rate is currently near 11,1%, however, numerous private estimates - and wage demand of the trade unions - drive the value onto almost 30%. 
Kirchner that took over the office in 2003 when Argentina was joggled from depressions declared growth and poverty abatement as his main aim, and not the inflation lowering. 
He refused the cooperation with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned the National Institute for statistics and Volkszählung INDEC, that then the official inflation statistics schönte. 
Can Fernández take a more moderate way now? 
She appealed to the private enterprise and the union leaders for conversations. 
And according to official statements wage increases are supposed to be restricted in the next year on 18%. 
The high world market prices for Argentina's farm products gave a strong impetus to the economy. 
Nevertheless the inflation untergrub the growth push through a great devaluation in the year 2002. 
Possibly Cristina Fernández would like to connect Argentina again finance-economically for this reason to the rest of the world. 
At the beginning of this year the government found an agreement with security holders who had refused the former debt rescheduling of the country in the year 2001. 
Now it seems to push Fernández onto an agreement with the financiers from the Paris club, that they approx. $6,7 Mrd. owes. 
The Kirchners had always refused an inspection through the IMF, as somewhere else usual. 
However, in the last month the minister for economic affairs Amado Boudou announced that the fund will perform "technical support" during the creation of a new national consumer price index. It looks as if this were the first step to the purge of the INDEC. 
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active on completion of their term of office also without the support through their husband. 
When yes, she needs the support of the middle class for that, that has most mainly enough of the Kirchnerismus. 
If the Argentines return in March from their summer vacation, the wave of the Sympatie which was brought to her will have faded away. 
If she liked to win a further choice, she must decide, whether she puts aside many for political decisions of their husband quietly and quietly.
