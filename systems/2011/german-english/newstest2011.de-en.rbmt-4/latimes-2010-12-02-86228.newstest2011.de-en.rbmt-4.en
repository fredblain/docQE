Grammy-nominations: The jazz-singer Esperanza Spalding was distinguished surprisingly in the category Newcomer of the year 
When you on demand a president auftritts, the people will notice it. 
Esperanza Spalding asked president Obama himself for performing during the ceremony on the occasion of the Nobel prize awarding 2009. Now the 26-year old jazz-bassist and singer was nominated Ã¼berrachsenderweise for the this year's Grammy in the category Newcomer of the year. 
Faced with the fact that Spalding is already a celebrated star since their album "Esperanza" In 2008 in the jazz-scene the nomination appears a little bit unusual. However, it corresponds to the Grammy-rules according to which an artist may have handed over at most three white poplars for publication of the album which he became known with in the wide public. 
Your ambitious album from the year 2010, "Chamber Music Society," is certainly a step forward. And one can compare Spalding quietly with their exhilarated voice and a good feeling for pop, radio and Latin Music, with Norah Jones 2003, who great success comes in the year 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category the nomination Spaldings nearest. 
Further "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer trio was nominated the album in the category instrumental white poplars. This darling of the critics experienced a huge success through that. 
"Moody 4B" of the practised saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the Keyboarders John Beasley belong to the competitors Iyers among other things. 
Trombone Shorty, a robbery-united favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBOs "Treme," Contemporary jazz in which otherwise white poplars are rather to be found by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber was distinguished in the category. 
The Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk-musician Darcy James Argue received in the category major group presumably earned attention. He competes thus with the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber-jazz and the adventure-merry Dave Holland and his octette that Life-Ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bass player as a democratic Bandleader.
