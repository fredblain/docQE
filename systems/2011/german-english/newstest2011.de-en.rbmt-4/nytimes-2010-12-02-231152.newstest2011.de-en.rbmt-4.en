Police actions in China become gentler 
As a training officer Tang Shenbin strode over an urban place, checked his nervous subordinates and gave in this case commands with military Authorität and lowered voice. 
He wanted his feminine members of the Chengguan - China's robust guardians of the urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their inclination for the power - to impress the spectators. 
"Answer!" 
"Look straight ahead"! 
"Shows to them," he whispered to them "as pretty girls are so"! 
Four girls, hardly the teenager age entwachsen, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and trousers stood tight. 
Four pairs of black court shoes stood in straight row. 
Four tidy hats were perfectly on that with blue-white striped bows held hair. 
"For me they look average" Mr Tang notices contemptuously. 
"Models are pretty." 
Several governments attempted already to polish up the image of China's city inspectors. 
In a city all new applicants must have a college end. 
The province Guangdong imported a radiantly blue uniform instead of the grey-green one. 
Wuhan in central-China replaced power by low stiffness: In 2009 50 officials circled according to reports a snack car properly not put forward and stared at the operator until this packed after half an hour and left the place. 
Xindu, a municipal district in Chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants, would like to change the image basically. 
Since 2003 13 women intensify the urban police cars. You were selected specific due to their appearance, their good figure and their youth. 
You are supposed to give a softer, feminine aspect to the gross police. 
However, unfortunately also Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the bad picture which the Chinese of these city commands have. 
With right, so the critics. 
Differently than the police officials may put through the urban laws these only with the aid of fines or other administrative punishments. 
Nevertheless the Chinese media show another picture routinely. 
In January 2008 officials beat a spectator to death in the province Hubei when this filmed it with his mobile at how they suppressed a protest action against a dump. 
In the last year a training manual of the Pekinger officials was stolen and published in the Internet. In that it is described how delinquents without bloodsheds can be beaten up. 
This year a Shanghaier watermelon trader suffered brain injuries after a brawl with five officials. 
A video game bristling with power, that from the Internet can download, shows in China trained officials at an attack on barrowmen. 
"Chengguan frightens the government," the national newspaper complained China Daily in the last year, after further controversies concerning the tactics. 
The newspaper required a "really thorough purge." 
Sceptic are the present approach for clearly inadequate. 
When the Distrik in October by advertisement searched eight feminine recruits, an Editorial put news into the Beijing Evening the question whether the women would have real tasks or are supposed to be used only as optical diversion. 
Probable both. 
According to job advertisement women were searched in the age by 18 to 22 with good figure and "harmonious features." 
You should be large above average - over 1,5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 customs. 
The employment relation ends with attaining of the 26th year. 
According to the officials the activity is physically too hard for women over 25. 
"The most important is their image," an unnamed district official served with the quasi government web page Rednet.com. 
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their external appearance, as size, weight, features, and so forth 
Then temperament and "internal qualities" come. 
"Is feminine Chengguan as flower vases," he said and added, "nevertheless in addition they still have other duties." 
Zheng Lihua, deputy conductor of the municipal administration of the district, would not like to agree with this description, 
admitted, however, that in China size handicaps are not uncustomary in job advertisements for two kinds of sex. 
The same one is valid for regular features. 
Whether that is to be equated with good appearance is controversial in China. 
But people with hindrances or physical deformations do not need to apply. 
"We can use" here more leider no cripples or hunchbacks," according to Mr Zheng. 
"Your image would not be good." 
Liu Yi, that of a cloister near on the Baoguang place patroliert, is 22, has Apfelbäckchen and a presumably shaped mouth. 
They empfindetes not than sexist, that so big value onto their appearance is put. 
"You think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with ironic look. 
Your colleague with the dimples, the 21-year old Xu Yang, comments On "our having the task of representing the image of the city." 
According to your information they do not regret the short attitude since they would have more ambitious career plans than simply to chase only traders through the lanes in order to hinder her at the business-doing. 
Every morning the patrol deals with approx. twelve barrowmen that attempt on foot or to sell many rolls and Tofugerichte if possible on the bike before they are chased away. 
"Herr Wang, you disappear here please." 
"We already so often said that to you"! Ms Xu declares to a trader, that had fled on foot and in this case his attached on a bike cart noodle kitchen temporary in the prick had let. 
According to the officials the activity is monotonous rather than hard. 
"It is almost every day the same one," declares Huang Jing, 20, that studies marketing beings in the leisure time. 
"Everything routine." 
A reason for that is, that the feminine officials may confiscate the goods of the traders not, as their masculine colleagues. 
You can threaten delinquents only with announcing it to their masculine superiors. 
That is supposed to protect her against public ill will to which officials are frequently misfired in China. 
Hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of the province Yunnan, rampaged this year after the rumor circulated, Chengguan officials would have killed a trader. 
More than one dozen policemen and Chenguan officials were hurt during the nocturnal incident, 14 government vehicles were overturned or fire was set to them. 
Xindu kept on from such power outrages being spared to up to now. 
However, riots are not to be excluded. 
Only two blocks removes from the quiet Baonguang place, at which the feminine officials at this morning patroulierten, more than 50 persons met at a street corner. 
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, that was repaired towards the rules on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop. 
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio. 
After 15-minute hesitation the officials with grim face cleared the way to their vehicles and left with the motorcycle and his owner. 
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the masculine patrol, stayed behind. At in order to remain anonymous it turned round his white label. 
As their colleagues the coordinators - men above 40 - play a role supporting in that. 
However, they were not trained in presenting a clean image. 
"Sometimes we go ahead verbally." 
"Sometimes but also physically," Mr Li declares soberly. 
"The people with the quarrel begin most time."
