The geriatric home confirms that the deaths are not to be put down to "missing measures" 
The owners of the home for the elderly in Olot do not exclude that their nurse killed more than eleven older people 
The persons responsible of the geriatric home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave yesterday a press conference in which they put out which damage had caused the criminal actions Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse that had killed during his work at least eleven old people for whom it was responsible - the equipment. 
The conductor of the geriatric home, Joan Sala, performed in company of his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced, "La Caritat would like to accuse the person responsible (for the deaths) ," but "the right and our liability duty force us to that to accept "the process and the civil law liability." 
The equipment does not have to accept only a social renown loss because she had not found the criminal actions of the nurse in time, but pay now also a high indemnity which is charged the dependant of the victims by the legal representatives. 
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime goes back to August 2009 and that he killed since then further. 
The judge arranged the exhumation from eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric home - since he presumed that no doctor examined the deceased personally, but the formalities were run due to their age and illnesses by telephone. 
The conductor of La Caritat denied this point flatly and declared that "absent measures keinerzeit could have been the reason for the incidents." 
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "there would not be any indications" in the lawsuit for negligent actions of another person as the accused person." 
The one already Baptized as "A death angel" confessed eleven murders the day before yesterday and declared, the first crime on 29th August 2009 verübt and one months later the second old lady have murdered. 
In This Case it killed insulin with an overdose, unlike the first crime in the case of which he had given a mixture of different tranquilizers. 
The conductor of La Caritat declared the access of the personnel to the medicines is to be controlled only heavily. 
The insulin syringes and that the nurse fitted in tranquilizer cocktail from nine committed crimes at six in order to free the patients with the death from their suffering. 
However the results of the laboratory research will present, whether Vila lies and chose for his first victims in fact one little cruel death or whether he burned out these from inside in his giving them paleness lye that he murdered between the 12th and 17th October as he had done it according to confession with three women. 
In La Caritat one does not give any belief to the statements of the nurse, not even what does not affect the number of the stood murders that more could absolutely be. This attitude is justified with Vila having done very different statements in court and it not turning any sense to change his approach suddenly after eight successful murders. 
You say they provided it for themselves for this reason and for the clarification of the range of these incidents of the justice.
