Putting the finger into the wound with literature 
The second round of 'the' a walk in the case of which the participants made themselves strong for the story was 'pleasure in the language' 
"I understand that with the sex in the language, however... The finger in the wound? What is "expected" by me"? the writer Luisa Valenzüla asked that should open the second round of 'Lot placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-speaking literature and used the subtitle of their question on this occasion (on another event the Round Table was dedicated to the sex in the language, it declared). 
The finger in the wound... "brings us in trouble," the Argentine Schriftstellein spat sweetly towards the public, which mainly consisted of young people that came together on the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) which Valenzüla, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated in in order to attend to rounds moderated to this by Marisol Shultz table. 
Luisa Valenzüla read out a text which she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and which Shultz characterized as a splendid story after that. Luisa tells in first person and is the protagonist that on the search it is to find out what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, from which she receives indeed no answer, but tips for the guide of their story. 
She leaves the Infektologen convincedly: "Patience is not my strength, maybe that is my wound." 
To the end, after a frustrating approximation to the traumatologist that robbed her of the breath right on the walk, and that declares her, however, that Wunde is not a scientific concept enthült the psychoanalyst the secret: "the wound is the really Open one, the symbolic thing is the scar." 
The central figure of the story sighs facilitatedly and closes, that they "of the wound only found out that this is really open and does not "exist." But it is convinced, that the pleasure in the language and their traps mix. 
Valenzüla, the writer, played with both of them. 
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez introduced also a delighting story that he mentioned 'Praise of the invention', and that does not mention in that of the fingers in the wound indeed, but that is discovered. 
With allusions onto the magic realism it tells about a famous magician that touched the clouds, returned far traveled men or reconstructed the virtue lost by a girl. The story did an about-turn and reported about America, the great novel that from the beginning did not lack his own chroniclers, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo that criticizes the abundance of the histories told by the Eroberen. 
"Cervantes that invited us all (the writers) mocked the deceived witnesses that emerged in the histories represented as true, however, in another manner the history of Americas would never have been told - with fancy that lost even the shame." 
However, he emphasizes, "it is the madmen and liar, that imagine the things best," and there reality and lie, where one does not know to which page the story belongs anymore, where the fictitious literature reaches the peak, approximate to each other. 
He mentions that the 'tradition Cervantes' in fact. 
"We inherited from him, to be what is told." 
When it was up to Mayra Montero, she commented and the writer praised the variety of the interpretations which the FIl had contributed the invitation to to the Round table 'The finger in the wound'. 
The Cuban and Puerto Rican dedicated their contribution of the large wound of the social power that strikes their country - as whole Latin America - as a result of the fights for the drug traffic. 
"I believe, that to contain good literature, good poetry, good songs" a silent, deliberately not planned engagement," she declared, after she had emphasized that literature is communication and obligation that builds themselves "up" between the author and the readers as at a "chemical re-action." 
The Spanish poet Luis García Montero concluded the evening, whose contribution also this finger of the engaged writer in the wound of the writer hevorhob. 
He noticed that in a short-lived world also the intellectual habits and the control of the consciousness come to dogmatisms, and will forget "that behind every confirmation a small refusal stands and behind every denial a small yes." 
"Around in the possession our thought and the reality be, we must nuance: And nuancing means frequent, to put the finger into the wound and to bother those ones that feel a lot of wohler if they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in preassembled ideas without nuances, and to bother also the powerful ones that prefer it, to divide the world into black and white it noticed and invited to rediscovering the sense of the writing.
