A tenant of Bakala: It gives a good heat indeed in the stove - in spite of that higher rent pays 
An older thickset man just leaves the client center of the society RPG Byty the "coal baron" Zdenk Bakala, the tallest private owner of flat lets for rent in Czechia. 
Under the arm a folder with three new rent contracts to three apartments: for the own one and the apartments of his daughters and his son who serves just a prison sentence. 
The rent was just increased to all three within the framework of the so-called "deregulation." 
Instead of 3500 crowns of month rent the son is supposed to fork out 4100 crowns in the next year for a 2-room-apartment with kitchen of the second category. 
"And over there there is in the apartment water not once fluently warm and must heat one in a simple coal stove," he bets annoyedly on the new rent contract of the son to whose signature he has a proxy with the finger. 
"But what - signed have I, declared it half detunes and half gives up." 
The civil union BytyOKD.cz that referred to the new rent conditions as "incorrect and immoral" guesses to the tenants, the new contracts not simply to sign and to wait up to the 7th December at which proposes to publish it some instructions as one proceeds against such contracts. 
But the man beckons only off. 
"One says this, that other that," it does a dark face. 
The region Ostrava becomes like this to the big "deregulation lab." 
After New Year this deregulation awaits most flat lets for rent in Czechia whose tenants up to now do not pay any market-just rent. 
Aktuáln.cz decided therefore on going to this "lab" personally. 
The RPG waiting room in Havíov is to one of four in the region Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday breaking full. 
To stand now next to the door the bodyguards of a security agency and with it a call device. 
"Rents in 2011," a specific feeling-field shines so on the Touchscreen. 
In a word touchedly and already the device spits out a number note. 
Hardly we did not decipher the number "in 157" and already it bleeps on the big display at the cover of the waiting room. 
Half a second later it is up to one. 
A little later an older married couple enters the waiting room in order to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room is not meant apparently at all for the new rent. 
Most people are here in order to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and similar. 
From middle November the envelopes with the new rent contracts flutter to most tenants of the in total 44.000 apartments of the port folio of the RPG in the region Ostrava into the mailboxes. 
The RPG Byty suggests a rent increase of approx. 15 to 38 percent to them in the writings. 
The specific counter for the new rents in the client center is since the 18th November opened. 
"The action runs a little across a week, that is, that is first the beginning," the ladies answer to hesitation behind the counter after a moment when the "client" turns out as a journalist. 
The deregulation and Bakalas former miner apartments are an explosive topic. 
Before the choices the parliament vice-president Lubomír Zaorálek coming from Ostrava had picked up this topic from the SSD quite lauthals, no miracle, that the newspapers are full of that today. 
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them." 
"Not once ne besch. they could "exchange" toilet glasses," the at the beginning mentioned man makes himself for air. 
Until now outcrop according to the employees before all pensioner at the counter in order to convince oneself whether they really receive the promised rent reduction that RPG promises them if they sign the special offer in time. 
February rent reduced into the pleasure of one half are supposed to come also the other tenants, that sign the new rent contract up to the 15th December. 
Until now "Deregulation counter" is everything else, however, in Havíov, than overloaded from demands. 
"From the 360 clients of yesterday only about 40 to 50 were here because of the rent in the year 2011," reckon the clerks. 
RPG offers in this case both on their web pages, as also blackboards individual rent agreements, where it appears necessary. 
If the rent parties should agree not on the new rent, however, it is defined by an independent court. 
"That is not supposed to be a threat, but that is as information about those ones only to understand possible and completely legitimate legal approach," declares RPG on his web pages. 
"Here nobody goes in court," thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client center gives to her at least in part right. 
"I have 13.000 (Crowns) pension, from that 5.000 remain for me for the food," where I should "get" the money for a court quarrel, he thinks. 
Nevertheless then the employee becomes unsure. 
"Seeing once." 
"Herr Zaorálek tells them about the media, they are not supposed to sign and so the people wait still off," she admits consider. 
The adjusted rent ends in the biggest part of Czechia to New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty the rent increase is an economic necessity. 
"The existing height of the rents does not suffice once for the maintenance of the living-ground" Pavel Klimes argues, the director of the apartment Portfolios of the society RPG Byty and - just the disregard of the apartment ground criticized by the angry tenants is in opinion of the house-owners the main reason for the rent increase. 
During RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the taken rents four billion into the apartments could invest, in the four years of 2011 to 2014 it is supposed to be to 5,2 billion. 
On the grossformatigen LCD display at the cover opposite the armchairs in the waiting room of Havíov a few information in a red way radiant emerge in between again and again. 
"The rent increases in the year 2011 around 15% and less affect 31 200 apartments, that is more than 90% of the apartments of RPG." 
"Always this means at most 7,50 CZK per square meter and month," is to read on the LCD monitor. 
Only near 400 apartments from the port folio of RPG the rent increases about 38 percent to itself. 
"In these cases it is a question of the rise of extremely small rent prices from 19,66 CZK per square meter," RPG argues. 
Near 2600 apartments the rent remains in the next year on same height. 
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not push up the rents suddenly, but occurs in a step by step way within four and eight years. 
What more - that imposes enterprises a further obligation: All gains from the rent increase (see diagram) the enterprise wants to put again into the apartments, particularly into heat savings - into new windows and into the thermal insulation. 
But - with first priority people that sign the agreements on the rent increase are supposed to benefit to those ones these.
