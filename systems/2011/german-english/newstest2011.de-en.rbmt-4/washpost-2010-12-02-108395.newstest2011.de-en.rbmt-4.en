Belarus is agreed on not keeping on collecting arm-capable uranium 
In a surprising victory for president Obamas campaign to the worldwide protection of nuclear material the government announced from Belarus on Wednesday, which is a critical component of nuclear arms, that one will not collect more longer highly enriched uranium. 
The deal was announced to the exterior minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Byelorussian foreign minister Sergei Martynov in a common statement after a meeting in an additional article of the security peak. 
The US government had attempted for years to convince Belarus of that not to collect more highly enriched uranium and it seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring. 
However official of the US government told to the Washington mail that in the last two months two secret agreements were hit with Belarus in order to remove 187 pounds of arm-capable uranium from a Byelorussian research institution. 
That prepared the stage for the accord on Wednesday, to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee that remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds. 
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obamas To "Nuclear security peak of the 47 nations" of April that had excluded Belarus. 
And it was obviously good enough in order to safeguard the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next peak 2012. 
"I was really enthusiastic of the fact that they want a seat in the Nuclear security peak (of 2012)." 
"That proves to me that it functions," said Ken Luongo, president of the partnership of Global Security, a group for the promotion of the nuclear security. 
Clinton named the agreement "a very significant, important step" of Belarus. 
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to safeguard all precarious nuclear material within four years. 
Since then the US government helped six countries with becoming their highly enriched uranium loosely. 
Belarus will be the seventh. 
A dozen of countries put it under the government from George W. Bush. 
At this time Security Peak Nuclear of Obamas the Byelorussian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared, that the nation will give up never their uranium. 
"As keep highly enriched uranium -" Lukashenko said "hundreds of kilos, what is basically arm-capable, and less enriched uranium," then. 
"That is our raw material... We will not make any dirty bombs from that and we will not sell it to anybody." 
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that is everything." 
Nevertheless Belarus approximated to the USA few months ago, when it indicated interest in the meeting of an agreement. 
The first run, to remove the uranium of Belarus in October was especially complicated because the material was light verstrahlt, say official. 
It was loaded into a special train, that more than 1.300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, official say. 
The second run was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the official ones by airplane. 
The US government pays $ for these efforts to 14 million at which a majority of the money flows into the Byelorussian research with weakly enriched uranium which can not be used for nuclear weapons. 
"This was extremely cautiously coordinated and synchronized in order to establish confidence" that led to the descendant that was signed by Clinton, Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the energy ministry that works on the Global Danger Reduction, said. 
The James Martin Zentrum for studies not to be passed on estimates, that Belarus had this year of at least 88 pounds waffenf√§hhigen uranium as well as hundreds of pound at highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus wants to dissolve his warehouse according to the common descendant to 2012. 
The relationships between Belarus and the USA were for years strained, in the first place because of Lukashenkos harsh disregard the human rights'. 
But the statement of the Wednesday suggests a possible approximation. 
"The progress of these global security questions welcome being called, the United States of America and Belarus announce, that an increased respect for the democracy and the human rights have a central topic in Belarus in the improvement of the bilateral relationships and it is essential for the progress of the country and his citizens," she declares.
