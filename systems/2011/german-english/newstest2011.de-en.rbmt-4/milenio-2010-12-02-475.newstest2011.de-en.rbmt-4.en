Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava 
The national leader of the PAN declared, that former panistische party chairpersons the right to turn the National Order Commission and to demand what would grant him the right is worn. 
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, insured, that the exclusion Manuel Espino Barrientos was legally and that the former party chairperson of the PAN has turned the right at the National Order Commission and to demand what would grant him the right. 
In an interview which occurred before the complaint leadership of Gabino Cué Monteagudos as a governor of the Federal state it declared the exclusion Espinos is a decision which was made on local level. 
"It is a question of an independent decision of the order commission in Sonora." 
"Herr Espino has the right to turn to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case about the complaint way so that a decision of a responsible place is made," he added. 
On the other hand, he declared, is not to be thought at the time at 2012 and that an alliance has sat to the premiership candidates never at the negotiating table. 
Nava Vázquez was convinced of Acción Nacional following from the internal vote fortified at the coming 4th and 5th one December at which his successor is elected. 
That (an alliance in the year 2012) is not a topic which was never on the negotiating table at least until now. It was a question of a Vorschlaag for the municipality choice, it was successful and it served his purpose," he exported. 
The panistische leader declared, that the PAN on 71 years looks back dialog, therefore "the internal competition" does not "frighten us; on the contrary "we enjoy it and she fortifies us," it commented. 
He said, that the council beyond doubt that one or the best chairperson, that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, would select. Therefore he would hand over the Stafette "to that one which the council would determine." 
"I am very unconcerned and open there. I would be proud to assign the office of the party chairperson to every of the Five of them." 
It predicted, which the upswing of the party noted by the 4th July at the last choices will be reflected in the next choices although it is not at the time to think of 2012." 
"Now goes to support it the governor Gabino Cué in his task for that." 
In this connection he emphasized that the three governments which followed from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa bear the flag and would be observed in the whole country. Therefore "many hopes and longing-addictions into them are set and I am secure that Gabino is on the height of the requirements." 
When it is questioned about the criticism of the PRI at the president Felipe Calderón because of his disk course within the framework of his four year long government, César Nava appealed to the supporters of the PRI to think over the six year long period of the former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of fox terrier and Calderón, they should begin to defend it, they should "come" at last from the cupboard," he confirmed. 
He thinks, that the holder of the Federal Government expressions as it can do that one, that one in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no mouth prohibition and still less a censorship.
