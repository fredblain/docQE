The president Barack Obama supported today the national mobilization to the support of the Dream Act - law's for the legalization of undocumented students with an information on his personal blog in the social net Twitter. 
"When you for the discharge of the Dream Act - law's are, call your senators then and insist on the discharge of this law," twitterte Obama." 
His short communication contains a Cyberlink for a more extensive document which asks the public to get with their senators into contact unterzüglich since the vote of the law approaches immediately. 
"With your voice which we wait for the time came, to listen to you," it stresses. 
The information was spread after the 42 republican senators threatened all voice to jam for every law, except for the expansion of the tax reductions from the times of Bush and the financing of the government would be expanded. 
Such a blockade that was announced on a letter signed by the 42 republican senators could onto the vote of the Dream Act - law's and other projects as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the circulation of nuclear weapons affect. 
Questioned about the blockade of the republicans of the law of Dream Act and other projects, the premiership speaker Robert Gibbs said he trusts in a schedule being able to be made if the tax topic is once solved for the remaining projects. 
"I believe, we have still a lot of time..." 
"All we agree, that the tax matter must be run before end of the year..." 
"I believe, that we can reach an agreement about that at any time and after that we can "plan" the course of the rest," he said. 
The chairperson of the democratic majority in the senate, Harry Reid, told on Tuesday at, "he would become the vote on end of the debate" propose, in this way the Dream Act - law with which the initiative for the legalization of undocumented students can be synchronized from the coming Thursday in the senate although the next week would be more probable. 
The version of the Dream Act - law's and/or. the law of the American Dream would have lived about 800 000 young people that immigrated to the United States when they were not yet any sixteen years old during the last ones five years in this country and written at a higher educational facility or near the army are, legalize. 
But the advocates of the law need sixty voices, for which they are dependent to republican onto the voices of a handful, for the discharge of the initiative. At this time the organizations of the intercessors of this project organize an intense influence on the discharge of the law. 
The democrats, of which to support the majority the Dream Act, have 58 seats. 
However, one of them, the senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska said, he would vote against that and only a republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support of the law. 
Therefore the defenders of the Dream Acts must get several republicans onto their page if other democrats should decide to turn the back to the initiative. 
Those ones belong to the the most umworbenen republicans from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the senator George Lemieux from Florida that took over the mandate of the senator Mel Martínez. 
Further republicans that supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they declared not to support it more in another occasion. 
A further republican who had spoken out for the law, John McCain, did not define his attitude up to now yet. 
Although the House of Representatives has another version, the analysts agree on that, which the Dream Act stands in the senate before the greatest obstacles.
