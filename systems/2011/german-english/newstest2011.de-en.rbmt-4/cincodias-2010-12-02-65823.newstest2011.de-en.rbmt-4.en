The executive board chairperson of owls fight on request of his children the companion meeting of Vega Sicilia 
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, owners of the societies of owls and El Enebro, does not drop. 
David Álvarez, founder of the Unternehmensgurppe, will trouble the companion meeting of El Enebro, who will occur on request of five of his seven children at the 16th, since he holds it for "completely vain." His children will attempt to receive a majority around the administration organs of the company - holder of the vinery Bodegas Vega Sicilia - control. 
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new justice chapter in their quarrel around the control of a part of the company group. 
The founder of the largest holding companies for enterprise services seems to be not ready to give in his lawsuit around the control of the organs of El Enebro. 
From the administration council he was knocked out by five of his seven children. These appointed themselves on the shareholders' meeting of the 18th January of this year, that in the commercial register already than troubled is entered, to administration councilors. 
The companion meeting of El Enebro, who was called by the judge of the commercial court number 2 from Madrid for the 16th, activated a new clap of thunder in the lap of the family Álvarez. 
The invocation of the judge to the Anberaumung of the meeting is the only juridical way which guarantees the calling of the companion meeting. 
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz becomes of David Álvarez when one "despair means of the proposers laid out - his five children -, around by means of legal hairsplittings, fraudulent machinations and to make acknowledge the meeting of the 18th January declared as vain of right abuse," as official speakers declare. 
This argumentation is the basis afterwards for the contestation of the meeting, around them than to declare "completely vainly." 
The same protagonists who wrap themselves in discrete silence attempted in June already unsuccessfully to call a meeting on judicial way. 
With El Enebro - property society and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, next to other capital values -' seven children 'control David Álvarez' 100 percent of the capital. 
On the other hand the founder of the service group demands the usage right according to family protocols over 51% of the capital. 
That is the actual background of the thing which the judge has to decide on in the hearing for the treatment of the contestation complaint for which yet no date was defined.
