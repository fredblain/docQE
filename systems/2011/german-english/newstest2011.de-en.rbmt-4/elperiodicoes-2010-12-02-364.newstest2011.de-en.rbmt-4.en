Offer offensive for the touting for group Christmas Eve chimneys in Barcelona 
This year makes the dictatorship of the calendar fall an avalanche of reservations onto the 16th and 17th days December. 
The ones wide of celebrations paid to employees themselves from. You want to spend not more than 20 to 30 euros. 
As the Turrón and the Christmas lottery there are in the consecrating night time group suppers which provide the restaurant and leisure time trade of Barcelona with oxygen also again. But due to the depression they activate a price offensive in order to catch also the customer segment which represents the big mass: They almost all would like to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a noon or evening food, confirm the consulted entrepreneurs and associations. 
In this way the accountancy still a little complicated becomes, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) made all orders fall into the week of the 13th December, with the result of an avalanche of reservations of suppers onto two Spitzentager (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders weekdays in front of that. 
Since 2008, than the bad times began, many enterprises stopped the group suppers for budget reasons. 
In order not to have to renounce this tradition, many employees pay these from their own bag. 
How the economic situation is ever, Niedrigstpreise are demanded, confirms the chairperson of the restaurant committee of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs. 
The representative of the roof truss does not dare until now to predict how the holidays will look in this month. 
"The people consider it 'zig time, before they reserve." 
"You would like to go out gladly, but they pay attention to the prices strongly," it stresses. 
The business will go at those "that offer quality to good prices with a good service" well he adds, and calls us into the memory, that the customers save in times of crisis, for which prices about 25 euros most strongly ask about. 
With an inquiry in various centrally sited restaurants it turns out that the evening of the 17th December leads the providers to the collapse. 
The group of Soteras says, the demands for this Friday with the intention to spend less than 30 euros would become boomen. The group fit their menus with complete offers to between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation. 
With another leading group, Andilana who maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others) the particularity of the calendar led to preferred reservations, even from beginning of November. 
"We made the impossible thing possible in order to maintain the previous year prices with menus for every taste of 19,95 to 30 euros," it declares. 
At AT Grup that guides El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and in total 23 restaurants one does not lose the optimism, after since the second quarter the gains flourish again and good, although onto few days of concentrated prospects for the Christmas business is expected. 
Sources of the company group emphasize that also the 18th will be a hyperactive day with friend groups which celebrate Christmas. 
A Christmas menu was added to the six group menus for 30 euros or more than price hit. One has to spend 10 percent more the impression that the customers are ready than in the previous year and to want more details in the corresponding train, as for example Cava. 
Also in some companies one sees green rungs sprouting, for which the employees are invited again. That provides the impression that the group chimneys are again in the upswing. 
Vonseiten of the roof truss Fecasarm (with alliances as the pub, restaurant and leisure time association of Barcelona), familiarly the deputy chairperson, Enric Gomà, to see the end of the tunnel on that and notices that the reservations are quite in total "lively" although the customers gain a maximum. 
The fun at the celebrating regardless who pays did not go back, however.
