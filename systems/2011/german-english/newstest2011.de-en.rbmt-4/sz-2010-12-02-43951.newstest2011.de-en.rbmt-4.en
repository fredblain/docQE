Mysterious earthworks 
The atomic energy authority IAEA has new references to a secret nuclear program in Syria. 
The country defends itself, however, to take position for this purpose - nor it does not approve controls. 
Against midnight of the 5th on the 6th September 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attack a mysterious, die-shaped building in Syria. 
It stands at the shore of the Euphrates; the next larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur. 
Your name emerges in documents of the International atomic energy authority (IAEA which comes off from the stream) when it is a question of the reactor which Syria supposedly built with help from North Korea in the ashlar, hidden in a valley. 
According to a briefing of the US foreign secret service of CIA of end April in 2008 the reactor common also under the name of the near small town el-Kibar would have been well suitable to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built. 
For other purposes on the other hand the technique is hardly worth from the fifties. 
The CIA demonstrated a video presentation with blurred satellite photographs. 
By computer animation she inserted, where which components of the reactor are supposed to have been before the destruction that is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the atomic center Yongbyon. 
Furthermore she presented photos, which show the building from the proximity or quite the interior. 
The reactor stood shortly before the initiation, it was said, been not loaded with burning-sticks, however, yet. 
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, hardly more is known than then, the puzzles became with the time rather larger. 
The former US president George W. Bush revealed youngest in his memoirs that that one was quite indeed sure of CIA that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, but did not see hardly clues about there being in the country "an active nuclear weapon program" before the attack. 
Some Geheimdienstler in Europe are even more cautious there more gladly and speak only of an "alleged re-actuator" even if they hold the CIA-presentation for "plausible." 
You lack hard proofs, in the same way as the IAEA. 
Asked how surely it is to have a reactor before themselves, a high UN-diplomat answered in the summer only succinctly, the IAEA has "material enough in order to ask questions." 
The Syrians created the debris of the alleged "unused military building" urgently indeed aside and leveled the ground thoroughly. 
Nevertheless an IAEA-team found in June 2008 tracks of uranium which had been made by people under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar. 
Furthermore the IAEA about a member state received satellite photographs of commercial providers from the time directly after the attack, which might be more expressive than those ones of the CIA presented. 
However, these photos are not to be gotten on the market, because the unknown customer has bought - maybe Israel - excluding them. 
The IAEA can not verify therefore their genuineness independently. 
Syria always declared to never have practiced a secret atomic program or to have built a reactor. 
The uranium comes from the Israeli arms, declared Damascus. 
However, the IAEA rejected that to analysis of the particles as improbable. 
Since then Damascus refuses to discuss about that - just the same as about the satellite photographs. 
Furthermore a second inspection into el-Kibar and the access to the ruins of the building bombed out refuses it to the controllers. 
But also Israel is silent iron. 
"We will never comment on that," the prime minister Ehud Olmert current in the attack's times confirmed recently the official position. 
So the investigation of the case is dragged since June 2008 without any result there and "develops increasingly into a serious plausibility problem for the authority," as a high western diplomat at the seat of the IAEA in Vienna grants - finally a difficult violation of the nuclear weapon blocking-contract stands in the room which the IAEA watches over. 
The IAEA sees as keys to progress during the clarification apparently three more facilities that are supposed to stand "in functional connection" with the probable reactor - and still to exist differently than this. 
Neither in this case the inspectors did not disclose up to now which installations it is a question of still which function they have or what makes her be appeared suspicious. 
According to information of the South German Newspaper they are called Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah inside at the IAEA, in turn carried off by cities seemed likely. 
The independent institutes for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and did on satellite photographs a complex of buildings at Masyaf ausfindig with which it is a question of one of the suspicious objects most probably. 
It is possibly in or immediately next to a military base - refused exactly with this reason Syria of the IAEA the access to the three places. 
In Vienna it is said the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA is vorgeschickt by the USA in order to spy out military areas. 
Because the nuclear detectives had become attentive through a tip of the US secret services onto the facilities. 
The IAEA has tips, under that satellite photos, that between the three places and the ashlar at the Euphrates material hin- and was transported. 
A high western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the installations could stand "in connection with the combustible production." 
There are, however, "no references to sensitive activities," therefore uranic enrichment or reprocessing; Processes which are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons. 
The reactor type is practiced indeed with uranium which is not enriched. 
However where the uranium should have come and gives where from that the plutonium should be separated later for the bomb, for these central questions it at best plausible suppositions. 
It is also unclear whether ruins which could hide valuable tracks were stored at the three places. 
As if the hundreds of truck loads would have disappeared from the earth, nobody wants to have information about that, where the debris stayed. 
The only few kilometers of salt mine al-Tibni sited from el-Kibar on the other hand of the Euphrates that Syria examined for their suitability as warehouses for radioactive garbage in 1998 the IAEA is regarded as improbable. 
The former IAEA-inspector Robert Kelley had brought it recently from satellite photographs in an analysis for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor in touch. 
Photos from the orbit show, however, that Syria carried out at the three suspicious places earthworks and removed big containers after the IAEA Zugang had demanded. 
That can be coincidence, if clearing the suspicion hardly contributed, however, to that. 
Furthermore it means in diplomat circles to keep possible military secrets, the IAEA that should allow it to Syria put many months into developing a plan there for inspections - only the expenditure shows how in a large way the interest of the inspectors is. 
While, Damascus ironed also this proposal off. 
Western diplomats had appeased in Vienna still a year ago, the reactor is destroyed, therefore the thing does not have any high priority, it deprives for instance US ambassadors of Glyn Davies since a few months of so-called special inspections ins Spiel, one of the sharpest means that has the Viennese atomic authority of controls to put through. 
IAEA leader Yukiya Amano already indeed has that would have to suggest these inspections of "an option, for which I am open in the future" spoken, nor, however, he does not hesitate. 
A high risk lies in this way: On the one hand a majority needs it for that in the governor council of the IAEA, and many of the there represented 35 countries are keen on an escalation all but. 
On the other hand, as a diplomat gives to consider: "What is if they do not find anything at the end at all"?
