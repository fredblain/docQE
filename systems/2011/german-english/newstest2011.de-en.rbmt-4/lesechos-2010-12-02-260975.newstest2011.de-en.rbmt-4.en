The government Berlusconi takes cover in Italy 
According to a week beginning worrying for Italy the situation relaxed yesterday a little with the drop of the corner interests onto 10 years. 
A return to the treacherous silence. 
At the end of the meeting with the minister for economic affairs the region chairpersons Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indecipherable" and to have it with an "unpredictable" weekend reckon to hear what that Affecting, however, denied immediately. 
On Tuesday anyway the scissors with the German interest rates would have achieved his record of 210 base points, and the prices of the contracts to the cover of the bankruptcy risk went up onto 263 points, which had caused a certain rash in Rome. 
Silvio Berlusconi had referred near his Council of Ministers to the discrepancy of Spain for the German interest rates being near 400 base points. 
His right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed itself, however, than "hardly gotten" by the "market turbulences" and a possible danger of infection from direction Ireland. 
"The good information is that Italy, the third national economy of the euro zone, is not as Greece or Ireland." 
"The bad piece of news is that Italy as Portugal is," declares Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson institutes. 
In the plain text that is called, his problem is not to be able to cover his financing need anymore the Absenz of economic growth and the accompanying, schwindsüchtigen control inputs that get the state into danger. 
The last Brussels predictions were a cold shower for the government. 
In the future an Italian growth is expected of 1,1% in the year 2011 and of 1,4% in the year 2012... although the budget budget present with the senate for the examination reckons 1,3% and/or 2%. 
Under these conditions, so the EU commission calculates, the budget deficit will form in the next year another 4,3% of the BIP (towards that of the governments' predicted 3,9%) and 3,5% in the year 2012 (instead of 2,7%). 
Therefore also the riot around a new budget collective that could be fit in from 7 billion euros after the holidays for a sum. 
"When force, new economy measures must "be taken," auditor Olli Rehn means. 
To the hour Italy receives the support of international institutions. 
"Is the foundation of Italy's economy all right and his accounts are controlled, we already since long time repeat that," Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund insures, who is entrusted with Italy near the IWF. 
"At the moment there are not any problems, neither on short-term, still onto long-term view, there of Italy in spite of his high indebtedness (119,2% of the BIP in the year 2011, A. through R.) to be demanded smaller stabilization progress than of other countries," pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD, observes. 
The question about the political unsteadiness remains. 
On 14th December Silvio Berlusconi will gegenübersehen to a motion of no confindence of the chamber of deputies, due to which the preferred choices already at the end of March could be organized. 
A little favorable period approaches therefore for a decision with regard to a hard crisis.
