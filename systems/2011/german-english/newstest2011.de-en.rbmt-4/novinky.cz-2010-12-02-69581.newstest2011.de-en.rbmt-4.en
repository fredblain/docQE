The living-costs of the budgets increase around some hundreds monthly 
The budgets do not have to reckon from January only higher costs for all energy kinds, but also with higher water and waste water fees and for Fernwärme and mancherorts also the rents increase. 
Families will have to pull January several hundreds of crowns monthly more so off from the purse than up to now. 
Stream becomes to about 4,6 percent more expensive, gas around 2 percent and more, in some cities one will have to pay more up to a tenth for water deliveries and mancherorts also the long-distance heating deliveries increase in price. 
Only the stream price increase costs some a hundred crowns more to the apartment budgets annually. 
The heavy current prices were reduced in this case by all main suppliers, the clear promotion of the electric power production is guilty therefore from renewable sources, in particular from photovoltaics installations. 
If gas becomes only moderately more expensive the most then exactly the people indeed this, however, must heat, and they have the highest consumption. 
Also here some a hundred crowns more per annum are to be reckoned therefore. 
During stream and gas in whole Czechia teuerer become, the prices are different for long-distance heating from city to city. 
Particularly bigger places' level increases in prices. 
So more must pay for example the budgets for Fernwärme monthly in Pardubice and Hradec Králové from January up to 50 crowns, more than 1000 crowns more per annum pay families in Liberec. 
To threaten the inhabitants of Prague in turn 9 percent of higher water and waste water fees and this for the case, that the city increases the infrastructure rent. 
If the rent is not changed, it is only 6,8 percent. 
The price heard in Prague in comparison with whole Czechia, however, also furthermore to the lowest. 
In the north Bohemia, where the prices belong already now to the highest, water and waste water fees are supposed to increase around 7,4 percent. 
Enormous rent price increases are to be expected for example in 140.000 flat lets for rent near which from January the so-called rent regulation is omitted. 
So for example the CPI apartment enterprise intends to increase Byty that has 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem the rents from January like about a hundred percent. 
Who with this rent increase does not agree agreed, the enterprise wants to prosecute that one judicially. 
The adjusted rents which one pays today still in approximately 300.000 apartments might go up next year around more than 10 percent.
