The Catalan cell got Al Qaida thousands of passports 
Except for the seven arrests in Barcelona there were three more in Thailand 
The seven Pakistanis arrested by the policemen of the secret service place of the police of Barcelona and the Nigerian formed the dschihadistische cell operated from Thailand, that different Al Qaida groups, under that the "movement for the liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Lax cirque e-Taiba" (Let) - latter was authoress of the assassination attempts in Bombay that required 2008 106 dead - with passports supplied. 
The Spanish Minister of the Interior assigns a great importance that it is possible so far that he insures to these investigations with the "Operation Kampai" the forgery apparatus Al Qaidas "was weakened" worldwide and thus their action ability. 
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where these were forged and sent after that onto the groups which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida consists of in this way whose "fighter" unpunished the borders of European and other western countries could cross. 
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the dschihadistischen net which was active in Europe. Therefore also other European police units participated except for the Thai investigation organs in the enquiries. Excluding is not that it will result in similar assassination attempts as the one that was exported on the last Tuesday in Barcelona on the field of the EU in the next days. 
In coordination with this operation (that Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another at which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt as well as the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested was carried out in Thailand. 
You had led from Bangkok the cell settled down in Spain and other European countries. 
PÃ¤sse stole the Catalan net - a part of them had been done in the year 2009 to the ground - in particular from tourists according to the handicaps of the so called "International Islamic front." 
That means that the documents had to be made out by men in the age of 25 to 45 years on the names and be valid still several years; they were not allowed to show any visa stamps. 
In investigation circles it is underlined that to now no connections between the ones arrested in Catalonia and the assassination attempt in Bombay be proved could although the author of this assassination attempt, "Lax cirque e-Taiba" was, one of the receiver groups of the passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand. 
In spite of that should be reminded of some days in front of the assassination attempt from Catalonia by means of a money transfer enterprise several thousands of dollars that "were invested" in the purchase of Prepaid-cards for mobile telephones that later were used by the members of the "command" that prepared an end for the life of 106 persons having been sent. 
The police confiscated an extensive documentation.
