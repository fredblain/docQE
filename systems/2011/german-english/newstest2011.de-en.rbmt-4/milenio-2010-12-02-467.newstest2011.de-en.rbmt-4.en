China keeps to his objectives for the decrease of the hothouse gases 
The representative of China declared on the COP16, his country undertook enormous efforts for the reduction of the carbon tracks and his offer would maintain it, to decompose 40 to 45 percent of his hothouse gases to 2020. 
China considers to reduce his offer by 40 to 45 percent the emission of hothouse gases up to the year 2020, assures Su Wei, the representative of this country, on the COP16. 
Su Wei insured with his first public appearance on the 16th world climate peak of the United Nations (COP16), his country would have undertaken enormous efforts for the reduction of the carbon tracks and for the adaptation of his industry. 
He exported that in the last four years his country invested 245 million dollars in order to reduce the emission of hothouse gases. 
On the other hand it declared that China would not change his objectives, but would work on this matter together with the international community. 
It declared that the Chinese strategy subdivides itself into four aspects as regards climate change: Dialog, construction of capacities, construction of institutions and support of pilot programs. 
In all aspects one did progress, including the discharge of a new energy law in the last year that contains the objectives with regard to the reduction of the emission of gases he declared. 
On the other hand he emphasized that in China the authorities of the Federal states would have cooperated with those of the central state and the municipalities around the objectives for the energy saving, an effective use of the energy and to achieve the reduction of emissions. 
In addition he exported, already some plans of several years were tackled or were finished, both those ones that were financed by the Chinese government and such that received money of other countries. 
For example he related himself to the program to the Effective Use of Energy, which was introduced in the last five years and investments of the United Nations (UNO), the government and to receive from private hands had. 
Also a project runs onto province level for the climate change, another for the exchange of the traditional electric bulbs through energy saving-pears and another to the attenuation and adaptation, it declared. 
Martin Krol, scientific government consultant as regards climate change in this country, confirmed that the efforts of China are by far greater than gemeinhin would be accepted. 
It showed, that the pro-head emission of hothouse gases in China is six tons per person, while it is being 100 tons in the United States. China is responsible for a nine per cent total contribution to the pollution. 
In the same way it does unprecedented progress in the field of the energetic use. The energy effectiveness was increased in the last five years around twenty percent and up to the year 2020 another is supposed to happen, it declared.
