The egg-university 
At the "Gelato University" near Bologne ice confectioners are prepared for better seasons. 
The three day long basic course for future Gelatieri has the biggest inflow and visitor from the whole world. 
From where does the whole ice come actually? 
Of the Gelatiere and of the Gelataio. 
The Gelatiere, in German a little outmoded the ice confectioner, the cream makes according to all rules of the Italian egg maker art. 
The Gelataio gets the ice cream with a putty knife from the cold shelves, it deletes into the waffle and she sells then. 
In order to know that, one does not have to go after Anzola dell'Emilia in the Bologne province. 
But who would like to know still more above ice that one does not pass by the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani. 
The manufacturer fitted out the egg-university from ice machines in the year 2003 so that the ice cream is raked to the high Italian ideals everywhere from his machines. 
The three day long basic course for future Gelatieri has the biggest inflow and visitor from all world. 
There are, however, also more days special courses about around the chocolate ice and practical trainings in the in-house ice-cream parlor. 
Some dreams in the Midlife-Crisis about a new career, others venture simply once onto the smooth ice of their vague longing-addictions. 
This time 40 participants are it from 19 countries of all continents - of Brazil above Hungary to Saudi Arabia. 
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food-movement and wants to offer the industrial Ice-Cream a European quality product in the future in the country. 
Anke from Berlin is management consultant and wants some Own eintüten after years in a nerve-racking job. 
Two young Egyptians dream about opening an ice-cream parlor in Cairo. 
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to correct the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because their children love Italian ice cream. 
Mästro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream first of all. 
Decisive is not only good taste, but also the silky pliability and the good consistency. 
Luciano forgets the cream hood of the national and anyway südländischen projecting part during his training but neither: "Italienisches Gelato is simply the best thing - and then still every amount of romanticism in this case is." 
The first step to the production seems very simple. 
Milk, cream, milk powder, sugars and stabilizers into a big blender which arouses everything with an electronic program on 85 degrees and cools off immediately on four degrees then, tilts the basic ingredients to Luciano. 
Then he opens a cock at the machine, and out a pasteurized white base cream, basis, comes for all milk ice sorts. 
Immediately the university lecturer is bombarded with questions: Can one manufacture ice cream only with natural materials without stabilizer? 
How one can let the own experiment pleasure free race? 
Luciano warns before making oneself be led from the spirit of the time into the insane. 
Who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients," used possibly in spite of that stabilizers - mostly a natural product, about Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne. 
Of course one can manufacture ice also without stabilizer, only it must be sold then within a day, otherwise it collapses in itself, and the customer bites open loud ice granules'. 
Certain variations at the groundmass are allowed. 
It becomes more thrilling with the aromas. 
For the taste in the ice maestro Luciano differentiates between the ingredients which one buys in the fruit-department or with the sweets of the supermarket. 
Furthermore there is powders and pastes gives. 
"The suppliers" attempt to turn on to you dozens flavored additions all." 
"However, you should experiment simply once." 
Either at the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits. 
Or now at the ice cream from the white groundmass, which becomes the yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder for the basis for all possible chocolate seductions. 
Now may the course participants onto the ice machines. 
Luciano lets it to each four different kinds of Vanilla-, to manufacture chocolate, espresso and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the groundmass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additions. 
Also the fruit ice-cream sorts are subjected to the same experiment. 
More aroma materials, more fruit puree - that is not flavorful absolutely better. 
Haselnuss-Eis does not taste absolutely nuttier if it contains more hazelnuts. 
The most popular kiwi ice makes the team that uses more fruits less water and a little less stabilizer. 
First a balanced mixture lifts the taste of a Gelato correctly out, says Luciano. 
Ice production is an arithmatical problem: If peach-puree with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar part must be reduced in the basic prescription. 
For Zitroneneis an extraportion of sugar is necessary. 
Luciano pulls out a device with which it determines the sugar content of the fruit sorts (Wine-growers measure in this way the Öchsle in the must of grapes). 
For the luck tables relieve the Rechnerei. 
Making ice does not require more so much physical use as formerly. 
Not only the device for the automatic production of the base sizes helps. 
There is also a device in which the ready egg-mixture simultaneously cremig is beaten and chilled on minus temperatures. 
All automatization zum Trotz small breakdowns are not missing. 
The Brazilian Gustavo stains themselves and his course colleagues of above up to below with fruit puree, than it the over-size stick mixer out of hand turns out. 
"In every course," maestro Luciano means, "it is only a question of the time until something like that happens."
