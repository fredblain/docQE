The demokatrische routine 
The democracy movement in Latin America becomes stronger, so as the support of private enterprises. 
Criminality is a greater problem than the unemployment is. 
In many parts of the region the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States is. 
For these results the Latinobarómetro inquiry came, that in 18 countries carried on and excluding in The Economist was published. 
This inquiry is carried out since 1995 regularly and shows so the opinion change in this region. 
Two facts fall in the this year's inquiry of September and October especially of in's eye. 
Firstly the good atmosphere in Latin America 
and secondly the wachsende interest at democracy and their most important institutions. 
In numerous countries at the South American Pacific coast the democratic movement increased strongly (see table 1). 
In Peru e.g. where the economy increases since 2002 annually around approx. 6% the number of the democracy proponents climbed from 40% per year in 2005 this year 61%. 
Also in Mexico, where the economy recovers since the strong burglary in the last year again, such a trend is to be recognized. 
Nevertheless only half of the interviewees in Mexico and Brazil, the most densely populated countries of the region, convinced democrats are, what lowers the regional average (see diagram 2). 
Declared to approx. 44% of the interviewees, that they satisfied with the democratic practice of their country be. Those ones are so many as in the last year, however, 25% more than in the year 2001 (Diagram 3). 
In about 34% trust the congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of the last year, show, however, a clear rise opposite 2003 (17% and/or 24%). 
A decade ago Latin America's depressions untergruben the endeavours towards more democracy. 
That this also during the world economy crisis lasted, is due possibly to the countries of Latin America experiencing only a short recession phase and recovering quickly again. 
In addition the paupers were caught by a stronger social net. 
(According to reports of the UN economic commission for Latin America of this week the poverty rate went up in 2009 into Latin America only insignificantly and fell this year around 32% again.) 
However from country to country there are strong atmosphere differences (see diagram 4). 
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the parting president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reflects in a spread progress thinking. 
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more strongly perceptible and power crimes increased, this is the case less. 
First for the second time since inquiry beginning many interviewees see a greater problem in Latin America in the criminality in their country than in the unemployment (see diagram 5). 
Approx. 31% state that either she herself or a member of the family in the last year became victims of a crime. However, opposite 38% in the last year the values sank and reach thus the lowest state since 1995. 
The increasing economic achievement reflects in the stronger support the Private- and the market economy against: approx. 71% of the interviewees indicated supraregionally that the private enterprise is indispensable for the development in the year 2007 it was 56% (see diagram 6). 
Approx. 58% declared that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared with 47% in the last year. 
Interestingly enough 62% of the interviewees retained this opinion in Venezuela (and 80% are for a private enterprise) although their left president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private enterprises. 
Brazil followed the biggest weight according to 19% of the interviewees (18% in the last year) in the region from the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% in the last year). 
On the other hand to see the interviewees in Mexico and most countries of Central America in the USA the most influential country near which this role is taken over by Venezuela in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
