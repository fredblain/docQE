Thousands mourn for dead pals 
More than 10.000 people thought in New Zealand of the spilled miners that were declared as dead after several explosions in a mine. 
Yet the corpses could not be brought out because the security situation keeps on being precarious in the misfortune shaft. 
Just two weeks ago it had resulted in a vehement explosion in the pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth. 
29 miners in the age between 17 and 62 years were spilled under days. 
A probe had been let into the misfortune shaft, had not discovered, however, any track from survivors. 
Due to the high concentration of poisonous gases and further following explosions no rescue teams could descend from safety reasons. 
According to the second vehement detonation the authorities and experts had assumed that there is not any survival chance for the pals anymore. 
The corpses could not be brought out up to now. 
Now members and friends with a commemoration reminded of the dead. 
Ten thousand people had met near shining sunshine in Greymouth on the New Zealand south island. 
For two minutes they were silent. 
In honor of the spilled miners 29 tables were set up, on which helmets, lamps and the names of the pals were to be seen. 
Also pictures and personal objects, under that garments and surfboards, found here their place. 
Before the government buildings of the country the flags at half-mast waved. 
New Zealand hoped for the miners coming onto the surface "from the depths of the earth" again, said the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the commemoration. 
"But they have never come home." 
It can not close with the death of his son as long as he did not see his corpse, said to Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was spilled in the pit. 
Next to the Prime Minister and members of the victims several foreign diplomats participated in the commemoration. 
During the first explosion on 19th November also miners of British and South African origin were spilled. 
Rescue workers began with putting out a fire in the interior of the coal mine on the south island of New Zealand. 
As soon as the explosive gases are replaced, people begin with chilling the glowing temperatures in the interior of the mine, said chief constable Gary Knowles to journalists.
