Nothing as away here 
At this evening it runs at last once again correctly about for the Irish. 
No track of grief. 
For that the home team dominates his guests too very much from Sweden, Finland and the USA. 
The fans howl with joy at cracking loud music, they stamp with the feet. 
The Bailey pub in the south-Irish Cork trembles because the players fling table tennis balls over a three meter distance in beer glasses - and hit. 
"Bierpong" names himself the bizarre rackets, it gives 500 euros of victory premium to win plus flight tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong world championships in January. 
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this shrill drinking-game and the reserved information scientist, that does really not match. 
And nevertheless the 26-year long one attempts at distracting oneself from the piercing question, which will bring the future, to amuse. 
On his plan game fun does not stand in Las Vegas, it will lead to the January application conversation in New Zealand. 
"I have a ticklish feeling in this case," he says. 
"It is so far from home and nor I do not have any work there." 
After all: His friend waits in Auckland already for it - "they had ruck, twitch" the young man says "their wish job as an event manageress, maybe a good sign," and smiles. 
Because of bad perspectives at home already two searched three siblings their luck abroad from Tanners. 
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin has now a place as an IT consultant in London. 
The boys go: As at the Tanners it looks on the island in many families. 
100.000 Irish will presumably leave the country in next time, predict experts of the economic and social research institute ESRI in Dublin. 
To 2015 they reckon even 200.000 emigrants. 
For the small country only with 4,5 million inhabitants a vehement loss. 
If the predictions Bewahrheiten, it results in an emigration wave comparably with that which Ireland suffered from in the eighties. 
After a decade of the upswing which brought great prosperity with themselves for the Irish dreary chimney spreads now once again. 
The depression verunsichert in this case particularly the young, well trained Irish for whom it went up to now only uphill. 
Job loss and social descent seemed in the boom years absurd. 
Everyone was needed, there was money in plenty. 
Meanwhile, however, three of ten women and men are less than thirty without work. 
In the Irish Times there are zuhauf reader's letters of young emigrants who complain: "Everything goes into Ireland the creek under that." 
"There should be a revolt against politicians and bankers - however who can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation in this way." 
"The last one does then the light from asks." 
Jurassic-student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, sees a dark future coming up because the government practices only eyewash and does not offer the young people any prospects anymore. 
"You reduce the minimum wages, but they do not have any strategy as new jobs are supposed to be created," says the 20-year long one. 
She observes, as their fellow students of an unpaid practical training to the next hangeln. 
She says, your greatest worry, it is to have to emigrate in four years themselves. 
"This thought is sad and depressing." 
In this case men as Stephen McLarnon attempt to fill the topic positively. 
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a fair which offers a Rundumservice on the topic to works abroad. 
"Nevertheless for professional beginners the work is abroad a splendid chance to do the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager. 
On his web page photos show surfers in Australia and Snowboarder in Canada. 
The message is clear: To work abroad is not a galley service, but brings also freedom and fun. 
Se√°n O'Donovan knows to establish something somewhere else, as it feels, since half a year. 
Because not doing anything more for the 29-year old engineer in Ireland gave, it works now with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany. 
In Gelsenkirchen they pull up just a fashion house. 
In January it goes on to Hanover or Berlin, for the next project. 
Meanwhile only still O'Donovan sees his home rare, because it does extrashifts in order to be able to pay off the credit at home for his house. 
"The situation is already a little mad," he says when it goes over the threshold of his house after long time for the first time. 
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland in which I am as good as never again." 
He laughs a little in embarrassment and goes through rooms cooled down. 
The small house stands in one fine residential area's with well-kept front gardens, in the entrances big, expensive cars park. 
Together with a sister O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380.000 euros - 100 percent credit-financed. 
There were mad times, there was simple money without many questions," he says. 
He is afraid, that it could go wrong with the credit? 
O'Donovan considers a while, pours hot tea after and says: "I do not have any children, that I must feed and am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can begin anew." 
The civil engineer does not like the lamentation, that it hears at the time of often. 
"Nobody has to hunger - nevertheless our situation is not as dramatic here on the island by far as in former times, "he says." 
"A while abroad work, that is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we feel ourselves through that first as Irish." 
He laughs and tells then about his father who went to England in the last great depression. 
"After seven years it was again there and the life went on into Ireland, very simple." 
Cian Tanner likes this thought. 
The future leave open and simply once look, how it runs with the life somewhere else. 
He really already has a few years of work in London behind himself and why it should not run into New Zealand also well for it and his friend? 
A thing which worries him appropriately in these days is still there, however: the celebration to his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin. 
He fears that it could degenerate into a farewell-party. 
"Only not too many emotions," he says and drinks a great sip of his beer. 
"Farewell, nevertheless that rings frightening." 
"Let's mention it more gladly a going party, very loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
