450 million in contracts without announcement 
Hydro-Québec granted on friendly terms project engineering companies 450 millions dollar at contracts for the waterpower project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert. 
Right in this avalanche of more than 100 contracts a consortium stands, existing from the Skilled BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor that received the most important part, that is the one of the project management, for a sum of 295 million dollars without announcement. 
This consortium, mentionedly "Énergie gérance," überantworten this important, hydroelectric project to the private sector in 2004 as a concomitant of the decision of Hydro-Québec their responsibility at the level of a sum of 5 billion dollars, educated. 
At the beginning of 2005 the consortium "Énergie gérance" got the lucrative contract without there having been a public announcement. 
For the Parti Québécois the going back represents on enterprise consortiums a serious ethical problem which causes the risk of the Wettbewerbsverdrändung as well as a price increase. 
"This is a new kind and manner of a fixed game and invalidates the competition." 
"That means, that" one instead of fixed games instead of in secret way now in open form carries on," Sylvain Simard, representative of the PQ, declared yesterday, on the press conference. 
On the early morning Simard had raised the question before the national assembly, because it seems hardly understandable to him as the interest of the public can be operated in this way. 
Resource minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon to that when she vehement denied that it would have been a question of a fixed game with this contract. 
"I remain loyal to my line," she cursed in her confirming, the PQ went on "dishonest" and "it lacks hardness." 
She said "it is the least thing" that the PQ apologizes. 
The model of the consortium is worldwide usual practice. 
It is a question usually of a within a given time so limited alliance that allows two or several enterprises to bundle up their expert opinions with regard to a commandment onto an announcement for a complex project. 
The project "Eastmain" shows a high complexity level concerning his work extent. 
The construction method is in process and is supposed to be made to 2012. 
Nevertheless the contract was assigned without a competition having been able to occur; there had been already negotiations. 
Furthermore the model of the consortium does not represent an exception by any means anymore in the Quebec even with relatively simple projects. 
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted down last week, object of government investigations is the model of the consortium used in the field of the civil engineer and consultation being. 
A short flying of the Quebecer enterprise register allows it, to designate more than 200 consortiums, from those ones to be some of continuous duration to seem. 
In this way the company Dessau cooperates for example with the majority of their nuclear competitors which CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult number among in partnership. 
Any linking, and from that there is several dozen, leads back to the very same juridical person, indeed on Dessau. 
Concerned something the consortium "Énergie gérance," minister Normandeau stressed so, that "the territory of the Baie James is subjected to a special worker dynamics and that Hydro-Québec expresses bill to this fact since the seventies in special kind and manner." 
Réal Laporte, the tall employer of the Société d'énergie de la of Baie James (SEBJ), gave a declaration, that the nose made about the fact that the contract was granted about the project management according to accord turn up. 
"When you do an announcement and gives it only few applicants, your prices will shoot up." 
"You have therefore two possibilities: either you take the people, which are on this Mart and say to you: one will negotiate a satisfactory accord for a good price." 
"The thought is, however, that the price is not decisive but the expertise of the persons," confirmed Laporte. 
This contract granted to the consortium "Énergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts over more than 50,000 of the Parti Québécois preserved dollar. 
The contracts were approved either by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert. 
After inspection the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineer and consultant contracts, the companies or their branches, under that in particular resource labs, between 2002 and were granted March 2010. 
SNC-Lavalin had gathered 22 contracts onto himself, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without including their participation in "Énergie gérance" at that. 
All these contracts were negotiated. 
They amount in the Gesamt to 449 783 344 $, locked up in that the contract with "Énergie gérance" above 295 131 564 $. 
Sylvain Simard had made be announced, that the four companies, who form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) the "Parti libéral you presumably confessed to Québec" are. 
Minister Normandeau had made remember, the PQ is equally united with the companies that "financed" it before she specified that it is rather a question of their managers.
