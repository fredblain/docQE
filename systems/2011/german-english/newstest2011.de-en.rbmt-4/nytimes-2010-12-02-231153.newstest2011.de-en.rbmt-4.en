The judgment was a surprise for many ethic-attorneys outside of the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion there were sufficient proofs of Ensign disregarding the Lobbying-prohibition. 
Interviews, E-Mails and other documents that were disclosed to the erstenmal in October 2009 in the New York Times gave reason to the supposition that to Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election officers, to lucrative tasks helped in order to buy his silence over an Affaire with Hamptons wife Cynthia.

According to the published indications "it is" a question "according to all appearance of an agreement and of the violation of the revolving door statutes," according to Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney which people specialized on the defense of clients which people stand in the visor of the government. 
While the Ministry of Justice was refusing it officially to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign-case, Mr said. Fire and other ethic attorneys, the ministry shines very cautiously from defeats that were pursued by the media with great interest in the picking up of political accusations after a great number, including the decision in the last year to make the accusation against the former senator Ted Stevens because of error behavior on the part of the public prosecutor fall. 
Public prosecutors "are obviously nervous," said Melanie Sloan, the chairperson of the union of "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization that objective is the abatement of corruption in parliament and government circles of the USA), a group of lawyers, To Accuse the different one against Mr. Ensign in court has brought.

Mr. Ensign was in addition with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, to the lunch agrees and asked the Minister of Transport for arranging a meeting on behalf of the airline, after this Mr. Hampton for the purpose of lobby work had prepared. 
When last year for the first time information passed about this affair at the public, Mr apologizes. Ensign with his voters and his position in the senate gave up, where it had been in the order of priority of the republicans at fourth place. 
After it had not become noticeable anymore many months, Mr told. Ensign two weeks ago reporters, that it strives a third term of office in the senate. 
In the announcement, that Mr. His press speaker, Jennifer Cooper, declared not to be Ensign longer the objective of police enquiries, the senator hopes for the ethic commission following the example of the Ministry of Justice very quickly and stopping his investigations.
