Love in times of the war 
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer with the work at their still nameless direction debut has begun, there is annoyance. 
She herself wrote the screenplay, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man. 
One does not know many more about that - however already that suffices for noise. 
Stubbornly the rumor the woman, a Muslim, falls with their Serbian rapist in love during the Yugoslavia-war holds itself. 
Bosnian woman associations protested immediately, woraufhin unites into knack days planned to Sarajevo at short notice to Hungary were laid out. 
Meanwhile the film turned away in Hungary and in the postproduction, however protests still in Bosnia. 
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of feminine war victims wrote to Jolie over the UN refugee public social aid UNHCR and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper told now - Jolie is even an ambassadress of the UN refugee public social aid. 
It is not diplomatic - she offered to the women before weeks already once a meeting in Hungary, which those ones, however, refused. 
The meeting must occur in Bosnia, according to Hasecic. 
There were not love stories in rape camps, and betrays Jolies attitude opposite the victims their enough about the screenplay. 
Your organization recommended according to the UN refugee public social aid to release Jolie as an ambassadress, tells the guerrilla warfare. 
What exactly, however, did Jolie write for scenes? 
The Bosnian culture ministry that their screenplay agreed to read gave a knack permission Back and Forth after some for Sarajevo - it is not very clear why Jolie did not come then in spite of that. 
Declared the young authoress herself she does not hunt any political intentions with their film incorporated with a lot of effort in the Yugoslavia conflict, want to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give a voice to all shared pages. 
With the contents it stays, however, vague. 
So another second synopsis for the film in the net nevertheless to ring quite differently then circulates: The loving ones knew themselves in that already before outbreak of war and meet again when it, a Bosnian Muslim, is verschleppt into a Serbian camp in which he works as a guard. 
What nevertheless rings considerably differently than the variant "Rape victim verknallt in torturer." 
That Jolies begins film in fact already before the war - so much is secure. 
The pressure on them is, according to Jolie, "unfair and based on misinformation." 
Now can provide their presumably only still that one hacker of Hollywood peace: When they the screenplay, as already so many before, to put into the net illegally.
