A bone house fascinated also still after 100 years. Have a look at the Interieure of fun 
The roof seems as the back of a prehistoric saurian, fish mouths torn open are the stairs as the spine of a dinosaur and the Balkone. 
That is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. 
From the local inhabitants the house with his organic forms got the nickname "bone house." 
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splinters and mosaic's, that facades reminding of scales and omnipresent soft lines, all this are typical features for the Jugendstil of Antonio Gaudi. 
The facade of the house plays with marvellous lines, gentle colors and textures that remind of nature and living beings. 
Before in the case of more exact seeing one does not notice that all of geometry, rhythm and order thought over is governed. 
In the night the whole facade seems even more plastic, more dramatic and the specific Anleuchtung still intensifies the shine of the colors. 
The same swing-full lines and cost forms also the interior of the house master. 
Wood in a wavelike way shaped even copies the window frames, rails, adornment elements of doors, spyholes and strips. 
The house Batlló in the quarter of Eixample at the animated shopping street Passeig de Grácia no. 43 arose through the reconstruction of a house from the year 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese exported. 
The reconstruction used two years and was finished in 1906. 
The investor, the prosperous industrial Josep Batlló, insisted initially on the demolition of the old one and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to the idea of Gaudís onto an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction. 
Antoni Gaudí did only not project the apartment house Casa Batlló, however. 
He cooperated in this case with the architect Josep Maria Jujol. 
Just on his drawing board the decorations arose for the representative apartment of the reality owner and also the use of mosaics at the facade was his idea. 
On the organization of the facade worked, however, also numerous further creators and artists with. 
The common work at the drafts for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fertile cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí. 
So Jujol participated also in the construction of Gaudís Haus Casa Milá in the park Gueell in which there are also further works of Antoni Gaudí. 
Already shortly after his finishing "Knochenhaus" got the house of the local inhabitants of his organic forms because of the nicknames. 
Other in turn it called because of the specific window opening mechanism the "yawning house." 
One also says very above on the building the sword of the holy Georg is the patron's represented from Catalonia. 
But also further sculptural elements symbolize hidden religious motives. 
Gaudí projected a central heating system unique for the former time with ventilation channels and typical chimneys for the house. 
A little bizarrely their 45-degree-inclination already seems. 
During his work Gaudí ignored all former design specifications consistently and could not be disconcerted by any means from these. 
For start of building he obtained the corresponding planning and building permission indeed from the city but the information done by it over the planned reconstruction were so vague, that the city fathers were two years later so horrified during the finishing from the result that they demanded remedy. 
The councillors also disapproved themselves among other things on the construction with his pillars intervening even in the public sidewalk. 
To changes more did not come it, however, quite the opposite - only fifteen days according to the related request of the quarter Josep Batlló made a request for the permission of the rental of the two höchstgelegenen storeys of the house - and it was given to him promptly. 
The house-owner himself moved in in the lower floors. 
There was a society parlor in the gallery in the 2nd stick, there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment in the third stick. 
The ground floor was leased to a jeweller. 
The entire six storey building ran through some stairs to up to the roof terrace. 
Through the fundamental elements of the reconstruction all right angles were removed and straight lines and replaced by bent and swung walls. 
Gaudí worked, however, also with a modern draft to the mutual connection of rooms. 
The social part can completely be combined through the opening of the parlor doors and so a larger society could chat comfortably without having to renounce a certain intimacy in the case of more confidential conversations. 
The house received also a quite unusual roof and two more storeys through Gaudís reconstruction except for a new facade. 
Impressive is also Gaudís game with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles, with which the inner court is covered and the patios. 
The game of these two colors gives a maximum of light to all floors of the house. 
He shut the principle in this case in a simple way Wear, that white reflects the light better as if Farben that absorbs the sunlight on the contrary for this purpose darkens. 
Everyone can go to the house Casa Batlló which was incorporated in 2005 into the world heir list of the Unesco today. 
In the first stick the most spacious and most splendid apartment is made accessible to the public. 
The house-owners decided only in the year on this step and this on the occasion of the 150.Geburtstags of the famous creator. 
When one found, that this a quite profitable business is, one retained the inspections, yes one also bulged it wider common and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace from. 
The price for the inspection of the monument is not, however, a cardboard stem, it is 16,50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist identity cards get 20 percent of reduction. 
This amount surpasses the admission charges to other Gaudí-constructions in the city. 
Who would like to become acquainted with the real atmosphere of the house with his dragon turrets should attempt, to close friendship with one of the house inhabitants and to visit it at home.
