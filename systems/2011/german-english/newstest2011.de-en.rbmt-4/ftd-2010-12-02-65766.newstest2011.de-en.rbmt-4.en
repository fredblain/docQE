Obama stops new drilling for oil 
Before the coast of the Florida US Federal state in the golf of Mexico there will not be in the coming years any new drilling for oil. 
The government issued a corresponding prohibition in Washington - and so that finally their former plans revoke. 
Also before the Atlantic coast new drillings keep on being forbidden for the time being. 
Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar informed of this on Wednesday. 
Trigger for the strict prohibition which at least is supposed to be valid for the coming five years is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April. 
Before the misfortune, that eleven workers the life cost and to the greatest environmental disaster of the USA led, president Barack Obama had signaled on pressure of the opposition and the industry his willingness to approve new drillings in the eastern part of the golf of Mexico. 
The proponents want to reduce in this way the dependence of the USA on oil deliveries from the exterior. 
Who bears the responsibility for the disastrous oil pollution in the golf is not until today definitively clarified. 
In the center of the criticism the British bp energy company group stands which is confronted with billion demands. 
An investigation commission in the task Obamas is supposed to present their results in the course of December. 
In October Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar had canceled the drilling-stop imposed after the explosion. 
In the connection different oil company groups had made immediately requests for new drilling-projects. 
With sharper controls and more severe safety regulations Obama and Salazar want to exclude a recent disaster. 
Currently the responsible control authority which had fallen into disrepute after numerous corruption reproaches is reformed basically. 
In parallel to that Obama announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas company groups. 
The industry warns now in public against the supporting-amount turning out in the golf through a more severe regulation in a clearly smaller way than up to now. 
"The plans of the government are the biggest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industry," the result of a current branch inquiry says through the consultant company BDO - still before the drilling-prohibition of Wednesday. 
The American Energy Alliance laments furthermore the insecurity in the branch: "Nobody knows what will be changed with the regulation exactly." 
Investments in new promotion projects would be postponed for the time being - at the expense of the growth.
