Vindictive hacker and busy spies 
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a twofold importance. 
On a page it turned itself out as an obvious scandal, a scandal that only a scandal is hypocrisy that governs the Beziehunge between the states, the citizens and the press in the Sinner one. 
On the Other Hand it announces far-reaching changes on international level, and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression. 
But let's go ahead in turn. 
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file constructed by a secret service (a x-beliebigen nation) consists of press clippings exclusively. 
The "exceptional," American disclosures about the sexual habits Berlusconis do not pass on anything from when that, what to read one over months in any case in every x-beliebigen journal got (except for those that owner Berlusconi is), and that frightening karikaturierte profile Gaddafis offered cabaret artists already since long time material for their sketches. 
The rule according to which the secret dossiers may consist only of already known news is not essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and that before in this century. 
If you go into a library which dedicates itself to esotherischen publications, you will recognize that every work (about Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) repeats exactly what already in previous works was written. 
That does not come only of the author of occult texts not wanting to publish any investigations (nor of his not knowing where news about the non-existing-end was to be found) but because those ones that dedicate themselves to the occultism at nothing different than what they already know and what confirms that they already learned believe. 
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown. 
In the same way the secret files'. 
The informant is lazy, and also the head of the secret service is lazy (or restricted spirit) (otherwise he could be something ever, for example editor at Libération), that takes only as true, which he acknowledges. 
The Top-Secret information about Berlusconi that had sent the American message to the state department in Rome the same ones were as those ones, that Newsweek had published already the week before. 
Why therefore was done such a cancelling's around the disclosures of these dossiers? 
On a page these say what every educated person already knows, and indeed that the messages - at least since end of the Second World War and since then also the heads of the government can call themselves mutually or can take an airplane in order to meet for the supper - to have lost their diplomatic function and, except for some small representation tasks, to have changed into espionage centers. 
Every arbitrary spectator of investigation films knows this very exactly, and it does not happen from hypocrisy, that one does so, to ignore this. 
Nevertheless: the fact to repeat it in public hurts the task of the hypocrisy and is used for putting the American diplomacy in a bad light. 
At second place: The idea that a x-beliebiger hacker can tap the most secret secrets of the most powerful country of the world contains the considerable stroke against the prestige of the state department. 
Furthermore the scandal brings the victims less, as rather the "sharp judges" in distress. 
But let's dedicate ourselves to the tiefgründigen nature of what happened. 
Formerly, at Orwells times, one could bundle up all power as a Big Brother that controlled every gesture of his subjects. 
Orwells prophecy, where one can control every movement thanks to the telephone, could have turned out since then as completely correct every made transaction, the gone hotel, the chosen motorway and so forth; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of the power. 
If one keeps oneself what ends today in mind, however, that even the secret crypts of the power of no more the control of a hacker can escape, so the control walk stops, to be unidirectional and becomes circle-shaped. 
The power controls every citizen, however every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as an avenger of the citizen -, can find out the secrets of the power. 
How can a power which is not to keep their own secrets anymore in the situation hold itself, however? 
It is right, Georg Simmel said already that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true, that any knowledge about the character Berlusconis or Merkels basically is a secret freely from Geheimis, since it gives away the public sphere; disclosing, however, in the style of WikiLeaks that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to rob her of any power. 
WikiLeaks did not do either Sarkozy or Merkel Unrecht, on the other hand, however, Clinton and Obama. 
What will the consequences of this offense be that a so tremendous power was added to? 
It is obvious that the states in future will not set any information reserved to more online - that would amount to a bulletin stuck up at the street corner. 
But it is just as obvious, to hope for being able to keep confidential reports about telephone a secret that it is with the current technologies in vain. 
Nothing is simpler than to find the way out, and when a head of state moves himself in an airplane and contacted one of his colleagues. 
How could relationships private and certain only for certain ears be maintained in future? 
I know very presumably that my forecast at the moment according to Science Fiction and novelistically rings, but I see myself forced to introducing the government agents to me in secret way busily on uncontrollable routes moving, their communications nowhere differently wearing than in the bare memory with themselves, and in addition the few written information that they got hiding in the heel. 
The information would be stored in single copy in shut drawers: basically the espionage attempt of Watergate had to record less success, as WikiLeaks. 
I had the occasion to write that the technology strides nowadays as a cancer backwards indeed. 
A century after the radio-controlled telegraph had revolutionized the communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire. 
The (analogous) video-cassettes had made for the film researchers possible, to spy out a film band for band when one could wind from behind forward and ventilate all secrets of the Mondays, during the (numeric) CDs nowadays nothing else facilitate, than to jump from chapter to chapter, therefore in macroportions. 
With the high-speed trains one brings from Rome within three hours Milan, while this is requiring three and a half hours by airplane including the change. 
It is not therefore extraordinary that politics and communications system come back to car and horse. 
A last observation. 
In Former Times the press attempted to understand which secrets were forged between the messages. 
The messages that require confidential information of the press are it current.
