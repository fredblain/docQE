Holy king is searched 
Dolls, cars, bikes and other toy want the children of the family Coronado Valenzüla in a longing way. 
For the parents it will be difficult on the next three king day to fulfill these wishes, because the budget consists no more and not less than of twelve persons and a billy goat. 
In spite of that nobility aida canvas, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar give them the toy and the garments which they long for so. 
The family inhabits a modest house in the settlement Salvador Allende. You live from hand to mouth, because the father does not have any fixed work. 
"Sometimes hard times are given because my husband does not have any job. But we sell tangerines and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go onto the street with the kids for the selling," said Cayetana Valenzüla Andrade, the mother of the small ones. 
The four year long nobility aida canvases would have gladly a doll or a bike, while their three years old sister Isabel is wanting a Barbie doll. 
The decennial José Alfredo would like to have a 'monster car' already for some time and Cayetana Kleidung suggests little brother Jesús old for his eight months in the size for one year long ones. 
" (José Alfredo) mir,'ich said would have so gladly this monster', however I answered to him, 'make us be waited for, boy', because "it was very expensive," Cayetana remembered sadly. 
For the older children who were in the school clothing and shoes would be ideal. 
The eleven year old María Guadalupe has the size 12; the decennial Isaías the size 10 during which eight years old Miguel size 8 has. 
The 14-year old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A few in the size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful. 
If you liked to help, to realize the dreams of the children of the family Coronado Valenzüla, you can at the campaign 'Holy king is searched' to participate when you donate a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noröste.
