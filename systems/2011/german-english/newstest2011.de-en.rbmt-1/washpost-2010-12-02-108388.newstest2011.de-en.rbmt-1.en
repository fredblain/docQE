Oozed US-document portrays Moscow as port of the corruption 
Control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and it passes on a part of the bribes and the protection money, which collect it, because of the Kremlin. Thus the American message in Russia in a note reported in February. 
Both police and the public security service extort high protection funds, so that they can hold their expensive standard of living in Moscow, then are called it. 
They do not only collect money from legitimized business, but also of organized criminal gangs. 
Each layer of the bureaucracy - which called prime minister Vladimir Putin "vertical of the authority" - takes itself its part of the money, which the ladder walks upward. 
The note, which was sent under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle to Washington, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on its homepage. 
The note is based on sources, whose name was drawn up. 
It was written, while Yuri Luzhkov still Moscow mayor was, and it accuses him of the corruption. 
It was fired in October von PrÃ¤sident Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly a proof for the fact that one would have in the meantime cleared up. 
Luzhkov and its wife, Yelena Baturina, which possesses a well-known building firm, rejected accusations of corruption again and again over years, and it won numerous libel actions against such accusations. 
In September he explained those to a Russian television station, when he was asked for a documentation, suggested, he was corrupt: "It is moved, it is dirty, it is dirty." 
> It believes an unbelievably large number at Russians that their society is corrupt. Surveys showed that. 
But it is unusual the fact that, as in the report of the Ambassador happens individual persons are called, and it is unheard that this is done via a diplomat of a foreign country. 
"The direct connection of the government of Moscow with the crime led to the fact that some call it "disturbed" and at the conclusion come that the government acts rather like a Kleptokrat as a government," so the note. 
"Criminal elements enjoy themselves one "kryshna" (a term from the world of the criminal ones/the mafia, which means word by word "roof" or protection), that over the police, the public security (FSB), which service supervisory authority (MVD) extends and the office of the public prosecutor likewise as by the entire Muscovites government bureaucracy. 
Specialists discovered a three-fold structure within the criminal world of Moscow. 
"Luzhkov stands in highest place." 
"FSB, MVD and the militia stand on the second stage." 
"The common criminal ones and the criminal inspectors follow last on the lowest stage." 
"This is an incompetent system, in which criminal groups within some ranges close a gap, because the city does not offer any assistance." 
The report continues to say that FSB money of the largest companies taken the money and that arrests the police small businessmen. 
A source, then is called is, "explained that Moscow business owners understand that it is best, which protection of the MVD and FSB have to get (and not of the organized crime), there it not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminal ones, but also because it by the law is protected." 
"For this reason the protection through criminal of course is no longer in demand as as in former times." 
The note notices that, while collecting of the funds is comprehensive the protection does not grant much its\; even those, which pay, are sometimes arrested. 
Those, which do not pay, appear their business very fast closed pre due to or other pretext. 
Medvedev spoke several times to fight the corruption however at the same time marked that he made only few progress. 
The note of the message contains of descriptions of men, who go also with suit-cases, which were probably full with money, into the Kremlin. 
"In its fight against the corruption Medvedev must on the bureaucrats leave," said themselves Georgy Satarov, director of as, Muscovites an expert commission, recently in an interview. 
"However it is part of this bureaucracy." 
"It is not a part of the political class, because a political class in Russia does not exist any longer." 
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of the force, then he says, is corruption inevitably. 
Country-wide, then estimates as, costs the corruption Russia more than $ 300 billion per year. 
The country ranks at place 154 of a newer investigation for the global perception of the corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparence international (countries of "to few corrupt" too "at most corrupt" specified). 
The exposure of the note of the American message, which after Muscovite time happened latein the evening, will release disfavors with security within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov for the errors of Moscow can be accused of, it for the Kremlin also a possibility be can state that one solves the problems. 
In an interview with Larry King for CNN maintained Putin the fact that the WikiLeaks documents a falsification could be and reacted furiously to the exposure that American diplomats called it Batman and Medvedev Robin. 
"The truth is that it concerns our interaction, which is an important factor of the home policy in this country," said it. 
"However to be over honest, we would not have expected that this would happen with such an arrogance, with such a pressure and in so unethical way, know you."
