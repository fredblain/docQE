Offer offensive to the customer catch for group Christamas Eve meals in Barcelona 
The dictatorship of the calendar lets this year an avalanche of reservations fall on the days 16. and 17 December. 
The celebrations paid by employees themselves spread. They do not want to spend any more than 20 to 30 euros. 
As the Turrón and the Christmas lottery give it in the pre-Christmas period also again to group dinners, which supply the restaurant and leisure trade of Barcelona oxygen. But due to the economic crisis they release a price offensive, in order to catch also the customer segment, which represents the large mass: Nearly everything would like to spend between 20 and 30 euros on noon or a dinner, confirms the asked entrepreneurs and federations. 
So that the bookkeeping becomes still a little more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on one Friday) let all orders fall into the week of 13 December, with the result of an avalanche of reservations of dinners to two Spitzentager (the 16. and 17.) and nearly no orders in the week before it. 
Since 2008, when the bad times began, have many enterprises the group dinners for household reasons adjusted. 
In order not to have to do without this tradition, many employees pay these from their own bag. 
Like the economic situation, it also always lies niedrigst prices is demanded, confirms the chairman of the restaurant committee of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs. 
The representative of the umbrella organization does not dare itself to predict up to now, how the holidays will look in this month. 
"The people consider themselves it 'tens of mark, before they reserve." 
"You would like to go out gladly, but pay attention, stress them strongly to the prices" he. 
The business will go with those well, "the quality to good prices with a good service offers," adds it, and calls us in the memory the fact that the customers in crisis periods save why prices by 25 euros is most strongly inquired. 
With a survey in various restaurants lain central it turns out that the evening the 17. Of December the offerers to the collapse leads. 
The group of Soteras says, the demands for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The group adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation. 
At another prominent group, Andilana, which maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and other one), has the medievalism of the calendar to preferred reservations, even starting from at the beginning of November, led. 
"We made the impossible possible, at the previous year prices with menus for each taste from 19,95 to 30 euros to maintain," explain he. 
With ON Grup, which leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and altogether 23 restaurants, one does not lose the optimism, after for the second quarter the incomes flower again and to good, even if on few days concentrated prospects for the Christmas business one expects. 
Sources of the entrepreneurial group emphasize that also the 18. an overactive day with friend groups, which before-celebrate Christmas will be. 
To the six group menus a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more than price hit was added. One has the impression that the customers are ready, 10 percent more than in the previous year to spend and in response more details wish, as for example Cava. 
Also in some companies one sees green rungs sprouting, why the employees are again invited. It obtains the impression that the group meals are again in recovery. 
Vonseiten of the umbrella organization Fecasarm (with unions like the tavern, restaurant and leisure federation of Barcelona), trusts the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, to see on it the end of the tunnel and notices that the reservations are quite "lively" altogether, although the customers drive "a maximum out." 
The fun at celebrating did not decrease however, all the same who pays.
