Sport and rule evasion 
Cheat as from Alonso and Ramos in the play against the Ajax show invention spirit, but not the will to go around a sanction. 
Allegedly the exclusion in the play from 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League, plotted by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos), it led to the fact that much ink was poured over whether it did not concern an unathletic action or and whether both players should be possibly sanctioned of the UEFA. 
As is common knowledge, lost the two players are a few minutes before playing (their team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls, so that the arbitrator them showed the second yellow map. 
In this way, and Real Madrid its group would start, would become the two players the prescribed sanction there with the next league play against the Auxerre to fulfill and without maps into the next play phase enter in such a way. 
Finally the Disziplinarkommitee of the UEFA punished the coach of the club, Jos√© Mourinho, with two plays and the players involved with different money. 
The provocation of a yellow map under such or similar circumstances is not new practice, it is rather frequently in the world of the football to be found. 
It is so far common the fact that her part of the Ethos - which unwritten obeyed, but in this kind of sport rules - is. 
Part the arisen debate about the represented case it decreases to the fact that a team of the football club Real Madrid (in its hymn the noble courage and honor give and at other opportunities its players for similar incidents had punished) played thereby the leading role, and on dramatization by Mourinho, which to his long history than theatrical and provoking technician added an episode more. 
In any case the debate about the fact turns whether this contradicts the principles of the sport not expressly from the statutes forbidden behavior, that is, whether these actions represents a rule evasion. This approach adheres actual to the statutes of the sport, seem to go around however its sense. 
With this affair that should the sport spirit caused damage to be examined. 
The sport spirit defends the physical soundness of the opponents, an aspect, which was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive play. 
A further aspect of a clean play consists avoiding of the fact that the infringers players draw an unjustified benefit from the Gegenteam. Also did not happen. 
The paradoxes of the action of the players of Real Madrid it is that she does not correspond, which we normally understand by wrong play or rule evasion, because the evasion of the rule became not secretly carried out, in order to avoid a sanction, but it should as possible be as remarkable, so that it is punished by the arbitrator. 
The players awaited and accepted the sanction joyfully. 
Another question is, which kind of advantage the infringers drew from the intentional fouls. 
Here it should be emphasized that the rival was brought neither into a more unfavorable layer still advantages for the played play was erheischt, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team with fewer players had play on. 
It is also no useful strategy for the next play, because the club does not have then these players. 
The advantage consists obviously of the fact that the players begin the next play phase of the Champions League without maps, which its participation in a future play could threaten. 
But this concerns a long-term advantage uncertain up to a certain degree, since the team could also be ruled out sometime. In addition the players with this approach receive a sanction and change into the second map cycle, in which they are ruled out because of map accumulation with a map less than in the first cycle. 
Thus it is not so clear whether it really concerns an advantage. 
Finally such approaches are not directed against the sport spirit, to which also strategic decisions belong, in order to draw from the regulations a greatest possible benefit. 
In this case the players a sanction did not want to go around (that would actually be a clear case of rule evasion), it wanted rather to select, when they undergo of these. 
They made a strategic decision, without evading to a punishment or flee before it. 
Although the border between ingenuity and rule environment is smeared, I believe that it acts with this affair around a clear case of ingenuity. 
I have the impression that the polemic developed due to two factors: Because it around two self exclusions went and because of the kind of the provoked rule transmission. 
The damage, which was caused to the principles of the sport by these actions, is less more ethicalally than rather esthetic art.
