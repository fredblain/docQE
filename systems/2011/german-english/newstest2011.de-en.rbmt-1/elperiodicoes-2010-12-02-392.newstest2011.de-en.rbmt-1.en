On the hunt for Wikileaks boss 
Obama appoints a high responsible person for the anti-terrorism fight the prevention of new exposures. 
Interpol spends a red warning for the pursuit and location of Assange. 
Everything that is connected with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth, in which the facts can be cleared up only with difficulty. 
Yesterday Interpol spent a "red warning" for the "location and pursuit" from Assange. 
However it does not act thereby around a traditional arrangement to the arrest. 
In addition it is not new, it comes from 20 November. 
She has to do also nothing with the last exposure from over four million to diplomatic documents from the USA, but with the accusations of sexual abuse, to which the Australian must place himself in Sweden. 
Furthermore the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, insures Mark of Stephens, "the police would know, where and how it can take up contact with Mr. Assange." 
Already to 20. the international Police Department with seat in Lyon (France) upon the request of Sweden the arrangement spent, but it was not announced to the power until yesterday after receipt by the Swedish authorities. 
Thus the things lie. The 188 Interpol countries are dependent to identify and find Assange to arrest and deliver "around it provisionally." 
Although Interpol cannot arrange the arrest of an individual concerned by a red warning, many member countries regard the red warning according to statements of the organization as charter for a Arrestierung - which must be accomplished by the national police - in particular, if they have a bilateral extradition treaty, how it is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange probably is. 
The action indignant Assanges of lawyers, who published gestures a letter, in which it about the fact it informed that the 39-year old founders of Wikileaks is ready to answer by video conference the questions of the Swedish authorities. 
They remind also of the fact that Assange requested the departure from Sweden and from the public prosecutor, who is compared with the sagenumwobenen Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security head by Stalin, who received appropriate approval. 
"That is like a hunt, not like a legal pursuit," in the letter is accused. 
While the world looks for it - and its mother from Australia the innocence of its son protested - stops Assange itself at an unknown place, however not being silent. 
On Monday it gave to the director/conductor of the magazine time by Skype from an indefinite place an interview. With the discussion he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the USA, Hillary Clinton. 
"If to be proven it can that she was responsible for the arrangement of North American diplomats, who UN offended to spy and thus approximately from the USA signed international agreements would have it to withdraw," said he. 
Its opinion was condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the white house, Robert Gibbs, the request for resignation as "ridiculously and absurdly" designated. 
"I am not safe me, why we should attach importance to the opinion of a type with a website," explained it the transmitter CNN. 
Obama has a high responsible person for the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, which prevention of new document exposures assigns. 
The attempt of the spokesman of the Pr√§sidenden Barack Obama to give Assange less attention stands contrary to the opinions, which announce conservative politicians and commentators in these days. 
The congressional representative Peter King, who will lead the presidency in the national Sicherheitskommitee of the Lower House starting from January, requested the state department to examine the possibility Wikileaks on the list of organizations of terror to set, "around their funds to seize and to everyone, that her supported or a contribution makes to pursue." 
Tom Flanagan, adviser of Canadian president Stephen Harper, had still continued to go, and he had its statement, Assange had "to be murdered" to recall. 
"Obama would have to transform it into a target and to use not a manned airplane or something like that." 
Who did not apologize, was Mike Huckabee, baptistischer Minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate. 
"Who it was also always, which let ooze in the government information, it is the betrayal guiltily and everything is, is which no execution eiine as mild punishment," explained it the transmitter Fox.
