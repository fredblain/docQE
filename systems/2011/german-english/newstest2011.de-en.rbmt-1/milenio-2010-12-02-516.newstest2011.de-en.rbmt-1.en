Rubén Omar Romano looks on three defeats in final games back, it ups and downs in its career experienced, but three times he had crucial plays, and so far he kept himself good, why this opportunity of completely special importance for him is. 
The Argentinean magnified the importance of itself with the medal to second champions, he a step behind the winners stayed and surprisingly he with the same team following each other final games delivered. 
The santistische strategist reached the first final game as a coach with the "gate-neo Apertura 2002," when del Morelia had the reins in the hand, with which it against Toluca with 4-2 a large defeat experienced\; later, at the "Clausura 2003" he reached the crucial duel, which he lost also with 3-1 against Rayados. 
Already with Santos Laguna on the "gate-neo Bicentenario 2010," with which they played against lot Diablo, had to put Rubén in again a setback, since the play with 2-2 against lot Choriceros went out after 210 play minutes undecided, but with the penalty kick it progressed with 3-1 and got two possibilities of putting its title in but in the long run three its player missed the eleven steps and the play turned to 4-3. 
Rubén had lost already two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, its large rival. Therefore it would not like to be pursued again from the bad luck and free itself from the bad charm, in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although it affirms that for it the most important is the play.

The last final game left a lasting impression still strong him, it insured, much from it to have learned: "The only teachings, which we can draw from it, are that to the arbitrators the end it does not whistle cannot we not celebrate, we at the line are preparatory, the players also, because the last mark were already preparatory we with two penalty kicks to be ruled out and I believed that teachings are not, until the play is not terminated give it a cause for celebrating." 
To know that this series could be decided by penalty shootout, it does not worry it, because it trusts its players: "One wants to never arrive with the penalty shootout, one would like in the regular play time to lock, sometimes but there is no alternative and one must for it be preparatory, in previous tour was preparatory we, but to us the fate unfortunately prepared to sometimes regard a bad play, due to nervousness or the violent tendency, the title in the hands, left us somewhat as this final game, and we to hope that it will not come this mark to it." 
It lies in Romanso power, no longer only second champion to be and the fame cost for the first time, which the titles bring with itself.
