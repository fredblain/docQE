To hell, warrior! 
Does Splatter fit the art cinema? 
The director Nicolas Winding Refn plumbs old category borders again with its fighter epic "Valhalla Rising." 
Of which audience the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn may have thought, when he turned "Valhalla Rising"? 
A caught Viking warrior with only one eye (WAD Mikkelsen) frees itself from his torturers and surrounds with almost superhuman forces by the dozen its opponents - ideally bloody Action, straight because our hero sounds gladly raving killing methods served and its enemies already the Gedärme from the alive body tears oneself for young male spectators in the search for, if he has bad mood. 
On the other hand a eye says, as it is actually called, the whole film about no word, and also the other figures admit themselves at the most times to or two sentences or a few painful death cries to enchant. 
Otherwise is silent and one indulges in the gruesome beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, which offers the backdrop to the Viking world from forwards about thousand years. 
Ideally rather for adult cineaste with interest in existentialism and very calm tracking shots. 
, If a film has several target audiences, harm beautifully only, if they are mutually exclusive. 
Director Winding Refn is valid since its wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher" as a kind Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, refuses however stoically making its works with somewhat more humor the mainstream or somewhat less brutality accessible the Arthouse. 
Most art cinema friends might let themselves be deterred from the brain mass squirting around and the Gedärmen. 
The Action fans die at the latest before boredom if a eye for freely interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries breaks open via ship after Jerusalem and in calm air and fog pins an eternity, before the crew obviously arrives at America and continues to be silent there. 
No miracle thus the fact that "Valhalla Rising" did not find a cinema rental business in Germany and now only on DVD appeared. 
That is particularly because of the magnificent pictures a misery, in addition, because behind the pretentious to bluttriefenden front a sometimes exciting piece cinema hides itself, which earned something attention. 
In this film it does not concern dialogs or a stringent action, it is all atmosphere, a film-become having a temperature area. 
And from there is no escaping for the spectator. 
Refn hardly grants one moment of the relaxation to him and laces up it with his icy pictures and the dark trance-well-behaved soundtrack completely slowly the throat, above all however with the incomprehensible hate, which confronts him from the hearts of the figures. 
Only a small blond boy, a eye faithfully to the side stands, retains themselves something like innocence, all different by anger is floated. 
Very most the monocular hero, whose motives are never explained, who becomes sometime however for enemies and temporarily allied one the warrior from hell, possibly as the Ambassador of the devil. 
It means a spoiling, perhaps in addition, only for anyway the spoiling. 
"Valhalla Rising" is a puzzling film, which one can hate and admire, for annoying, exciting and being astonished. 
An experience.
