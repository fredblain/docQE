Zapatero and the red line of Germany 
Berlin has itself for maintains the euro decided, but at the same time for the entire European union set up conditions. 
The tensions on the markets released a double answer of the government. 
On the one hand José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero submitted, begun new measures of adaptation with tax reductions for small and kleinst enterprises, the adjustment of temporary work agencies or the abolition of the 426 euros support for unemployed persons, who do not refer an unemployment pay, up to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, to the administration of the airports Barajas and El Prat as well as 30 percent of the national lottery. 
On the other hand the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former head of the provincial government Felipe González the criticism at the chancellor Angela Merkel than responsible person, supports who out-swore to the present crisis. 
How are these procedures to be understood? 
, The Merkel's position no error of their public work is anticipated is. 
On the contrary, this concerns a new round during the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro. 
Germany takes a basically new perspective for the organization of our future, which collides with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of a majority of its partners. 
In view of the resistances in Europe one begins in Germany over three possible ways out of the crisis too spekuliern. 
First: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area. 
Second: The re-establishment of the German Marks - although at present rather after Science the Fiction sounds -, supported from a majority of the public opinion, approx. 50 percent of the population. 
Third: A transformation of the euro in accordance with German proposals. That means: more macroeconomic control\; housekeeping\; Punishment of the countries, which cross the defaults\; the möglichereweise payment attitude of some countries as well as the expansion of the costs of potential measures of adaptation on the private sector. 
The German position is clear and appears already for some time. Therefore there are no excuses now. 
First 2009, when both the IMF as well as incentives for deficits created the European commission and a constitutional reform drew itself the German government from the sleeve, in order to prevent this starting from 2016. 
That was the first sign for drifting apart between what considered Germany necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. 
The second indication set the Central European country, when Merkel postponed the decision for the rescue of Greece painfully. 
At that time that was strongly criticized. But fact is that the political consent in Germany, which was absolute public and the published opinion against a rescue of Greece. 
Finally Merkel comes out in the last October days on the new with a clear position. It demands a reform of the agreements of the European union, in order to make the rescue possible of a country and to obligate the private money lenders at the same time to carry a part of the costs. 
This position was laid out as anti-European, since it advanced the Ireland crisis and all following. 
But their proposal, even if something sweetens, was accepted. In the next months we will participate in the reform of the European union, which is to make these measures possible starting from 2013. 
Germany drew a red line, which does not intend to exceed it. 
It says all that - even if now unpopular measures must be met - it starting from this date the old function mode of the euro will not any longer give. 
2013 could be forced to explain themselves the year of birth of a new currency area to be, in which the infringers of countries are hard punished, insolvent and in this case the private sector a part of the costs take over must. 
Germany shows us that we must hit a hard growth course, with high saving and investment rates, moderation of the consumption, improvement of the productivity and competitive ability as well as positive externaleconomical balances. 
The other alternative, which on indebtedness and building industry with enormous holes in the balance of payments is based, was stated as it by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would do badly not to understand it. 
It does not only concern to down-drive the state deficit up to the year 2013 on three percent. 
The demands are many harder. 
And the worst, which we could do under these conditions, is us too would amount to. 
I hope that the present turbulences change into more peace. 
And that we will use the possibilities, which are ordered us up to the spring 2013. 
It seems that Zapatero understood also in such a way, and its double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large-scale enterprises on past Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) points out that despite the criticism at Merkel the hypothesis prepared to create order in the own house their way. 
There but the red line drawn from Germany is, and it does not look in such a way that in it somewhat would change. 
Under the considered possibilities those that we would have to leave the euro area fully plugged with little respectable countries is, to exclude not. 
In this case Germany could say to us still, it had warned us.
