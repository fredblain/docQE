NASA announces the find of extraterrestial life 
The North American space agency called up a press conference, in order to tomorrow before-set a find, which will have effects on the search for organisms in the universe. 
Tomorrow, Thursday, a astro+biological discovery announces the national air and space agency (NASA) of the United States, which could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestial life. 
The find is introduced tomorrow at 13.00 o'clock at a press conference in the seat of NASA in Washington von Experten of astrobiology. It concerns a science, those the origin, the development, which examines distribution and the future of lives in the universe. 
During summoning to the press conference insured NASA, it "an supervision-exciting find for the search for extraterrestial life" will present, what released speculations with experts of other countries. 
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments, which unbwohnbar one considered so far manlike creatures can exist. The hypothesis was raised that these could transform into intelligent organisms - as humans -, if their living conditions improved. 
Apparently it concerns a microbe, which was found on the reason of the mono Lake in the Yosemite national park, California. It lives there in an environment, which was considered too poisonous for all conceivable ways of life, since the lake is strongly arsenic. 
In some way the Mikrobie uses the arsenic as survival resources. With consideration of this ability the opportunities increase that there could be similar life on other planets, which do not have our protecting atmosphere. 
If these organisms amplifier-off-change the arsenic, it is in accordance with the astrobiologists proven that "there is actual another way of life, a second way of life, from us admitted itself differentiates." 
The space agency gives tomorrow, on Thursday, on which press conference the actual range of its find well-known. 
To conference participate Geo biologist Pamela Conrad, which possibility of lives on Mars examines, and which biologist Steven Benner, one the scientist, whom titanium (the largest moon of Saturn) under the question, whether its chemical composition resembles that the earth, it studies.
