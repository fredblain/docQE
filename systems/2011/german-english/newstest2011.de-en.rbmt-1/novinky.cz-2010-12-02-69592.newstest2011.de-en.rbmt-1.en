American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon." 
The American troops for the first time used a new "intelligent" weapon, which admits so far only under its code name XM-25 is in Afghanistan. 
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon affects the local conflict with the Taliban and shifts the balance of power to its favor. 
The new weapon is something like that, like an super+exact cannon. 
Their projectiles are steered by lasers with an accuracy by only to unite few meters in the goal. 
The special projectiles of caliber of 25 mm, which were developed for this rifle and highly explosive explosive contain, function practically like small shells. 
The projectiles can be programmed in such a way that them not only in the case of the impact on the goal, but at any point of their ballistic flight path to explode to be able. 
That is, one can use it against an enemy, who itself behind an obstacle - hides to a wall or in the trench. 
From above it is usually not protected, which can put murderous steel fragment rains from above it thus easily out of action. 
Richard Audett according to, which took part in the development of the XM-25, is the new combat rifle the first infantry weapon, which uses itself "intelligent" technologies too makes. 
"The soldier proceeds strictly speaking in such a way: it visiert the goal on and sends a laser beam, which the distance certainly, then it wins an exact point of visor, after which it the quadrant elevation corrected, then it needs to only force away. 
"Times, one 543 m measured legends we." 
"If one forces away, loads themselves the weapon and shoots the projectile on the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
