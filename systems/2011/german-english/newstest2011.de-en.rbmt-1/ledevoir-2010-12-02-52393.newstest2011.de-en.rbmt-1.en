Government loan for the assumption of eXcentris 
The Quebecer government, that was requested of the Société Angus as well as the enterprise Parallèle to take part financially in the assumption of the cinema complex eXcentris explains itself in agreement with a co-operation, however only in form of a competitive loan. 
The developer company Angus as well as the enterprise Parallèle, which had expected a donation at a value of seven million dollar of the ministry for education and cultural for the assumption of the Daniel Langlois of belonging cinema complex eXcentris on the boulevard Saint Laurent, in order to surrender these again to its actual cineastischen function, obviously do not receive, which they required. 
The government accepted to involve itself in this thing however on its own conditions. 
Instead of the expected donation the Quebecer government offers rather a loan in smaller than the initially expected height, which could bring a viable solution on favorable conditions into being, at least according to opinion of the sources entnehmbaren from the national rumor-mongers. 
A first plan of action as well as an inquiry after 12.8 million were rejected already last spring by the Quebec, that request for asking since that were again hum-moderately downward corrected. 
A proposal as well as a plan of action already by the president of the "Société de développement the entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, at minister St-Pierre sent, who leads the document eXcentris. 
Several days ago it had given to her a last special report. 
The counter proposal of the cabinet was conveyed the SODEC however on Wednesday. 
Parallèle and Angus have now by 31 December time to answer to these. 
Anyhow the premise of the state donation seems to have been really pushed to the side. 
We call ourselves in memory that the Quebecer owner community of the cinemas and cinema complexes had revolted itself against a direct state investment for the support of the assumption of eXcentris, by stating the argument, to carry out the Secretary of cultural affairs has no financial assistance for real estate projects there which he had given not also different cinema halls. 
Several other market players of the segment complained however in contrast to it substantial, economic assistance. 
Cinema boss of Daniel Langlois had presented the author cinema in spatialities of its cinema complex after the self-financed construction of the cinema over ten years long under large difficulties, which could justify the exception position on the part of the treasury. 
The lack of cinema halls, which show independent films, is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris its clientele knew to hold with the bar. 
The Société Angus as well as the enterprise Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the point, heads for their part a privately financed Campagne, from which they expect a sum 700,000 $, in order to set the acquisition in motion. 
For the spring 2009 only one canvas continues showing films in eXcentris i.e. Le Parallèle. 
A goal of the future purchasers is it, the three cinema halls on 27 February of next year with the demonstration of the film very much succeeded of Xavier Beauvois "of the hommes et dieux" to open again. 
Christian Yaccarini however did not recall the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one did not ignore, what he and his group of the proposals corrected downward to hold, which one made for them.
