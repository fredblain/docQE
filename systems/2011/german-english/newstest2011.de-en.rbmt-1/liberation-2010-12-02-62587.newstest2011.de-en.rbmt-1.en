Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches 
Since the debate about the modernization of the traffic economy on the Ile-de-France is in full course, it rains billions. 
At least in the discussions. 
One calls oneself here in particular the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris in memory, which by the Société you Grand Paris to be built is. 
In order to initiate the commencement of construction of the SGP, the state proclaimed a capital donation of 4 billion euros. 
In the theoretical pattern this is the sum, which the SGP would then make possible to lend on the markets a part the financial sum to their double one. 
Today it finally came to first computer forecasts. 
The additional budget examined of 2010, this morning of the finance committee of the national assembly, contains the intended measures, in order to apply the first part of these funds. 
It concerns here two different measures: the creation of a special tax to Erschließund and a higher taxation of the offices on Ile de France. 
First, then one takes article 15 of the bill, goes "in favor of the public institute Société you from Grand Paris." 
This is numbered: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year." 
Zweitere is a re-organization of the enterprise taxation already existing: to modernize "around these to increase by the product resulting from it and to surrender this increase of the Société you Grand Paris." 
How much would that bring in? 
A mystery. 
This sum is not numbered in the text. 
Of the 4 billion one is far. 
"It is implemented that fiscal resources are included to the 4 billion euros of the capital donation, which are applied by the state and which is carried out Société you for Grand Paris gradually for the project" to infer then is the explaining statement. 
With the SGP does not find at all one this system to offensive. 
"Since the instant, in which one books incomes (the two taxes, D.), One can cover and only then from the 4 billion draw project engineering for R. over three years long," then one explains. 
"This is noted in the budget and taken off gradually." 
The SGP estimates that 2013 will be begun to note the 4 billion for the budget 2014. 
This measure, whose 4 promised billions one will be able to look for still for a long time, runs the risk, a quite induced to cause parliamentary discussion. 
The first public meeting takes place on 7 December.
