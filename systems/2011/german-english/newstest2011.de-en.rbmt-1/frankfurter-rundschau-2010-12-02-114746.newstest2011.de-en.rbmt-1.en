The trace of the stones 
Uli Gsell also which procured itself, altogether to about 400 Kilos. 
On Monday evening it stood before Stuttgart station, the tuba on the back. 
It was demo. 
It snowed. 
History is well-known: In September the excavators were moved forward and had begun to break a large piece off of the north wing. 
The Stuttgart world was no more the same: Thousands of demonstrated against S21, billions-worth setting of the station lower. 
When it came to suspension of building work, a majority of the wing lay in rubble. 
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces. 
Crailsheimer shelly limestone, a soft rough stone, between 1914 and 1920 blocks. 
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old. 
It has itself few that breaking into secured. 
"These stones are relics." 
"You may not disappear." 
It swarms: "A cheap and poor stone, simply and groundful." 
When it sawed one, after cigarette smoke had smelled. 
Which it will make with breaking into, he does not know yet. 
Stones have time. 
Uli Gsell also. 
The trace of the Stuttgart stones leads into a forest with T5ubingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen its loaded established. 
The 44-year old acts with old stones. 
He bought all, which resulted with the outline in Stuttgart. 
"It would be a dishonor, it to crushed stone ground or in the dump would disappear," says it in its office, a Holzbüdchen, which was once an awake little house. 
Insulted and if one threatened it, he tells, when in September in the newspapers it stood that he had bought the remains of the north wing of the abort entrepreneur. 
But it talked with the S-21-Gegnern, for days. 
And it explained to them that he cannot do nevertheless now nothing at all for the outline. 
And if it happens just, then it is the most reasonable nevertheless, if the stones were re-used. 
About 200 S-21-Gegner took themselves thereupon one on average 80 Kilos heavy cuboid also, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros. 
As memories, some in addition, in hope to be able to return it in a reconstruction. 
500 tons Rongen had bought, to 25 large truck loads. 
About half still stores in the forest, which is rest for a long time sold. 
Owner of garden, landscaper, home-builder. 
From everywhere they came and dragged away, which trunk and supporters could carry. 
Stuttgart stones of the impact for a long time into "Mäuerle" transformed or into delimitations of herb patches. 
"Actually this stone is not anything special," says Rongen. 
"Would not be the political component." 
It rises in its jeeps, makes a route by its 20 hectare large realm. 
It studied and broke law off, late biology, then he interested in computers and finally stone resellers became. 
And stone lovers. 
It stores 40000 tons of stones. 
From all of Germany it carts its treasures together. 
He says, he is a largest old stone reseller of the republic. 
It brakes. 
In the snow ornate behauene sandstones lie. 
"You belonged once to Dresdens the Marienbrücke," tell he. 
Elbsandstein, yellow, warmly, it swarms. 
"My favorite stone." 
It goes the way highly through the forest. 
It points to a heap: red sandstone, early part Karlsruhe of the station. 
And further. 
"Beautiful travertine." 
Once the cuboids belonged to the grandstand of Stuttgart Neckarstadion. 
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, Cannstatter travertine from Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the cathedral sank Blasien, tuff of the Heilbronner hospital. 
Which work, which troubles, which sweat. 
If Rongen remembers, how the stones were gehauen in former times by hand and moved with simple pulley-blocks and ox trucks, it becomes completely religiously. 
"It would be nevertheless a scandal, if one would shred something like that." 
It is not become, loaded already not at all rich. 
But the stone reseller employs 14 people today, in addition in the forest stone-cutters, a sculptor, a smith, a glassblower and a garden farmer established themselves above. 
"We work hard, but it is satisfying," says the Resteverwerter. 
Shortly it must to Cologne. 
There are stones also there to save.
