A tenant of Bakala: It heats in the furnace - nevertheless higher rent pays 
An older stocky man leaves the straight client center of the society RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest owner of private of rented flats in Czech Republic. 
Under the arm a briefcase with three new leases to three apartments: for the own and the apartments of its daughters and its son, who serve a straight detention. 
All three in the context of the so-called "deregulation" the straight rent was increased. 
Instead of 3500 crowns monthly rent is to shell out the son in the next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns. 
"And there there is warm water to heat flowing in the apartment not times and must one in a simple coal furnace," does not tap it annoyed with the finger on the new lease of the son, to its signing it an authority has. 
"However which - signed I," explains it half detuned and half resigned. 
The citizen combination BytyOKD.cz, which called the new terms of hire "inkorrekt and immorally," guesses/advises the tenants not to sign and by 7 December wait the new contracts simply, on which it intends to publish a guidance, as one proceeds against such contracts. 
But the man only declines. 
"One says this, the other one," makes it a dark face. 
The region Ostrava becomes in such a way the large "deregulation laboratory." 
After New Year this deregulation is approaching for most rented flats in Czech Republic, whose tenant pays so far no rent corresponding to real market conditions. 
Aktuálně.cz decided to visit this "laboratory" personally. 
The RPG waiting area in Havířov is one of four in the region Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday breaking fully. 
Directly beside the door the bodyguards of a safety agency stand and with it call equipment. 
"Rent 2011," then shines a special palpation field on that for touch screen. 
Briefly touched lightly and already the equipment spits a number note out. 
We have the number "157" deciphered and already hardly beep them on the large display at the cover of the waiting area. 
Is a half second later one in turn. 
An older married couple enters the waiting area somewhat later, in order to ask for the rent, but the attack in the waiting area is not valid for the new rent obviously at all. 
Most people are here, in order to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance affairs and the like. 
Starting from in the middle of November flutter in the region Ostrava the covers with the new leases most tenants that altogether 44,000 apartments of the portfolio of the RPG into the mail boxes. 
The RPG Byty proposes in the letters a rent increase from approx. 15 to 38 percent. 
The special switch for the new rents in the client center is opened since 18 November. 
"The action runs somewhat over one week, that is, that is only the beginning," answers the ladies behind the switch after one moment hesitating, when the "client" emerges as a journalist. 
The deregulation and Bakalas former miner apartments are an explosive topic. 
Before the elections from Ostrava coming parliament vice-president Lubomír Zaorálek had taken up this topic by the ČSSD quite loud neck, no miracle that today the newspapers are full of it. 
"I want twenty years from them a new floor." 
"Not times ne besch. They knew, make themselves toilet seat replacement" the initially mentioned man air. 
Up to now above all pensioners at the switch line up according to the employees, in order to convince itself whether they really receive the promised tenant moderation, which promises them RPG, if they sign the special offer in time. 
Into the benefit of one to the half reduced February rent also the other tenants are to come, who sign the new lease by 15 December. 
Up to now "deregulation switch" is in Havířov however everything else, as if overloads from demands. 
"Of the 360 clients of yesterday only about 40 to 50 of the rent was in the year 2011 because of here," estimates the switch woman officials. 
RPG offers thereby both on its web pages, and blackboards individual renting agreements, where it appears necessary. 
If the renting parties should not agree however on the new rent, them from an independent court one specify. 
"That should be no threat, but is as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach to understand," explains RPG on its web pages. 
"Here nobody goes before court," means one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the road before the client center gives it at least partly quite. 
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pension, of it remain for me 5,000 for the meal, where I should take the money for a court controversy," mean he. 
Then the employee becomes nevertheless uncertain. 
"Mark see." 
"Mr. Zaorálek says about the media, it to them is not to sign and so not wait the people still off," gives her to consider. 
The adjusted rent ends in the largest part of Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and RPG Byty according to is the rent increase an economic necessity. 
"The existing height of the rents hands not times for the maintenance of the apartment fund out," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of the society RPG Byty and - the straight neglect of the housing fund criticized by the applied tenants is according to opinion of the home-owners the principal reason for the rent increase. 
While RPG could invest four billion in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the taken rents into the apartments, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it should be 5.2 billion. 
On the large sized LCD at the cover opposite the upholstered chairs in the waiting area of Havířov occasionally always emerge few red shining information. 
"The rent increases in the year 2011 around 15% and less concern 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of the apartments of RPG." 
"This always means at the most 7.50 CZK per square meters and month," is on the LCD monitor to be read. 
Only with 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG the rent increases by 38 percent. 
"In these cases it concerns to RPG the increase of extremely small rents from 19,66 CZK per square meter," argues. 
With 2600 apartments the rent remains in the next year on same height. 
RPG Byty promises the fact that the deregulation does not drive the rents precipitously up but gradually within four and eight years takes place. 
Which more - the enterprise imposes upon itself a further obligation: The enterprise wants to put all incomes from the rent increase (see chart) again into the apartments, particularly into heat savings - into new windows and into the thermal insulation. 
But - with priority these are to benefit that people, which sign the agreements over the rent increase.
