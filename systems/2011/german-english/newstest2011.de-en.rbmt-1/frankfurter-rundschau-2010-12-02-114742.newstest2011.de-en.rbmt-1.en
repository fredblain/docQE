Testers in the twilight 
The European food authority Efsa is infiltrated of the industry experimenting with gene plants. 
Now the team of experts Testbiotech, which understands itself as independent Institut for the impact assessment of the biotechnology, formulates this reproach. 
"Like a conspiracy theory sounds, but we documented, said it well" Testbiotech boss of Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich. 
The director/conductor of the Efsa team of experts for genetically changed plants, Harry Kuiper, and a further Efsa expert are for years also with the lobbyist federation Ilsi under contract. 
That is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer. 
Kuiper cooperated considerably in the Efsa test provisions for gene plants and stands thereby in a clear clash of interests, criticizes Then. 
The Efsa regulations are by paragraphs with position papers of the Ilsi and would carry thereby the handwriting of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma. 
It is already the second time that Testbiotech criticizes an interest collision. 
Like that a high-ranking Efsa manager is recently without editions or transition period to the Swiss agrarian company Syngenta - and thereby the sides changed. 
Also the Central German broadcast (MDR) had revealed recently personnel connections between controlling EU department and industrial lobby, what made the Federal Office for Environment Protection just like EU Parliament Aryan badly soundproofed. 
The Efsa can recognize meanwhile no clash of interests. 
One falls back to all respectable data, also to such the industry, as long as they are from high technical quality, is called it in a statement. 
Of the experts, who work for Efsa, one does not require that they do not have contacts to the industry. 
They would have to reveal these however. 
Kuiper grants its work for internationally the Life Sciences of institutes (Ilsi) in the USA. 
This calls itself as neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things to the risk estimate for biotechnology without order for lobby. 
In the thing independent experts criticize such as Then that genetically changed plants at present become certified without each feeding attempt with animals and are not tested the reaction by gene plants on environmental influences. 
"We want to know, what for example genetically changed corn on the field makes, says" Then. 
Present practice is it, only insulating proteins to test but not the whole gene plant which does not supply reliable results. 
"If one the risks does not search, how one is to then find her? ," Then asks accusing. 
That sees also Angelika Hilbeck in such a way. 
The female scientist researches since 1994 in the genetic engineering and is at present active at the technical university Zurich. 
The industry tries in this area as more and more in the USA now also in Europe to affect or discredit critical scientists. 
It gives therefore hardly still researchers, who are not intertwined with companies. 
For enterprises critical studies were not published usually. 
"The industry controls the safety research," maintains Hilbeck.
