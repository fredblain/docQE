Ogoniland is burned down 
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells as at the gas station: Billions liter run out crude oil destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland. 
Humans live on theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking. 
Celestine Akpobari means it well. 
, Calms Ökoaktivist troubles you "not off" the journalists down: "Will get you still today enough sludge before the lens." 
The 37-year old Nigerians pursued the attempt to make a blueprint a boy with the streaks, surrounding wading up to the chest in the water, it: In the rainbow-colored water gloss the scene works nearly prettily. 
The fact that under the surface brown crude oil clouds float is not to be seen. 
In former times she collected, tells here eimerweise shrimps Esther Badom on the bank of the Bodo Jetty river. 
In the meantime slowly-acting flowing waters is perfectly dead. 
Before five years enormous amounts crude oil poured into the enormous humid area from a burst piping. 
Fischer from that close convenient small towns Bodo must row now six hours, in order to arrive into fischhaltige waters: The Ogoniland lain in the heart of the Nigerdeltas is considered as one of the most badly polluted regions of the world. 
On the trip by the Mangrovensümpfe durchzogenen of river courses the whole extent of devastation becomes obvious. 
Instead of bright water the motorboat brown roots brews, who dips its hand into the water, pulls out oily fingers. 
The roots of the Mangrovenbäumchen rise up like black licorice bars out of the ground, leave sad isolate palms their whisks which can be found to hang. 
Bird-swarm, as they are otherwise usual in humid areas, one searches in vain: As soon as Außenborder is silent, eerie peace spreads in like a gas station the smelling earlier paradise. 
"Which here happened, is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari darkly: "We live in constant danger for the health." 
The war comparison is appropriate. 
The settlement area of the Ogoni is for decades a disputed battleground: Here the first Explorateure from Europe penetrated, here organized itself in the 80's-years with late executed writers Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, here had the Shell company 1993 its production to adjust more than 60 years ago, because it became too dangerous for its oil workers. 
This very day the return after Ogoniland is refused to the enterprise: While from the entire delta region of the three-way size of Switzerland over 5000 drilling sources and 7000 kilometers pipings are also pumped daily more than two million barrel of the black gold, the oil fields are appropriate for the company in the Ogoniland fallow, too unstably are the situation. 
Every few hundred meters rise up steel racks like bizarre sculptures out of the water: "Christian small trees" are much too tenderly called the heads of the boreholes. 
They are years old up to 50, which corrode to most to in Marks. 
Again and again break apart such a drilling head, mean Akpobari, then gutter a constant river crude oil in the water. 
More than two billion liter according to expert estimations in 50 years into the ecosystem of the Deltas flowed: Year by year the quantity oil, like it with the accident of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" before 21 years in the sea before Alaska penetrated - one of the largest environment disasters in the history of mankind. 
Who is to be made responsible for the continuous eco-gau, over it one argues. 
While the Shell company makes sabotage and the organized oil theft responsible for more than 90 percent of the contamination, environmentalist sees bursting drilling heads and leaking pipelines as main causers. 
Shell puts on substantially lower safety standards in Nigeria than otherwise in the world usual, accused the US-scientist Richard Steiner the company 2008: However the rate of defects at the lines is higher "around a multiple than elsewhere." 
At a place, which looks from the distance like an abandoned, oil-smeared workshop in the open air, shapes emerge from the Mangroven: They are stark naked and up to the neck oil-smeared. 
Under one of the many barrels, which are to be constituted partly connected with tubes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the area, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery. 
In the barrel the crude oil over the fire is heated up several hours long, explains Michael, the boss of the group. 
First gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the catching pot, later trickles in the end the line kerosene and finally Diesels out. 
Thus Michael and four employees produce 300 liters daily up to four barrels of Diesel à: "34,000 Naira" - a dollar bring us approximately 22. 
The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state of black Africa. 
Nigeria has only one refinery. 
The Diesel price ridiculously low with scarcely 40 euro-cent per liter can the illegal digesters still undercut: Because they get their raw material in vain. 
It comes from "Bunkerern," which tap the pipeline net straight through Ogoniland: In this way are lost to the country according to experts in the entire Niger delta daily at least 16 million liter crude oil. 
Only a infinitesimal small part of the provisionally stored temporarily raw material is however illegaly improved: Organized criminal networks, to which also politicians and sell high-ranking of military are to belong, fill the lion's share into tankers and it on the world market. 
The debate, whether the environment disaster is owed rather activities of the population or the lax mode of production, holds the activist Akpobari for purely academic. 
"The oil companies were noticed not as intruders and would not have been destroyed them the base of life Fischer not so thoroughly, would give it neither to sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries." 
In the meantime the relationship of the Ogoni is particularly destroyed to Shell however so that only one departure of the company asks in would come: "Perhaps yes other nationalities turn out like the Chinese than better." 
There Michael becomes nervously. 
"High time that you disappear, say" the muscular oil man. 
"Each minute can the soldiers come." 
If the illegal Ölveredler is gotten by the special-purpose force of the armed forces, no arrest threatens them, probably however a painful bribe. 
Also the soldiers primarily originating from the national north want to profit - like all Nigerians - from the raw material. 
"This condemned things brought, say our country in every sense on the dog" Akpobari.
