More and more parents want human being control instruments, in order to have the kids under control 
The fear around the own children grows and thus considers more and more parents supervising it by GPS. 
The system, which was originally invented for search after cars, can locate just as well humans, which also in such cases would be helpful, as recently with the without trace disappearance of the Anička of nine years Janatková. 
The equipment is not at present about as largely as a cigarette box however already soon might it be larger, than a wrist-watch. 
The case of the disappeared Anička has many humans shifted in fear and fright and in such a way to hold it after means and ways look out to protect their children better. 
Also for the price of an impairment of their privacy. 
"We strive to say all that it does not concern to reduce the probability here under any circumstances Herumspionieren, but around an effective means that it comes, leads to the tragedy" Petr Pilin of the society macro because on, one of the suppliers of GPS datum locators on the Czech market. 
"I admit that it can come in individual cases to the abuse of such devices, for example if one it someone into the bag am, without he knows of it, but we had so far no such case to register." 
"Most customers really buy it for safety reasons," add Pilin. 
According to its opinion the child should however always know, the "box" serves which purpose and how one uses it in emergency. 
The child psychologist Dana Bočková points out however that a child, if it may not carry such a thing gets rid of it of its simply. 
"Also very small children show large creativity, if it concerns to lose certain things intentionally if they do not want to be controlled." 
"Already the mobile phones created at first with parents large expectations, but they can be switched off just as easily, as these new control instruments," mean Mrs. Bočková. 
According to their opinion it is also disputed whether such actually helps a facility in case of an attack. 
"With planned kidnappings the kidnapper controls practically always, whether the child has any electronics with itself, with that it to be located could." 
"Today it is the mobile phone." 
"If such control instruments broader use would find, them these to likewise search, would be there their sale surely accompanied by solid advertisement." 
"In these cases are the criminals of the police always a step ahead," mean the psychologist. 
It grants however that similar devices can be quite helpful with a sudden attack by a paedophile. 
Roberta Čech of the society RC according to monitoring, which offers detection services both for automobiles, and for persons, can help the existence such of equipment also if it is destroyed immediately after the attack. 
"The equipment can be adjusted in such a way that it announces the respective position in certain intervals." 
"Even if it were destroyed immediately, is available at least the last position of the person concerned." 
"With more expensive devices even a gradiometer is integrated, that is, if one falls down and remains motionlessly lying, the equipment sends immediately a warning by indicating of the position," states Mr. Čech. 
According to its opinion similar services could perform also intelligent mobile phones with navigation, one need only a special software to bring in. 
The problem of the present datum locators consists of it that it concerns here either devices into matchbox size, the supporters resembles or around smaller mobile phones. 
So the danger always exists that one loses it. 
Mr. Pilin of that macro because according to one tests from there in the presence of devices, which look like normal digital clocks. 
"That has the advantage that the possible aggressor does not have to recognize at all that it concerns a monitoring and/or a datum locator. 
"Or he notices only after certain time, which gives, adds a time lead to the police" it. 
No matter, into which direction the development goes - to bracelets or supporters, always thereby used the same technology, as during the vehicle detection. 
Thus around the combination of detection function assistance of the GPS system (exactly the same as with the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone, which announces the current position.
