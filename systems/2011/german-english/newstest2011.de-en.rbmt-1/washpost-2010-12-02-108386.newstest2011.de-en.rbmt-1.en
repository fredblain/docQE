Can politeness connect the separation? 
After a campaign at insult words and Negativität this week broke little politeness off in Washington. 
Is it omen of a genuine two-party co-operation or one moment of the illusion, before one returns fast again to the fight of the parties in the capital? 
Meetings to Tuesday between president Obama and Spitzen congress brought no break-through in large questions, with whom one during the so-called "lame duck yourself session," which meeting had to employ in the end one government period, in which no more decisions are made. 
After all what one hears, it was to be governed neither a polite discussion between two different sides still another attention of their divided responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a party point collecting. 
The public meeting of the deficit commission of the president on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences, which exist between the members further. 
It seems to be clearly that a close interaction lets a mutual respect develop during one period of months, that the ideological gap, which separates further the members, masked. 
That is hardly enough, in order to state, it is started a new era of co-operation. 
Both sides are now in a test phase - in that the one of the other indication of the cooperative and compromise readiness calls in, while one tries to weigh the borders of the public opinion and the patience of the voters after renewed party warfare. 
Therefore the meeting limited on Tuesday and its estimate were by the participants to a minimum of demands or accusations. 
The philosophical differences between Obama and the republicans are too large and too deep, that one could expect a fast change of the atmosphere, which predominated in the past two years. 
All the same whether it concerns taxes, donations, health or claims, which are both sides kilometres away from each other remotely. 
To good the latter the November choice Washington was correct at least for short time mild. 
"No question, the intonation changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, which now for the "Ethics and Public Policy center" works. 
"That is inevitable after elections. 
Elections arouse party passions, which die again. 
And that is well like that." 
In some questions, particularly in those, which on the agenda the "lame duck session" stand, republicans and democrats have hardly another choice to find than a solution." 
Bush's reductions of taxes end of the year ends, and nobody endorses that. 
Both sides want to find a way, over some or all too receive, are it now passing or permanent. 
To expect likewise is compromise concerning increased unemployment pay, if only, because the republicans it cannot afford that one believes, the favored reductions of taxes for the realms, while they refuse unemployed person workers a support. 
After the meeting on Tuesday in the white house the optimism rose that one in these questions during the "lame duck yourself session" to unite and at the same time also contract the new START can ratify. 
But William glass tone of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful co-operation in urgent questions the lame do not duck session" compellingly to a permanent co-operation of the parties lead must, if new 112. Congress is called up in January. 
Instead, then he says, is a phase of the Nichtübereinstimmens more probably perhaps even inevitable. 
"After the things, which must be done, are done, will turn over, said this short term psychology to confrontation" it. 
Wehner is also sceptical - and this skepticism is divided by many - which leads politeness to true co-operation. 
"I see much that happens from today on until 2012, as Vorkampf, or, he said shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012." 
The reasons for this have to do much with the presentation of the new republican majority in the white house and with the tea party voters, who were helpful to their education. 
How it procures the republican leaders over the fact also be may to keep that it too highly to play poker, it to know that they must try, their promises, to lower the expenditures of the government and to set the health reform repealed. 
These party lines become already clear in the first reactions concerning the recommendations of the deficit commission, which a tax revision and the raising of some taxes as well as the rise of the pensionable age and lowering the public expenditures contain. 
The deputy chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles transferred one of the most difficult jobs to Washington and to have to set pushed in accordance with their own estimate, so much on it, the deficit question on the public agenda that these no more cannot be ignored. 
But they need within the commission 14 of the 18 voices, in order to make their plan regarding official recommendation and them fight much, in order to come only into the proximity of this number. 
The largest resistance is in the selected representatives of the committee, since in financial questions, at least today, only little clearance or little sympathy for compromises is. 
Galston forecasts two phases in the fight between the white house and the republicans in the congress. 
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party collisions, if the republicans Obama regarding the national budget, which provokes taxes and the health system, later then followed of a phase of larger two-party co-operation. 
What will lead to this change? 
The public opinion. 
It is proven that, despite the partyness of the current choice, which desires majority of the Americans still that the two parties work together. 
If confrontation leads into a dead end, how it happened 1995, then both parties must pay attention carefully to the public reaction. 
Whoever is condemned to losing, the course will change and the compromise to look for will have. 
That may be indeed an optimistic aspect. 
Partyness and polarization are today larger than in the center of the 1990er years, and they seem to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and the congress republicans than at that time between president Bill Clinton and the republicans. 
At the same time the activists of both parties sees 2010 as pure preliminary for a choice by far more extensive at consequence 2012. 
So seen the politeness, which is carried this week to the exhibition, may be welcomed by many Americans. 
But it will require more trouble very much on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions which separate the two still.
