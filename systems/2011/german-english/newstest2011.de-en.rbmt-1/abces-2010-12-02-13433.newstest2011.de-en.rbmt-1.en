The Catalan cell procured Al Qaida of thousands of passports 
Except the seven arrests in Barcelona there were three further in Thailand 
The seven Pakistani arrested by the policemen of the secret service place of the police of Barcelona and the Nigerians formed the Jihadistic cell, which different Al Qaida groups, steered from Thailand, under it the "movement for the freeing from Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latters was an authoress of the assassination attempts in Bombay, which demanded 2008 106 deads - with passports supplied. 
The Spanish Minister of the Interior assigns a great importance, which goes so far that he insures to these investigations, with the "operation Kampai" is the falsification apparatus Al Qaidas world-wide "weakened" and "thus to their capacity to act." 
Researchers go out of it that in two years, in which the cell was active in Catalonia thousand of passports to Thailand sent, where these were falsified and to it to the groups, of which the criminal galaxy consists Al Qaida, sent, so that of them could cross "fighters" unpunished the borders more European and other western countries. 
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the Jihadistic net, which was active in Europe. Therefore except the Thai investigation organs also different European police units participated in the investigations. It is not to be excluded that it will come in the area of the European Union in the next days to similar assassination attempts as that, which was implemented on past Tuesday in Barcelona. 
In co-ordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade arrested) in Thailand a further was accomplished, with which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt as well as the Thailänder Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested. 
They had led from Bangkok the cell established in Spain and other European countries. 
The Catalan net - some of it had been destroyed made in the year 2009 - stole in particular tourists of passports in accordance with the defaults of the so-called "international Islamic front." 
That means that the documents on the names of men had to be in the age of 25 to 45 years issued its and still several years valid\; they were not allowed to exhibit visa stamps. 
In investigation circles it is underlined that no connections between in Catalonia the arresting and the assassination attempt in Bombay could be proven up to now, although the author of this assassination attempt was, "Laschkar e-Taiba" one of the receiver groups in Spain of the stolen and thereupon in Thailand of falsified passports. 
Nevertheless it should be reminded of the fact that some days before the assassination attempt from Catalonia by means of a money transfer enterprise several thousands dollar, which became "invested" in the purchase by Prepaid maps for mobile phones, which were used later by the members of the "command," which prepared an end for the life of 106 persons. 
The police seized an extensive documentation.
