Dupont partially reprimanded 
The Quebecer broadcast moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian supervisory board for broadcast standards (CCNR) because of his controversies expressions over social welfare and Haitians just like because of its out-due manner of speaking over radio. 
The CCNR holds the opinion, M. Dupont and its CHOI 98.1 FM-team would have the right to own expression of opinion, however certain expressions would have "inaccurate information about the social welfare and unauthorized negative representations of the Haitians as well as likewise such a coarse manner of speaking contained, those the transmissions radiated during the day are inappropriate." 
The supervisory board had likewise conclusion-concluded that a discussion over suicide, which contains the spreading of the names of two persons it committed the suicide, against the code of the broadcasting offends. 
The CCNR had received several complaints of reference during the comments made in the period of 2008 and 2010 radiated transmissions. 
The first order was inserted due to a complaint of the "front commun the personnes assistées sociales you Québec." 
The Aktivistenorganisation had weighted that the amounts specified in the transmission were inaccurate. 
The moderators should give rather solidly than misleading information. 
Regarding the topic suicide had represented moderator Stéphane Dupont the opinion, is the suicide an expression of cowardice. 
The majority of the supervisory board members had drawn the conclusion, the obtained message is here that suicide not when solution may be regarded of life crises. 
"The majority of the supervisory board considers the fact that in ask standing consequences of the transmission "Dupont le midi" a sensitive topic in family-fairer and suitable way would have begun to cut." 
Therefore it was occupied with no blame opposite its person. 
The last point at issue concerned the statements, which had referred to the earthquake in Haiti. 
Stéphane Dupont and Jean René Dufort had supplied themselves in this connection an medium-effective dispute that a quantity of reactions had caused. 
The CHOI moderator had explained in favor of the Haiti assistance to have donated since one would not know with certainty whether the needy would also really receive the cash donations. 
The supervisory board is the opinion that these comments an abusive character were not that however its cumulative effect presents an unauthorized negative representation of the Haitians. 
"I already abgebüßt my three-day-long suspension punishment in this thing." 
"My document is virgin for one and a half years," explained the moderator. 
In all resolutions the supervisory board the spreading of a coarse mode of expression prangert on. 
In all cases the CHOI-FM broadcast announcer acted "beyond its obligations." 
The consequences for the radio station, which should have communicated among other things its decisions uniquely during the main end time within one period of three days, is slightly.
