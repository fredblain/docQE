Euro: the EZB is compelling to maintain their purchases of government stocks 
The last meeting of the central bank council of the EZB last year should offer possibilities to opportunity point out, how one comes out from the crisis, or at least the arrangement of a large number of unconventional measures the monetary policy to announce, the end of the year to its conclusion to come be supposed. 
The crisis of the European national indebtedness obligated, the central bank in Frankfurt can not afford without a doubt, also the today's it to incurr the loss more than strained situation on the European bond markets in order not to cause their aggravation. 
The political costs thereby would be by far too high. 
The French Minister of Finance Christine Lagarde had yesterday welcomed taken, active role on the occasion of a press conference of the EZB in favor of the solution of the national budget indebtedness of Europe. 
She did not dare to say, whether she the opinion is, the central bank can still more do, for example by setting in motion of her program of the purchases in motion of government loans. 
"I keep my considerations for my European trade partners before (...) ." 
Jean-Claude Trichet, Präsident of the EZB had not pointed himself the day before to Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the economic and monetary committee of the European parliament very eloquently concerning his projects, but itself rather been content to point out that "it continued using the program of the purchases of government stocks on the secondary market" will and that we will see at the meeting on Thursday ," like the decisions it fails." 
Only certainty: The EZB will leave its key interest invariably with 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009. 
In practice the obligation purchases of the vault were doubled of the EZB last week on approximately 1.35 billion euros. 
And according to indiscretions of some resellers it is to have transacted new purchases at Irish and Portuguese government stocks yesterday. 
Altogether the central banks of the euro system made for May 2010 purchases at a value of 67 billion euros. 
Among the resellers the anticipation of further pursuing the buying rate is not under any circumstances doubted (see page 29). 
The political economists expect already no more remarkable change of course. 
If the loan business from over three months will have disappeared already from the arsenal of the EZB, the latter will create itself still at the unrestricted fund reserves in lavish kind will make, during one period of one week up to three months. 
The political economists make themselves already today calm on the fact that this measure will expand still by some months. 
"I cannot imagine that the EZB will amend its program to substantial kind." 
"Otherwise it would be received the risk to provoke new tensions in the short term," then Michael Schubert, Volkswirt of the Commerzbank assumed. 
," A progressive exit intended for the process of the first quarter 2011 seems to me," anticipated more probably for his part Norbert Bräms, political economist with Sal. 
Oppenheim. 
Within the range of its interventions on the market of the national indebtedness "the EZB should upright-hold such a purchase volume by obligations, the slow-acting market encouraged," adds Norbert Bräms. 
Considering the relevance of the exposed position of the European banks on the markets of the national indebtedness in the Eurozone the central bank does not have other choice to maintain than their presence on the market. 
"Enthusiasm for the net yields paid to the weakest states must step you to prevent," testified yesterday an important debenture holder at each price to the Steller of the investors lacking on the market and act in such a manner, around shoots forward. 
Because if the interest rates set to the high-altitude flight, the states were prevented still more to reduce or only stabilize their indebtedness. 
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
