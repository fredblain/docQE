The government Berlusconi goes into Italy into covering 
After a beginning of the week worrying for Italy the situation relaxed yesterday with the decrease of the hitting a corner interest on 10 years a little. 
A return to deceitful satisfying. 
In the end the meeting with the minister of economics the region chairmen Giulio Tremonti had the situation as "undecipherably" qualify and it with a "unvorhersagbaren" weekend to count heard, what the concerning however immediately disclaimed. 
On Tuesday the shears with the German interest rates would anyhow have reached its record of 210 base points, and the prices of the contracts for the covering of the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome. 
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council of Ministers that the discrepancy of Spain is to the German interest rates about 400 base points. 
His right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed itself however as "heavily procured" from the "market turbulences" and a possible infection danger from direction Ireland. 
"The good message is that Italy, the third national economy of the Eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland." 
"The bad news is that Italy is such as Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, political economist at the Hudson Institute. 
In the plain language is called that, its problem is the absence of economic growth and control inlets exerted by it and the consumptive, which bring the state in danger not to be able to cover its financing need any longer. 
The last Brussels prognoses were a cold shower for the government. 
In the future an Italian growth of 1,1% in the year 2011 and of 1,4% in the year 2012 expected... although the household budget which is present with the senate for examination on 1,3% and/or 2% counts. 
Under these conditions, then the European Commission calculates, the budgetary deficit in the next year still 4.3% of the Gross Domestic Product will constitute (against of the governments predicted 3.9%) and 3.5% in the year 2012 (instead of 2,7%). 
From there also the riot around a new household collective, which could be used after the holidays to a sum of 7 billion euros. 
"If necessarily, new economy measures must be seized," mean chartered accoutant Olli Rehn. 
To the hour Italy receives the support of international institutions. 
"The foundation of Italy economy are correct and its accounts are regular, those repeat we already for a long time," insure Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, which is entrusted with Italy with the IMF. 
"At this moment there are no problems, neither on short term, nor on long-term view, there from Italy despite its high indebtedness (119.2% of the Gross Domestic Product in the year 2011, A.D. R.) smaller Stabilisationsfortschritte to be demanded than of other countries," observes jetty Carlo Padoan, chief political economist of the OECD. 
The question about the political unsteadiness remains. 
On 14 December Silvio Berlusconi a motion of no confidence of the chamber of deputies to be faced with, due to those preferred the elections at the end of March be already organized could. 
It is approaching thus a little favorable period for an adoption of resolutions regarding a heavy crisis.
