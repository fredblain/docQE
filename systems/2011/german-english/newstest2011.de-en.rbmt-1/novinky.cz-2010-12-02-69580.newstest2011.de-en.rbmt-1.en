In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen the anti-corruption police made arrests in the last days. 
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. were exhausted from the detectives in handcuffs. 
This had allegedly tried to manipulate a straight taking place public competition in such a way for the completion of requirements for restitution that properties offered in the competition were assigned to a concrete prospective customer. 
This is to have paid Luboš G. for it one half million. 
"At this time I can only confirm the fact that the police said a person because of the crime of fraudulent machinations with a public competition pursued," to Antonie Zelená, the boss of the Pilsner public prosecutor's office of the newspaper "Právo," could not grant further details it regarding the current investigations.

The spokeswoman of the ground fund Lubomír Černá stated the police on the relevant question of Právo, in the Pilsner branch of the ground fund actually arrests made and this during a public competition. 
"It concerned a client not at all and around one of our employees," made it concrete. 
The public competition had Mrs. according to Černá the correct designation "request to the lodging of tenders from requirements to the transfer of properties in accordance with the ground law" and in cases would take place, in those several applicants interest in offered property bezeigen. 
"These persons offer requirements for restitution which can be settled to the request a higher value of their in the framework by the transmission, than the proclaimed real estate value." 
"Specified according to the offered requirements the sequence of the potential purchasers, afterwards transfers the ground funds property to the person with the highest offer," explains the spokeswoman of the fund. 
Luboš G. were obviously to information at the disposal, which had registered on the request and since he entitled person was, since it had bought a set of requirements for restitution, offered he interests of property that he withdraws himself from the competition. 
Obviously against a fat compensation. 
That would be also a sufficient explanation for why he had a large money with its arrest such with itself. 
Luboš G. had already in the past all too good contacts to the Pilsner ground fund. 
Thus it played a role, which criminally one pursued, because he gave change in spare restitutions properties also in the Causa of the former boss of the ground fund Václav Sankota, to which already location decisions to building projects pleases were. 
At that time Luboš G. acquired of ground fund for example also properties, which were intended for the building of public roads, more exactly said, in the place, where the building of the Zufahrtsmagistrale polarized Borské to the trade area was planned. 
Later it exchanged these very favorably with municipal authorities against a house directly in the historical center of the city, which exceeded the value of properties far. 
The city hall had at that time with a heavy heart small adding, in order not to endanger the building project by the blocking of properties.
