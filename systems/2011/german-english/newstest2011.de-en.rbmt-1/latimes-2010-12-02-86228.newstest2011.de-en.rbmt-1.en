If you on request of a president of appearance, become the people it to notice. 
President Obama asked Esperanza Spalding to arise with the ceremony on the occasion of the Nobel Prize award 2009. Now the 26-year old jazz Bassistin and singer Ã¼berrachsenderweise for the Grammy of this year in the category newcomers of the year were nominated. 
In view of the fact that Spalding is already since its album "Esperanza" 2008 in the jazz scene a celebrated star, the nomination appears a little unusual. But it corresponds Grammy rules, according to which an artist before publication of the album, with which it admits in the broad public became, may have published at the most three albums. 
Their ambitious album from the year 2010, "Chamber Music Society," is surely a step forward. And with their lively voice and a good feeling for Pop, radio and Latin Music, one can compare Spalding calmly with Norah Jones 2003, whose large success in the year 2003 as a jazz artist in this category of the nomination Spaldings comes next. 
Furthermore the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer trio in the category instrumental albums was nominated. This favorite of the critics experienced thereby a vast success. 
To the competitors Iyers belong among other things to "Moody 4B" of the experienced saxophonists James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboard player John Beasley. 
Trombone Shorty, some favorite from new Orleans and frequent guest in HBOs "Treme," was distinguished in the category contemporary jazz, in which otherwise rather albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber are to be found. 
The Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue probably received earned attention in the category large group. It steps thus on against Billy Childs Emsemble with its chamber jazz and adventure-hilarious Dave Holland and its octet, whose Life Ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassists as democratic bandleader.
