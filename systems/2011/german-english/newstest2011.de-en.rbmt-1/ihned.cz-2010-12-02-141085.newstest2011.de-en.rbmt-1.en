I wish a calmer year to my successors, than we had it in Farmet 
The victory euphoria was replaced fast from the consequences of the crisis. 
Owing to its determination Farmet has the worst behind itself. 
Karel Žďárský, the company owner of Farmet received the price for the first rank of the competition Vodafone company of the year in the past class. 
The jury appreciated at that time the efforts, with which it stamped an enterprise from the ground from the small tool construction in Česká Skalice, which makes hundreds of millions sales. 
"I can say that this appreciation not only me, but also all my employees encouraged and in the fight with the competition" the previous year winner encouraged, says our self-confidence. 
At the beginning the company history of Farmet the effort stood to do something useful. 
And as then the state to its father Karel Žďárský as compensation for the property seized of the communists a small workshop to the lease, hesitated he offered not for a long time, let his career in the company, in which he was by then busy, rushes and based also a few comrades of its father his own company for the production of plastic tubs. 
Short time after they began to concentrate on vegetable oil presses. 
Within 18 years they ascended to largest manufacturers of automatic presses in all of Central Europe. 
But only by success in the mentioned competition and its medialization it entered also the consciousness of the non--specialized public. 
"That our customers notice the mark Farmet clearly more intensively now, also our foreign partners did not only begin the circumstance to be able to co-operate with a company which achieved greatest possible success in its country, larger value to attach," say Karel Žďárský. 
The past year did not however only stand with Farmet in the indication of the victory euphoria. 
The appreciation proceeded from the economic results of the enterprise in the year 2008 and a part of 2009. 
And straight 2009 were the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products. 
The crisis, which vibrated the citizens, but above all enterprises at that time still less, achieved straight its high point - many companies were compelling to stop their investment projects and to limit the purchase of new facilities and technologies. 
"We could not escape this situation naturally also." 
"The sales decreased by 40 percent, we had production to limit and even to dismissals seize," explains Karel Žďárský 
A viable enterprise must seize every now and then also such unpopular measures. 
It succeeded however to hold the situation into the grasp too gotten and the company in the black numbers even if with smaller profits, than before the crisis. 
With one the enterprise was not determined to make reductions - during the investments in the research and development. 
"From the subsidy we built a research and a training center, we encouraged our presentation on international fairs and acquired main prices with domestic exhibitions," say Žďárský. 
Everything witnesses of the fact that we overcame the crisis. 
The sales grows again and with them also the number of new employees. 
"I wish much joy in the victory to the new winner - however in calmer atmosphere," Karel Žďárský lets align.
