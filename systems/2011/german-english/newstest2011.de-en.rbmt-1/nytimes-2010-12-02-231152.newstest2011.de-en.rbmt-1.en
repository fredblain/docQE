Police employments in China become gentler 
Like a training officer seaweed Shenbin walked across an urban place, examined his nervous subordinates and gave thereby with military authority and absorbed voice of instructions. 
It wanted that its female members of the Chengguan - of China robust guards of the urban order, feared and despised for its arbitrary raids and its tendency to the force - which spectators impress. 
"Straight lines stand!" 
"View straightforward!" 
"Them," whispered he shows to them too, "like pretty girls like that is!" 
Four girls, hardly the teenager age outgrown, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants stood tightly. 
Four pair black pumps were located in straight lines row. 
Four tidy hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue Weis touched loops. 
"For me they see on the average out," notice Mr. Tang contemptuously. 
"Models are pretty." 
Several governments already tried to polish up the image of China city inspectors. 
In a city all new applicants must have a university conclusion. 
The province Guangdong introduced instead of the grey-green bright blue uniform. 
Wuhan in central China replaced force by down-rigid: 2009 circled according to reports 50 officials a duly not set up lunch car and stared the operator on, until this packed up after a half hour and left the place. 
Xindu, an urban district in Chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants, would like to change the image basically. 
Since 2003 13 women strengthen the urban police patrols. They were selected special due to their appearance, their good figure and their youth. 
They are to lend a softer, feminine aspect to the coarse police. 
But also Scarlett Johansson would unfortunately succeed hardly, the bad picture, which the Chinese of these city commands have to improve. 
With good reason, so the critics. 
Differently than the police these officials may implement the urban laws only assistance of penalties or other administrative punishments. 
But the Chinese media show by routine another picture. 
In January 2008 officials in the province Hubei flogged a spectator to death, when this filmed her with its mobile phone thereby how they struck down a protest action against a dumping ground. 
In the last year a training manual of the Beijings officials was stolen and published in the Internet. One describes how offenders without bloodshed can be lambasted. 
In this year a Shanghaier suffered water melon resellers after a melee with five officials brain injuries. 
Being bursting with force a video game that from the Internet can be downloaded, shows trained officials in China with an attack on street hawkers. 
"Chengguan makes for the government fear," lamented the national newspaper China Daily in the last year, after further controversies concerning tactics. 
The newspaper required a "really thorough cleaning." 
Sceptics find the current approach for clearly insufficient. 
When the Distrik looked for eight female recruits in October by announcement, a Editorial asked the question into Beijing Evening news whether the women genuine tasks had been supposed to serve or only as optical diverson. 
Probably both. 
According to job advertisement women at the age were looked for from 18 to 22 with good figure and "harmonious features." 
They should be above average large - over 1,5m or 5 foot, 2 1/2 tariff. 
Conditions of employment end with the reaching the 26. Year of life. 
According to the officials is the activity for women over 25 physically too exerting. 
"The most important is their image," indicated a unnamed district official with that quasi to government web page Rednet.com. 
"Whether the candidates gotten, it depends the job first on its outside feature, like size of, weight, features, etc." 
Then temper and "internal qualities" come. 
"Female Chengguan is like flower vases," said it and added, "nevertheless beyond that has it still different obligations." 
Zheng Lihua, deputy director/conductor of the city administration of the district, would like not to agree this description, 
it admitted however that in China size defaults are not uncommon in job advertisements for both kinds of sex. 
The same is valid for even features. 
Whether with good appearance is to be equated, is disputed in China. 
But humans with handicaps or physical distortions do not need to apply. 
"We can use here unfortunately no lames or humpbacks," so Mr. Zheng. 
"Your image would not be good." 
Liu Yi, which patroliert at the Baoguang place close of a monastery, is 22, has Apfelb√§ckchen and a probably formed mouth. 
It empfindetes not as sexist that so large value on their appearance one puts. 
"Finding you, I looks sexy in this uniform?" she asks with ironical view. 
Their colleague with the dimples, which 21-year old Xu Yang commentates, "we have the task to represent the image of the city." 
Reports their according to they do not regret the short attitude, since they would have more ambitious career plans to shoo than simply only resellers by the lanes in order it from the business making to prevent. 
Each morning is concerned the patrol with approx. twelve street hawkers, which try, to sell to foot or on the bicycle as much as possible rolls and Tofugerichte before they are chased away. 
"Mr. Wang, you disappear here please." 
"We already so often said that to you!" explains Ms Xu to a reseller, who had fled to foot and its fastened on a bicycle cart noodle kitchen had let down temporary. 
According to the woman officials is rather monotonous the activity as arduous. 
"It is nearly each day the same," explains Huang Jing, 20, in the spare time the sales natures studied. 
"All routine." 
A reason for it is that the female officials the goods of the resellers may not to confiscate, like their male colleagues. 
They can threaten offenders only to announce it to their male superiors. 
That is to protect it against public meeting with hostility, officials are frequently exposed to which in China. 
In this year hundreds inhabitant of Kunming, the capital of the province Yunnan, after the rumor circulated, rampaged Chengguan officials a reseller would have killed. 
More than one dozen of policemen and Chenguan officials were injured with the night incident, 14 government vehicles were upset or been into fire. 
Xindu remained so far spared by such force excesses. 
But riots are not to be excluded. 
Only two of block remotely from the calm Baonguang place, at which the female officials patroulierten on this morning, met over 50 person at a street corner. 
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, which was repaired against the regulations on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop. 
The owner cried Zeter and Mordio. 
After 15-minute hesitating the officials with furious face cleared the way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner. 
Left Xuedong, 40, a co-ordinator of the male patrol, stayed. It turned its white name plate, in order to remain anonymous. 
Like their colleagues the co-ordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supporting role. 
But they were not trained to present a clean image. 
"Sometimes we proceed verbal." 
"Sometimes in addition, physically," Mr. Li explains soberly. 
"The people with the controversy begin most time."
