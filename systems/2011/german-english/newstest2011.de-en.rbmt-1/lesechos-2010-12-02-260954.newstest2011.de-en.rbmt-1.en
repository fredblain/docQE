Second mandate: the notoriousness 
De Gaulle had really shortened. 
Mitterand had let believe that it shortens. 
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show smallest hesitating. 
And Nicolas Sarkozy still less than these. 
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next. 
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in the year 2012. 
But the notoriousness stands for the side of the mystery, which adheres to the presidency function, not well to face. 
Thus one must do in such a way, as if the doubt would exist from now on. 
In the one, as also in the other sense. 
2006 gave the supporters of Jacques Chirac, a third mandate is impossible, without believing even in it. 
On 15 November Nicolas Sarkozy in serious tone insured to make its decision sometime "in the autumn of the year 2011." 
That it would let be reminiscent on Tuesday evening in the Elysée before the UMP parliamentarians the perspective of "two mandates," little Fieberhaftigkeit had therefore spread. 
Was that the official announcement of its candidacy? 
Far been missing. 
The president let remind only of the fact that the constitutional amendment limits the number of five-year office periods of 2008 to only two. 
It did not make an statement, an announcement. 
It is not the first time that it mentions the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone. 
"You have at worst still seven one half year with me, or at best," he explained to them in July 2009. 
On a new in May 2010: "It does not believe that I do not think about the phase thereafter." 
Its words from the day before yesterday do not make it for no more the candidate than the day before\; in addition, not less. 
If they should cause comments, then for a double reason. 
The acceleration of the race around the candidacy with HP on a side. 
The admission of the competition with Ségolène Royal, who drives Nicolas Sarkozy to it, is however not to be revealed. 
On the contrary, it is its obvious candidacy in the year 2012, which admonishes many members of HP more promptly than accepted to the challenge. 
The bad surveys on the other side. 
For the first time the voters would prefer rights a candidacy of François Fillon to that from Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to survey of the BVA L'Express). 
"We have a candidate, and there is the environment of the prime minister with the UMP no discussions over it," reacted directly and carefully. 
"If it would find a defeat as possible, would not be it not candidate," communicates Jean-Pierre Raffarin. 
"It in it to always believe, triumph to be able," corrects Alain Juppé, who resigned himself to the notoriousness.
