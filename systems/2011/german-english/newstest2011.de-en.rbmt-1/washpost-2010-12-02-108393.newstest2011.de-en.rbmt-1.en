Khmer Rouge veterans in a forced manner to the confrontation with the past 
In a weakly lit up, concreted classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds of the man, who built him, at later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok. 
"Everyone loves here Ta Mok." 
"He was a good leader and he about his people worried," said Sreng Kor mA, 42 years. 
Because of its brutality during Khmer Rouge's rule admits former Khmer rouge center as "the butcher," remains the commander been a long way in this in the northwest of Cambodia popular, where it built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers to still live. 
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of Khmer Rouge in relation to the government, supporters of many years in Anlong Veng are provoked. 
In April local truth and reconciliation forum permitted the public confrontation with humans, who supported once the regime to the victims. 
In June the government distributed a school book, which tell for the first time the story of Khmer Rouge to children of former soldiers. 
And in July a community tribunal of the UN and Cambodia condemned a former member of Khmer Rouge, when it admits the former boss of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better than Duch, to 35 years prison for the first time condemned. 
With each of these developments the fear grew under Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, made its efforts more difficult around reconciliation and reintegration into the society of Cambodia. 
"There is still refusal and fear in former Khmer Rouge, but they do not have power to do something," said Chhang Youk, director/conductor of the documentation center of Cambodia, an independent organization, which investigates the regime. 
"For it the life under Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime became a symbol of the bad one." 
"It splits even families." 
During Khmer Rouge's rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, were executed roughly 1.7 million humans or it died at diseases, revision or before hunger. 
When the Vietnameses broke in and fell 1979 the pole Pot Ied government, the leftovers of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand. 
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated. 
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary the guerilla war of their basis in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia led, consulted Ta Mok the next generation in Anlong Veng. 
But years, when 1993 to the first democratic elections of the country led a peace agreement promoted by the UN, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began in the middle of the 1990er to overflow for government which led to the surrenders of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu SAM fan 1998. 
Pol Pot died 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not given way, was arrested 1999 by government forces with the Dangrek Mountains. 
It died 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he waited for his process. 
When their sponsors did not protect it any longer longer, most former Khmer Rouge's fighters fled into those wearing down poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory. 
Even if some few elitist official ones of Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts, because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers. 
"These humans profited to only very few from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the center for justice and reconciliation, which holds public forums in all of Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng, 
"You are anchored into the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime." 
"You grew up without any occupation knowledge." 
Sor Lim, 55 years, which had followed 1974 as teenager of the Rhmer rouge, Veng fought, before it to 1998 established itself in the jungle over concerns, in order a life as a poor rice farmer to lead. 
"The life under Khmer Rouge was good," said it. 
"Ta Mok gave to eat each something." 
"The life is heavy however, now, because we must worry about us." 
Current Khmer Rouge tribunal evoked concerns also here. 
Beginning of next year will try court, Nuon Chea, Khieu SAM fan, Ieng Sary and its wife as well as Ieng the Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister to place before court. 
The order of the court is it to condemn the old leaders and those, that are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases. 
That contributed a little to moderate the fears in Anlong Veng. 
Current medium speculations concentrated on in the Chaem, 64 years, which had been during Khmer Rouge's rule in the late 1970's district boss in the province Manteay Meanchey. 
2007 had it assigned the documentation center told by Cambodia, she had led the building of the Trapeang Thma of dam, a project, with which thousands of forced laborers probably died. 
In a hot evening returned in the Chaem of the work on the fields to its timber building at a dirty road outside from Anlong Veng. 
As the sun rejected in the Chaem it threw long shade on the grass dried up to discuss over their past with Khmer Rouge. 
If the court should cite it, then it would go refusing, said themselves it. 
"Cambodia lives in peace and in stability," said it. 
"There would be no more pursuits, would be here war." 
Prime minister Hun Sen, who fled 1878 of Khmer Rouge, in addition has repetitive before it warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court more suspect would accuse, although experts and historians discuss this. 
"Cambodia must dig and the past bury a hole," said it. 
But the confrontation with the past is what must do Cambodia, in order to be able to go forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center. 
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means a gathering of the broken pieces," said it. 
"It is our obligation to set these broken parts together so that like everything can understand." 
The center created first of the government approved school book over Khmer Rouge, the 75seitige "history of democratic Cambodia." 
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as appendix to the story-book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four sides over Khmer Rouge. 
How often in Cambodia the young people in Anlong Veng know only little about Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime. 
Touch Valeak, 19 years, a student to the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps the student to understand an important part of their history. 
But its parents reacted sceptically, when it brought the book with home, in order to read it. 
"My family leans many parts of the book and the court off," said it. 
"You are distrustfully, because they are not safe, like many humans by the court to be condemned." 
Such a resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicates, said Sok Leang. 
But the public forums, the school book and the court attain gradually influence," said it. 
Still Khmer Rouge possesses a powerful attraction here. 
Above in the Dangrek mountains from bushes more Ã¼berwucherter and with plastic garbage got filthy way to a rectangle leads covered by black soot, with a rusty sheet metal roof. 
Pol Pot's body after his death 1998 on a heap of tire one had burned here. 
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a mobile phone shop assistant at the roadside, said, she did not know much about the man, who had been burned here. 
"However it has a strong spirit and many humans to go here to it over to pray," said it. 
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday later and on the day wanted it to Pol Pot's last resting place to go, where it becomes shrubs of ripe bananas placing - in hope that he brings its luck.
