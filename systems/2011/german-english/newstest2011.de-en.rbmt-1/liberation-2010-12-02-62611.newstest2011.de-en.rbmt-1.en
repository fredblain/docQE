Alarm - of children taken pesticides 
A child of 10 years takes 81 different chemical substances over the day, thus this Wednesday study published by the combination Générations Futures (former movement for the protection of the rights and the respect of coming generations). 
The combination, which explains the fact that their results do not show "in view of the small number of analyzed samples statistically significant value but represents an illustration character of the treated problem," had between July and September usually the food consumed within four from a about ten-year child to the meals plus an intermediate meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris bought. 
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five blew fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 liters water per day - were examined just like Naschereien by laboratories in the search for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants. 
The plate balance is striking down: 81 chemical substances, under it 42 as possibly or probably carcinogenically classified and five as surely karziogen classified, just like 37 substances with Endokrinin interference factor, according to studies of several institutions as for example the international cancer research center. 
"Even if in approximate whole cases legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance not exceeded, then infers one this collection nevertheless very much well that the reality, in which the consumer is possibly exposed to carcinogenic materials or substances with Endokrinin interference factor is worrisome one," notices the combination. 
Already with the breakfast contained alone the butter and the tea with milk already more as ten of the possibly carcinogenic residuals and three reliably than karzinogen proven, just like more than twenty residuals, which can impair the endocrine system. 
From Brazil imported the apple, as intermediate meal for the study intended, exhibits traces of six chemical substances, among them in France a forbidden fungicide. 
The same is valid for the green beans from Kenya, in the lunch enclosed, with which the study traces of an insecticide forbidden strictly in the European Union determined. 
Furthermore also the chopping steak, the tuna from the can, the baguette and the chewing gum of pesticides and other chemical materials had even cribbed. 
With the tap water the analyses brought the presence of nitrates and chloroform to the light. 
During dinner was the salmon steak with 34 determined, chemical residuals at the "richest," and even the plastic plate used for warming the meal up in the microwave was not unloaded. 
The conclusion-finite risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer "is probably underestimated," so the study. 
"Alliance Europe Ecologie Les Verts" (EE-LV) suggested for its part "in view of the urgency the situation" introducing a moratorium over the use of pesticides in order to stop the "increase in illnesses caused by civilization." 
In July a study of the European authority for food safety (EFSA) had identified reference to the presence of residuals 365 more differently, in fruit and vegetable identified pesticides, which are consumed in Europe, among them 76 in Getreiden.
