A bone house also still fascinates after 100 years. Look at yourselves the interiors of Gaudi 
The roof seems like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spinal column of a dinosaur and the balconies is broken fish muzzles. 
That is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. 
From the local inhabitants the house with its organic forms got the nickname "bone house." 
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaic, those at sheds reminding fronts and pervasive soft lines, all this are typical characteristics for art nouveau of Antonio Gaudi. 
The front of the house plays with fantastic lines, tender colors and textures, which remind of nature and organism. 
Only when exact looking one notices that everything of geometry, rhythm and thought-out order is controlled. 
At the night the whole front works still more vividly, dramatically and the special Anleuchtung strengthens the gloss of the colors still. 
The same zestful lines and devoured forms control also the inside of the house. 
Wavelike formed wood copies the window frameworks, railing, Zierelemente of doors, even looking holes and ledges. 
The house Batlló in the quarter of Eixample at the encouraged shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 resulted from the change of a house from the year 1877, which Emilio Sala Cortese implemented architects. 
The reconstruction took two years and to 1906 up was locked. 
The investor, the wealthy manufacturer Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the outline of the old and the building of a completely new building, but finally it agreed the idea Gaudís on an unusual and also cheaper change. 
The dwelling house Casa Batlló did not sketch Antoni Gaudí however alone. 
He co-operated thereby with the architect Josep Maria Jujol. 
Straight ones on its drawing board developed the decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of reality and also the use of mosaics at the front were its idea. 
In the organization of the front however also numerous further Bildner and artist cooperated. 
The common work on the drafts for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful co-operation of Jujola and Gaudí. 
Thus Jujol took part also in the building of Gaudís house Casa Milá in the park Güell, in which also further works of Antoni Gaudí are. 
Already shortly after its completion the house of the local inhabitants of its organic forms got bone house" because of the nicknames ." 
Others again called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "yawning house." 
One says also, right at the top on the building is represented to holy George, the patron the sword by Catalonia. 
In addition, further bildhauerische elements symbolize hidden religious motives. 
Gaudí sketched for the time at that time a singular central heating system with vent holes and typical fire-places for the house. 
Somewhat more bizarre their 45-Grad-Neigung already seems. 
With its work Gaudí ignored consistently all construction specifications at that time and let themselves by no means from these confuse. 
Before commencement of construction it got the appropriate building permit the reconstruction, planned provided by him, by the city however the information concerning was so vague that the city fathers were frightened two years later with the completion so by the result that they required remedy. 
The councilmen pushed among other things also to the fact that the building with its columns intervened even in the public sidewalk. 
To changes it did not come however any longer, quite the reverse - Josep Batlló a request placed only fifteen days after the relevant request of the city quarter to the approval of the letting of the two high-altitude floors of the house - and she was promptly given to him. 
The home-owner drew into the lower floors. 
In the gallery in the 2nd stick a society salon was, in the third stick was the bedrooms and private areas of the apartment. 
The ground floor was leased to a jeweller's shop. 
The entire six-floor building goes through stairs to up to the roof terrace. 
All right angles and straight lines were eliminated and replaced by the fundamental elements of the change by curved and swung walls. 
In addition, Gaudí worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of areas. 
The social part can be connected by opening the salon doors completely and so could a larger society comfortably chat, without having to do with more confidential discussions without a certain intimacy. 
The house received a quite unusual roof and two further floors by Gaudís change except a new front also. 
Also Gaudís play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles is impressive, with those the inner court is disguised and the halations. 
The play of these two colors lends a maximum of light to all floors of the house. 
It made simply the principle too uses oneself that Weis the light reflects better, as if dark colors, which absorb the sunlight on the contrary in addition. 
The house Casa Batlló, which was taken up 2005 to the world inheritance list of the Unesco, can visit today everyone. 
In the first stick the roomiest and most magnificent apartment of the public is made accessible. 
The home-owners decided only in the year to this step and this from cause of the 150.Geburtstags of the famous creator. 
When one stated that this is a quite lucrative business, one maintained the inspections, yes one expanded her even on further common and the attic areas, including the roof terrace. 
The price for the inspection of the building of historic importance is however no pasteboard handle, it amounts to 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist documents of identification gets 20 percent of reduction. 
This amount exceeds the admission fees to other Gaudí buildings in the city. 
Who would like to learn the genuine atmosphere of the house with its dragon turrets to know, should try, to close friendship with one the house inhabitant and visit it at home.
