The new unit does not find unanimity 
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit to the fight against corruption and Kollusion on the part of Jean Charest numerous observers demand further the education of a public committee of inquiry to this topic. 
Robert Dutil, Minister of public security, stated, this idea does not come from yesterday: Quebec would have consulted already last January New Yorker departments the OF Investigation concerning this topic. 
The metropolis orders since 1870 over a standing unit against the corruption. 
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday surprised more than only one. 
One must say to the fact that this measure was not in the slightest discussed on the occasion of the meeting of the standing committee of the Quebecer of police service on 29 October of last year despite the presence Robert Dutils. 
It was not missing also to the fact that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois qualified, this announcement in terms of public security as "from the hat done magic a rabbit" as well as "at a table end by right tinkered solution." 
Minister Dutil had turned for his part again to those, which fears the fact that political power asks too much influence on in standing, future unit has. 
"You will see the result, if we will announce it," were content it to affirm itself. 
"One is aware of this problem." 
In accordance with Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, cannot replace the execution of a public survey to anything. 
"The more M. Charest persisted to want the more become to prevent the education of this committee of inquiry the people like it and I think that it has to hide something," explained it. 
"The only means to be able to educate a committee of inquiry is the resignation from Jean Charest," then for his part Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and politics systems explained to the ENA (staatl. University for the training of high civil servants). 
In order to come out from this dead end, it suggests to the Quebec granting to financial test control a special mandate so that can employ these investigations corresponding over corruption and secret arrangements. 
"One should be able to expand the mandate of test control," then he decided. 
It holds likewise the opinion that the Quebec of test control could granting the same power as to commissioners, what it would also permit to obligate the people to the statement. 
The education of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the government Charest. 
The Quebec of Ottawa likewise to require to amend the penal law to that effect in order to be better to this kind adjusted by crimes. 
This demand comes from the senior public prosecutor of the operation Marteau, which informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier about the fact that the jurisdiction is not clear in this kind of the prosecution. 
Vic Toews, Minister of State for public security confirmed for his part, its colleague of the law, Rob Nicholson, argues at present with certain, amendments concerned this dossier. 
While the operation Printemps 2001, which concerned the groups of the motorcycle policemen, were, 131 persons arrested, although the penal law had not been amended. 
Ottawa implemented the law due to its against Gangstertum.
