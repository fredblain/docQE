Nothing like away here 
In this evening it runs finally once again correctly approximately for the Irish. 
No trace of sadness. 
But the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much. 
The fans howl before joy with crashing loud music, it stamp with the feet. 
The Bailey pub in the southIrish Cork trembles, because the players table tennis balls throw and meet over a three-meter distance in beer cups -. 
"Bierpong" calls itself bizarre spectacle, to win gives it 500 euro victory premium plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong world championships in January. 
Cian Tanner is a calm type\; this shrill drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, really do not fit. 
And the 26-year old tries nevertheless to amuse to divert itself from the boring question, which will bring the future. 
On its plan fun does not stand in Las Vegas, it in January job interviews in New Zealand will lead. 
"I have an uneasy feeling thereby," say he. 
"It is not so far away from at home and still has I a work there." 
Nevertheless: Its friend waits in Auckland already for him - "she had jerk, twitches her desire job as an event manager, perhaps a good indication," says the young man and smiles. 
Because of bad perspectives at home already two from Tanners three brothers and sisters abroad looked for their luck. 
Its sister Yvonne, a social female worker, is in Sydney, its brother Colin has now a place as an IT-adviser in London. 
The boys go: As is the case for the Tanners it looks on the island in many families. 
100,000 Irish will probably leave, forecast the country in next time experts of the economic and social research institute ESRI in Dublin. 
To 2015 they count even on 200.000 emigrants. 
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a violent loss. 
If the prognoses prove to be true, it comes to an emigration wave comparably with that one, from which Ireland suffered in the eighties. 
After a decade of recovery, which brought large prosperity for the Irish with itself, now again sadness makes itself broad. 
The economic crisis disconcerts thereby above all the young, well trained Irish, for whom it went so far only uphill. 
Job loss and social descent seemed absurd in the boom years. 
Everyone was used, to money gave it in the abundance. 
In the meantime however are three of ten women and men under thirty without work. 
In that Irish Times gives it in droves reader letters of young emigrants, who complain: "Everything goes down in Ireland the brook." 
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - however who can, leaves and our country loses thereby a whole generation." 
"The latter constitutes then please the light." 
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, sees a dark future drawing up, because the government operates only eyewash and to the young people no more future prospects offers. 
"You reduce the minimum wages, but they do not have a strategy, like new jobs to be created are," say the 20-year old. 
She observes, how their fellow students proceed hand over hand themselves from an unpaid practical course to the next. 
Their largest concern, says it, is it, to have to emigrate in four years themselves. 
"This thought is sad and depressing." 
Men try to positively occupy such as Stephen McLarnon the topic. 
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a fair, which offers a Rundumservice about work abroad. 
"For entrants the work is abroad nevertheless a great opportunity to make the first steps on the career ladders," says the manager. 
On its web page photos surfers in Australia and snowboarders point to Canada. 
The message is clear: Abroad is no galley service works, but brings also freedom and fun. 
How it feels to develop elsewhere something Se√°n O'Donovan knows since a half year. 
Because there was nothing more to do for 29-year old engineer in Ireland, he works now with 15 Irish colleagues on the building in Germany. 
In Gelsenkirchen they pull up a straight fashion house. 
In January it continues to go to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project. 
Its homeland sees O'Donovan in the meantime only rarely, because it makes extra layers, in order to be able to at home pay the credit off for its house. 
"The situation is already a little moved," says it, when it steps after long time for the first time over the threshold of its house. 
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I am so well never more." 
He laughs something moves and goes through cooled down areas. 
The small house is located in a fine residential area with maintained front gardens, in the entries parks large, expensive cars. 
Together with a sister O'Donovan bought the house for forwards four years for 380,000 euros - 100 percent credit-finances. 
"Were crazy times, it gave simple money without many questions," says it. 
Does it have fear that it could go wrong with the credit? 
O'Donovan considers one while, tops up hot tea and says: "I do not have children, whom I must feed and I am young\; even if everything goes wrong, I can begin again." 
The civil engineer does not like a lamenting, which he often hears at present. 
"Nobody must be hungry - our situation is nevertheless by far not as dramatic as here in earlier times on the island," says it. 
"One while abroad works, that is not the worst, which can happen - perhaps we feel thereby only as Irish." 
He laughs and tells then of his father, who went in the last large economic crisis to England. 
"After seven years it was and the life again there continued in Ireland, completely simply." 
Cian Tanner pleases this thought. 
The future leave open and just look, like it runs with the life elsewhere. 
A few years it has work in London yes already behind itself and why shouldn't it run in New Zealand also well for him and its friend? 
A thing is there however still, those it in these days concerned belonging to: the celebration to its 27. Birthday on Friday in Dublin. 
He is afraid that it could degenerate into a vale party. 
"Not too many emotions," he says and drinks bare a large sip of its beer. 
"Vale, sounds nevertheless frightening." 
"Calling we it rather a leaving party, completely loosely, also a few friends, a few drinks, a few plays."
