Belarus agrees to accumulate not far uranium capable of bearing arms 
In a surprising victory for president of Obama the government of Belarus announced campaign for the world-wide protection of nuclear material on Wednesday that one will not collect any longer longer highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. 
That deal was announced to the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Byelorussian minister of foreign affairs Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the safety summit in a common statement after a meeting. 
The US Government had for many years tried to convince Belarus to collect highly uranium any longer not enriched and seemed last spring a hurdle to have achieved. 
But official ones of the US Government told Washington Post that in the past two months two secret treaties were met with Belarus, in order to remove for 187 pound uranium capable of bearing arms from a Byelorussian research institute. 
The prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee, who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, approximately 500 pound. 
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results from Obama's "nuclear safety summit of the 47 nations" from April to, the Belarus had excluded. 
And it was obviously well enough, in order to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit 2012. 
"I was really enthusiastic by the fact that they want a seat in the nuclear safety summit (of 2012)." 
"It proves to me that it said functioned," Ken Luongo, president of the partnership of global security, a group to the promotion of nuclear security. 
Clinton called the agreement "a very much meaning, important step" from Belarus. 
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure within four years all precarious nuclear material. 
Since then the US Government helped six countries to become loose their highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus will be seventh. 
A dozen of countries did it under the government of George W. Bush. 
At present of Obama's nuclear safety summit the Byelorussian president explained Alexander Lukashenko that the nation will never give their uranium up. 
"As keep highly enriched uranium -, Lukashenko said hundreds of Kilos, which is basically capable of bearing arms, and less enriched uranium" at that time. 
"That is our raw material... We will make from it no dirty bombs and will become we it for nobody to sell." 
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that are everything." 
Belarus approached nevertheless few months ago the USA on, when it indicated interest in the meeting of an agreement. 
The first approach to remove the uranium of Belarus in October was particularly complicated, because the material was easily radioactively contaminated, says official ones. 
It was shipped into a special course, more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, says official ones. 
The second approach was decided on Monday and accomplished according to the official ones by airplane. 
The US Government pays 14 million for these troubles $, whereby a majority of the money flows into the Byelorussian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons. 
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and co-ordinated, around confidence to develop," which led to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the energy Ministry, which works on the global danger reduction. 
The James Martin center for Nichtweiterzugebende studies estimates that as well as Belarus had hundreds of pound at highly enriched uranium in this year of at least 88 pound waffenf√§hhigen uranium. 
Belarus wants to dissolve its camp to 2012 according to the common agreement. 
The relations between Belarus and the USA was tensely for many years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh defiance of the human rights. 
But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approach. 
"Welcome being called the progress of these global security questions, the United States announce from America and Belarus that a increased respect for the democracy and the human rights in Belarus remains a central topic in the improvement of the bilateral relations and it is essentially for the progress of the country and its citizen" explains, her.
