China keeps its goals upright for reduction to that greenhouse gases 
The representative of China explained on the COP16, its country and would maintain it had undertaken enormous efforts toward the reduction of the carbon-pure its offer to reduce to 2020 40 to 45 percent its greenhouse gases. 
China holds its offer the emission from greenhouse gases to the year 2020 around 40 to 45 percent to reduce, insures Su Wei, the representative of this country on the COP16. 
With its first public appearance on that 16. World climate summit of the United Nations (COP16) insured Su Wei, its country enormous efforts toward the reduction of the carbon-pure and toward the conversion of its industry would have undertaken. 
It implemented that in the last four years its country had invested 245 million dollar, in order to lower the emission of greenhouse gases. 
However he explained the fact that China would not change its goals would work but together with the international community on this affair. 
He explained that the Chinese strategy is divided into things climate changes into four aspects: Dialog, structure of capacities, structure of institutions and support of pilot programs. 
In all aspects one made progress, including the adoption of a new energy law in the last year, which contains the goals regarding the reduction of the emission of gases, explained it. 
To reach on the other hand main header it out that in China the authorities of the Federal States with those of the central state and the communities would have co-operated, in order the goals to the energy saving, an effective use of the energy and the reduction from emissions to. 
In addition it implemented, some multiyear plans was already tackled or locked, both those, which were financed by the Chinese government, and such, which received funds from other countries. 
For example it referred to the program for the effective use of energy, which was introduced in the last five years and investments of the United Nations (UN), to the government and from private hands had received. 
Also a project runs on province level to the climate change, a further for the change of the traditional bulbs by energy savings pears and a further for the weakening and adjustment, explained it. 
Martin Krol, scientific government adviser in things climate changes in this country, confirmed that the efforts of China were by far larger than were generally accepted. 
It pointed out that the pro head emission of greenhouse gases in China amounted to six tons per person, while in the United States 100 tons are. China is responsible for a nine-percent total contribution for environmental pollution. 
Likewise make it unparalleled progress within the range of the energetic use. The energy effectiveness was increased in the last five years by twenty percent and up to the year 2020 is to happen a further, explained it.
