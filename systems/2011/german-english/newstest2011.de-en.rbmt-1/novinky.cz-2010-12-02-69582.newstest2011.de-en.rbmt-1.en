Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer are out - it works simply too slowly 
Fernet, rum and vodka, exceptionally also times a good whiskey, which one stole from the father from the house bar. 
Those are the beverages, according to whose benefit drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen must be most frequently emergency-treated. 
An exception are not children, who must sleep late their tomcat repetitive in the hospital. 
This comes out from the experiences of physicians, who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of the children's departments of hospitals. 
"Beer or wine is completely from the mode, because it lasts simply too long, to one drunk is." 
"The today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the head physician of the children's department in the centralBohemian hospital Hořovice. 
"Whiskey, if succeeds stealing to the father a bottle from the house bar and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka. 
"Vodka has the advantage that one can mix it with Juice, then smells it not so strongly," explains the head physician. 
The spokeswoman of the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives it quite. 
"Most frequently it concerns Fernet or rum." 
"That is the today's alcohol trend, in particular at primary schools." 
"Isolated it concerned also Slibowitz, which one carries forward, stated from at home" Mrs. Jurinová. 
Head physician according to Pelikán are thirteen or fourteen-year old drunkards in the hospital admission for a long time no nonpareil. 
Before the hospital in Hořovice, on which he works for this year, it was ten years long in the pediatrics department the hospital of the Motol active, where the ambulances delivered tipsy pupils from close and far. 
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times." 
"Your career began it with 12 years, as it the first time with 3,5 parts per thousand alcohol in the blood and still in addition in combination also "ecstasy" was admitted," described the physician a particularly heavy case. 
"Was you in the exhibition sites in Holešovice on any dance party." 
"The interesting with the fact was that it did not seem to its mother strangely at all that their daughter came, is surprised 48 hours not home" the head physician. 
The straight missing interest of parents or their unbelievable tolerance when knocking against with the own offspring is considered as one of the main causes for the increasing alcoholism of children. 
A genuine dependence in the true sense of the word it does not concern to experts according to with children. 
"Under alcoholism a chronic dependence of many years on the alcohol is to be understood including all phenomenon which is connected with it and that is with these children not the case." 
With those, which repeats alcohol enjoys, mostly a negative family-social Background is characteristic," explains head physician Pelikán. 
The spokeswoman of the hospital Motol, Mrs. according to Jurinová, to in the middle of November about forty drunk children were instructed into the local department for child and youth medicine. 
However only the cases with heavy alcoholic poisoning, which made a hospitalization necessary, enter statistics. 
Drunk children, who are home brought if necessary after ambulatory treatment by parents or by the police, are not registered. 
Except the cases, in which children drink up only times so a bottle liquor in the school bench give it in the opinion of Mr. Pelikán three seasonal amplitudes, relying is hundred percent on whom: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end from the school year. 
"The latter for two reasons - either from grief because of the bad certification or from joy on holidays." 
"In the Walpurgisnacht I experienced, stress already seven drunk children at once in the admission" doctor Pelikán. 
A drunk child, who spends the night under medical supervision, is paradoxically better to, than a child, who has to fight on the next day only with an unpleasant tomcat. 
, One can drive the headache out in the morning after, which is due to the Dehydration and to lack of glucose in the hospital with a liquid-donating infusion with glucose and nutrients, which are missing to the organism. 
"You are clearly better to, because after "the wonderful" experience in the evening, they wake up with in a good mood, without something does pain somewhere." 
"You are only something confused over it where they are," grant doctor Pelikán, whereby it spoils the patient every now and then at least thereby the good mood, by enumerating them the costs, which she will cost the treatment. 
Because transport with the ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly on a few tens of thousand crowns. 
"Now and then I as the education means used, if I enumerated directly the children with the round, which cost its drunkenness and that it can quite pass that they must work times whole holidays over, around the money for only one such party to earn," added doctor Pelikán. 
According to its opinion the health insurance companies do not reach however for recourse procedures, around which for the healing of the trunkenen children necessary costs of parents call in.
