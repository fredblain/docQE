Puzzling earthwork 
The atomic energy authority IAEA has new referring to a secret nuclear program in Syria. 
The country resists however to take in addition position - still it permits controls. 
Against midnight of 5th on 6 September 2007 attacks at least four Israeli F-15 I of combat aircraft a mysterious, würfelförmiges building in Syria. 
It stands on the bank the Euphrates\; the next larger city, 30 kilometers remotely, is Dair as-Saur. 
Their name emerges in documents of the international atomic energy authority (IAEA), if it concerns the reactor, which Syria built allegedly with the help of out North Korea in the cuboid, hidden in a valley, which goes off the river. 
According to a briefing of the US-foreign secret service CIA von Ende April 2008 also the reactor common under the name of the close locality el-Kibar would have been well suitable to produce plutonium - from the nuclear weapons to build let themselves. 
For other purposes against it the technology from the 50s is hardly suited. 
The CIA led a video presentation forwards with indistinct satellite photographs. 
By computer animation it faded in, where which components of the reactor before the destruction are to have been, which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the atomic center Yongbyon. 
Besides it submitted, those to photos the building from the proximity to show or the interior. 
The reactor is confessed shortly before start-up, it was said, but equips not yet with fuel rods been. 
Today, more as three years after the bombardment, is hardly more well-known than at that time, yes the mysteries became rather larger with the time. 
The former US president George W. Bush revealed recently in his memoirs the fact that the CIA before the attack was quite safe that Syria in el-Kibar built a reactor but hardly saw reference points for it that there was an active nuclear weapon program" in the country ." 
Some secret service agents in Europe are there rather still more careful and speak only of a "alleged reactor," even if they regard the CIA presentation as "plausible." 
Hard proofs are missing to them, just like the IAEA. 
, As safe he was to have a reactor before itself a high UN-diplomat answered in demand in the summer only lapidary, the IAEA has "enough material, around questions to place." 
The Syrians created and planed the debris of the alleged "unused military building" hasty aside the area thoroughly. 
A IAEA team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium in June 2008, which had been manufactured by humans, found nevertheless. 
Besides the IAEA received satellite photographs of commercial offerers from the time directly after the attack, who might be more meaningful than of the CIA presented over a member state. 
However these photographs on the market are not to be gotten, because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively. 
The IAEA cannot verify from there their authenticity independently. 
Syria has always to have protested, a secret nuclear programme to have never operated or a reactor build. 
The uranium comes from the Israeli weapons, explained Damascus. 
But the IAEA rejected after analysis of the particles as improbable. 
Damascus refuses since then discussing - exactly the same as the satellite photographs. 
Besides it refuses a second inspection in el-Kibar and the entrance to the rubble of the flattened with bombs building to the testers. 
In addition, Israel is silent iron. 
"We will never commentate, affirmed that" recently that at present the attack acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert the official position. 
Thus the investigation of the case drags itself since June 2008 without result and "develops increasingly to a serious reliability problem for the authority," as a high western diplomat at the seat of the IAEA in Vienna grants - finally a heavy offense against the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is located in the area, over which the IAEA is awake. 
As key to progress with the clearing-up the IAEA sees obviously three further facilities, which are to be located "in functional connection" with the presumed reactor - and still exist differently than these. 
The inspectors revealed so far neither, which plants it concerns, still which function it to have or which lets it appear suspicious. 
After information of the newspaper Süddeutsche they are internally called Masyaf and Iskandariayah with the IAEA Marj as-sultan, derived again from close convenient cities. 
Independent institutes for the Science and internationally to Security in Washington (Isis) these places identified and on satellite photographs a building complex with Masyaf made, with which it acts in all probability over one of the suspicious objects. 
It is possibly in or directly beside a military base - exactly with this reason Syria of the IAEA refuses the entrance to the three places. 
In Vienna is called it, the Syrians was afraid one fishing expedition - that the IAEA is sent ahead from the USA, in order to spy military plants. 
Because the nuclear detectives had become attentive by a hint of the U.S. secret services on the facilities. 
The IAEA has references, under the fact satellite photos that between the three places and the cuboid at the Euphrates material and was transported. 
A high western diplomat in Vienna said, at least one of the plants could "in connection with fuel production." 
It does not give however "referring to sensitive activities," thus uranium enrichment or reprocessing\; Processes, which are necessary for the building of nuclear weapons. 
The type of reactor is operated with uranium, which is not enriched. 
But where the uranium should have come and where from it the plutonium for the bomb should be separated later, to these central questions there are if necessary plausible assumptions. 
Unclear it is also whether rubble, which could save valuable traces, to which three places were stored. 
As if the hundreds of truck loads of the ground would have disappeared, want to have nobody information about where the debris remained. 
Only the few kilometers of el-Kibar on the other side the Euphrates convenient salt mine Al-Tibni, which examined Syria 1998 for its suitability than camps for radioactive waste, the IAEA than improbable is valid. 
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had brought it recently in an analysis of satellite photographs for the renowned magazine to Jane's Intelligence review with the reactor in connection. 
Photographs from the orbit show however that Syria at the three suspicious places made earthwork and removed large containers, after the IAEA entrance had required. 
That can be coincidence, however hardly contributed to eliminate the suspicion. 
Besides it is called some months in diplomat circles, the IAEA after used to develop a plan for inspections there which should permit it to Syria, any military secrets to true - alone the expenditure shows, how large the interest of the inspectors is. 
Meanwhile, Damascus ironed also this proposal off. 
Still one year ago had appeased western diplomat in Vienna, who was reactor destroyed, therefore the thing does not have high urgency, for instance US-Ambassador Glyn Davies brings so-called special inspections since a few months in the play, one of the sharpest means, which have the Viennese atomic energy authority, in order to implement controls. 
IAEA boss of Yukiya Amano, which would have to suggest these inspections, has of course from "an option, for which I am open in the future" spoken, still however hesitate he. 
It lies a high risk in this way: On the one hand it needs for it a majority in the board of governors of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented there are everything but eager on an escalation. 
On the other hand, as a diplomat gives to consider: "Which is, if they do not find in the end nothing at all?"
