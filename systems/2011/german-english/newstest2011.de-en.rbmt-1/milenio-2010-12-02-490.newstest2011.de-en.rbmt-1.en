Its short report contains a Cyberlink to a more extensive document, which requests the public to step unterzüglich with its senators in contact since the vote of the law is imminent.

The message was expanded spread, after the 42 republican senators threatened to block all voice for each law except the expansion of the tax reductions from the times of Bush and the financing of the government. 
Such a blockade, which was announced on a letter signed by the 42 republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream act - law and other projects like the ratification of the new starting agreement with Russia against the spreading of nuclear weapons. 
About the blockade of the republicans of the law asked, the presidency spokesman Robert Gibbs, he said Dream act and other projects trusts on the fact that, if the tax topic is solved a schedule for the remaining projects could be set up. 
"I believe, we have still much time..." 
"All we agree in the fact that the tax affair before end of the year must be completed..."

The chairman of the democratic majority in the senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday, "he the vote on conclusion of the debate" would request, so that the Dream act - law, with which the initiative can be co-ordinated for the legalization of undokumentierter students starting from coming Thursday in the senate, although the next week would be more probable. 
The version of the Dream act - law and/or the law of the of American dream became approximately 800,000 young people, who immigrated to the United States, when they were no sixteen years old still, while last five years in this country lived and at a higher educational facility or at the army are written, legalize. 
But the advocates of the law need sixty voices for the adoption of the initiative, why they are dependent on the voices of a handful of republicans. At present the organizations of the advocates of this project organize an intensive influencing control on the adoption of the law. 
The democrats, from whom the majority the Dream support act, have 58 seats. 
However one of them, the senator said Ben Nelson from Nebraska, it against it to be correct and only one republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, its support of the law announced. 
Therefore the defenders of the Dream Acts must get several republicans on their side, if other democrats should decide to turn the initiative the back. 
To at most wooed the republicans belong from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the senator the George Lemieux from Florida, which took over the mandate of the senator Mel Martínez. 
Further republicans, who supported the Dream act in the past, are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained not to support it at another opportunity no more. 
A further republican, who had expressed itself for the law, John McCain, did not specify his attitude so far yet. 
Although the house of representatives has another version, the analysts agree which is located the Dream act in the senate before the largest obstacles.
