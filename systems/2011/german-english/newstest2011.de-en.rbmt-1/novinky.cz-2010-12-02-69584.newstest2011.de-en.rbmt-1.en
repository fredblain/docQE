A longer index finger than ring fingers means a lower risk to get sick with cancer 
Men, whose index finger is longer, as the ring fingers, are obviously exposed to a smaller risk to get sick with prostate gland cancer. 
That is the surprising result of a study, which was published on Wednesday by British the journal OF CAN cerium. 
That is to be connected with the mirror of the male hormone testosterone. 
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve the study, Ros Eeles, professor at Krebsforschungsinstitut at the university in Warwick as simple test for the risk of prostate gland cancer and this in particular with men to sixty," explained the co-author. 
The finger could thus determine help, which men should absolutely undergo to a prostate gland cancer test, above all, if genetic risks or other factors of risk are present, like for example family health loads, Mrs. Eeles added. 
In the period of 1994-2009 she pursued than 1500 patients with prostate gland cancer with her colleagues in Britain more, at the same time in addition, 3000 healthy men. 
With more as half of the participants of the study the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger. 
For these men the same probability of prostate gland cancer, as for 19 percent of those men, was valid whose ring and index finger were equivalent long. 
With men, whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk sank however by 33 percent, with men to sixty by 87 percent. 
The relationship of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which already form at the prenatal age, reflects obviously the different mirrors of sex hormones, the child was exposed to which in the uterus. 
Fewer testosterones corresponds to a longer index finger. 
Earlier research showed that the straight testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate gland cancer. 
Václav Pačes, prominent Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK, him this study was volatilely well-known, yet regard it the relationship between the finger length and the cancer risk so far not as "completely proven."
