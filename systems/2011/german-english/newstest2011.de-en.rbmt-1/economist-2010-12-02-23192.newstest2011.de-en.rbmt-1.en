The demokatrische routine 
The democracy movement in Latin America becomes more strongly, as the support of private enterprises. 
Crime is a larger problem than unemployment. 
In many parts of the region the influence of Brazil is larger than that of the United States. 
To these results came the Latinobarómetro survey, which was accomplished in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist. 
This survey is accomplished since 1995 regularly and points so the opinion change out in this region. 
Two facts particularly fall in the survey of this year from September and October into the eye. 
First of all the good tendency in Latin America 
and secondly the increasing interest in democracy and their most important institutions. 
In numerous countries at the South American Pacific coast the democratic movement increased strongly (S. table 1). 
In Peru, where the economy grows annually since 2002 by approx. 6%, the number of the democracy proponents of 40% e.g. rose in the year 2005 to 61% in this year. 
Also in Mexico, where the economy recovers since the strong break-down in the last year again, such a trend is to be recognized. 
But only half of the asked ones in Mexico and Brazil, which is most densely populated countries of the region, convinced democrats, what lowers the regional average (S. chart 2). 
Approx. 44% of the asked ones explained that it with the democratic practice of their country contently its. Those are so many as in the last year, however 25% more than in the year 2001 (chart 3). 
About 34% trust the congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of the last year, show however a clear rise opposite 2003 (17% and/or 24%). 
One decade ago of Latin America undermined economic crises the efforts around more democracy. 
This also during the world economic crisis persisted, is possibly because of the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a short recession phase and fast again recovered. 
Beyond that the arms by a stronger social net were caught. 
(Sound reports of the UN-economic commission for Latin America of this week rose 2009 the poverty rate in Latin America only slightly and is in this year 32% pleases.) 
But from country to country there are strong tendency differences (S. chart 4). 
Of Brazil strong economy and the popularity of separating president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reflects itself in a common progress thinking. 
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more strongly noticeable and increased force crime, this is less the case. 
Only for the second time since beginning of survey many asked ones see a larger problem than in Latin America in the crime in their country unemployment (S. chart 5). 
Approx. 31% state that either they or a family member became in the last year victims of a crime. But opposite 38% in the last year sank the values and achieve thus the lowest conditions since 1995. 
The rising economic performance reflects itself in the stronger support of the private and of the free-market economy: approx. 71% of the asked ones supraregional indicated that the private sector for the development is indispensable, in the year 2007 were it 56% (S. chart 6). 
Approx. 58% explained that only the free-market economy can bring progress to its country, compared to 47% in the last year. 
Interestingly enough 62% of the asked ones maintained this opinion in Venezuela (and 80% are for a private sector), although her left president, nationalisation Hugo Chávez, many private business. 
Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed from the United States (9%, according to 19% of the asked ones (18% in the last year) invariably since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% in the last year). 
The asked ones in Mexico and most countries of Central America however see the most influential country in the USA, whereby this role is transferred to the Dominican republic and Nicaragua von Venezuela.
