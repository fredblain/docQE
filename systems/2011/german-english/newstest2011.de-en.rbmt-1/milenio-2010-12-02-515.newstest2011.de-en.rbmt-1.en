Put the finger into the wound with literature 
The second round of "the desire at the language" was a walk, with which the participants made themselves strong for the narration 
"With the sex in the language I understand yes, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected by me? ," the authoress Luisa Valenzuela, which should open the second round of "lot placeres de la lengua," asked a cycle, that the Spanish-speeking literature celebrated and on this occasion the sub-title of her question used (on another meeting table the sex was dedicated to the round in the language, explained it). 
The finger in the wound... "in difficulties," spat the Argentine brings to us Schriftstellein sweetly against the audience, which consisted mainly of young people, who met on the international book fair in Guadalajara (FIL), in order to attend this by Marisol Shultz moderated rounds table, at whom Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated. 
Luisa Valenzuela read out a text, which she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and which Shultz marked thereafter as a great narration. Luisa told in first person and is the protagonist, on the search is to be experienced, what a "wound" is, and from physician to physician goes, from which it receives no answer, but notes for the manual of her narration. 
It leaves the Infektologen convinced: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps is yes my wound." 
In the end, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who robbed it in the middle on the course the breath, and who it however explained that wound a scientific term is not, enthült the psychoanalyst the secret: "the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar." 
The main figure of the narration sighs relieved and closes, which only received it "from the wound the fact that this was really open and does not exist." But it is convinced that the desire at the language and their traps mix themselves. 
Valenzuela, the authoress, played with both. 
The Nicaraguaner Sergio Ramírez presented also delighting a narration, which it called "praise of the invention," and in that the finger in the wound is not mentioned but is not discovered. 
With allusions to magic realism it tells of a famous magician, who returned the clouds affected, far traveled men or re-established the virtue lost by a girl. The narration made an about-face and reported of America, for the large novel, to which it was not missing from the outset at its own chroniclers, and it quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, which criticizes the abundance of stories told by the Eroberen. 
"Cervantes, which invited us all (the writers), scoffed the pretended witnesses, who emerged in as truely explained stories, but on other way the story America would have been never tell - with imagination, that even the shame was misplaced." 
However he emphasizes, "is it the crazy people and liars, who imagine the things best," and there approaches reality and lie, where one does not know no more, to which side the narration it belongs each other on, where the fictitious literature reaches the summit. 
It actually calls that the "tradition Cervantes." 
"Of him we inherited to be which is told." 
When Mayra Montero at the row was, and praised the authoress commentated the variety of the interpretations, to which the invitation of the FIl had contributed to rounding table "the finger in the wound." 
The Cuban woman and Puertorikanerin dedicated its contribution to the large wound of the social force, those their country strikes - like completely Latin America - as result of the fights for the drug trade. 
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, explained good songs a tacit, deliberately not planned commitment contained," it, after it had emphasized the fact that literature is communication and commitment which between the author and the readers as with a "chemical reaction" develops itself. 
The Spanish poet Luis García Montero, its contribution decided the evening likewise "this finger of the engaged writer in the wound of the writer" hevorhob. 
He noticed that in a fast moving world also the intellectual habits and control of consciousness run out on dogmatism, and is forgotten, "that behind each confirmation a small no stands and behind each denial a small yes." 
"Over in the possession our thought and the reality to be, we must give subtle nuances: And giving subtle nuances means frequently to put the finger into the wound and trouble those, which feel much better, if they think in the form of caricatures, in black and Weis, in prefabricated ideas without nuances for troubling and also the powerful ones which prefer it, the world in black and Weis it noticed dividing and loaded in addition the sense of the letter to rediscover.
