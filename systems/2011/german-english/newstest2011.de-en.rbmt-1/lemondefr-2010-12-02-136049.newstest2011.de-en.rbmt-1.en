Affair Clotilde tear: the Elysée palace exaggerates its intermediary function for Syria 
Within more than six months, of July 2009 until May 2010, the fate of Clotilde thought tears, the French public in breath to a young French researcher, who was held in Iran because of "espionage," shifted the diplomacy in alert stand-by and accented the degradation of the relations between Paris and Tehran. 
All of this under attentive views of the diplomats of the United States. 
From WikiLeaks received and from the newspaper "Le Monde" the examined American documents give some background to this crisis price. 
They describe, how the Elysée had explained to the Americans its strategy, who went so far giving this pieces of advice to handling their own crisis of "takings of hostages" in Iran (a small group of ramblers). 
They point out, like the French responsible persons tried to convince Washington of the fact that the freeing of the young Frenchwoman does not have the release of Majid Kakavand, in France an imprisoned held and of the American law due to trade with material Iranian looked for in favor of the Iranian nuclear program to the Gegeleistung. 
Finally they set the way, with which the French presidency tried to manipulate the media for the purpose to make for these the idea convincing the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad have a central role with the freeing from Clotilde tear played, into a sharp light. 
In truth he had done nothing in this regard. 
On 12 August 2009 into of Paris drawn up diplomat telegram "Iran carries the title: French comments on the way of handling takings of hostages." 
François Richier, Elysée adviser in strategy questions, conversed accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the middle Orient with the American diplomat of the Kathleen Allegrone. 
They explained the French method to her. 
Those guessed/advised the Americans to set everything in order to reconduct their own citizens, who were held by force in Iran. 
"Power noise," they said, "articulated loud and clearly and without omit" the words of "basic human rights," "innocence," "immediate release" in the media. 
This is necessary, in order to bring the Iranian regime in embarrassment, which pays attention very sensitively to its image. 
"This does not operate, particularly since the Iranians ask you, all the more to do." 
Because "silence does not solve anything," past the discussion attempts over on inconspicuous way, the Iranians is "masters in evasive maneuvers." 
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "common, Iranian tactics": "Taking of hostages for the purpose of political extortion." 
He announces, the release of Clotilde tears from the prison (on 16 August to come, on the day, at that it should into the French message takes refuge) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230.000 euros bail). 
And it lets the Elysée announce, anticipates further takings of hostages, a phenomenon, which will be intensified "." 
The Iranians could arrest "in the near future another that approximately 1.800 French citizens, who live in Iran," then he said. 
28. August 2009. 
Clotilde tear is twelve days ago from the prison dismisses, however further in Iran one holds. 
Information was in circulation brought: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the united states demand due to illegal trade with sensitive electronics material to Iran, is after decision of a judge in Paris from the detention dismisses. 
The American message places itself, like numerous other observers, questions over this disturbing coincidence. 
For Washington, which pursues the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of for the nuclear program planned material, the release of Majid Khakavand represents a bad news. 
Did France accept a horse trade? 
The freeing of the Iranian against that the Frenchwoman? 
On the occasion of a renewed conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September insures François Richier that this is not the case. 
The Elysée, then he says, was not only "completely surprised from the resolution of the judge," but also tried to revolt itself against it. 
"It gave to move exchange between the French presidency and the French Minister of Justice to one" (at present Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot the judicial decision not change," explains it. 
Mr. Richier would like to also point out that Majid Kakavand stands further under "more strictly" supervision of the French secret service. 
The Elysée adviser selects a telephone number, puts, informed then the American diplomat, the Iranian "would be at present in the buildings led by the Iranian message in Paris." 
During the safekeeping of Clotilde do not tear in Iran preserves the Elysée his efforts, by means of announcements and from the media more organized "escape attempts" believe to make, the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influential intermediary role." 
The Americans observe this activity not without irony and state that the manipulation carries fruits, since several press articles reflect the official French version. 
From 25 August 2009 dating telegram causes "medium lightning of the French authorities." 
On which so much is based, asks themselves "thank testifying" opposite Mr. Assad those Paris message. 
"The French authorities admit defiance of its explanations full praise price secretly that they have only a vague notion of it, which the Syrier actually did." 
The document is concerned then with the reasons, which brought the Elysée to it, this fiction to purge. 
The intensive communication efforts "aims off Sarkozys politics of the opening opposite Syria to confirm," analyzes it. 
A 2008 launched politics, which come prematurely at that time "from numerous critic voices in France as well as abroad as and undeservedly one noticed." 
"The Syrian role blowing up" tries to lead of Paris "Syria before eyes, which commendation one can obtain, by playing a constructional role in the region." 
A goal is it in addition to sow "discord between Syria and Iran." 
The American message knows this on good authority. 
On 11 August François Richier had entrusted it: "naturally we do not know whether the Syrier whatever made." 
"However we thanked you despite everything them." 
"This should donate at least confusion with the Iranians." 
Clotilde tear turns to 16. May 2010 to France back. 
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Elysée. 
In a Kommuniqué it thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the release our compatriot."
