Since Hampton was recently still in Ensigns choice team, was it was allowed he one year long no lobbying for its former employer or the entire senate to take over. 
According to statement of ethics experts the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, which were closely friendly before the affair, offended against the so-called prohibition of the revolving door Lobbykratie. 
In accordance with the published indications "it acts to all appearances around an arrangement and around the offense against the revolving door statutes," so Stanley fire, Washington a lawyer, who specialized in the defense of clients, in the visor of the government. 
While the Ministry of Justice rejected it officially, admits the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case to give, Mr said. Very carefully the accusation seems to let fire and other ethics lawyers, the Ministry fall against the former senator Ted of Stevens because of failure on the part of the public prosecutor in taking up political accusations after a variety of defeats, which were pursued by the media with large interest, including the decision last year. 
Public prosecutors "are obviously frightful," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the combination "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization, a whose goal is the fight against corruption in parliament and government circles of the USA), a group of attorneys, the different accusations against Mr. Ensign before court brought. 
"That means in principle that high-standing government officials can assume now the laws are not valid, added for it" them. 
Paul Coggins, Hauptverteidiger von Mr. Ensign, said in an interview, he had received a telephone call of a public prosecutor on Monday and a further on the next day, in which it was communicated to him that the Ministry will not raise complaints against its client. 
Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with the public prosecutors, in order to convince it of the fact that the senator, as its office in an explanation repeated again on Wednesday had "in agreement acted with the law." 
Mr. Coggins rejected it, the legal arguments, which he had stated opposite the public prosecutors to explain more exactly. 
"Me not probably is about to go into the discussion details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much is said: We believe the correct decision to have met," said it. 
Last month the federal electoral committee decided to stop the investigations because of a separate complaint by the ethics group after the one payment of $96,000 of Mr. Ensigns parents to the Hamptons offended against the Federal electoral law. 
The electoral committee said, it had not given enough proofs that the money was something else as a gift. 
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, who supported long time the senator, was one of the companies, in those Mr. Hampton owing to the assistance of Mr. Ensign lobbyist work found. 
An email from December 2008 proves that, after the company Mr. Hampton as lobbyist helped, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a conversation with Mr. Hampton had, in which he communicated to him that he at the ministry of the Interior because of a thing "knock." 
Mr. In addition Ensign was with Mr. The transport minister, a meeting in the name of the airline arranges and asked Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant air, to the lunch to agree upon, after this Mr. Hampton for lobbying had adjusted. 
When last year for the first time information about this affair penetrated to the public, apologize Mr. Ensign with its voters and gave its position up in the senate, where he had confessed in the order of rank of the republicans in fourth place. 
After it had been noticeable many months no longer, Mr told. Ensign two weeks ago reporters, which it a third term of office in the senate aim at. 
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign any longer longer the goal of police investigations its, did not explain its press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, the senator hopes that the ethics commission follows very fast the example of the Ministry of Justice and stops its investigations. 
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continue its hard work in the service of humans in Nevada," said her.
