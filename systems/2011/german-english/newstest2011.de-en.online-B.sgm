<seg id="1"> What to do, the CSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "pastry." </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new councilors of the capital from the ranks of the CSSD will have to overcome some obvious language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague City Council and in the representation at all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The newspaper has Aktuálně.cz members of the new Council from the ČSSD even a little "knocked off" as they master the notorious slang that has become standard in recent years that the current coalition partners in Prague were at the helm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The coded vocabulary that was introduced in the bygone era of Mayor Pavel Bém of the Prague political elite, some of the most famous actors, situations and Causae borrowed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Surprisingly it was found that the new councils fall in relation to these new terms somewhat in the dark. </seg>
<seg id="6"> They say at least. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Who's Voldemort?" </seg>
<seg id="8"> "No idea." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "I'm more of a newcomer to Prague's politics," responded Lukáš Kaucký, the new councilor for culture, to test the "godfather of vocabulary." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But the councilman Karel Březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar manner. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example, the term "golf hole." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "This is the only expression of those that you present to me here, I occasionally use." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Otherwise, I do not think much of slang." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> From the vocabulary that had published the daily paper Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the election congress of the ODS, the editors picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously associated with the Prague City Council. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Social Democrats should "go to the pastry shop, the terms" Voldemort ,"" Prague's largest golf hole, ,"" buffalo hump ,"" paneling "" betrayal of the capital "and define. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Three Prague councilmen agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - but promised his first participation in the conversation, but not even then took up the receiver. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The fifth councilor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test in advance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "These things I do not care and how the Civic Democrats together to talk, I do not judge it." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "For me it is important how we see ourselves as part of our programs," he countered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký in the above headline would have allegedly failed to recognize that the speech by the influential businessman and friend of the ex-Mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The term "Voldemort" Kaucký says absolutely nothing and the only term he guessed correctly when tested, was "the country's largest golf hole." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, added security, but added: "But I know more from the newspaper." </seg>
<seg id="23"> And jokingly, "I'll have to take a language course." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The "golf hole" is then deciphered not only from Matador Karel Březina, but also by the councilor for environmental issues as Tunnel Blanka Lukáš Plachý correctly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Both Social Democrats also know for whom the term is Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý suspects even where this figure is related to and therefore also what it means to "go into the pastry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "I think it's like to go in any Prague restaurant business," Plachý is pretty close to the riddle, if you know that this is the seat of Janoušek companies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Consistent with Březina he asserts, however, to have derived this knowledge from the newspaper rather than to him this vocabulary would own. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Judging from the test participants after, it appears under the Socialists actually do give similar naturalized slang. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I asked my colleagues, but obviously there is something we really do not." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "We call us by name, from time to time we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of the CSSD Prague Petr Hulinsky - from his party comrades shot "Hulda" called. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "In school I Bříza (birch) was called, but I do not know if my colleagues call me that," tells us Karel Březina his nickname. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The newspaper has tried Deník Aktuálně.cz the name and lo and behold - it works. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Councilman Weinert is for the party comrades kind of "grandfather" or less friendly to the "old," the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention before the elections by machinations of the party sponsorship to the will of some colleagues, "Igráček" (famous Czech Lego figure) called. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Nicknames are the only allow the Social Democrats in the intra-party usage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Hulinsky like it allegedly did not when he is "Hulda" calls, but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered yet another nickname of Prague's chairman. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> His nickname is "Doctor of truncheon-rights" has nothing to brag that Petr Hulinsky received his Juris Doctor from the title Bratislava police academy. </seg>

<seg id="1"> A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudi </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The roof seems like the back of a prehistoric lizard that staircase as the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are gaping fish mouths. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This is the Casa Batlló by the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Of the local residents got the house, with its organic forms the nickname "bone house." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile and mosaic fragments that are reminiscent to shed facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these features typical for the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The facade of the house plays with beautiful lines, gentle colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Only on closer inspection one notices that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm, and thoughtful order. </seg>
<seg id="8"> At night, the whole facade is still vivid, dramatic and special being illuminated increases the brightness of the colors yet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The same sweeping lines and intricate shapes dominate the interior of the house. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wave-shaped timber copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements from doors, peep holes and even bars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The House Batlló in the Eixample district of the busy shopping street Passeig de Gracia No 43 was rebuilt from a house built in 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese pointed out. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reconstruction took two years and completed in 1906. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The investor, a wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of an entirely new building, but eventually he agreed to the idea of ​​Gaudí on an unusual and cheaper construction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The apartment building Casa Batllo Antoni Gaudi designed not alone, however. </seg>
<seg id="15"> He worked together with the architect Josep Maria Jujol. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Especially on the drawing board, the decorations were for the representative of the apartment property owner and also the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In the design of the facade but also worked with several other sculptors and artists. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The joint work on the design of the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Thus Jujol also involved in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Mila in Park Güell, in which there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Shortly after its completion, the house was given by the local population of its organic forms because of the nickname "bone house." </seg>
<seg id="21"> Others called it the special window opening mechanism due to the "yawning house." </seg>
<seg id="22"> It also says at the top of the building is the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia presented. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But even more sculptural elements symbolize hidden religious motives. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Gaudí designed for the house of a unique for its time central heating system with venting channels and traditional fireplaces. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Somewhat bizarrely seems its 45-degree tilt on already. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> In his work consistently ignored Gaudí all that time building and was not swayed by them. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before construction starts, although he took from the city of the appropriate planning permission but the information given by him about the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers and two years later at the completion of the results were so horrified that they required help. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The senators met with, among other things, the fact that the construction interfered with its pillars, even in the public sidewalk. </seg>
<seg id="29"> came to change it but no longer quite the opposite - only fifteen days after the relevant request of the district presented Josep Batlló a request for approval to the hiring of the two highest floors of the house - and it was granted to him promptly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The house owner himself moved into the lower floors. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In the gallery on the 2nd Stock was a social room, third floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The entire six-story building by running up a flight of stairs up to the roof terrace. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Due to the fundamental elements of the renovation all right angles and straight lines were eliminated and replaced by bent and curved walls. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for interconnecting rooms. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The social part can be explained by the opening of the saloon doors combine completely and so a bigger company could chat easily without losing confidential conversations to have a certain intimacy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The house was given by Gaudí's conversion except for a new facade, a very unusual roof and two floors. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It is also impressive Gaudí's play of light and the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is covered and the atria. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The interplay of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum of light. </seg>
<seg id="40"> He simply set out the principle advantage that white reflects the light better than darker colors, which absorb the sunlight on the contrary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> The house Casa Batllo, which was launched in 2005 in the World Heritage list of UNESCO can now visit everyone. </seg>
<seg id="42"> On the first floor the spacious and attractive accommodation is made available to the public. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The owners decided only in the year to take this step and this on the occasion of the famous 150.Geburtstags Creator. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="1"> The right mattress and bed frame right? Women have different needs than men </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Not the most fantastic bed frame, but the quality of the bed - that mattress and rust make good bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> These should complement each other harmoniously, however, to meet the needs of specific user needs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In choosing to play a role in many things - the weight, size, health, and not least the gender of the sleeper. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Equally important is also the interior, which have mattress and rust subordinate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> A typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a weekend home, is not in the heated periodically, latex mattresses are not suitable, because they take a lot longer to "warm up." </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition, they are much heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And - they should be turned regularly. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If they have that is not enough Entlüftungskanälchen in the core and yet to lie on a hard drive, backs up to moisture: it is not impossible that forms beneath her horse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the selection also plays a role in what one is accustomed. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Who was extended overseas, where very high standard mattresses with soft layer is difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "Probably all of hockey players who have returned from the NHL, have complained to me that here they can not sleep properly." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "For their off Shun those shoulders, heels and hips, they need a soft layer of Visco foam (memory foam - a shape-memory polymer)." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "This, I recommend including diabetic people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so they" can receive from the joints and skin bad "information, said Sylva Hadamcziková, which specializes in upholstered furniture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Therefore, I have worried some years ago many hockey players, but also other customers, this mattress with visco-foam (memory foam). </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Today this is no longer a problem, because such services include the mattress manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech producer of Tropico." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And you have to be a famous hockey player is not necessarily to appreciate the benefits of visco foam. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" actually works quite simply. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The foam optimizes its hardness and shape corresponding to the heat absorbed, in other words, he literally hugs the body to warm. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Nowhere is suppressed, the night rolls around you do not like after a heavy battle. </seg>
<seg id="22"> We sleep so much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against pressure ulcers (gangrene). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> When choosing a mattress size to body size you should still expect the length of the soles added, that about 21 to 34 cm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Man and woman who are in need, the 180 cm tall, so a 210 to 220 cm long bed. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Each of the risers should be at least 90 cm flat width available, this makes 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> For single beds, for example, singles, 120 are attached to 140 cm. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Sake of comfort and also to any visitors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise, the following rule of thumb for the ideal Bed Width: "If you lie on your back should be enough room for the slightly bent arms," ​​advises Ing Helena Prokopová, the guild master of upholsterers and interior decorators, who for years the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture dedicated and maintains this topic at schools. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> With a double bed each with a distinct rust and needs its own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are also equal. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise there is no alternative when the grates to be installed in different heights and that's not possible with any bed frame. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, with spring mattresses skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should account for the shape layer and fine upholstery. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "With the hand or when you sit down you can feel the springs in any case," warns Helen Prokopová. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Each mattress takes a special type of grid is required. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Soft beds with mattress and all-surface as grown together Siamzwillinge have to look for anything in the bedroom. </seg>
<seg id="36"> These mattresses can not lift the cover and can not wash it, what today is already common practice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And since in a single night from 0.2 to 0.75 l loses sweat, it is clear that the mattress slowly after five to seven years to a huge (and clogged strainer) is. </seg>
<seg id="38"> And because of lean experts from advertising slogans, the promise of mattress to last up to 25 years and even lifetime warranty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Each thing has its ifs and buts. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And therefore a practical advice from dealers: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, one should not shy away from the hygiene of the washable, removable cover, but it is advisable to use a mattress cover that can be easily washed and remove. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Although today are usually made mattress covers with full zipper, so you get after opening two halves (extremely important for washing and the washing machine size!), The manipulation seems larger mattresses, especially single run, much as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath on. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> If they are in bed instead of a grating of a fixed disk? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Out with it! </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or at most for a bed for guests and unloved for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Even so, they should prefer the plate provided with ventilation holes (if not already have it) and use spring mattresses with skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket springs and fine upholstery. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethane mattresses are not on such a surface. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For non-adjustable frames with 14 to 18 slats (slats) are latex or sandwich mattresses suitable (and possibly combinations of latex and coconut), always pay it grates with a large latte number of words of 28 or more spring strips, with lumbar support in the lumbar region and the ability to regulate the bar hardness. </seg>
<seg id="48"> On adjustable louvre gratings are no mattresses with spring frame, since they do not respond to the ergonomic adjustment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> In addition to setting the stiffness of the spring bars, special modules are offered flexible shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="50"> This involves a special attachment of the slats, making it possible to press the slats or even verwinkeln so as to enable the selective depression of the shoulder of the sleeper. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use in "Mr. Mattress" soft zones for the shoulder area. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Also to the ladies is intended - to begrudge them this soft zones in the hip. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For the most demanding customer point-elastic spring wing systems (Lattoflex) or grids with point elastic contact pads are designed with so-called Multitorsionsfederung. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure is distributed on several points, thereby reducing the tension. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But - if you use the right mattress and right grate a bad (too big and voluminous) pillows, most benefits are lost. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Again, a rule of thumb: the pillow is to support the head, its tip should only reach to the shoulders so the shoulder muscles to relax. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Ideal is therefore a 50 x 60 cm large cushion, as it may, for example, the Scandinavians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In the side position the pillow should be offset (along with the shoulder relief zone in the grate or the soft zone in the mattress) to shoulder height. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Something our modern mattresses have but with the former (filled with hay), straw bags in common. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern manufacturers increasingly use natural materials, or at least their admixtures. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Even with mattresses is the new magic word "organic." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of petroleum raw materials used for the preparation of polyurethane foams are increasingly naturelle oils - such as castor oil and soybean oil. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soy is well used by all major manufacturers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> "Bio is for mattresses, which are its core materials from purely natural origin," Petr Vašíček Tropico Plus from the company explained. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Natural products are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers - one of the first it was Aloe Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> You can treat yourself but also micro-capsules, spread the sleeping forest or fresh lavender scent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Here, too, do you make a difference between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While used in the men a "cooling" plant extract of birch leaves to absorb the mattress cover, the heat and cool the body, can have the references to women, "warming" effect. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Extracts from red peppers stimulate blood circulation, it's the weaker sex is so nice and warm while sleeping. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> And today's favorites? </seg>
<seg id="72"> Foam mattresses (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than conventional polyurethane and also much more flexible). </seg>
<seg id="73"> The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foam and visco-foam mattresses formed multi-zone, who know exactly where to head, hips and heels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> For a high quality mattress but you have to fork out more and 7000 crowns. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Health mattresses but are usually burdened with lower VAT, as they apply for medical aid. </seg>
<seg id="76"> The first Czech company was Gumotex this advantage given. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> You see, to save on the mattress and the rust is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Sometimes there are special offers from manufacturers and merchants who offer two mattresses for the price of one. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Thus offers the brand Magniflex Duofreeze the mattress with quilted during the Visco Memory Foam for 11,990 CZK to. </seg>
<seg id="80"> The second you get for free. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the Tempur material, which ushered in the era of the viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density in almost cosmic speed. </seg>
<seg id="82"> No wonder, they were still developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to the enormous startup overloads. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83"> Tempur softens with heat and in cool environment, it solidifies again. </seg>
<seg id="84"> It adapts to the body perfectly and distributed in an optimal way the body pressure. </seg>
<seg id="85"> It is not only ideal for preventing bedsores, but generally increased the sleeping comfort. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86"> Viscoelastic foams are not only in mattresses, but also in other health products such as with special foot rests used, the legs and the vessels are designed to provide relief. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Domestic manufacturers use as the foams Eucatherm C, Twin Saver or similar products. </seg>

<seg id="8"> "I admit that there may in some cases to abuse of such devices, such as when someone puts it in his pocket, he knows that without it, but we have had no such case reported." </seg>

<seg id="1"> The army has so many fuses that you wrap the whole Czech Republic but you could keep only two years </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers fuses are ignited with explosive devices. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The year before, the Defense Department already 224 km fuse had delivered to the army camp. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is to know reassuring that the military has safe hands for 225 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The only problem is the durability of the fuses - two and a maximum of four years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Army bought the fuses of the corporation STV Group, as for a paltry 40 million kroner. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In its reasoning for the purchase of this huge amount of general staff said fuse MF DNES, the soldiers would consume annually to the 60 kilometers fuse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to research by the Armeepyrotechnikern, the MF DNES spoke out, it is clear from this statement that the army would have to annually complete a very intense pyrotechnic training - of all the generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaning ladies. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Only in this way the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers fuses could reasonably justify. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This length corresponds to other 25,000 detonations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Even so, this army would be enough stock for more than ten years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But if there is the old rule by experts that are sufficient to train any new professional soldiers six feet fuse completely, then the army has carried these new acquisitions - has a calming stock for which - even in the light of the increased needs of the pioneer and specialist units mentioned 225 years created. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> It complained of the rapid reaction brigade soldiers recently at Defense Minister Vondra, they had almost no ammunition for small arms more so target practice the lack of resources are limited due to strong. </seg>
<seg id="15"> That of the trouser to mention. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "I will also not know why they buy from us such vast amounts fuses." </seg>
<seg id="17"> But this is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need. " </seg>
<seg id="18"> "For us, the army a good customer, we want to come largely as a seller should," says the sales manager of STV Group January Decky. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Pejšek January, the Defense Ministry spokesman justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometers fuse so that the army would have just become a cover for at least ten years with this "ammunition." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> January Decky of the STV Group, however, speaks only of a four-year life of the fuses and police and army pyrotechnician even just two years. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "With perfect storage are probably the four mentioned years possible," admits one of them that wants to remain anonymous, to avoid being a soldier accused of criticism of the army. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the expiry of the period of use any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and endangering the lives of soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="23"> These tests are not free, but cost more money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Another argument of the Defence of the quantity discount for the 445 km fuse. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "They cost us sixty percent less than last year's supply of 244 kilometers," spokesman tells us Pejšek the position of the buyers of Defense. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Just for comparison: liquidate The annual consumption of fuses of pyrotechnics to the police, the ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet army, brother, for some years barely exceeds 1,500 meters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> And the police ordered only such amounts of ammunition they can use before the end of its life. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Even the safety of pyrotechnics because, well, keep to themselves as open to the possibility of purchases of more modern flexible and thus more reliable fuses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The Defense Department already has huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, as the two hundred thousand-strong Czechoslovak People's Army in its campaign to the Rhine prepared. </seg>
<seg id="30"> According to the pyrotechnicians, the MF DNES spoke to the Czech armed forces expected in a few years ago the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of miles of old fuses, it has today purchased "cheap." </seg>

<seg id="8"> And when offered the government his father Karel Zdarsky as compensation for the seized by the Communists owned a small workshop to rent, he did not hesitate long, his career was in the company where he worked until then whiz, and started with a few friends of his father's own company to produce plastic tubs. </seg>

<seg id="7"> The Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are now looking to the Internet home in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman said while other countries and companies for a boycott of Wikileaks. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Wikileaks and founder Julian Assange that appears on the wanted list of Interpol is to stay after a newspaper report in the UK. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> "Wikileaks displaced from Amazon servers." </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Free speech in the land of the free," shared the investigative activists via short message service Twitter on Wednesday (local time) with. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Shortly before the internet company Amazon the Wikileaks documents had been banished from its servers. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The Internet activists had in publishing the secret diplomatic telegrams on the Amazon Web Service (AWS) are used to cope with the high traffic to the documents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Twitter explained by Wikileaks continues to step: "Prima - our dollars are now spent to deal with people in Europe." </seg>
<seg id="15"> When Amazon had this problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Amazon have stopped the use of its servers by Wikileaks, after staff of Senator Joe Lieberman had made inquiries, the CNN reported, citing Lieberman's office. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security had threatened a boycott of Amazon, told the British Guardian. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Where does all the ice? </seg>
<seg id="5"> From Gelatiere and the Gelataio. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The Gelatiere on some old-fashioned German of the ice cream maker is to apply the cream to her all the rules of Italian Eismacherkunst. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Gelataio collected with a spatula the ice from the refrigerated counter, she sweeps into the wafer and then sells them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> To know this, you must not drive after Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But who still want to know more about ice, can not pass on the "Gelato-University of the Italian company Carpigiani. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The University has set up ice, the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003, so the ice cream from its machines throughout the high Italian best values. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest feed and visitors from around the world. </seg>
<seg id="12"> There are also multi-day special courses and internships around the chocolate ice cream in our own ice cream parlor. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Some people dream in the mid-life crisis of a new career, others just venture onto ice smooth their vague yearnings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary and Saudi Arabia. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow Food movement and will in the land of industrial ice-cream offer in the future, a European quality product. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Anke from Berlin is a consultant and wants after years in a nerve-wracking job something of my own bagging. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of their ice cream bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia's because children love their Italian ice cream. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Maestro Luciano Ferrari Gelatiere explained to the participants, first the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The point is not only good taste but also the silky smoothness and good consistency. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Luciano forgets his training but not the icing on the national and even southern superstructure 'Italian Gelato is simply the best - and still is a lot of romance here. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first step in the production seems very simple. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Luciano tilts the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer, which is heated with an electronic program all at 85 degrees and then immediately cooled to four degrees. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Then he turns on the machine to a faucet and out comes a white base pasteurized cream, foundation for all Milcheissorten. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Is immediately assailed the instructor with questions: Is it possible to produce ice cream with only natural ingredients without a stabilizer? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How to give your own desire to experiment free reign? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Luciano warned to be led astray by the spirit of the times. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Those of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" speech, perhaps using them anyway stabilizers - usually a product of nature, such as guar gum from the guar bean. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, but it must be sold within a day, or it collapses into itself, and the customer bites loud ice granules. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Some variations of the matrix are allowed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> More exciting is it with the flavors. </seg>
<seg id="32"> For the taste in ice Maestro Luciano distinguish between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit department or at the sweets of the supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, there are powders and pastes. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "The suppliers are all trying to palm you dozens of flavored additives." </seg>
<seg id="35"> "But you should just experiment times." </seg>
<seg id="36"> Either in fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Or even at the ice cream out of the white matrix, which is yellow to cream with eggs and cocoa powder as the basis for all kinds of chocolate temptations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Now, students will be distributed to the ice machines. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano, they can produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base, with more or less vanilla or other natural supplements. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The same experiment can be subjected to the fruit ice. </seg>
<seg id="41"> More flavor, more fruit puree - the taste is not necessarily better. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Hazelnut ice cream does not taste absolutely nutty if it contains more hazelnuts. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The popular Kiwi ice cream makes the working group that uses more fruit, less water and less stabilizer. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Only a balanced mix lift the taste of Gelato out properly, "says Luciano. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Ice cream is a question: peach puree is used with lots of sugar, the sugar content are reduced in the basic recipe. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Lemon ice for an extra helping of sugar is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano pulls out a device with which it determines the sugar content of fruits (wine measure so that Oechsle in grape must). </seg>
<seg id="48"> Fortunately tables facilitate the computation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> to make ice cream does not require as much physical effort as before. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Not only the device for automatic preparation of the matrix helps. </seg>
<seg id="51"> There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture struck simultaneously creamy and cooled to minus temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Despite all the automation stay small margins is not enough. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The Brazilian Gustavo blotted himself and his course colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree, as he gets the oversized blender out of control. </seg>
<seg id="54"> "In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens." </seg>

<seg id="21"> The 44-year-old is with stones. </seg>
<seg id="22"> He bought all that were incurred during the demolition in Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "It would be a shame, they would ground into gravel or disappear in the landfill," he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen, which was once a guard house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Insulted and threatened to have him, he says, than in September was in the newspapers that he the remains of the north wing was bought by the demolition contractor. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But he has talked with the S-21 opponents, for days. </seg>
<seg id="26"> And he has told them that he could do nothing now but for the demolition. </seg>
<seg id="27"> And what if it happened once, it was still the most sensible, if the stones were reused. </seg>
<seg id="28"> About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of an average of 80-pound blocks with, unit price from 6.50 to 14 €. </seg>
<seg id="29"> As a souvenir, but some also in the hope of being able to return it for a reconstruction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 large truckloads. </seg>
<seg id="31"> About half stored in the forest, the rest is long since sold. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Gardeners, landscapers, homeowners. </seg>
<seg id="33"> From everywhere they came and were dragged off, which could carry luggage and trailers. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The Stuttgart stumbling blocks have long since turned into "Mäuerle" or limitations of herb beds. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="57"> Rich he did not become filthy rich even less. </seg>
<seg id="58"> But 14 people of the stone traders employed today, have also settled in the forest at the top of stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a horticulturalist. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In the contest for the best and brightest, many companies now go into the melee and place, such as VW, on cooperation with the universities. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Your mission: the most talented graduates as early as possible to recruit in the lecture halls before entering the labor market and are courted by others. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And because universities do not release the records of the achievements of their students, trying to spot the exceptional talents in practical projects and loyalty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig touted by the car company for talent. </seg>
<seg id="10"> A young lady from the HR department distributed pens, sweets and folders with VW logo. </seg>
<seg id="11"> She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and jobs for students and shows them ways in the Group. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Nicole Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig in charge of the project with VW. </seg>
<seg id="13"> He also sees benefits for both sides: "The students come into contact with the industry and gain experience." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "VW can simultaneously meet students, look at some interesting candidates in detail and think, who would you as an employee in question." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Such cooperation, so Selle, are not unusual. </seg>
<seg id="16"> New, that will be courted as aggressively to the students. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project," said Selle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even harder. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In many industries, their employees, companies can no longer choose from a wide array of candidates. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But they have to advertise courtship and especially for skilled workers. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Above all, graduates of engineering disciplines are used in an excellent bargaining position. </seg>
<seg id="22"> According to the Association of German Engineers VDI in October were more than 40,000 engineering positions unfilled. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And the so-called engineering gap will be even greater, according to VDI forecasts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> For the accounting and consulting firm KPMG Dykta novel goes to the talent hunt. </seg>
<seg id="25"> He organized elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG-Race, a sort of scavenger hunt where participants have the basis of GPS coordinates to find their way. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Eight promising students will send the company so next year across the USA. </seg>
<seg id="27"> By the way, participants can view KPMG's branches and get to know the company. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Who is allowed to decide in two rounds in advance. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Only the crème de la crème of the many candidate flies to the U.S.. </seg>

<seg id="31"> "We want the race apart from the crowd." </seg>
<seg id="32"> "Just a simple sailing trip was not enough for us." </seg>
<seg id="33"> For talent hunters Dykta the bill seems to be working. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "We have to date with all participants in a similar action last year contact." </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Some are nearing their conclusion and want to apply with us soon," he says. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="42"> "It's just very difficult to fill vacant positions." </seg>
<seg id="43"> "It costs a lot of time and money," she says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Another way is to contact the university professors. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Solar World is cooperating with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg. </seg>
<seg id="46"> "The professors give hints that you can do internships with us or write his thesis." </seg>
<seg id="47"> Expensive advertising campaigns are not announced at the Solar specialists. </seg>
<seg id="48"> But the company tried to recruit other benefits for themselves: Personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "This can not often offer a large corporation," says HR manager Stübe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> Money is in finding a job is no longer the main role. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Flexible working hours, child care or good career opportunities are other key factors. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Solar World documented in a study of the Great Place to Work Institute the 55th Place among the 100 best employers in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The Institute publishes an annual list of top German employers. </seg>
<seg id="54"> To this end, it asked employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the environment for the employees. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Human Resources Manager Stübe expects from the Placement and a bonus for the job seekers. </seg>
<seg id="56"> "I think candidates look particularly for external reviews of a potential employer," she says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57"> Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long term strategy, a reputation as an employer. </seg>
<seg id="58"> He advises his clients to greater authenticity. </seg>
<seg id="59"> And that means, according to Kriegler, especially internal measures. </seg>
<seg id="60"> "The best way out to make themselves attractive as an employer and its employees," he says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> In industry jargon is called the internal employer branding, employer branding that is within their own workforce. </seg>
<seg id="62"> "Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors." </seg>
<seg id="63"> If you treat his people well and they identify themselves with the company, they would advertise all by itself with friends and acquaintances for their employer. </seg>

<seg id="7"> Before the disaster, which cost the lives of eleven works and the largest environmental disaster in the U.S. led Barack Obama to pressure the opposition and the industry had indicated its willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The proponents want to reduce U.S. dependence on oil supplies from abroad. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The water in the rivers of oil is brown, it smells like at the pump: billion gallons of spilled crude oil have destroyed the nature of the Nigerian Ogoniland. </seg>
<seg id="3"> People live by theft, corruption and illegal oil boiling. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Celestine Akpobari means well. </seg>
<seg id="5"> "Do not be plagued from" calms the Ökoaktivist the journalists: "You will now get enough oil sludge from the lens." </seg>
<seg id="6"> The 37-year-old Nigerian has been following the attempt to scan a wading chest-deep in water boy with the surrounding streaks: In the rainbow sheen of water, the scene looks almost pretty. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The fact that hover beneath the surface of brown oil fumes is not visible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> They used to have here collected buckets of shrimp, Esther badomen told on the shores of Bodo-Jetty River. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Meanwhile, the slow-flowing water was completely dead </seg>
<seg id="10"> Five years ago, poured from a ruptured pipeline tons crude oil in the vast wetland. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo have to row now six hours to get into fish-containing waters: in the heart of the Niger Delta located Ogoniland is one of the worst polluted regions in the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> On the way through the criss-crossed by rivers, mangrove swamps, the full extent of the devastation is apparent. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Instead of bright water stirs the motorboat on brown stock, who dips his hand into the water, pulls out oily fingers. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The roots of the mangrove trees extend like black licorice sticks from the ground, sad to hang occasionally encountered their palm fronds. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Flocks of birds, as they are in wetlands usually the case, one searches in vain: when the outboard motor is silent, is spreading like a gas station in the former paradise smelling of eerie silence. </seg>
<seg id="16"> "What happened here is ecological warfare," Celestine Akpobari says gloomily: "We live in constant danger to health." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The war comparison is appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The settlement area of ​​the Ogoni is fought for decades battlefield: Here penetrated more than 60 years, the first Explorateur from Europe, here was organized in the 80's with the later executed author Ken Saro-Wiwa, the first resistor, in this case had the shell Group in 1993 to close its production because it was too dangerous for the oil workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Even today, the company refused to return to Ogoniland: While three times from the entire Delta region the size of Switzerland with over 5000 Bohrquellen and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines every day more than two million barrels of black gold pumping, are the oil fields fallow in Ogoniland to the group is unstable the situation. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Every few hundred yards rise steel frames and bizarre sculptures out of the water: "Christmas tree" the heads of the drill holes are called much too affectionate. </seg>
<seg id="21"> They are up to 50 years, most corroded to the core. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Again and again, cracking up such a drill head, said Akpobari, then trough a constant stream of crude oil into the water. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> More than two billion gallons have flowed according to expert estimates, in 50 years the ecosystem of the Delta: Year after year, the amount of oil as it urged the sinking of the supertanker Exxon Valdez 21 years ago in the sea off Alaska - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of mankind. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Who is to blame for the continuing eco-case scenario, it is argued. </seg>
<seg id="25"> While the Shell Group makes sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution responsible environmentalists see bursting drill heads and leaking pipelines as the main cause. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Shell Nigeria put in much lower safety standards, as is usual in the world, accused the U.S. scientists Richard Steiner of the Group 2008: Only the rate of defects in the lines was "higher by far than anywhere else." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> In a place that looks remotely like an abandoned oil-stained garage under the open sky, emerge from the mangroves figures: they are naked and smeared with oil up to the neck. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Among one of the many barrels, partly connected with tubes, some identify scattered randomly on the site, flickering fire: an illegal small refinery. </seg>
<seg id="29"> In the barrel, crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, said Michael, director of the group. </seg>
<seg id="30"> First, gasoline comes through the pipes into the collection cup, and later drips at the end of the line out and finally diesel fuel. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Michael and four staff to produce it every day up to four barrels of 300 liters of diesel, "This brings us 34 000 naira - about 22 dollars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The delta residents use the chronic fuel shortages in the country's largest oil-Saharan Africa. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Nigeria has only one refinery. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The can with just under 40 euro cents per liter diesel ridiculously low price to undercut the illegal boiler still, because they get their raw material free. </seg>
<seg id="35"> He is from "bunkers" that tap into the network of pipelines across Ogoniland: In this way the country are daily, according to experts in the entire Niger Delta at least 16 million gallons of crude oil lost. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Only a tiny proportion of the raw material is stored temporarily between refined but illegal: the lion's share of fill organized criminal networks that will include high-ranking politicians and military, its will in tankers and him on the world market. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The debate about whether the disaster is due rather to the machinations of the population or lax mode of production, the activist Akpobari holds for purely academic. </seg>
<seg id="38"> "If the oil companies, not perceived as intruders and they would have destroyed the livelihood of the fishermen not so thoroughly, it would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries." </seg>
<seg id="39"> Meanwhile, is the ratio of the Ogoni especially Shell but destroyed so that only a subtraction of the group would qualify, "Maybe yes imagine other nationalities like the Chinese out to be better." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Since Michael is nervous. </seg>
<seg id="41"> "Maximum time that you disappear," said the muscular man oil. </seg>

<seg id="2"> The German bank plans to divest its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the money home buyers looking for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Up to 500 million euro could bring the property. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Just recently, the Deutsche Bank has made its corporate headquarters nice: The twin towers in Frankfurt's financial district have been upgraded, now the bankers were allowed to return to her job. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Reasons for the proposed sale was not mentioned by the spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "We always consider whether it makes more sense to own property themselves or sell and then zurückzumieten," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> This is Germany's largest financial institution headquartered within a short time again. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The bank took over the twin towers until mid-2007 for 272 million euros by investors an in-house funds and then renovated complex. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Fits to splatter art cinema? </seg>
<seg id="3"> Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores new fighters from his epic "Valhalla Rising" old genre boundaries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> To which audience likes the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought, as he has "Valhalla Rising" filmed? </seg>
<seg id="5"> A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is freed from his tormentors and places with almost superhuman powers rows of his opponents to - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, just because our hero like rabid killing methods served and its enemies ever tear the guts out of the living body, if he's in a bad mood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On the other hand, One-Eye says, as he is known in fact, the whole movie about nothing, and the other figures can be at most times to one or two sentences or carried away a few agonizing death cries. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Otherwise, silence and the creepy beautiful hills of Scotland reveled that offers the Viking world of a millennium ago the backdrop. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Ideal for more adult film buffs with an interest in existentialism and quiet camera movements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Nice if a movie has multiple audiences pity, only if they are mutually exclusive. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Director Winding Refn, since its wild and drug dealer-styled trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino refuses, but stoic, make his work accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor or a little less brutal to the Arthouse. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Most art Cinema fans should feel let down by splashing around the brain or the intestines. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The latest action fans will die of boredom when One-Eye breaks free from interpretable reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries by ship to Jerusalem and is stuck forever in doldrums and fog before the team appeared to arrive in America and continue still. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> No wonder then, that has "Valhalla Rising" in Germany found a movie rental and is now available only on DVD. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is especially for the fabulous pictures a shame, but also because it is hidden behind the pretentious facade to a sometimes bloody exciting piece of cinema that deserves attention. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This film is not about dialogue or a compelling plot, it's all atmosphere, a film had become a fever dream. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> And from which there is no escape for the audience. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Refn begrudge him hardly a moment of relaxation and strangled him with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack very slowly to the throat, especially with the incredible hatred that proposes to meet him in the heart of the figures. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Only a small blond boy, One-Eye is the loyal support of preserves such a thing as innocence, all others are driven by anger. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Most of all, the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but the enemies and allies temporarily at some point the warriors from hell, might as Ambassador of the Devil itself </seg>
<seg id="20"> It means destruction, but perhaps only for the already spoiled. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="2"> The Atomic Energy Agency has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The country defends itself, however, to comment on it - yet it allows for checks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Around midnight on 5 to 6th September 2007 attack at least four Israeli F-15 fighter planes I a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It stands on the banks of the Euphrates, the nearest large town, 30 miles away, Dair is as-Saur. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Your name appeared in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) if it goes around the reactor, which Syria has allegedly built with help from North Korea in the cube hidden in a valley that branches off from the stream. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing by the U.S. foreign intelligence agency CIA of 2008 would be the end of April under the name of the nearby village of al-Kibar reactor was common well-suited to produce plutonium - from the could build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes, however, the technique is good in the fifties hardly. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA conducted a video presentation with blurry satellite images. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Using computer animation to a hidden, where the components are said to have the reactor before the destruction, a reduced copy of the North Korean model is from the Yongbyon nuclear center. </seg>
<seg id="11"> They also presented photos showing the building up close, or even the interior. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor had been scheduled to begin operations, it said, was not yet equipped with fuel rods. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more known than before, so the puzzles were rather larger with time. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Former U.S. President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack but was pretty sure that Syria build a reactor in al-Kibar, but saw little evidence that in the country " an active nuclear weapons program was ." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some intelligence officials in Europe are even more cautious and would rather only speak of an "alleged reactor," even if they hold the CIA presentation to "plausible." </seg>
<seg id="16"> They lack hard evidence, like the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Asked how sure he is, a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat said succinctly in the summer only, the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The rubble of the alleged "unused military building" managed to hurry while the Syrians bulldozed the site thoroughly and set aside. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Nevertheless took place in June 2008 IAEA team under former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium that had been made by people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, the IAEA received via a Member State of commercial satellite imagery providers in the period immediately after the attack, which might be more useful than the CIA presented. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, these recordings on the market are not getting because of the unknown customer - maybe Israel - it has bought exclusive. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The IAEA can not verify their authenticity, therefore, independent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always maintained, never run a secret nuclear program or built a reactor to have. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But the IAEA pointed to the analysis of the particles back as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss it - as well as on satellite images. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In addition, it denied the inspectors, a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the wreckage of the bombed building. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But Israel is silent iron. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We will comment on that before," reiterated most recently, at the time of the attack, acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Then drags the investigation of the case back inconclusive since June 2008 and "is increasingly becoming a serious credibility problem for the Authority, as a high Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA admits in Vienna - after a serious breach of the NPT is in the air, watches over the the IAEA. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As the key to progress in the investigation, the IAEA apparently sees three other institutions to be "operably linked" to the alleged reactor - and differently as this still exist. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The inspectors have been disclosed or to which assets it is, or what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, will intern at the IAEA referred to as Marj al-Sultan, and Masyaf Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby towns. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and satellite images at a building complex made Masyaf locate where it is most likely one of the suspicious object is. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It may be in or close to a military base - exactly denied on that basis Syria IAEA access to the three locations. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In Vienna it is said, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be pushed forward by the United States to spy on military installations. </seg>
<seg id="37"> For the nuclear detectives were due to tip the U.S. intelligence became aware of the facilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that was between the three towns on the Euphrates and the square footage to and fro. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A high Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be "in connection with the fuel production" are. </seg>
<seg id="40"> But there was "no evidence of sensitive activities," ie uranium enrichment and reprocessing processes that are necessary to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The reactor type is indeed powered by uranium, which is not enriched. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But where the uranium would have to come from and where it later, the plutonium would be separated for the bomb to these key questions is at best a plausible conjecture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> It is also unclear whether debris that might hold valuable traces were stored at the three locations. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the earth, no one wants to have information about where the rubble is left. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates River Mine located al-Tibni of Syria in 1998 under investigation for use as storage for radioactive waste is, the IAEA is unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently brought in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review in conjunction with reactor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Images from orbit show that Syria at the three sites suspected undertook earthworks and large container removed once the IAEA had requested access. </seg>
<seg id="48"> This may be coincidence, but has done little to dispel the suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Moreover, it is said in diplomatic circles, the IAEA had used several months on developing a plan for inspections there, it would allow Syria to maintain any military secrets - but the effort shows how great is the interest of inspectors. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Meanwhile, Damascus and ironed from this proposal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Western diplomats in Vienna were not appeased a year ago, the reactor was so destroyed, so did the cause no great urgency, as U.S. ambassador Glyn Davies takes a few months old so-called special inspections into the game, one of the sharpest agent that the Wiener atom has authority to enforce controls. </seg>
<seg id="52"> IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would propose such inspections, has indeed already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future," but still he hesitates. </seg>
<seg id="53"> There is a high risk in this way: First, it needs for a majority of the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented in it are anything but eager for an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> to consider the other as a diplomat is: "What if they find nothing in the end?" </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Since Angelina Jolie has begun in the summer to work on their yet unnamed debut as a director, there is trouble. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The screenplay she wrote a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man </seg>
<seg id="4"> Little more is known about it - but even that's enough for concern. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Stubbornly keeps the rumor that the woman, a Muslim woman fall in love, during the war in Yugoslavia in their Serbian rapist. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Bosnian women's organizations have protested immediately, whereupon some were planned days of shooting in Sarajevo moved quickly to Hungary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Meanwhile, the film is filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protesting in Bosnia. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female victims of war wrote about the UN refugee agency UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper reported now - even Jolie is an ambassador of the UN refugee agency. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Diplomatic she is not - it has a few weeks ago the women ever offered a meeting in Hungary, which were opposed, however. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Love stories in rape camps had not existed and Jolie's attitude towards the victims tell her enough about the script. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Your organization has recommended to the UN Refugee Agency According to Jolie dismissed as an ambassador, reports the Guardian. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> What exactly is written scenes for Jolie? </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, to read her script was added, after some argument, granted permission to film Sarajevo - it is not clear why Jolie was not then anyway. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The young author herself asserts, involved no political intentions with this film have to be working with a lot of effort into the Yugoslav conflict, would show the terrible consequences of war and give all interested parties a voice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The contents of it, however, remains vague. </seg>
<seg id="17"> So still a second Synopsis circulated to the film in the network, then it sounds quite different: The lovers knew each other is already before the war, and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim woman, is abducted in a Serbian camp in which he as a guard work. </seg>
<seg id="18"> What after all significantly different sound than the variant "rape victim in a crush torturer." </seg>
<seg id="19"> That Jolie's film actually starts even before the war - that's for sure. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The pressure on her, and Jolie was "unfair and based on misinformation." </seg>
<seg id="21"> Now you can probably only the hackers gain peace of Hollywood: By the script, like so many before, make illegal online. </seg>

<seg id="42"> In January, we continue to Hanover and Berlin, to the next project. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="43"> His home O'Donovan now sees only rarely, because it causes extra shifts in order to pay off the mortgage on his house at home. </seg>
<seg id="44"> "The situation is a bit crazy," he says as he steps in a long time for the first time over the threshold of his house. </seg>
<seg id="45"> "I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I am as good as ever again." </seg>

<seg id="47"> The little house in an upmarket residential area with manicured front yards, park in the driveways big, expensive cars. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Together with a sister O'Donovan has bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 € - 100 percent loan financing. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "They were crazy times, it was easy money without a lot of questions," he says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> Is he afraid that it could go wrong with the credit? </seg>
<seg id="51"> O'Donovan thinks for a while, after pouring hot tea and says: "I have no children, by which I must feed them and I am young, and even when everything goes wrong, I can start anew." </seg>
<seg id="52"> The civil engineer may not be the wailing, the moment he hears often. </seg>
<seg id="53"> "No one should go hungry - but our situation is not nearly as dramatic as in previous times here on the island," he says. </seg>
<seg id="54"> "For a while working abroad, which is not the worst thing that can happen -. Perhaps, we feel this only as an Irishman" </seg>
<seg id="55"> He laughs and then tells of his father, who has gone into the last major economic crisis in England. </seg>

<seg id="11"> In Peru, for example, where the economy is growing annually since 2002 by about 6% and the number of democracy advocates increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Even in Mexico, where the economy from the sharp drop last year recovered, such a trend can be seen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region are convinced democrats, lowering the regional average (see Chart 2). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Ca. 44% of respondents said they are satisfied with the democratic practice of their country. They are as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Chart 3). </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values ​​are the same as last year, show a marked increase over 2003 (17% and 24%). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> A decade ago, Latin American economic crises have undermined the efforts for more democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> That this continued even during the Depression, there may be the fact that the Latin American countries experienced a short recession and have recovered quickly. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, the poor were offset by a stronger social network. </seg>
<seg id="19">  (According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week 2009, the poverty rate in Latin America increased only slightly and is again this year fell by 32%.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But from country to country, there are strong differences in mood (see Chart 4). </seg>
<seg id="21"> Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread belief in progress. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and have increased violent crime, this is less the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> For only the second time since the beginning of many survey respondents see in Latin America in the crime in their country is a bigger problem than unemployment (see Chart 5). </seg>
<seg id="24"> Ca. 31% say that either they or a family member last year were victims of a crime. However, compared with 38% last year, the values ​​declined and thus reach the lowest level since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The growing economic power is reflected in the increasing support for the private and the market economy: about 71% of respondents nationwide indicated that the private sector is essential for the development, in 2007 there were 56% (see Chart 6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> Ca. 58% stated that only the market economy can bring progress their country, compared with 47% last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly, 62% of people in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% for private sector), although her left president, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private companies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil has, according to 19% of the respondents (18% last year) the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year). </seg>
<seg id="29"> The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, however, see in the U.S., the most influential country, and this role is in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua is from Venezuela. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Secretly in the middle </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband was told Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez, a wave of sympathy that drove their popularity rate by 20 points to over 50% up. This is the highest figure since being elected in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Whether you this but the next year helping to re-election depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more accommodating than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The signs are not clear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Néstor Kirchner, who even after the election of his wife drew the economic policy, is often on budgets, tax revenues, economic growth and inflation has not fully taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This allowed the president and his wife, the extra revenue to spend as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On paper, the Fernández government lost in the last year, the majority in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death on the 27th after a heart attack October led to further disagreements. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some dissidents from the ranks of the ruling Peronist rallied to Cristina Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But after chaotic sessions (which struck another in the face of parliament and other government accused of corruption), it was the Congress not to adopt the budget for 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I will not discuss it," said the President. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The 2010 budget does for the next year, which the President has even more opportunity to spend money as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy is overheating: it will probably grow this year by up to 9%. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official inflation rate Coll at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of unions - the value to drive almost 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner, who took office 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises said growth and poverty reduction to their primary objectives, and not the inflation reduction. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He refused to cooperate with the IMF harassed, the private sector and cleaned the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which then the official inflation statistics, brightened. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Fernández can now follow a smoother path? </seg>
<seg id="18"> They called on the private sector and trade union leaders for talks. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And, according to official statements, wage increases are limited to 18% next year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a big boost. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the surge in growth, inflation, undermined by a large devaluation in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Maybe Cristina Fernandez wants financial terms for this reason, Argentina re-connect to the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Earlier this year, the Government signed an agreement with holders of securities that had earlier rejected the rescheduling of the country in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Fernández now seems to an agreement with donors from the Paris Club to push, which it owes about $ 6.7 billion. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Kirchner had a review by the IMF, as is usual elsewhere, always refused. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But last month, announced the Minister Amado Boudou, the Fund will provide support to the creation of a new national consumer price index "technical support." It looks as if this is the first step to clean up the INDEC. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is unknown whether Fernandez will be politically active after the end of its term without the support of her husband is. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If so, it needs to support the middle class, many of whom have had enough of Kirchnerism. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the Argentines to return in March from their summer holiday, is the wave of sympathy that she was met, be abated. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If they want to win another election, it must decide whether to many political decisions of her husband quietly canceled. </seg>

<seg id="4"> On 27 November made more than 7.5 million voters, or 70% of eligible voters, on to be elected to the five boroughs, mayors and town councils. This will provide a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou scored. </seg>
<seg id="5"> By building ground-breaking business, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma is itself a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with mainland China for the first time since 1949 lasting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Ma has passed the test, but only just. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT), three of the five mayors is that they did not receive a majority vote. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Instead, given the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence for Taiwan, nearly 50% of the vote, the KMT received 45%. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In a presidential election would have meant for Ma problems. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Since his election two years ago, the share of votes his party has fallen by about 8%. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For the first time the DPP drew an even together with the KMT in the city councils. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> During the election there were the usual incidents in Taiwan such as truck convoys with rioters, Flag-waving mass parades and scantily clad dancers. </seg>
<seg id="13"> There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT held on the eve of the election a speech to a KMT candidate, </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Remarkably, relations with the mainland was not discussed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Instead, the candidates debated plans to housing and job creation. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The Taiwanese love their de facto independence from China's military threat and refuse. </seg>
<seg id="22"> For this reason, the KMT government in its relations with Beijing, not like in the foreground. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But this time avoided the DPP, the anti-Chinese feelings to stir up a lot. </seg>
<seg id="24"> She was responding to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy without China can not survive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Ma would in turn confirm that the majority of Taiwanese favor of his China policy. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of Taiwan zurückzulocken with economic incentives in the community. </seg>
<seg id="27"> China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Certainly, it also wants political integration. But first things first. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It prefers to wait until after the 2012 presidential election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The DPP has now re-invented. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Two years ago it was severely weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian for corruption was in prison. </seg>
<seg id="32"> During his presidency from 2000 to 2008 he was strongly committed to absolute independence. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But under Tai's reign, developed a new generation of moderate politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of working people and youth. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Tsai was a presidential candidate of the DPP very well received, as Su Tseng-chang to Chen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Their party is doing everything now to show that they too will be able to develop strong relations with Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Tsai is planning a think tank as a contact point between the DPP and China. This, however, requires open-minded discussions. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Tsai said publicly that their party is a "trusted alternative" to offer Mas hasty rapprochement with China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Chen seems to have this change very angry. </seg>
<seg id="39"> From his cell, he said, the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence. </seg>
<seg id="40"> He urged the pragmatist Su even to abandon the presidential candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even without the interference of Chen's DPP has difficulties to choose their candidates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The KMT is undergoing its own self-analysis must. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Mas values ​​are bad, despite rapid economic growth, the KMT candidate wanted to campaign without him. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The discovery of another species of bacteria that include can live on arsenic, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Although scientists of this unusual bacterium discovered here on Earth, it considers that it is a sign that a life without the hitherto possible as vital elements is considered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "This organism has two options." </seg>
<seg id="5"> "He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "That makes it something special, even though it is almost a kind of 'alien' life form is," said Paul CW Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> So far, six major elements considered essential to life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> But as the scientists found the bacterium in California's Mono Lake is growing even further when it replaces phosphorus by arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "One wonders just what else is possible," the co-author of the report, Ariel D. Anbar, said of Arizona State University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists have to realize life and its forms, Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study deals with microbes that are found on Earth. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The announcement of a press conference in which no details have been announced to the discovery gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet, that the report could be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems, organisms with the help of other elements may share biochemical processes in motion and that the 'standard items', which we believe are absolutely essential for life, stipulated not as closely," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the UK. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockels was not part of the research team. </seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> This discovery was not accidental. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Felisa Wolfe-Simon of Astro Biological Institute of NASA, who led the study, chose the Mono Lake because of high arsenic content. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically, it was thought that microbes, which both are exposed to potentially replace one element by another. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The lion roars again following a court approval of the MGM-restructuring </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty MGM finally got the green light for a fresh start. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed the "prime" from Gläuberplan to pay off the debt of $ 5 billion and the 86-year-old entertainment company to pave the way for new films and television shows. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to the testimony of Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy laws, so that the restart of MGM, led by Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founder of Spyglass Entertainment, nothing more stands in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will preside over the somewhat stripped-down studio as General Manager. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The workforce will be reduced to more than 400 around 320th </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For MGM enters Chapter 11 as recently as in force when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned bond issue of $ 500 million to finance the new MGM productions. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Right now heads a consortium of investment bank, which itself brings $ 75 million, the company. The financing should be done until mid-December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 to help with the order to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the company's management, with the interest payments of $ 300 million fighting a year, to solve their financial problems. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In August, the CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert who was his job at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts announced. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Moelis & Cooper's efforts to resolve the financial concerns MGM and pay out more than 140 Gläuber the studio lasted longer than expected. </seg>
<seg id="11"> After months of discussions, both parties agreed in late 2009 to offer the company up for sale. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the requested $ 2 billion by the creditors. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In the spring of this year, everything started from scratch, as the MGM team began with the restructuring plan that was after months of internal debates and disputes in late October finally signed by the creditors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> If MGM has in the weeks to come through the bankruptcy official, Moelis and Cooper for their work in a bonus of several million dollars. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The proportion of Moelis & Co., which have already received $ 1.2 million, amounts to $ 9.5 million </seg>
<seg id="16"> Cooper, which was paid for the management of the company $ 375,000 per month will receive a "success bonus" of $ 4 million </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM again. This year brought out the studio only a movie and created an annual plan with seven or eight films, the initial release in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="18"> They also are planning two movies after "The Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The studio needed to a separate loan of $ 265 million to $ 275 million for its financial share of these two films to be established, directed by Peter Jackson. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The investor Carl Icahn, who has financed about 18% of MGM's loan sought a merger with the studio Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder is he. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the last negotiations between the two companies led to no result. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Tech Toys Your Gift Budget holds in equilibrium </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can tear a considerable hole in your budget gifts. </seg>
<seg id="3"> An iPad costs as much as five BMX bikes for $ 99, while the price for a game about 10 Kinect classical skipping ropes, or about 48 cans Play-Doh meets. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> But you can protect your gift budget. </seg>
<seg id="5"> I recently visited in search of three electronic toys under $ 80 three national toy retailer - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club. </seg>
<seg id="6"> I was immediately clear that Moore's Law was in force. This year, the technology toys at the same time efficient and cost slightly less than last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> And although fewer new toys appear with their own web sites found on the most famous of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, a wider range. </seg>
<seg id="8"> More and more button-cell powered toys come on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Here are some recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="10">  (Unless otherwise indicated, all prices of Toys "R" Us are.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $ 13 for children 3 years) are plush figures, the size of guinea pigs that sing a note, if you press on her stomach. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Press once corresponds to a note by pressing several times can you play a song. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Note: If you started with the press of time, you can not stop. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> For a combination of envoys and dance is the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $ 60 for children 2) the best choice. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Based on the offers in the last year developed Elmo Live doll animatronic technology, the changing games like 'Simon says', and thanks to the novel hinge legs with wheel lock, they dominated the Moon Walk. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. Her parents complained, however, about the lack of volume control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> If you are a child of the 80s, you can certainly remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Now he is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $ 40 for children over 3), with a whole pile of question cards, with which a car can be a lesson, with a know-alls with auto-correction function as a teacher. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> If your child does not want to entrust your phone like, here are three independent alternatives. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Mobigo from VTech ($ 60 for children 3 to 8) is the cheapest and easiest to use solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. It or its games are not as instructive as those on the Explorer Leapster ($ 70 for children 3 to 12), which is equipped to the first major revision of the Leapfrog Leapster-series with a new, brighter screen. </seg>
<seg id="22"> None of the versions is compatible with older tapes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> iXL by Fisher-Price ($ 90 for children 3 to 7) used for the Games and eBooks, a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD card drive can also be considered family photos on it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Finally, there are Scrabble Flash ($ 30 from Hasbro, for children over 8). The five blocks are no larger than a matchbox and have their own LED display. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The game is about to merge the blocks to form words before time runs out. It is great for an impromptu spelling bee. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> More and more toys have some sort of online connection. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If you go alone to the offer in the toy stores, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important. </seg>
<seg id="28"> To give your child an online pet on Club Penguin, you may also a Disney Club Penguin 2 "Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($ 5 for children 6 to 12) buy, which includes a coin with a confidential code. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If you enter the code online, your child will receive the Club Penguin Store enough credits for two other parts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> It can be roller skates or a Puffle-stuffed animal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The latest head-cell powered micro-robots, nano Hexbug ($ 10 for children over 5) is not larger than the head of your toothbrush. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The beetle is moving quickly to 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction. </seg>
<seg id="33"> It's fun to send him through a maze of blocks. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Prosecutor will not indict Senator Ensign </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Justice Department prosecutors have Senator John Ensign acquitted of the charges, which in his affair with a former election worker, and his attempt to give her husband a lobbying were brought against him, gave the senator's lawyers said Wednesday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This decision ends the most serious legal charge against Senator Ensign, a Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal that caused a nationwide headlines, and put a damper on his career, he was regarded as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As Senator Ensign's office announced that he was on the sentence after the one-year investigation "delighted." </seg>
<seg id="5"> The ethics committee of the Senate could still impose a Disziplarstrafe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to Ensign's lawyers they were from the Justice Department informed that the investigation against Senator Ensign have been set and that there is the matter no further charges. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Justice Department declined to comment on the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The verdict was for many ethical lawyers outside the Justice Department a surprise. In your opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign has violated the lobbying ban. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Interviews, e-mails and other documents for the first time in October 2009, in The New York Times disclosed gave rise to the presumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his campaign workers, helped to lucrative contracts for his silence about an affair to buy with Hamptons wife Cynthia. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Cynthia Hampton worked for a campaign treasurer as Ensigns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Ensign made contact with some political friends to give Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over for them after setting Hamptons lobbying. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Because Hampton was recently election team in Ensign, it was he could not lobby for a year take over for his former employer, or the entire Senate. </seg>
<seg id="13"> According to a statement of ethics experts violated the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, against the so-called revolving-door ban on Lobbykratie. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> According to published evidence "is apparently an agreement and to the violation of the revolving-door statute" said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are targeted by the government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> While the Ministry of Justice official refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign-known case, said Mr. Brand, and other ethics advocates, the ministry seems very cautious in taking political accusations against a large number of defeats by the media with great interest were pursued, including the decision to leave last year, the indictment against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct fall by the prosecutor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Prosecutors "are obviously frightened," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization aimed at fighting corruption in parliamentary and government circles in the U.S.) is a group of lawyers who has brought several charges against Mr. Ensign in court. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "That basically means that high government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Paul Coggins, the main defender of Mr. Ensign said in an interview on Monday he had received a phone call from a prosecutor and another the next day, informing him that, was that the Ministry would not bring any action against his client. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Mr. Ensign's defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors in order to convince them that the senator, as his office again reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, had "acted in accordance with the Act. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr. Coggins declined to the legal arguments he had brought against the prosecutors to explain in more detail. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "I'm not comfortable in the call details between the Ministry of Justice and to walk me Suffice it to say. We believe we have made the right decision," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Last month the Federal Election Commission has decided to discontinue the investigation for a separate action by the ethics group that had failed after a payment of $ 96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons of the federal election law. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The Election Commission said there was not enough evidence that the money had been anything other than a gift. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> NV Energy, a big company in Nevada, which has long supported the Senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton was a result of support from Mr. Ensign lobbyists work. </seg>
<seg id="25"> An e-mail in December 2008 shows that, after the company has done much to Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he Ministry of the Interior because of a cause "knocking." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and other customers in Nevada, Allegiant Air, arranged to meet for lunch and asked the transport minister, held a meeting on behalf of the airline to agree, after this Mr. Hampton had set for the purpose of lobbying. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Cheshire appeal draws attention to Twitter </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Half a dozen of them tapped into the riots off in the courtroom. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The minute they sent their reports on Twitter gruesome testimony. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the end, the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process to rape and child chained to beds in a house that burst into flames. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Thursday, the closely watched process by Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to find a formal end when the verdict on the death sentence, which has pronounced the jury makes. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already filed claims with the court, explain the reasons for an appeal and the courts will be dealing for years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> One of the provocative reasons is that the intensive coverage of the process - and by the extensive use of Twitter by the average reporter - came to a "circus atmosphere" and a so widespread, immediate penetration of insurgent details is so that the jury in inadmissible way by the public outcry had been affected. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Such opposition could lead the Courts of Appeal to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules in court is necessary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "So as I have experienced during this process, I think it's really a risk if the intake influences of new technology in the courtroom of everyone's right to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes lead counsel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue Chamber of the Supreme Court last week dismissed the applications by decision succinctly back when he said, would be that the new media "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But that was certainly not the last word on this matter. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For decades, appeals courts have determined that bear the coverage of notorious cases of doubt as to the fairness of a process can be. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In its historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States the conviction of Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who allegedly murdered his wife lifted, and said in his ruling that due to the new media a "carnival atmosphere in the court would have given ." </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some people believe that based on the television series and the feature film "The Fugitive" in this crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some say lawyers, court appeals, which Mr. Hayes condemnation consider a half-century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom, at the time of the case, Dr. Sheppard was still inconceivable . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "It's a good reason, about the impact of new media in processes that are followed by the general public to be alarmed," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut . His report states that it is imposed arbitrarily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor Donohue said that some Courts of Appeal could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of prompt communication from the courtroom out the processes could make fairer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Twitter matter is just one of many who claim the lawyers of Mr. Hayes to discuss for years, and thus postpone a conviction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defense lawyers argue, for example, that Mr. Hayes might have been already prejudiced when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them during jury selection gruesome crime scene photos. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years, had filled her with disgust. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defense lawyers say they would make the constitutionality of the death penalty constitutional in question, and argue that the judge had incorrectly replaced a juror who had been a critic of the prosecutor, and that he had improperly exerted pressure on the ruling, as he had taken the unusual decision to put the jury on the weekend off. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The jurors were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But their arguments about the influence of the detailed reporting of the process takes perhaps the greatest interest. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In one sentence challenge, which they submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and throughout the election campaign was discussed for the office of governor and for the American Senate candidate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They argued that the new media have continuously ignited the flames of emotions about the case again. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "Such a rush of everyday media beepers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," wrote the lawyers, "one has before that in New Haven, and perhaps not even the country experienced." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Its focus on reporting by Twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In interviews, some said journalists that the claim that these direct messages were rabble-rousing than reports which are, slowly, an anti-technology view is that the impoverished on future reporting processes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> But some lawyers said, Courts of Appeal were often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes require adaptation by the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr. Hayer Legal reinforce this assertion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In their appeal they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, was repealed on the conviction of Dr. Sheppard because of reporting and made it clear that new media require new rules. </seg>
<seg id="32"> "This case," they wrote, "Sheppard against Maxwell represented the 21st century." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Politeness can connect the divide? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> After a campaign of insults and negativity this week little civility in Washington is broken. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Is it the omen of a genuine bipartisan cooperation or a moment of illusion, before quickly returning to the struggle of parties in the capital? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and peaks of the Congress took a breakthrough in the major issues that might occur during the so-called "lame duck session," session at the end of a reign in which no decisions are taken more to employ, had. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After all that, what you hear, it was not a polite debate between two different sides nor a respect for their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a party gathering points. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meeting of the deficit of the President Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that exist between the members remain. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems clear that close interaction can occur over a period of months, a mutual respect, of the ideological divide that still separates the members of one another, veiled. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> This is hardly enough to argue, there is a new era of cooperation had begun. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Both sides are now in a testing phase - in which one of the other characters from the demands of cooperation and compromise, even while trying the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a new party warfare to weigh. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Therefore, the meeting was limited on Tuesday itself and its evaluation by the participants for a minimum of demands or accusations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to be expected that a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, could. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Whether it comes to taxes, donations, health and rights is, the two sides are miles apart. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Finally, the November election Washington, at least for a short time has become more tolerant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration who now works for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "This is inevitable after elections. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elections arouse partisan passions, which eventually die again. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And that's good. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> On some issues, particularly those who are on the agenda of the "lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution." </seg>
<seg id="19"> Bush's tax cuts that end of the year, and no one supports this </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether temporarily or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Likewise, a compromise with respect to the increased unemployment benefits to be expected if only because the Republicans can not afford that one believes that deny favored tax cuts for the rich, while unemployed workers for assistance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House has increased the optimism that one on these issues during the "lame duck session," while some may not ratify START and the new contract. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful collaboration lead in pressing issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to sustained cooperation of the parties must, when the new 112th Congress convenes in January. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead, he says, a phase of non-compliance is likely, perhaps inevitable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology turn into confrontation," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - that cooperation leads to true courtesy. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "I lot of what happens between now and 2012, see it as a front line, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and the Tea Party voters, whose education was appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="29"> How worried the Republican leaders may also be about having to play poker too high, they know that they have to try out its promise to reduce government spending and put the health reform repealed to comply. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> This party lines in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Commission clearly deficit, which include a tax reform and raising some taxes and increasing the retirement age and lowering government spending. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The Vice-Chairman Alan Simpson, and Erskine Bowles took over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, so much urged to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need within the Commission, 14 of 18 votes, to make its official recommendation, they plan to fight very come to even get near that number. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the Panel, as in financial matters, at least today, is little room for compromise or little sympathy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and Republicans in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The first battle will take place next year in the form of party clashes, if the Republicans to challenge Obama regards the national budget, taxes and the health system, later followed by a phase of major zweiparteilicher cooperation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will cause this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> Public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It is proved that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still wants more, that the two parties work together. </seg>
<seg id="39"> When confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties need to carefully pay attention to public reaction. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Whoever is destined to lose, will change course and seek compromises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> That may indeed be an optimistic view. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Partisanship and polarization are greater today than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be more ideological divide between Obama and the Congress as a Republican to be the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At the same time, the activists of both parties in 2010 as a mere prelude to a consequence of much broader choice 2012th </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Seen like the courtesy that is worn on show this week to be welcomed by many Americans. </seg>
<seg id="45"> But it will take on both sides a lot more effort to find a common denominator in the issues that separate the two remain apart. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and they are a part of the bribes and protection money they collect, on to the Kremlin. In February, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Both police and the state security police extort protection money high so they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, they say. </seg>
<seg id="4"> They collect money not only by legitimate businesses, but also by organized criminal gangs. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of authority" - takes his share of the money that moves up the ladder. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The memo that was sent under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle to Washington, was released on Tuesday from his home page on WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It was written while Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow was still Mayor, and he was accused of corruption. </seg>
<seg id="9"> He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is little evidence that had been cleaned up in the meantime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, which has a known construction company, have refused for years to allegations of corruption over again, and he has won numerous libel suits against such accusations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In September, he told a Russian television station, when he was asked about a documentary that suggests that he is corrupt ." It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. The polls have shown. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But it is unusual that, as happened in the report of the ambassador, individuals are mentioned, and it is unheard of, that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "The direct connection of the Moscow City Government with the crime has meant that some of them as" call and come to the conclusion that the government is acting more like a kleptocrats as a government "interference, so the memo. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "Criminal elements enjoy an" kryshna " (a term from the world of criminals about the Mafia, which literally means roof or protection), which extends over the police, the State Security Service (FSB), the Service Authority (MVD) and the Office the prosecutor as well as extending throughout the Moscow government bureaucracy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Experts have discovered a three-layered structure within the criminal world of Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Luzhkov is our top priority." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage." </seg>
<seg id="19"> Recent follow the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors at the lowest level. " </seg>
<seg id="20"> "This is an incompetent system, close to the criminal groups in some areas, a gap because the city is offering no help." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The report further says that the FSB collects money from the biggest companies and the police arrested the small business. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> A source is, then, "said that to understand Moscow's business owners that it is best to get the protection from the MVD and FSB (and not by organized crime), because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law. " </seg>
<seg id="23"> "For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is not as popular as before." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The memo noted that while the collection of funds is comprehensive, protecting themselves are not very modest, even those who pay are sometimes arrested. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Those who do not pay will find their business very quickly closed - because of one or other pretext. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Medvedev has repeatedly talked about fighting corruption, but noted also that he has made little progress. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The message of the message contains descriptions of men with suitcases, which were probably full of money, go to the Kremlin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> "Leave in its fight against corruption must Medvedev on the bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, said Director of By, a Moscow committee of experts in a recent interview. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "But he is part of the bureaucracy." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "It is no part of the political class as a political class in Russia no longer exists." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Nationally, according to estimates, by which Russia Corruption costs more than $ 300 billion per year. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The country ranked 154 of a recent study on the global perception of corruption by the NGO Transparence International (countries from least corrupt "lists" most corrupt "to). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> The revelation of the memo of the American embassy, ​​which happened after Moscow time late at night, will almost certainly trigger displeasure within the Russian government, though, as Luzhkov can be blamed for the mistakes of Moscow, it can be to the Kremlin a chance to say that to solve the problems. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Khmer Rouge veterans forced a confrontation with the past </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a dimly lit, concrete classroom with peeling walls and dirty, the director of Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built it, to the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> "Everyone here loves Ta Mok." </seg>
<seg id="4"> "He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Cor Sreng Ma, 42 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> known for its brutality during the Khmer Rouge's reign as "the butcher," is the commander popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still living . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, long-term followers will be challenged in Anlong Veng. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum that victims are allowed public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In June, the government distributed a textbook, the first former child soldier tells the story of the Khmer Rouge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And in July a joint tribunal condemned the UN and Cambodia for the first time a former member of the Khmer Rouge than the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek IEV, better known as Duch, sentenced to 35 years in prison. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Each of these developments, the fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Veng, their efforts made it difficult for reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "There is still resentment and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do something," said Youk Chhang, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an independent organization that studies the regime. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "It even splits families." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died from disease, overwork or starvation. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When the Vietnamese invaded and 1979, the Pol Pot-Ied government collapsed, fled the remnants of the regime and its military on the border of Cambodia to Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Here they spread until December 1998 when the last movement surrendered to sleep. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> As introduced Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary, the guerrilla war from its base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok went the next generation matured in Anlong Veng. </seg>
<seg id="18"> But the mid-1990s, when a project funded by the UN peace agreement led in 1993 the first democratic elections in the country, started a large group of Khmer Rouge fighters, to the government to overflow, leading to the capitulation of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998 led. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Pol Pot died in 1998 of natural causes, and Ta Mok, who was not given, was arrested in 1999 by government forces in the Dangrek Mountains. </seg>
<seg id="20"> He died in 2006 in prison in Phnom Penh, where he waited for his trial. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> As their patron they are no longer protected, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the grinding poverty of rural Cambodia, and many kept the movement in nostalgic memories. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Even if kept a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge their local government posts, because they laid down their weapons, were the rank and poor, uneducated peasants. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> "These people have very little benefit from the surrender," Sok Leang said the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds throughout Cambodia, in Anlong Veng, public forums </seg>
<seg id="24"> "They are rooted in the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime." </seg>
<seg id="25"> "They grew up without any professional knowledge." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Sor Lim, 55, who joined in 1974 as a teenager the Rhmer Rouge, fought in the jungle to Anlanger Veng, before he settled in 1998 to lead a life of a poor rice farmer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> "Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said. </seg>
<seg id="28"> "Ta Mok has been eating something for everyone." </seg>
<seg id="29"> "But now, life is hard because we have to take care of themselves." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also aroused concern. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Early next year, the court will try to provide Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister in court. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The order of the court is to order the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will follow on these four cases, further action. </seg>
<seg id="33"> That has done little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Recent media speculation have focused on the Chaem, 64 years, concentrated, which during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s was the district chief in the province Manteay Meanchey. </seg>
<seg id="35"> In 2007, she had told agents of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, they have guided the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of slave laborers died probably. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> On a hot evening in Chaem came from work in the fields of her wooden house in a dirty back road out of Anlong Veng. </seg>
<seg id="37"> As the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass threw leaned in Chaem discuss it off to charge, their past, the Khmer Rouge. </seg>
<seg id="38"> If they summon the court, they would refuse to leave, she said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> "Cambodia is at peace and stability," she said. </seg>
<seg id="40"> "If there were no more prosecutions would be war here." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled in 1878 by the Khmer Rouge, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be unsafe, would accuse the court more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> "Cambodia dig a hole and bury the past," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> But confrontation with the past is what Cambodia has to do to go to forward to, "said Youk Chhang by the Documentation Centre. </seg>
<seg id="44"> "Reconciliation with the Khmer-time means of collecting the broken pieces," he said. </seg>
<seg id="45"> "It is our duty to put these broken pieces together, so as to understand everything." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> The center created the first government-approved textbook about the Khmer Rouge, the 75seitige "History of Democratic Cambodia." </seg>
<seg id="47"> It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the history books for the High School Ministry of Education that contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> How many times in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know very little about the Khmer Rouge regime, despite the compounds of the city. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new textbook will help students to understand an important part of their history. </seg>
<seg id="50"> But his parents reacted with skepticism when he brought the book home to read it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> "My family does not accept many parts of the book and the court," he said. </seg>
<seg id="52"> "They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are convicted by the court." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> Such resistance is complex and complicated the process of reconciliation, "said Sok Leang. </seg>
<seg id="54"> But obtaining the public forums, the textbook and the court gradually influence, "he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> Still has the Khmer Rouge here a powerful attraction. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Up in the mountains Dangrek launches of shrubs and overgrown with plastic garbage dirty way to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Pol Pot's body was cremated here after his death in 1998 at a tire pile. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile vendor on the roadside, said she did not know much about the man who was cremated here. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> "But he has a strong mind and many people go here to pray to him," she said. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Belarus agrees not to collect more weapons-grade uranium </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign for global nuclear material security, the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton in the White Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the security summit. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus expects to earn no more highly enriched uranium and last spring seemed to have reached a hurdle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that were taken in the past two months, two secret agreements with Belarus, to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian Research Institute. </seg>
<seg id="6"> That set the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee, who remains anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue, about 500 pounds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The agreement seems to be one of the main results of Obama's "Nuclear safety summit of 47 nations to be" in April, had been ruled out of Belarus. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next peak 2012th </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I was really impressed by the fact that they want a seat on the Nuclear Safety Summit (2012)." </seg>
<seg id="10"> "This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Clinton called the agreement "a very significant and important step" of Belarus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, within four years to secure all nuclear material precarious. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries, their highly enriched uranium to get rid of. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Belarus will be the seventh. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A dozen countries were doing it under the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At the time of Obama's Nuclear Safety Summit of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never give up its uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of pounds, which is essential weapons-grade and less-enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "This is our raw material ... We will make it no dirty bombs and we will sell it to anyone." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We use it for research purposes only, that's all." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Belarus approached yet in a few months ago the United States, as it indicated interest in meeting an agreement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The first attempt to remove the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly complicated because the material was contaminated slightly, say officials. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It was loaded onto a special train, the more than 1300 miles to say a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The second attempt was decided on Monday and was conducted according to the officials by plane. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The U.S. government pays for this $ 14 million effort, with much of the money in the Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium flows, which can not be used for nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "This was very carefully coordinated and agreed to build trust," which led to the agreement that was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official with the Ministry of Energy, which operates on the global risk reduction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende study estimates that this year Belarus had at least 88 pounds of uranium and hundreds of pounds waffenfähhigen of highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Belarus wants according to the joint agreement to resolve his camp until 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The relations between Belarus and the United States were strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko harsh abuse of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But the statement on Wednesday suggested a possible approach. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> "The progress of these global security issues welcome hot end, announced the United States of America and Belarus that an increased respect remains for democracy and human rights in Belarus, a key issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens, "she explains. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This called PLM computer science program was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The aim is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built in order to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs. </seg>
<seg id="9"> PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras from Canon, the Sukhoi aircraft and the most famous vehicles from Nissan. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Zapatero and the red line in Germany </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin has decided to include retention of the euro, but at the same time set up conditions for the entire European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tension in the markets have caused a duplicate response of the government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, presented new adaptation measures, from tax breaks for small and micro enterprises, regulation of employment agencies and cancellation of 426 Euro support for the unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatization of 49 percent from AENA, the administration Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 percent of the state lottery. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, supports the Deputy Prime Minister, Elena Salgado, has with the help of former President Felipe González government criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as managers who herausbeschwört the current crisis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As these processes are understood? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is anticipated that Merkel's position is no fault of their public relations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> While Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective, a to shaping our future, the conflict with the maintenance of ancient traditions of much of its partners. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In view of the resistance in Europe starting in Germany to speculate about three possible ways out of crisis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would leave the euro area. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Second: The reintroduction of the German mark - although currently it sounds more like science fiction - supported by a majority of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The Third: A transformation of the euro according to the German proposals. That means more macroeconomic control, strict financial management; punish countries that violate the regulations; möglichereweise the payments of some countries and the expansion of the potential costs of adaptation to the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is clear and is emerging for some time. Therefore, there are now no excuses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First, 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission provides incentives for deficits and the German government, a constitutional reform took off the sleeve, to prevent this from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This was the first sign of the growing gap between what Germany thought it necessary (strict control plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second sign was the central European country, as Merkel's decision to rescue Greece painful postponed. </seg>
<seg id="18"> At that time, which was strongly criticized. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion was totally opposed to rescue Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally, Merkel is in the last days of October and again with a clear position of strength. She calls for a reform of the European Union agreements to allow the rescue of a country and at the same time to require private lenders to bear part of the cost. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as they advanced the Ireland crisis and all that follows. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But her proposal, although some sweetened, was adopted. In the coming months we will participate in the reform of the European Union that will allow these measures as of 2013. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has drawn a red line that it does not pass. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It says all that - even if unpopular measures must be taken now - there will be from that date the old no longer functioning of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="24"> 2013 the year of birth will be a new currency area in which the offending countries will face severe penalties, may be forced to declare themselves bankrupt and take in this case, the private sector a portion of these costs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany have shown us is that we are a hard growth, high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improve productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The other alternative, which is based on debt and building industry with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it was led by Spain in boom times, is simply not acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would do badly in not understanding it. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It's not just about the national deficit by 2013 to drive down to three percent. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much harder. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, we are deceiving themselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope the current turmoil to go to more peace. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And that we have the opportunities that we are commanded to use until the spring of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero has taken this so well, and its double announcement (the reforms promised after the meeting with the Enterprise on Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel hypothesized order to create in-house, their way has prepared. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look that situation would change somewhat. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Among the options under consideration is that we are serious with the little stuffed euro zone countries would have to leave to exclude. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In this case, Germany could still tell us that it had warned us. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Sport and control circumvention </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tricks such as those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax shows ingenuity, but not the will to avoid a penalty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The supposedly by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso, Sergio Ramos) instigated exclusion in the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League meant that much ink has been spilled over whether it is an unsportsmanlike act or not act, and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA. </seg>
<seg id="4"> As is well known, lost two players a few minutes before the end of the game (her team had already won clearly) the time and played several fouls, so the referee showed them the second yellow card. </seg>
<seg id="5"> would in this way, and give the Real Madrid since his group, the two players to the penalty prescribed for the next league game against Auxerre meet and so on without a card game to the next phase. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Finally, the Disziplinarkommitee UEFA punished the club coach, Jose Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="8"> She is so widespread that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport rules followed - is. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of the arisen debate about the case shown stems from the fact that a team of football club Real Madrid (who claims in his hymn nobility and honor, and punished on other occasions his players of similar incidents had) it played the leading role, and the dramatization Mourinho, who has added one more episode to its long history as a theatrical technician and provocative. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case, turns the debate about whether this is not expressly prohibited by the statutes of conduct contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts constitute a circumvention rule. Actually endorses this on the statutes of the sport, but seem to get around its meaning. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In the matter of the spirit of sport should be investigated damage caused. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The spirit to defend the physical integrity of the adversary, an aspect that has not been jeopardized by these actions because it was not an aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that pull the offending player an unfair advantage of the opposite team. That did not happen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally understand about foul play or rule evasion, for the circumvention of the rule was implemented not in secret to avoid a penalty, but they should be as flashy as possible so that they will be punished by the referee. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players waited and took the sentence to joy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is what kind of advantage the offender from the deliberate fouls subject. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Here should be emphasized that the rival was neither placed in a less favorable situation has advantages for the game played were demanded, for the obvious result of this move was that your team had to continue playing with less players. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is also not a useful strategy for the next game because the club does not then these players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The advantage is obviously that the players begin the next phase of the Champions League without playing cards, which could threaten their participation in a future game. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree of uncertainty advantage because the team could leave at some point. In addition, the players with this approach, a penalty and go into the second cycle of cards in which they retire because of accumulation of cards with a card lower than the first cycle. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Thus, it is not so clear whether there really is an advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Ultimately, such approaches are not directed against the spirit of sport, to which strategic decisions in order to benefit from the provisions of the possible results. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case, the players wanted to avoid any penalty (which would actually be a clear case of circumvention rule), they would rather choose when to undergo this. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Despite the announcement of the possible formation of a new unit available to the fight against corruption and collusion on the part of Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public commission of inquiry on the subject. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hydro-Quebec has agreed by mutual agreement of project planning company 450 million U.S. dollars in contracts for the hydropower project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium comprising the companies BPR, Dessau, SM and Groupe Axor, the most important part, that of project management, has received a total of 295 million dollars without tender. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This consortium, known as "Énergie gérance" in 2004 to answer as a corollary of the decision by Hydro-Quebec, the private sector, their responsibility, that important hydroelectric project in the amount of a sum of $ 5 billion, is formed. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In early 2005 landed the consortium "Énergie gérance" the lucrative contract, without that there was a public tender. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For the Parti Québécois, the recourse is to consortia of companies is a serious ethical problem, evoking the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung and a price increase. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "This is a new way of a conspiracy and exhausted the competition." </seg>
<seg id="8"> "This means that instead of carrying out prearranged games instead of a secret way now in open form," said Sylvain Simard yesterday, deputy of the PQ, at the press conference. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the early morning Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, for it seems difficult to understand how the interest of the public in this way can be operated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau the afternoon had responded by vehemently contest that it had been in this contract is a put-up job. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "I remain faithful to my line," she thundered, encouraged by the PQ was "dishonest" basis and "their lack of hardness. </seg>
<seg id="12"> She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologized. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The model of the consortium is the world standard practice. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is usually a time such temporary alliance that allows two or more entities to pool their expertise regarding a bid on a tender for a complex project. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The "East Main" has a high level of complexity with respect to his employment proportions. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The construction process is underway and should be installed by 2012. </seg>
<seg id="17"> However, the contract was awarded without a competition had to take place, it had already been negotiations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In addition, the model of the consortium is in Quebec even with relatively simple projects no longer an exception and </seg>
<seg id="19"> As the newspaper "Le Devoir" last week noted that in the field of civil engineering and consulting model being used by the consortium subject of government investigations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> A short flight over the Quebec business registry makes it possible to designate more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be of constant duration. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In this way, for example, the firm Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its key competitors, which include CIMA +, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, or Roche and Tecsult together. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Any link, and there are several dozen leads back to one and the same entity, namely, Dessau. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> What the consortium "Énergie gérance" is concerned, Minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territory of James Bay is subjected to a specific labor market dynamics and that Hydro-Québec, this fact since the 70's in a special way bill unpaid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Réal Laporte, the major employers of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that the nose can turn up on the fact that the contract was approved by the project management agreement. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "If you make a call and there are few candidates, your prices will soar." </seg>
<seg id="26"> "So you have two options: either you take the people who are on the Mart and say to yourself. We will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price" </seg>
<seg id="27"> "The idea is that not the price is decisive, but the expertise of the people," insisted Laporte. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> This, the consortium's Énergie gérance "approved contract is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 received from the Parti Québécois dollars. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The contracts were either approved by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> After reviewing counted the newspaper "Le Devoir" more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts, the firms or their subsidiaries, including, in particular resources, laboratories, were granted between 2002 and March 2010. </seg>
<seg id="31"> SNC-Lavalin had gathered 22 contracts per se, Genivar had received 16, 14 and Dessau Tecsult 10, without whose participation in this counted "Énergie gérance. </seg>

<seg id="3"> The Quebec consumers have little confidence among the main actors of sustainable growth, but neither to the designated brands or the eco-labels that are to control his choice. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Too bad, though it bathes in a media-universe, where information in favor of a more responsible use teeming: the barometer of responsible consumption has suffered a lack of credible information, a deficiency that makes itself recognizable as a brake of his commitment as the first reading showed that was held yesterday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Although they have advanced the use of the so-called socially responsible products in 2010, it seems that Quebecers still those who try to sell them to pay little credit. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Two thirds of the Quebec population is, in fact, give the environmental commitment of the company to as little faith as a green business advertising, tells the consumer the responsible center of the University of Sherbrooke sophisticated meter. </seg>

<seg id="8"> Following the same pattern of discourse of the politicians on the subject of only 14.6% of Quebec's population is taken seriously. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The information regarding responsible consumption seems nevertheless important to stimulate this consumer segment that is currently approaching one-third of Quebec consumers animated. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In fact dampened void and of dubious nature of the information the zeal of 46% of the consumers. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is in accordance with the higher price of the products, the second part of the barometer identified brake. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, a third of Quebecers of the specified performance of green products and services to them is to create hand ready to with mistrust. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to another communication had changed more than half of consumers in 2010 and changed their habits mainly the mark of one or more products to declare their conviction. </seg>
<seg id="14"> According barometer, they had also preferred to 61% of their purchases from distributors district and encourages the purchase of food grown in their region. </seg>

<seg id="15"> Green and responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had achieved this year 64 of the maximum value of 100 - Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling, is trying his to slow down in the environment traces left by he cares about animal welfare. </seg>
<seg id="16"> But the social and ecological consciousness nevertheless appears in front of his car to make a stop, the barometer: only 28% of Quebecers have indicated, in 2010 used public transportation or carpool prefers to have to demonstrate their ecological interest. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The new American diplomatic cables that were distributed by WikiLeaks unravel the mystery of what regard the United Nations under the inferiority complex of Canadians to the Americans, they set but with the same stroke, the feeling of superiority open the latter to Canada. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Consequently, the American diplomats were surprised that the Canadian voters in the ballot does not have the Canadian-American relations in the sense, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the Conservative government to push through their budget by 2009! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The four new releases from the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington that were disclosed to the public yesterday, offer even more piquant details as the mere substantive content to which you have to nibble. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One of 22 September 2008 dating connection, ie the period in which the federal Wahlkampage was in full swing located reported on participation at what point the United Nations, not the political leaders are discussing their missions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> To the surprise of David Wilkins, of Ottawa set up, American ambassador. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Mr. Wilkins offers several possible explanations of this situation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "Causes a Canadians almost inherent inferiority complex reasons be talking to the Canadian, political leaders much more likely to over internal disputes of everyday life, as blaming the United States in this election the buck (as in 1988 when the campaign to free trade)," he describes. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The United Nations, he concludes, are therefore "the proverbial Goliath this choice: omnipresent, but potentially dangerous to speak of him." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The ambassador understands these "deafening silence" even less so as the two countries cherish intense political and economic relations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Logically," he assessed, "should inhibit the ability of a candidate, party and much more of a party leader are essential for guiding such a relationship to the voters at the polls as a key factor in mind." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The other expression of this feeling of importance reads in the 22 to prepare January 2009 by Terry Breese, charge d'affaires in Ottawa, sent message to President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Your journey will help to ensure the survival of the government in the vote of confidence from the federal budget in early February, enter in the Canada its first deficit in more than a decade known that due to a recovery program in the height of 30 to 40 billion U.S. dollars has emerged, "says Breese. </seg>
<seg id="14"> He never had mentioned that the Government had the legislative session must adjourn before Christmas to ensure that Parliament would be overthrown by the coalition and affect the so-induced persistence of the opposition parties on the quality of the proposed recovery program would. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Another, dating from January 2008 and by the Ambassador Wilkins agreed written notice from Washington spread becoming increasingly negative image that aired on CBC dramatic series from the United States. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Ambassador is concerned about programs such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O observed in which several subtle references to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" or transfers for the purpose of by musclemen of CIA interrogations can. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Yet another release detailed reports about how Hillary Clint on her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner asked at their first bilateral meeting on whether Europe is ready to take some prisoners from Guantanamo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Mr Kouchner said to have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual "case by case" decision. </seg>
<seg id="19"> At the end of the meeting described as "he has delivered to the state secretary a paper in terms of Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim Canadian origin." </seg>
<seg id="20"> "The Secretary of State has agreed to review the file again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Finally, we note yet that things get heated with regard to the WikiLeaks Web site. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Tom Flanagan, an old and very closely consultant with Stephen Harper had said on CBC that should be the massive leak responsible for this "killed." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Global plan for the renewal of the lighting </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The UN yesterday proposed a plan in Cancun for the renewal of the lighting of households, commerce and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction of the greenhouse gas (CFC), which nearly a third of the additional reduction is equivalent to be recovered in order to stabilize the Earth's climate by 2020. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This ambitious plan takes up its position in the steps of the concrete projects, which hopes to implement the UN in Cancun, to compensate for the absence of mandatory emissions reduction commitments by developed countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> After yesterday put forward a plan would the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the avoided because of the lighting on the earth emitted CFCs, when the incandescent bulbs, which represent so far a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market by fluorescent or better yet, would be replaced by light emitting diodes (LED). </seg>
<seg id="5"> Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of smoke from the global fleet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In Copenhagen, had last year, the major gas emitters like the United States, China, Europe and others, also including Canada is obliged to voluntary reduction plans that would scale down the global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt. </seg>
<seg id="8"> From that review we would have to deduct another 5 Gt to stabilize between now and 2020 climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius to prevent this out of control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the incandescent bulbs escapes 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light. </seg>
<seg id="10"> With the compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs to reduce this energy requirement by a further two times. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The compact fluorescent bulbs hold on average between 6000 to 10.000 hours. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The new LED bulbs, such as those required by the manufacturer Philips has launched this week on the market - this company has incidentally participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy consume 25,000 hours and 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an indication of the potential savings of Auswechselungsplanes that is to be used in 100 countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Besides the fact that hese completely new light bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a rheostat. </seg>
<seg id="14"> And they contain no mercury. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Several experts have pointed out that reserves have compact fluorescent bulbs because they contain mercury and that they therefore dispose of as special needs, which is in the developing countries is not always possible, unless the producers provide a collection point for disposal. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The main source of mercury emissions to the planet, according to the report is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but the coal plants that emit much more mercury to produce the wasted by incandescent bulbs electricity. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Just in the United States experience these coal plants 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The report presents a detailed account of the profits that would generate each country thanks to this international program. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Indonesia would save, for instance a billion dollars annually for the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 means a coal-fired power plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion. </seg>

<seg id="6"> She has not dared to say whether it was thought that the central bank can do more, for example by boosting its program of purchases of government bonds. </seg>

<seg id="8"> Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB had the previous day in Brussels to mark not his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament very eloquently about shown its projects, but rather is content to point out that the program of purchases of government securities on the secondary market, "continue to operate" and that we would "be seen as failure, the decisions" at the meeting on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The only certainty: The ECB will leave its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest levels since May 2009. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In practice, the bond purchases by the Treasury by the ECB last week at about 1.35 billion euros have been doubled. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And according to indiscretions of some dealers yesterday it is to new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government bonds have made. </seg>

<seg id="17"> "I can not imagine that the ECB will amend its program to essential nature." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "Otherwise, they would run the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert suspects, an economist at Commerzbank. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> In the area of ​​its intervention on the performance of government debt, "the ECB should keep up such a volume of purchases of bonds, which revived the sluggish market," adds Norbert Braem. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the market for government debt in the euro zone, the central bank has no other choice than to maintain its presence in the market. </seg>

<seg id="18"> "At the moment there are no problems, either on short-term nor long-term view, because of Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.) lower stabilization progress will be required as other countries "observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Vindictive hackers and diligent spies </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The affair WikiLeaks has a dual meaning. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On one hand, it has turned out to be obvious scandal, a scandal that is only a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand, it announces far-reaching changes at the international level, and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But we proceed in order to. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each created by a secret file (an x-any nation) is composed entirely of newspaper clippings. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary" revelations about the sexual habits of American Berlusconi's throw from nothing more than what we got for months anyway-any x in each journal to read (other than those owned by Berlusconi), and the frightening karikaturierte Profile Gaddafi offered cabaret artists for a long time material for their skits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule that must pass the secret dossiers of known news is essential for the dynamics of the secret, and not only in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each plant (of the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosenkreuzler) exactly repeats what is already written in previous works was. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is not just the fact that the author of occult texts will not publish research (nor, therefore, that he did not know where to find news would be of the non-existent), but because those who are devoted to the occult, of anything else, as believe what they already know or confirm what they have already learned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This mechanism is also the success of Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Similarly, the secret files. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is the head of the secret (otherwise, what could also be, for example, an editor at Libération), which is only considered as true, as he acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The top-secret information about Berlusconi, who had the American Embassy in Rome sent the State Department were the same as those that Newsweek had already published the week before. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> So why such a fuss about the revelations of this dossier was made? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On one side, say it, knows what every educated person already, namely that the messages - may take at least since the Second World War and since then the Government can call each other or a plane to meet up for dinner - their diplomatic function have lost and have, with the exception of some small representation tasks, into espionage centers. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Any viewers of investigative films knows this very well and it does not happen from hypocrisy that we're supposed to ignore this. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it in public, violates the object of the hypocrisy and serves to inform the American diplomacy in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Second: The idea that an x-secret secrets of any hacker can tap into the most powerful country in the world, the significant blow against the prestige of the State bears department. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Moreover, the scandal does not so much the victims, but rather the "executioner" in distress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we are dedicated to the profound nature of what happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Formerly, to Orwell's time, you could combine all the power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwell's prophecy had since been able to turn out to be completely right, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, they make a transaction, the hotel visited, the elected highway and so on, the citizens would be the total victims of the eye of power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But if you have in mind would lead what is happening today is that even the secret crypts of power can not escape the control of a hacker, so, the control gear to be addressed on one side and circular ground. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power control every citizen, but any citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the avenger of the citizen - can bring the secrets of power in experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> How can but hold a power that is no longer able to protect their own secrets? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is true, (and be an empty secret can never be revealed) Georg Simmel said, that a real mystery is an empty secret, it is also true that any knowledge is about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel's basically a secret free of Geheimis, because it reveals the public sphere, but in the style of WikiLeaks disclose that were the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty secrets, means to deprive them of any power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> WikiLeaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, however, but Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What will be the consequences of this insult, which such an enormous power was added? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the states in the future no longer be reserved, please ask yourself - this one would come up to the street corner glued posting. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is also clear that with the current technology is vain to hope to be able to keep secret confidential reports by telephone. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is easier than finding out whether and when a president travels in an airplane and has contacted one of his colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="33"> What could be maintained in future private and only for certain ears certain relationships? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know very well that my prediction at the moment for science fiction and novel-like sounds, but I find myself compelled to imagine the government agent, is a secret way busily moving to uncontrollable roadmaps, their messages anywhere other than in the mere memory carrying with it, and moreover, the few written information they have received, in the heel hiding. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information would be stored in single copy in locked drawers in fact had the espionage trial of Watergate reported less success than WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity to write that the technology is advancing these days like a cancer, that is backwards. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionized communications, reconstructs the Internet with a telegraph (telephone) wire. </seg>
<seg id="38"> was the (analog) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers, a film scout band for band by back to front coil and all the secrets of mounting air, while allowing the (numerical) CDs now nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter , ie, in macro portions. </seg>
<seg id="39"> With the high speed trains you drive within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this requires three and a half by plane, including the interchanges hours. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It is therefore not unusual that return policy and communication technology on car and horse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> A final observation. </seg>
<seg id="42"> In earlier times, the press tried to understand what was forged in secret between the messages. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Currently, there are the messages that request confidential information from the press. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Climate: nice as France persuaded its financial promises </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to ensure compliance with the rapidly dissolved funding promise (also called "Fast Start" or early financing ") to investigate, which were realized by developing countries. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And even the French crude Beautiful shipping companies are revealed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Copenhagen agreement, developing countries have pledged to mobilize 30 billions dollars between 2010 and 2012. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (ie 420 million per year). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> At the opening of the COP16, the EU has pulled all the stops to their partners on the fact of their commitment to satisfy the fast-start lending: How detailed report of its Member States to press, great side events, brochure distribution. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The operation transparency is admirable and appreciated just for their intrinsic value: the developing countries and civil society would see it like if all the developed countries did the same on the same level of precision. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The EU announced that they have released in 2010, 2.2 billion euros, which puts them on track to Respektbezollung their commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But if one looks into detail, things are a little more complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional application was submitted without redound to the detriment of official development assistance according to the Copenhagen agreement. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional." </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the EU Commission proposed a harmonization of certain member states, including France, have blocked the process. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today everyone chooses the benchmark, which he deemed best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The EU Commission has chosen, for example as a guide for those of 2009: the international finance are maintained and are in the financing of "fast start" over three years to 150 million. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries have similar values, either with regard to year or with respect to selected conditions at the level of official development assistance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In return, France was considered that the financing "of all new projects" of 2010 were "new and additional." </seg>
<seg id="17"> In other words, there are no guidelines for expenditure of the previous year, or global levels of official development assistance. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In concrete terms, the total of the French support of developing countries remain stable (or decrease) - France pretends to respect its commitment to the "new and additional" funding. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In yet there is no rule, and each elects its calculation mode. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, such as France are, 1 borrowed € to be equivalent to € 1 donated. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Obviously, this is only difficult to argue: the trouble is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to the emission reduction projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is wrong to introduce the euro, the one recognized as the equivalent of a donated € ... Moreover, only the costs, should the loan for the investor country are counted as a commitment (ie the equivalent of an interest rate). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France has nothing different in meaning as the following consideration: it "respects" his commitment of 420 million euros, by 91.5% Loans (€ 389.8 million) receives and donates 8.5%) 36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document, in order to witness. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only EU country that uses loan to a large extent. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany calls for 46%, while pursuing Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among others) their obligations to 100% of donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union 1 € to fulfill their obligations outputs are France just 10 cents and understands a similar use. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Beautiful Hoax! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double swindle: to part with a Weiterentwicklkung of action over time and partly with the reality of financial commitment. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France manages to make believe that it had issued 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with his promise, saving 36.1 million €. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the Treasury (as it probably seems that it was Bercy, who carried out the arbitrage) could have a doubly negative effect by itself, once the EU internally (why go the other member states continue with the donation if it is enough to but ? borrow) and then in the negotiations, as developing countries can be fooled so completely ... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter of the premature funding only a small question in a relatively short time compared to the total in discussions on the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it might be too much of the drop in the vast machinery of the UNFCCC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Let us hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Whatever the reason is, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early financing. </seg>
<seg id="36"> First of France could announce a change in its Verbuchungsart for the years 2011 and 2012, and in a spirit of respect for its obligations and the corrective justice with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Above all, France would bring the discussions on the subject-matter of the long-term financing to the front (another crucial and currently debated topic): you can not escape the question of "chargeability" or Verbuchungsart its loans. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could change its position to be well advanced with regard to the issues, as it is in other things. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The hope rests on the new Environment Minister, Kosciusko-Morizet, which will arrive next week in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A surprise announcement about the Fast-Start of France and its vision of "chargeability" and the use of loans would increase by nature, the international trust that is necessary for further discussions. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A child of 10 years, takes over the day 81 different chemical substances, a this Wednesday by the Association Générations Futures (formerly the Movement for the Protection of the rights and respect of future generations) published study. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The association, which declared that their results "reflect the face of the small number of samples analyzed, no statistically significant value, but represent Illustration character of the treated problem, had between July and September, usually within four, one about ten years old child at meals consumption of foods plus a snack in the supermarkets in Paris and bought Oise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruits and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 liters of water per day - were examined as well as treats from laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The balance plate is staggering: 81 chemicals, including 42 as possibly or probably cause cancer and five classified as safe karziogen classified, as well as 37 substances with Endokrinin-disruptive, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "Even if not exceeded in the virtually all the cases, the legal limit for any chemical, individually ingested substance, one of the survey takes it very well that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to cancer-causing agents or substances with Endokrinin-disruptive is worrying, "says the association. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Already at breakfast alone contain butter and tea with milk, more than ten of the potentially cancer-causing residues and three safe proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the endocrine system. </seg>

<seg id="13"> The eventual risk of this "pollutant cocktails" for the consumer "is probably undervalued," says the study. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The "Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts" (EE-LV) has also proposed "given the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in lifestyle diseases." </seg>
