<seg id="1"> What shall she do, the CSSD? The Czech social democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor this one "café". </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new councillors of the capital from the rows of the CSSD will have to overcome obviously certain language barriers to be able to understand her old new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague council and in the city representation at all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The newspaper Aktuálne.cz has "knocked" members of the new council off from the CSSD a little once as they master the notorious slang which has become naturalized within the last few years in which today's coalition partners were at the helm in Prague. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The vocabulary coded, this one of mayor Pavel Bém was introduced by the Praguely political elite, is it borrowed for some of the most well-known protagonists, situations and affairs in the bygone era. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Surprisingly, the new councils let themselves be seen that with respect to this one these new concepts grope in the dark a little. </seg>
<seg id="6"> They claim this at least. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Who is Voldemort?" </seg>
<seg id="8"> "No idea." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am rather a newcomer in Prague politics", Lukás Kauck ý, the new councillor for culture, reacted on the test of the "godfather vocabulary". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But also the councillor Karel Brezina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar manner. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example on the concept "putting-hole". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "This is the only expression of the ones whom you present to me here which I use now and then." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "I otherwise do not think much of slang." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> From the vocabulary which the daily newspaper Aktuálne.cz had published in this year's June before the election convention of the ODS the editorial staff picked six concepts, primarily such which is put through to the Prague municipal authorities notoriously. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The concepts "Voldemort", "greatest Prague putting-hole", should "go to the café", "thick neck", "betrayal of the capital", and "flash" the social democrats define. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinerts, the future boss of the Prague school system - promised his participation in the conversation but first, did not pick the receiver up then, however. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, declined the test from the start. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "I do not care about these things and as the middle-class democrats talk under each other, I do not judge it." </seg>
<seg id="19"> He "is important to me how we get on in the context of our programmes", countered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> As indicated already, Lukás Kauck ý would not have recognized allegedly in the headline mentioned above that the talk is from the influential businessman and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The concept "Voldemort" says Kaucky nothing at all and the only concept which he correctly guessed at the test was "the greatest Prague putting-hole". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Kauck ý says "this is the tunnel Blanka", however, still added to safety reasons: "But I rather know this from the newspaper." </seg>
<seg id="23"> And jocular: "I will have to take a language course well." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The "putting-hole" then is not only decoded correctly by matador Karel Brezina but also by the councillor for enviromental issues Lukás Plach ý as a tunnel Blanka. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> However, both social democrats also know for whom the concept Voldemort stands and Lukás Plach ý suspects even, where this figure be found can and also through what means it "to go to the café"? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "I think, this means to go into any Prague restaurant ", Plach ý is rather near to this at the puzzle's solution, if one knows that this is the seat of Janouseks companies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Agreing with Brezina, however, he declares rather to have created this knowledge from the newspaper in that this vocabulary would be characteristic of him. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The test participants do not seem to give any slang naturalized similarly actually under the social democrats after to judge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I also have asked my colleagues but obviously really does not give something like that with us." </seg>
<seg id="30"> We we call us at the name, use contractions or nicknames now and then, too " ", the chairman of the Prague CSSD says to Petr Hulínský - called "Hulda" by his party members sloppily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "I was called Bríza (birch) in school but I do not know, Karel Brezina betrays his nickname to us whether my colleagues also call me so ". </seg>
<seg id="32"> The newspaper Deník Aktuálne.cz has tried out the name and see there - he works. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Councillor Weinert is friendly the "grandpa" or less kind of the "altos" for the party members, the representative Miroslav Poche who drew one's attention to himself by wheelings and dealings at the party sponsoring before the elections is called "Igrácek" (known Czech Lego figure) by some colleagues. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Nicknames are the only thing so which in the inner-party useage the social democrats allow. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Hulínský allegedly does not like it if one mentions him "to Hulda" but Deník Aktuálne.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> His nickname "doctor of rubber truncheon laws" has to do allegedly with that, that Petr Hulínský has obtained his title Doctor jurist at the Bratislaver police academy. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and published a booklet </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> As a rule, women who are labelled as witches in Burkina Faso show some common social features. </seg>
<seg id="3"> You rather belong to the older generation, they do not find work for example for physical reasons they are single and no children have. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> If one of these women "turns" witch, she is isolated strictly, the rest of the village cannot get dangerous so that she. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Men are quite seldom concerned by this destiny." </seg>
<seg id="6"> Also young and healthy women this "remains" saved since they help and give birth to children at work, a nun describes the situation which takes care of more than one hundred women who were ejected by her communities in a special home in the capital of the west African country Burkina Faso. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The local government decided "social measure" to proceed against this abnormal one now. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And a booklet which shall stop the "witch-hunt" published for this reason. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> However , there's a rub in it. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "More than 70 per cent of all adults in Burkina Faso can not read", the newspaper "the standard" pointed to the dilemma of the written enlightenment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> However, it also is to be accused of the sorcery in other African countries a matter of course. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year Ammy Hemmahová was tormented by three women and two men to death - they poured paraffin over her and simply switched her on. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The Server BBC also reported about this occurrence among others. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The perpetrators claimed, though, the thing would have been only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances. </seg>
<seg id="15"> According to your version oil which is used for ritual unctions has caught fire. </seg>
<seg id="16"> And but after the group has tried "to exorcize" "an evil spirit" from the woman. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The people here support the isolation of "witches" without consideration for her education. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "The standard" quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso to this: "In the past like today, eaters of human souls are a danger", he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> In Burkina Faso therefore the Gambian president has at least done the government his best during himself the president been involved himself properly to defuse the witch-hunt last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "President Yahya Jammeh kindled a monstrous witch-hunt after the death of his aunt since these made allegedly a contribution to the death and would try now to kill the president even by black magic also." </seg>
<seg id="21"> He exclaimed it " shaman from the near Guinea to help which women and men arrested at random in the company of policemen, soldiers and the bodyguards of the president forcibly from Gambian villages carried off and in Kanilai brought about to the farm of the president ", the organisation cited Amnesty International in her report. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The incarcerated people were forced to drink an Absud from plants with a hallucinogenic effect which, however, also caused intestines and kidney problems on the farm. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Two of the locked people did not survive the stay on the farm. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="24"> Only due to the international pressure the almost one thousand prisoners were released again. </seg>

<seg id="1"> A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the stove - nevertheless pays higher rent </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> An older stocky man just leaves the client centre of the society RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakala, the tallest private owner of rented flats in Czechia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Under the arm a briefcase with three new leases to three flats: For the own one and the flats of his daughters and his son who just serves a prison sentence. </seg>
<seg id="4"> All three just became increases the rent in the context of the so-called "deregulation". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The son shall pay 4100 crowns instead of of 3500 crowns monthly rent for a 2 room flat with kitchen of the second category next year. </seg>
<seg id="6"> "And" there is not fluently warm water in the flat and one must heat in a simple coal stove there he guesses annoyedly the new lease of the son to whose signing he has a power with the finger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> I have signed " but what - ", he explains half disgruntledly and half resigns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The citizen union BytyOKD.cz which described the new letting conditions as "incorrect and immoral" advises the tenants not to sign simply and to service until December 7th on which she intends to publish instructions the new contracts as one proceeds against such contracts. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But the man only puts off. </seg>
<seg id="10"> One says " ", this, the different one this he makes a dark face. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The region Ostrava becomes the large "deregulation laboratory" so. </seg>
<seg id="12"> After New Year this deregulation is still to come in Czechia for most rented flats whose tenants do not pay rent in conformity with the market till now. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Aktuálne.cz decided therefore to go to this "laboratory" personally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The RPG waiting room in Havírov is breaking for one of four in the region Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday full. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The bodygards of a safety agency stand and at her a call device just next to the door. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "2011 rents", a special feeling field shines on the touch screen so. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Tapped briefly and the device already spits a number piece of paper out. </seg>
<seg id="18"> We have hardly decoded the number "157" and she already cheeps on the big display at the ceiling of the waiting room. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Half a second later it is his turn. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> An older married couple enters the waiting room a little later to ask for the rent but the rush in the waiting room is not apparently for the new rent at all. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Repair applications, insurance matters are here most people to solve the usual problems - and similar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> As of the middle of November flutter the envelope with the new leases most tenants of the altogether 44.000 flats of the portfolio in the region Ostrava the RPG into the post-boxes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The RPG Byty suggests them a rent increase of approx. 15 to 38 per cent in the letters. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The special switch for the new rents in the client centre is opened since November 18th. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "The action is going on a little over a week, this means this is first the beginning " the "client" turns out, the ladies answer hesitation behind the counter after a moment, to be a journalist as himself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Former miner flats are an explosive topic the deregulation and Bakalas. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In front of the elections, the parliament vice-president Lubomír Zaorálek being from Ostrava of the CSSD had taken up this topic rather at the top of the voice, no wonder that the newspapers are full of it today. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> "For twenty years I want a new floor of them." </seg>
<seg id="29"> "She no could not replace certificate toilet glasses", the man mentioned at the beginning gives vent to himself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Up till now pensioners queue according to the employees primarily at the switch to convince oneself, whether they really receive the promised renting reduction which promises them RPG, if they sign the special supply on time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> February rent reduced one in the pleasure half being supposed to the other tenants also come, this one sign the new lease until December 15th. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Up till now "deregulation switch" is all other things than overtaxed by demands in Havírov, however. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> "About 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 only were from the yesterday's 360 clients because of here", appreciate the counter clerks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> RPG offers, and blackboards individual rental agreements both on her web pages, where it seems necessary. </seg>
<seg id="35"> If the tenant and families, however, should not agree on the new rent, she is fixed by an independent court. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> This "shall not be a threat but is understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure", explains RPG on his web pages. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> "Nobody goes here in front of court", partly one of the employees of RPG Byty thinks and a man on the street in front of the client centre gives her at least properly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> "I have 13.000 ( crowns pension), I have 5.000 left for the meal of this, where I should get the money for a court quarrel ", he thinks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The employee then gets insecure anyway. </seg>
<seg id="40"> We'll see. </seg>
<seg id="41"> "Mr Zaorálek tells their attention they shall not sign and people still wait for so over the media", draws to her. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The regulated rent ends in the largest portion of Czechia at New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty the rent increase is an economic necessity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> The existing amount of the rents "does not" suffice for the maintenance of the living fund the neglect criticized by the outraged tenants of the flat fund is just the main reason for the rent increase in opinion of the house-owners and - , argued for Pavel Klimeš, the director of the flat portfolio of the society RPG Byty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Being supposed to it be 5.2 billion within the four years from 2011 to 2014 while RPG could invest four billion in the flats from the earned rents within the years between 2005 and 2010. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Some couple of red shining information appears on the large-sized LCD display at the ceiling opposite the armchairs in the waiting room of Havírov in between times again and again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> "The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31 200 flats, this is called more than 90% of the flats of RPG." </seg>
<seg id="47"> "This always means not more than CZK 7.50 per square metre and month", has to be read on the LCD monitor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> Only for 400 flats from the portfolio of RPG the rent increases by 38 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "It is all about the rise of extremely low rents from 19,66 CZK per square metre in these cases", argues RPG. </seg>
<seg id="50"> The rent stays with 2600 flats next year on the same level. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not drive the rents by leaps and bounds in the height but is gradually carried out within four and eight years. </seg>
<seg id="52"> The enterprise imposes another obligation on himself what more - : The enterprise wants to invest all takings from the rent increase (see diagram) in the flats primarily in warmth savings into new windows and into the insulation again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> But these shall as a matter of priority people be of benefit to the ones, this one sign the agreements on the rent increase. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the enterprise Arch.Design. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But who would expect a mini-nursery school here already, what is included with everything: Colourful walls, creative furniture, a crowd's toys and even a mini-playground on the outer terrace. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> For last year this nursery school is at the employees' of Arch.Design disposal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The project planning and architectural office Arch.Design from whose studios a whole number of well-known Brno buildings is imputed of the first outlines for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for his company mini-nursery school. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Has lain that the designers and architects return as fast as possible to her job in baby boom old age and the company in a wise foresight, because most of his 90 employees are (inside). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The nursery school is another bonus which Arch.Design has to offer his employees in the concept of her fair deal, shortened together with the possibility working. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The civil engineers and architects have it so more easily to bring her demanding profession and the childcare under one roof. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> An original idea of the employees is (inside) the mini-nursery school of Arch.Design and they managed to win promoting monies of the European Union and the ministry with the support of the management for her project for work and social. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The operational mini-nursery school is financed by the operation programme humane resources and manpower policy from means of the European social fund and from the national accounts budget of the Czech Republic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Thanks to this financing (subsidies in the amount of 2, 8 m. CZK) the necessary facilities and the equipment could be obtained and for the duration of 2 years you provide qualified staff and the business. </seg>
<seg id="12"> After the exhaustion of the subsidies (2 years) the society Arch.Design is obliged to operate the mini-nursery school at the expense of its own further another 3 years. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The preparations for this project took a whole year, in which the society Economy credit rating helped actively at the application carrying out. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Qualified staff takes care a nurse of the children whole actively - and children can to a nursery school teacher, the nursery school pay a visit without age-like reservations although most of them are more than three years old. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And since it is about a mini-nursery school, only 5 children may be present simultaneously, several children take turns mutually over the day, though. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The nursery school business is, coordinated flexibly with the need of the parents this one children of all employees have the same rights with respect to the use of the nursery school without consideration for the company hierarchy and her respective position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Although it is individual education and care, the programme contents are nevertheless comparable with the framework of the pre-school education in the mini-nursery school. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The children do only not play here, excellent lessons primarily are commanded to them from basic knowledge up to the pre-school lessons they at the same time also learn English. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The classroom is not only with toys and creative games but also with a computer equipped which is at the children's disposal. </seg>

<seg id="21"> The parents can glance at the children any time and the stress is so dropped when picking up the children with a delay from a far away nursery school. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The parents therefore use her working time more productively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> No wonder that also natural and loyal employer employee relations take shape here. </seg>

<seg id="1"> A bone house fascinates also after 100 years. You have a look the interior from fun </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The roof appears like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spinal column of a dinosaur and the balconies are fish mouths torn up. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Of the local inhabitants the house got the nickname "bone house" with his organic forms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Organic forms, wild colours, the unusual use of stone, glazed tile splinters and mosaic, lines move the to façades reminding sheds and ubiquitous, typical features are all this for the Art Nouveau of Antonio Gaudi. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The façade of the house plays with wonderful lines, tender colours and textures which remind of nature and living beings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Only when looking more exactly one remarks that everything is mastered by geometry, rhythm and thought-out order. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In the night works the whole façade still more plastically, more dramatically and the special lighting still strengthens the gleam of the colours. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Forms also master the inside of the house the same sweeping lines and gobbled up. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wave-likely formed wood copies the window frames, banisters, decorating elements of doors, yes even peepholes and last. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The house Batlló in the quarter Eixample at the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia no. 43 was made from the rebuilding of a house from the year 1877 which Emilio Sala Cortese executed for architects. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Originally the investor, the prosperous industrialist Joseph Batlló, insisted on the demolition of the old and the making of a completely new building but he agreed to the idea Gaudís on an unusual and also cheaper reorganisation at long last. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The block of rented flats Casa Batlló, however, did not design Antoni Gaudí by itself. </seg>
<seg id="15"> He cooperated at this with the architect Joseph Maria Jujol. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The decorations arose just on the drawing-board for the representative flat of the real estate owner and his idea was also the use of mosaics at the façade. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> A however also numerous further creator and artist collaborated in the design of the façade. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The common work on the outlines for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fertile cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís house Casa Milá in the park Güell in which also further works are located in Antoni Gaudí. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Already shortly after his completion the house of the local inhabitants got the nickname "bone house" because of his organic forms. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In turn others called it the "yawning house" because of the special window opening mechanism. </seg>
<seg id="22"> One also says the sword of Saint Georg, the patron saint is represented by Catalonia on the building right at the top. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But also further sculptural elements symbolize hidden religious motives. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Gaudí designed a central heating system unique for the time then for the house with venting channels and typical fireplaces. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Her 45 degree inclination already appears a little bizarre. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> In the field of his work Gaudí ignored consistently all construction specifications then and let himself be put off by these not at all. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before start of building he caught up of the town with the corresponding planning and building permission but the details made by him on the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers were so horrified of the result at the completion two years later, that they required remedy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Among other things the councillors also disapproved of it, that the making even intruded on the public pavement with his pillars. </seg>
<seg id="29"> To changes it did not come quite the reverse any more, though, Joseph Batlló made an application to the approval of the letting out of the two most situated stories of the house only fifteen days after the request of the district regarding this, and she was assigned to him promptly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The house-owner himself moved into the lower floors. </seg>
<seg id="31"> A society parlour was located in the gallery in the 2nd floor, the bedrooms and private rooms of the flat were located in the third floor. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The ground floor was leased to a jeweller's shop. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The complete six-storied building passes through stairs to the housetop terrace to up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> By the fundamental elements of the reorganisation became all right angles and straight lines removes and by turned and swung walls replaces. </seg>
<seg id="35"> However, Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of rooms. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The social part can be connected completely by opening the drawing-room doors and a larger society could talk comfortably so without having to do without a certain intimacy during more confidential conversations. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1"> The right mattress and the right bedding down grid? Women have other wishes than men </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Not the most terrific bed framework but the quality of the mattress area mattress and grid therefore agree on the good bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> These must complete themselves harmoniously, though, to do justice to the wishes of the concrete user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In the choice many things play a role, the weight, the size, the state of health and not least also the sex of the sleeper. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The interior in which mattress and grid have to subordinate themselves is also just as important. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> Latex mattresses are not suitable well in a weekend house in which you do not regularly have the heating on, since they need much longer to "get warm". </seg>
<seg id="8"> Furthermore they are considerably heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> They should be turned regularly and. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If they do not have enough little venting channels in the core and are to this on a solid plate still namely, humidity dams himself: So it is not ruled out that mould forms under her. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the election of course also plays a role, to what one is used. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Abroad who was for some time where very high mattresses are usual with soft stratum will a low mattress get used with a hard surface heavily on be able to. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "All ice-hockey players which has come back from the NHL have welfare complained that they can sleep no longer correctly here to me." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "They simply need a soft shift for her toiled shoulders, heels and hips from Visco foam (memory Foam - a shape memory polymer)." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "Among other things I recommend these to also diabetic people who suffers from a disturbance of the nervous system so that they can receive the "information" badly from the joints and the skin", Sylva Hadamcziková explains which specializes in upholstered furniture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Therefore I have already got many ice-hockey players but also other customer these mattresses with Visco foam (memory Foam) years ago. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "This is no more problem today because the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico offers such mattresses among others." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And one does not certainly have to be a famous ice-hockey player to learn to appreciate the advantages of the Visco foam. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" very simply works actually. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The foam optimalises his hardness and form according to the absorbed warmth, different said, he nestles up really at the warm body. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It pushes nowhere, in the night one does not roll around like after a heavy fight. </seg>
<seg id="22"> One simply sleeps much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Furthermore the viscoelastic foam also offers protection from decubitus (gangrene). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> One still should add the length of the soles of the foot to the height in the election of the mattress size that is approx. 21 to 34 cm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> These about 180 cm are big, need such a 210 to 220 cm long bed man like woman. </seg>
<seg id="26"> At least 90 cm of couch breadth should together that is 180 cm be at each's of the sleepers disposal. </seg>
<seg id="27"> 120 to 140 cm are appropriate at single beds for example at singles. </seg>
<seg id="28"> On account of the comfort and also for possible visitors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The following rule of thumb otherwise applies to the ideal bed breadth: "Enough room still should, if one lies on the back, be for the arms bent easily", advises engineer Helena Prokopová, the guild master of the upholsterers and interior decorators who devotes herself to the difficulties of the healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture already for years and reports this topic also on technical colleges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Everybody needs a grid of his own and his own mattress, however, pay attention at the purchase at a double bed, so that the mattresses are also just as high. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Nothing else otherwise is left but to put the cooking surfaces together in different height and this is not possible at every bed framework by far. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Foam mattresses at least three centimetres should be at least 14 cm highly, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, of this should be allotted to the form stratum and the fine cushion. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "One may feel the feathers by no means with the hand or when putting down", warns Helena Prokopová. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Every mattress requires a special grid type. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Whole upholstered beds with mattress and pad like Siam twins grown together have to look for nothing in the bedroom. </seg>
<seg id="36"> These mattresses can not be let some air in and one can not wash the reference, today, what already a matter of course is. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The mattress after five to seven years and one loses, is clear there in one single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat that becomes slow to a gigantic one (and stopped sieve up). </seg>
<seg id="38"> Also because of this experts decline advertising slogans, of promise up to 25 years, yes even lifelong guarantee this one at mattresses a life time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Every thing has her ifs and buts. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And therefore a practical council of the dealers: One should not shun the hygiene of the washable, deductible income at mattresses of 120 or 140 cm of breadth, recommends himself nevertheless to use a mattress cover which one can easily remove and wash. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The manipulation often appears even if, today, mattress income is established with all around zip-fastener, as a rule, so that one gets after opening two halves (immensely important to the washing process and the washing machine size)!, with bigger mattresses like the dissimilar fight between David and Goliath, executed primarily alone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a rust? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Out so that! </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or at the most for a bed for unloved guests and for one single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They should provide the plate with cooling holes rather, (provided that none already are into this), and use mattresses with feather skeleton and 15 cm of minimum altitude with so-called bag inner-spring and fine cushion also so. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a pad. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable for not adjustable gratings with 14 to 18 spring contact strips (lamellae) (if necessary also combinations of latex and coconut), grids always pay off with a larger slat number therefore of 28 and more spring contact strips with lumbar support in the lumbar vertebrae region and the possibility, regulating the slat hardness. </seg>
<seg id="48"> No mattresses belong on adjustable lamellar grids with feather skeleton since they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Besides the attitude of the stiffness of the spring contact strips also special flexible shoulder modules are demanded. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Goes around a special fastening of the spring contact strips which makes it possible to press in the spring contact strips or to wind really so that they make possible sinking in selectively for the shoulder of the sleeper. </seg>
<seg id="51"> By name for men with broad shoulders an important thing. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use soft zones for the shoulder area at "sir mattresses." </seg>
<seg id="53"> Also the ladies are thought, one is glad for them to have these soft zones in the hip area. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> Point elastic wing feather systems (Lattoflex) or grills are intended for most demanding customers with point elastic contact pads with a so-called multi-torsion springing. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure is distributed on several points, through what the tension is reduced. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> To the right one one a bad (too great and corpulent) pillow uses mattress and right grid, most advantages are lost again but if. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Also here a rule of thumb: The pillow shall support the head, his tops only should reach the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Ideally a 50 x 60 therefore appears to cm of a big cushion, like it the Scandinavians for example like. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In the side position the pillow should compensate for the shoulder height (together with the shoulder relief zone in the grid or the soft zone in the mattress). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Our modern mattresses have got with the former palliasses (filled) hay commonly have something anyway. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern manufacturers always more frequently use natural materials or at least their additions. </seg>
<seg id="62"> The new magic word "biol" is called also at mattresses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of mineral oil raw materials one always more frequently uses temperaments oils - for example castor-oil and soya oil for the production of polyurethane foams. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soya is used by all well-known manufacturers well. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> Biol is ", said her core consists of materials of purely natural origin Petr Vašícek of the company Tropico explains plus this ", at mattresses. </seg>
<seg id="66"> However, natural substances are - the first used also at the production of mattress income one aloe was Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> However, one also can allow himself microcapsules which spread a fresh woods or lavender smell when sleeping. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> One makes a difference between man and woman also here. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While with the men one "refrigerant" plant extract from birch newspapers is used so that the mattress earnings can absorb the warmth and cool the body down, the income has "warming" effect for women. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Extracts from red peppers activate the blood circulation, so the weakerer sex gets warm when sleeping pleasantly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> And today's favourites? </seg>
<seg id="72"> Mattresses from cold foam he (has bigger pores with a destroyed cell structure and therefore is more breathable than customary polyurethane and also many more flexibly). </seg>
<seg id="73"> Increase zone mattresses which exactly know are made from the combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and Visco foams, where head, hip and heels are. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> For a high-quality mattress one has to pay 7000 crowns and more, though. </seg>
<seg id="75"> However, health mattresses are charged usually by a less value added tax since they are regarded as medical aids. </seg>
<seg id="76"> As the first Czech enterprise this advantage was granted to Gumotex. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> One sees, it is so easy not to economize at the mattress and at the grid. </seg>
<seg id="78"> There are special offers of manufacturers and dealers now and then who offer two mattresses at a price of one. </seg>
<seg id="79"> So the brand Magniflex offers the mattress Duofreeze with Visco foam memory turned into desert in the purchase for 11.990 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="80"> One gets the second to it freely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the material Tempur which started the era of the viscoelastic foam materials with open cell structure and high density in almost cosmic tempo. </seg>
<seg id="82"> They were not developed for NASA anyway any miracle, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the starts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83"> Tempur gets soft in warmth, in turn it hardens in a cool environment. </seg>
<seg id="84"> So it adapts to the human body perfectly and distributes the body printing in an optimal way. </seg>
<seg id="85"> It therefore is not only ideal for the prevention of pressure fire but increases the sleeping convenience generally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86"> However, viscoelastic foam materials will be supposed to provide the legs and the vessels of relief with it, not used only at mattresses but also at other health products such as at special foot cushions. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Local manufacturers use for example the foam materials Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The worry about the children of one's own grows and more and more parents consider so to supervise her by GPS. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The system which originally was invented for the search for cars can just as well locate to people namely, what would be helpful also in such cases like recently at the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anika Janatková without trace. </seg>
<seg id="4"> At present, the device is approximately as big as a cigarette box but already soon it might not be bigger than a watch. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The case has given many people to disappeared Anika in fear and frights and they think the lookout to means and ways to protect her children so better. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Also for the price of an impairment of her privacy. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Petr Pilin leads "we do our best to tell everyone that it is under no circumstances about snooping about but to reduce the probability around an effective means that it comes to the tragedy" of the society Macro because on, one of the suppliers of GPS locating units on the Czech market. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> "I admit that it can come to the abuse of such an equipment in the individual case for example if one tells it to somebody into the bag without him knowing but we did not have to record such a case till now." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "Most customers really buy it for themselves for safety reasons", Pilin adds to. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In his opinion, however, the child should always know which purpose the "box" serves and how one if necessary uses her. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The child psychologist Dana Bocková points, however, that a child, if it does not like to carry such a thing, it simply rids itself of him. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "Also very little children show a great creativity if it is all about to lose certain things deliberately, if they do not want to be checked." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Already at first great expectations woke the mobile telephones among the parents but let her switch themselves off just as easily like these new monitors", thinks Mrs Bocková. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> In your opinion is also controversial, whether such a facilities actually help in the case of an attack? </seg>
<seg id="15"> "At planned kidnappings the kidnapper always checks practically, whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located to with it." </seg>
<seg id="16"> "It is the mobile telephone today." </seg>
<seg id="17"> "If such monitors were more broadly used, they also would look for these, since her sale would for certain be accompanied by heavy advertising." </seg>
<seg id="18"> The criminals are " always ahead of the police the psychologist thinks a step ahead ", in these cases. </seg>
<seg id="19"> You fills, however, that a similar equipment can absolutely be helpful at a sudden attack by a pedophile. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Which offers locating services both for motorcars and for persons, the existence of such a device then can help, too if it is immediately after the attack destroyed according to Roberta Cech of the society RC monitoring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> "The device can be adjusted namely so that it reports the respective position in certain intervals." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "Even if it would be immediately destroyed the last position of the person concerned is at least available." </seg>
<seg id="23"> "Even an inclinometer is integrated at a more expensive equipment, this means if one falls down and is left motionlessly the device immediately sends a warning under detail of the position ", Mr Cech claims. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In his opinion similar services could carry out also intelligent mobile telephones with navigation, one needs to play in only a special software. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The problem of the present locating units consists in the fact that either it is in matchbox size about equipment either which resembles pendants or around smaller mobile telephones. </seg>
<seg id="26"> There is always the danger so that one loses her. </seg>
<seg id="27"> One therefore tests equipment Mr Pilin of the Macro in the presence which looks like normal digital watches because according to. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> "This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognize at all, that it is a supervision or locating unit. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The army has so many fuses that could one wrap round whole Czechia think you, however, for only two years </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Czech army has bought 445 kilometres of fuses, explosive devices are detonated. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Before, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometres of fuse to the army camps in the year. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is already calming down to know that the defense forces have from worried for 225 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The problem is - only the durability of the fuses two, at the most but four years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The army bought the fuses of the public limited company STV Group, a. p. for silly 40 million crowns. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In his grounds for the purchase of this enormous lot of fuse the general staff answered MF DNES the soldiers would use up about 60 kilometres of fuse every year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Which asked MF DNES about it, goes out from this detail from all generals and officers of the army command up to the secretaries and cleaning ladies that the whole army must complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic education annually according to the enquiries of army pyrotechnists. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Not excepted for Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondra and army general Vlastimil Picek. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of fuses could be justified partly only in such a way. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This length corresponds by the way to 25.000 explosions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> This army inventory would suffice for more than ten year but also so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> If the old rule of experts is, however, still valid that two metres of fuse suffice for the training of every new professional soldier completely, then the army has herself for created the 225 years already mentioned by these new purchases - stock calming one also under the point of view of the increased need of the sapper and special squads. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Soldiers of the fast use brigade complained to the Minister of Defence Vondra recently, they would have almost no more cartridges for handguns so that shooting practices are limited strongly because of the missing means. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Completely being silent of the pant defect. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "Why I not understand, she of us buy such vast amounts fuses either?" </seg>
<seg id="17"> But this is her decision at long last, they already will know what they need her for." </seg>
<seg id="18"> For us the army is ", the we as dealers extensive contrary to liked to come ", a good customer the sales manager says to STV Group Jan Decký. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Spokesman of the Ministry of Defence accounts with that for the purchase one hundred kilometre fuse Jan Pejšek, this one, this one army would have stocked up on this "ammunition" so at least for ten years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Jan Decký of STV Group only speaks, however, about a four-year time of use of the fuses and police and army pyrotechnist really only of two years. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Storage is well possibly " at perfect ", also the four mentioned years one of them which, however, wants to remain unnamed to be not accused of the criticism of the army as a soldier fills. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After expiry of the time of use must any ammunition be tested thoroughly, whether she is still reliable and does this not endanger lives of the soldiers? </seg>
<seg id="23"> These tests, however, are legitimately but cost further money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Further argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometres of fuse. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "You cost us sixty per cent less as the last year's delivery of 244 kilometres", speaker Pejšek informs us about the point of view of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Only for comparison purposes: The annual consumption of fuses of pyrotechnists of the police which liquidate ammunition from the second World War or the Soviet brother army exceeds hardly any 1.500 metre already for some years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> And the police always order only such amounts of this ammunition which still can consume her before expiry of the time of use. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Spare because of the safety of the pyrotechnists, in addition, one keeps the possibility for flexible purchases of more modern and therefore also reliable fuses open so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The Ministry of Defence has anyway gigantic problems at the liquidation ten thousand tons ammunition from times of the Warsaw contract when the Czechoslovakian People's Army of two hundred thousand prepared for her campaign to the Rhine. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Which mentioned MF DNES according to the pyrotechnists, the same problem at the liquidation of one hundred kilometre old fuses which she has bought so "favourably" today expects the Czech defense forces within a couple of years. </seg>

<seg id="6"> "I can say that this appreciation encourages only me myself but also all my employees and has not confirmed our self-confidence in the fight with the competition", says last year's winner. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At the beginning of the company history of Farmet stood the effort, something to do useful. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And when the state of his father Karel Ždárský then offered a small workshop as a compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists to the lease he did not hesitate for a long time, let his career in the company he till there busy was employed which buzzes and a company of one's own was based with a couple of comrades of his father to the production of plastic baths. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And the most difficult year was straight 2009 for the sale of tool engineering products. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The crisis which still less shook the citizens but primarily enterprise at that time just reached her highlight - many companies were forced to adjust her capital subjects and to limit the purchase of new facilities and technologies. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Of course we could not escape this situation either." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "The sales declined by 40 per cent, we had to limit the production and even to reach for dismissals", declares Karel Ždárský </seg>
<seg id="19"> A viable enterprise must take up also such unpopular measures from time to time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> However, it turned out well to get a grip on the situation and to keep the company in the black numbers even if with smaller profits than before the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The enterprise was not willing at one in investments in the research and development to make end strokes. </seg>
<seg id="22"> "From the subsidy we built a research and training centre, we confirmed our presentation at international fairs and purchased first prizes at home exhibitions", says Ždárský. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Everything shows it, that we have overcome the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The sales wax again and with them the number of new employees, too. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="17"> Lubos G. already had contacts too good in the past to the Plzen floor fund. </seg>
<seg id="18"> So he played Václav Sankota who was followed criminally because he returned properties into substitute restitutions to which location decisions had already been made to building schemes a role also in the Causa of the former boss of the floor fund. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Longer, men are the forefinger, as the ring finger, obviously a lower risk is exposed to falling ill with prostate gland cancer. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This is the surprising result of a study which was published by the British Journal of Cancer on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This shall be connected with the mirror of the male hormone testosterone namely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The co-author of the study, rose eles, declared lady professor at the cancer research institute at university in Warwick " show our results, that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate gland cancer and this by name with men to sixty ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The finger could help to determine which men should certainly take a prostate gland cancer test primarily so, genetic risks or other risk factors are available such as family physical loads if Mrs Eeles added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> She followed more than 1500 patients with prostate gland cancer, at the same time 3000 healthy men with her colleagues in Britannia in the period of 1994-2009, however, too. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The forefinger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger at more than the half of the participants of the study. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The same probability of prostate gland cancer whose ring and forefinger were equally long like for 19 per cent of the men applied to these men. </seg>
<seg id="10"> With men whose forefinger was longer than the ring finger this risk sank, however, by 33 per cent with men to sixty even by 87 per cent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Obviously the relationship of the length of the both mentioned fingers which form already in the prenatal age reflects the different mirrors of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Less testosterone corresponds to a longer forefinger. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Earlier researches showed that definitely the testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate gland cancer. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="14"> Leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the academy of sciences, this study is, CTK said, briefly known to him, till now, Václav Paces, he nevertheless does not keep the relationship for "proved completely" between the finger length and the risk of cancer. </seg>

<seg id="10"> The manufacturer of ice-cream machines has set up the ice university in the year 2003 so that the ice cream does justice to the high Italian ideals out of his machines everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The three-day elementary course for future Gelatieri has the biggest draw and visitors from all the world. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, there are also several days of special courses around the chocolate ice-cream and traineeships in the ice-cream parlour of his own. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Some dream in the midlife crisis of a new career others simply venture on the smooth ice of her vague longings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> There are 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents of Brazil via Hungary to Saudi Arabia this time. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Jacky, art-teacher from California, loves the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial intercity express train cream in future. </seg>

<seg id="17"> Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice-cream parlour in Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in her bars, and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Maestro Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream next to the participants. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Only good taste but also the silky suppleness is not decisive and consistency the good. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, Luciano does not forget the cream topping of the national and at all southern superstructure at his training either: "Italian Gelato is simply the best, and any amount is then still Romanticism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first step towards the production seems very simple. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Luciano dumps the basic ingredients milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and antiroll bars into a great mixer which heats everything up to 85 degrees and then immediately cools down on four degrees with an electronic programme. </seg>
<seg id="24"> He then turns the machine a tap, and a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all milk ice cream types, comes out. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The assistant professor is immediately bombarded with questions: Can one make ice cream only with natural substances without antiroll bar? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How can one let the experimenting desire's of one's own free run? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Luciano warns to have himself led astray of the Zeitgeist. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" has nevertheless used antiroll bars possibly - most natural product, approximately guar gum from the Guarbohne. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Loud little ice pellets of course one can produce ice also without antiroll bar, it then must be sold within a day only, otherwise it sinks into himself together and the customer bites on. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Certain variations at the matrix are permitted. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It gets more thrilling with the flavours. </seg>
<seg id="32"> For the taste in the ice maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients which one buys in the fruit department or at the sweets of the supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Moreover, gives there are powder and pasta. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "All the suppliers will try to palm dozens of aromatized additions off on you." </seg>
<seg id="35"> "But simply you should experiment." </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits either. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Or just at the ice cream from the white matrix which becomes the yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder to the basis for all possible chocolate seductions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The students may to the ice-cream machines now. </seg>
<seg id="39"> She lets Luciano produce four different types each of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice-cream with or without eggs in the matrix with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural additions. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The fruit sundae types are also subjected to the same experiment. </seg>
<seg id="41"> More flavors, more fruit purée, as regards taste this is not better absolutely. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Hazelnut ice-cream does not taste nuttier absolutely if it contains more hazelnuts. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The most popular kiwi ice restores the working group to health who uses more fruits, less water and a little less antiroll bar. </seg>
<seg id="44"> A balanced mixture stresses the taste of a Gelato correctly first, says Luciano. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Ice making is a sum: If peach purée is used with much sugar, the sugar amount must be reduced in the basic recipe. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For lemon ice-cream an extra portion of sugar is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano draws a device out, with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit types (winegrowers measure the degrees Oechsle in the grape juice with that). </seg>
<seg id="48"> Tables the calculation fortunately make easier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> It requires physical use to make ice no longer as much as in the past. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Not only the device for the automatic production of the matrix helps. </seg>
<seg id="51"> There also is a device in which the ready ice mixture is beaten creamily and cooled on minus temperatures at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Small breakdowns do not fail to appear Aller automation to this despite. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The Brazilian Gustavo spills from above to below fruit purée over themselves and his course colleagues when the colossal staff blender turns out for him out of control. </seg>
<seg id="54"> "Maestro Luciano thinks, in every course ", " it is only a question of time until something like that happens." </seg>

<seg id="24"> The industry tries to influence or to discredit scientists in this field like in the USA in Europe always more, critical now, too. </seg>
<seg id="25"> There therefore are hardly any researchers who are not interwoven with groups. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The story is known: The excavators had advanced in September and had started to stop a large piece of the north grand piano. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The same was not the Stuttgart world any more: Demonstrated against S21, the lowering of the station worth a few billion, tens of thousands. </seg>
<seg id="8"> When it came to the building freeze, a large part of the grand piano lay in ruins. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Broken in 6000, 7000 piece. </seg>
<seg id="10"> A Crailsheim Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, between 1914 and 1920 obstructed. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The trace of the Stuttgart stones leads to a former ammunition depot of the French army where Manuel Rongen has set up his stone empire to woods at Tuebingen. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The 44-year-old trades in old stones. </seg>
<seg id="22"> He has bought everyone whom attacked at the demolition in Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "It would be a disgrace, they would be ground to gravel or in the dump disappear", he says in his office, a wood hut which was once a little guardhouse. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="2"> There is an active crowd at the Buffet. </seg>
<seg id="3"> 16 students crowd around salmon roll, tomato soup and sweet. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The technical University of Brunswick and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In a kind of competition of ideas they shall talk shop over the car of the future, and get to know Volkswagen quite at the same time together with VW developers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In the competition around the cleverest heads many enterprises go in the close combat meanwhile and back cooperations with the universities like VW. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Your mission: Recruiting the most talented graduates in the lecture rooms as early as possible before they come onto the labour market and are courted of other. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And because the universities do not return any lists about the performances of her students, one tries the exception talents in practice projects to espy and at himself to bind. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> On the second day of the workshop at the TU Brunswick the car manufacturing group solicits the talents. </seg>
<seg id="10"> A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens, jellybaby and briefcases with VW logo. </seg>
<seg id="11"> She tells to the hopeful young talents of traineeship programmes and student jobs and shows them ways to the group open. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="12"> Nico Selle of the TU Brunswick looks after the project with VW. </seg>
<seg id="13"> He sees the advantages for the two sides: "The students get in contact to the industry and gain experience." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "VW can get to know students simultaneously, looks at interesting candidates more nearly and wonders who would be considered as employee." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Such cooperations, are not unusual, so Selle. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It is that the students are wooed um so offensively new. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Otherwise the main emphasis rather was on the technical project", says Selle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The fight for the graduated freshly probably will get even harder. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The enterprises cannot choose her employees from a large crowd of applicants in many lines of business any more. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But they must extol themselves and perform the courtship display particularly around highly qualified workers. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Primarily graduates from the engineer disciplines are at it in an excellent negotiating position. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Engineers VDI stayed sound with the association of Germans over 40.000 engineer places unoccupiedly in October. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And the so-called engineer gap will get even bigger according to the VDI forecasts. </seg>

<seg id="42"> "It is just very hard to fill vacant positions." </seg>
<seg id="43"> "This takes a lot of the time and money", she says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Longer way is the contact over the university professors. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Solarworld cooperates with different universities, approximately the university in Freiberg. </seg>
<seg id="46"> "The professors give indications that one can make traineeships or write his master thesis with us." </seg>
<seg id="47"> Expensive advertising campaigns are not planned with the solar specialist. </seg>

<seg id="49"> "A large combine often cannot offer this", says personnel manager Stübe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> Money does not play the leading role in the job hunting any more. </seg>

<seg id="52"> Solarworld ranked 55th at a study of the Great Place to Work institute among the 100 best employers of Germany. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> There will not be any new oil drillings within the next years off the coast of the U.S. federal state Florida in the golf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="3"> A corresponding ban has passed the government in Washington, and revoked her earlier plans definitely with that. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Also in front of the eastern seaboard new drillings remain forbidden for the time being. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This informed Home Secretary Ken Salazar on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Trigger for the strict ban which shall be at least valid for the next five years is the explosion of the drilling rig "Deepwater Horizon" in April. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This the life cost and led to the greatest ecological disaster of the USA, president Barack Obama had signalled his readiness on pressure of the opposition and the industry to allow new drillings in the eastern part of the golf of Mexico before the accident, eleven workers. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The supporters want to reduce the dependence of the USA of oil supplies from abroad with that. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> To this day, who takes the responsibility for the devastating oil pollution in the golf is not cleared in conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The British energy group BP which is confronted with billion demands is in the centre of the criticism. </seg>
<seg id="11"> An investigating committee on behalf of Obama shall present her results in the course of December. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Home Secretary Ken Salazar had lifted the drilling stop imposed after the explosion in October. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Different oil companies had immediately made applications for new drilling plans in the connection. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> With sharper controls and more severe safety regulations Obama and Salazar want to exclude a recent catastrophe. </seg>
<seg id="15"> At present, the responsible control authority which had got after numerous corruption reproaches in disrepute is reformed basically. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In parallel, Obama has announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas groups. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The industry warns publicly now that the capacity in the golf would turn out considerably lower than till now by a stricter regulation. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The water in the rivers is ölbraun, it smells like at the filling station: Billions litres of crude oil run out have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The people live on theft, corruption and illegal Ölkochen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Celestine Akpobari means it well. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Do not be troubled the environmental activist calms the journalists " as of ": "Today, you still will get enough sludge in front of the lentil." </seg>
<seg id="6"> The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed up the attempt to photograph a boy wading up to the chest in the water with the striations surrounding him: In the rainbow-coloured water gleam the scene seems almost pretty. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It can be not seen that brown crude oil clouds float under the surface. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> She in the past has in bucketfuls collected prawns here, Esther Badom says on the bank of the Bodo-Jetty river. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The sluggish running waters are completely bleak by now. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Five years ago vast amounts crude oil flowed from a burst pipe into the gigantic wetland. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Fishermen from this near situated small towns Bodo must paddle now six hours to reach waters containing fish: The Ogoniland lain in the heart of the Niger delta is regarded as one of the regions of the world polluted worst. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> On the journey by the mangrove marshes run through by courses of a river the whole extent of the devastation gets conspicuous. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The motorboat stirs brown broth up, place who dips his hand into the water, pulls oily fingers out bright water. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The roots of the little mangroves rise like black liquorice bars from the ground sadly, palms to be found have her fly whisks occasionally hung. </seg>
<seg id="15"> As otherwise they are usual in wetlands one searches in vain swarms of birds: As soon as the outboard motor is silent, ghostly quiet spreads herself in the earlier paradise smelling like a filling station. </seg>
<seg id="16"> "What happens here an ecological warfare is", Celestine Akpobari says darkly: "We live in permanent danger for the health." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The war comparison is appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The housing area of the Ogoni is a battlefield disputed for decades: Here the first discoverers penetrated more ago than 60 years from Europe, the first resistance organized himself with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa executed later here in the eighties, here the Shell group 1993 had to discontinue his production because it got too dangerous for the oil workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The return is refused to the enterprise to Ogoniland certainly today: The oil fields are fallowly, too unstably located in the Ogoniland the situation is for the group while more than two million barrel of the black gold are pumped out by the triple size of Switzerland with over 5000 drilling sources and 7000 kilometres of pipes daily from the complete delta region. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Steel racks like bizarre sculptures rise all couple of one hundred metres from the water: "Little Christmas trees" become far too tenderly the heads of the drill holes called. </seg>
<seg id="21"> You are corroded to the core up to 50 year oldly, the usually one. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Akpobari thinks such a drill chuck breaks from each other again and again, a constant current crude oil then runs into the water. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> More than two billion litre have flowed after expert estimates into the ecosystem of the delta within 50 years: How at the accident of the super tanker "Exxon Valdez" into the sea she insisted year for year the lot oil - one the greatest ecological disasters in the history of mankind 21 years ago in front of Alaska. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Who for the continuous environmental district responsibly be made can, about this is argued? </seg>
<seg id="25"> While the Shell group is holding the pollution sabotage and the oil theft organized responsible for more than 90 per cent, environmentalists consider bursting drill chucks and leaky pipelines main causes. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Shell lays out considerably lower standards of security in Nigeria as or else in the world usual, the U.S. scientist Richard Steiner reproached the group 2008: Alone the instalment of defects at the pipes is " around a multiple higher than elsewhere ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Shapes appear from the mangroves at a place which looks like a deserted, oil-smeared workshop under a free sky from the distance: You are stark-nakedly and up to the neck oil-smeared. </seg>
<seg id="28"> A fire flickers under one of the many barrels which can be agreed with tubes scattered connectedly, partly arbitrarily on the area partly: An illegal little refinery. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Michael, the boss of the group, explains the crude oil is heated up over the fire in the barrel for several hours. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Petrol penetrates through the pipes into the on-catch pot first, drips kerosene and finally diesels out later at the end of the line. </seg>
<seg id="31"> So Michael and four employees produce litres up to four barrels of diesel at 300 each daily: This earns us 34.000 Naira one " - about 22 dollars ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The delta residents use the chronic fuel scarcity in the largest mineral oil state of Black Africa. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Nigeria only has one single refinery at its disposal. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This one still be able to the illegal cookers undercut with almost 40 eurocents per litre of ridiculously low diesel price: Because they get her raw material for free. </seg>
<seg id="35"> He is from "bunker ships" which tap the pipeline net straight through Ogoniland: This way be lost to the country at least 16 million litre of crude oil lost daily according to the experts in the complete Niger delta. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Only an insignificantly small portion of the raw material stored provisionally is refined illegally, though: Organized criminal networks fill the lion's share, to which and high-profile also politician shall belong, into tankers armed force and get rid of him on the world market. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The debate rather haunted this one, whether the ecological disaster is owed to the population or the lax production way, the activist regards Akpobari as pure academically. </seg>
<seg id="38"> "The petroleum companies would not be perceived as intruders and they would not have destroyed the basic living conditions of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be sabotage still theft and illegal refineries." </seg>
<seg id="39"> The relationship of the Ogoni is destroyed primarily so meanwhile, however, to Shell that only a discount of the group would be possible: "Perhaps yes other nationalities like the Chinese than better prove." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Michael gets nervous there. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The muscular Ölmann says " high time, that you disappear ". </seg>
<seg id="42"> "The soldiers can come every minute." </seg>
<seg id="43"> Although if the illegal oil refiners of the special squad of the defense forces are caught, no arrest, well but a painful bribe, threatens them. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The soldiers principally being from the country north also want to profit from the raw material like all Nigerians. </seg>
<seg id="45"> "These damned things have taken our country to the dog in every regard", says Akpobari. </seg>

<seg id="5"> The winter freezes Germany: The whole republic is almost snow-covered at icy temperatures in the night to the Thursday, what in many places leads to chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Partial 15 centimetres of thick coverings of snow are in the north and in the east. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The traffic is strongly restricted in several motorways and many streets. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The winter road clearance was in the continuous use on the A7 near Flensburg, did not get ready with the snow on permanently blowing newly, however. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Almost two weeks ago it had come to an intense explosion near the city of Greymouth into the pike's River mine. </seg>
<seg id="5"> 29 miners at the age between 17 and 62 years were buried alive below day. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> A probe had been drained to to the accident shaft, however, had not discovered any trace of survivors. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Due to the high concentration of poisonous gasses and further following explosions no rescue workers to dosshouses could for safety reasons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the second intense explosion the authorities and experts had assumed that there is no more chance of survival for the mates. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Till now, the corpses could not be recovered. </seg>

<seg id="1"> To the hell, warrior! </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Does splatter match the art cinema? </seg>
<seg id="3"> The director Nicolas Winding Refn plumbs old genre limits newly with his fighter epic poem "valhalla Rising". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> To which audience may the Danish director have commemorated Nicolas Winding Refn when he has turned "valhalla Rising"? </seg>
<seg id="5"> A captured Viking warrior with only an eye (Mads Mikkelsen) escapes from his torturers and puts on his opponents with almost superhuman strengths in rows, sounds ideal for young male spectators on the search for a bloody action just because our hero likes to make use of violent killing methods and tears the intestines for his enemies from the live body, if he has spleen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On the other hand one eye says what he is called actual, the whole film about no word, and the other figures let themselves be carried away to one or two sentences or a couple of painful death cries at the most, too. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Otherwise they are being silent and indulging oneself in the horrifyingly beautiful hilly country of Scotland which offers the scenery to the Viking world of about one thousand years ago. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Ideal rather for adult cineastes with interest for existentialism and very quiet tracking shot. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> When a film has several target groups, only harm beautifully, if they exclude each other. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Director Winding Refn is regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy "pusher", however, refuses stoically to make the mainstream or a little less brutality his works approachable to the type House in a little more good humour. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Most art cinema friends might let themselves be deterred of the brain mass splashing around and the intestines. </seg>
<seg id="12"> At the latest, the action fans die then before boredom if one eye breaks ship open to Jerusalem and pins an eternity into calm and fog for freely interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via before the team arrives in America and is further silent there apparently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> No miracle therefore, that "valhalla Rising" has not found any cinema rental company and has appeared only on DVD now in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is a misery particularly because of the splendid pictures but this also has merited attention a little because a piece of cinema irritating now and then hides behind the pretentious till bloody façade. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In this film it is not all about dialogs or a stringent action, it is all film become atmosphere, one feverish dream. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> And from this there is no escape for the spectator. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Refn which is him faced from the hearts of the figures is glad for him to have hardly a moment of the diversion and ties up him the throat with his icy pictures and the dark trance like soundtrack quite slowly, primarily but with the incomprehensible hate. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Only a little fair-haired boy one eye faithfully aside suits which, keep something like innocence, all others are driven by anger. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Himself the one-eyed hero, his motives are never explained, however, this one is to the warrior from the hell for enemies and temporarily allies sometime possibly at the one most of all to the ambassador of the devil. </seg>
<seg id="20"> He means ruin perhaps but also for the anyway bad only ones. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="1"> Mysterious excavation </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The atomic energy authority IAEA has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the country defends itself, to take position as it, it still allows controls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At least four Israeli F 15 I fighter planes attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria toward midnight from 5th until September 6th, 2007. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is at the bank of the Euphrat; the next larger town, 30 kilometres removed, is Dair ace Saur. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Your name appears in documents of the international atomic energy authority (IAEA) if it is about the reactor alleged with the help the Syria has built in the cuboid from North Korea, hides in a valley which comes off the current. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing of the U.S. foreign secret service CIA of the end of April 2008 this one also would have been suitable well under the name reactor familiar to the near village of tbsp Kibar to produce plutonium, nuclear weapons could be built from this. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes however technology hardly is good from the fifties. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA demonstrated a business video with blurred satellite pictures. </seg>
<seg id="10"> She displayed by computer animation, where which components of the reactor have been in front of the destruction shall, the one is reduced copy of the North Korean model from the atom centre Yongbyon. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Moreover, she presented photos, the interior which shows the building from the proximity or cooked. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It was said the reactor has stood shortly before the putting into operation but still not with fuel rods equippedly been. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today hardly more is known more than three year after the bombardment than at that time, the puzzles got rather bigger with the time. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The former U.S. president George W. Bush has revealed in his memoirs recently, it was sure that although the CIA rakes herself before the attack, however, hardly clues saw that there was "an active nuclear weapon programme" in the country that Syria in tbsp Kibar built a reactor. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some secret service agents in Europe are kind even more careful there and only speak about an "alleged reactor" even if they keep the CIA presentation to "plausible". </seg>
<seg id="16"> You lack a hard proof just like the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Asked how he assure a high UN diplomat answered summers only succinct, the IAEA in this it was to have a reactor in front of himself enough material has ", to guarantee around questions ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Syrians misappropriated the rubble of the alleged "unused armed forces building" quickly and levelled the area thoroughly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Nevertheless found an IAEA team in June 2008 under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in tbsp Kibar traces of uranium which had been produced by people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Moreover, the IAEA got satellite pictures of commercial suppliers about a member state directly after the attack, from the time which might be more meaningful than the one of the CIA presented. </seg>
<seg id="21"> These photos cannot be got on the market because the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - has bought her exclusively, though. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The IAEA cannot verify her genuineness therefore independently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always declared to have operated a secret nuclear programme or built a reactor never. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Damascus explained the uranium is from the Israeli weapons. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But this rejected the IAEA after analysis of the particles as improbable. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Damascus refuses to discuss it - just like about the satellite pictures since then. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Moreover, it refuses the inspectors a second inspection in tbsp Kibar and the entry to the ruins of the bombed-out building. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Israel is but also ironly silent. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We will never comment on it", the premier being in office in the time of the attack, Ehud Olmert, confirmed the official position recently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> So the examination of the case has dragged itself without result to since June 2008 and "develops into a grave reliability problem increasingly for the authority" as a high western diplomat grants the IAEA at the seat in Vienna, a difficult violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty finally is in the room the IAEA watches over. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As a key for progress in the enlightenment the IAEA still sees apparently another three facilities which shall be "in a functional connection" with the presumed reactor and different from it existing. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Neither the inspectors have disclosed till now nor which plants it is, which function they have or what she seem suspicious makes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to information of the Süddeutsche Zeitung they are described internally as Marj ace sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived from near situated towns in turn, at the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="34"> International Security in Washington (Isis) which it in all probability is one of the suspicious objects has identified these places and found a building complex on satellite pictures at Masyaf the independent institutes for Science and. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It possibly is in or immediately next to a military base - with these grounds Syria exactly refuses the IAEA the access to the three places. </seg>
<seg id="36"> It is said in Vienna the Syrians were afraid of a fishing expedition - that the IAEA is sent forward by the USA to //späh// armed forces plants. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Because the nuclear private investigators had got aware of the facilities by a tip of the U.S. secret services. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has indications, among this satellite photographs, that material was transported to and fro between the three places and the cuboid at the Euphrat. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A high western diplomat in Vienna said one of the plants could at least stand "in connection with the fuel production". </seg>
<seg id="40"> However, there are "no indications of sensitive activities", that is uranium enrichment or reprocessing; Processes which are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Although the reactor type is operated with uranium which is not enriched. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The uranium would have been supposed to come here and where the plutonium should be divided off for the bomb from this later, for these central questions there are if need be plausible assumptions but where. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> Whether ruins which could hold valuable traces were stored at the three places is also unclear. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As if the hundreds of truck loads of the ground had disappeared, nobody wants to have information about it, where the rubble has remained. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The only few kilometres of tbsp Kibar on the other side of the Euphrat situated salt mine al-Tibni which has examined Syria 1998 for her suitability as a store for radioactive rubbish is for the IAEA as improbable. </seg>
<seg id="46"> She had the former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley brought Intelligence review to Jane in an analysis of satellite pictures for the renowned magazine with the reactor in union recently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> However, photos from the orbit show that Syria carried out excavation and removed big containers at places suspicious to three, after the IAEA had required entrance. </seg>
<seg id="48"> This can be chance, however, has hardly contributed to dispel the suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Moreover, it is called in diplomat circles, has put the IAEA into this for quite a number of months which should permit Syria, develop a plan for inspections there, to keep possible armed forces secrets, alone the effort shows how big the interest of the inspectors is. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Damascus ironed this suggestion meanwhile, too. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> High urgency had the thing therefore has no western diplomats in Vienna still a year ago appeased, the reactor is destroyed, U.S. ambassador Glyn Davies has approximately taken so-called special inspections to the game, one of the toughest means which has the Viennese state nuclear authority for a couple of months to succeed with controls. </seg>
<seg id="52"> IAEA boss Yukiya Amano who must suggest these inspections already has spoken about "an option which I am straight in the future", he still hesitates, however. </seg>
<seg id="53"> A high risk lies in this way: On the one hand, it needs a majority for it in the governor council of the IAEA and quite a lot of 35 represented there are countries anything but keenly on an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other hand, how a diplomat points out: "What is if they find nothing at all at the end?" </seg>

<seg id="1"> Love in times of the war </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Since Angelina Jolie has started with the work on her still nameless debut as a director in summer, there is trouble. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The film script has written her herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man. </seg>
<seg id="4"> One much more does not know about this, this suffices already for unrest, however. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The rumour obstinately persists, the woman, a muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavia war. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Bosnian women's associations have immediately protested whereupon some days of shooting planned in Sarajevo were transferred to Hungary at short notice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The film is changed course in Hungary and in the post production meanwhile but it is still protested about in Bosnia. </seg>
<seg id="8"> A Bosnian newspaper has reported now Bakira Hasecic of the organisation of female war victims wrote UNHCR to Jolie about the UN refugee relief organization and required a meeting with the actress, Jolie is itself an ambassador of the UN refugee relief organization. </seg>
<seg id="9"> She diplomatically is not, she has offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago before which these, however, declined. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The meeting must take place, so Hasecic, in Bosnia. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Has love stories into rape camps not given it and betrays Jolie's attitude to her opposite the victims over the film script enough. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Your organisation has recommended according to the UN refugee relief organization dismissing Jolie as an ambassador reports to Guardian. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> What exactly has written for Jolie for scenes, however? </seg>
<seg id="14"> A trick approval has assigned the Bosnian Ministry of Education and the Arts which got to read her film script back and forth for Sarajevo after some, it is not quite clear why Jolie did not nevertheless come then. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The young author herself declares she does not pursue any political intentions with her film, has got used to the Yugoslavia conflict with much effort, wants to show the terrible results of the war and give a voice to all sides involved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> She stays with the contents vaguely, though. </seg>
<seg id="17"> So a second Synopsis for the film in the net which then sounds rather different anyway still circulates: The loving had met in this already in front of outbreak of war and meet again when she, a Bosnian muslim, is protracted into a Serbian camp in which he works as a guard duty. </seg>
<seg id="18"> What substantially different does sound of course "rape victim falls itself for torturer" as the variant? </seg>
<seg id="19"> That Jolie's film actually starts already before the war, so much is sure. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The pressure on her, is "unfair and been based on misinformations", so Jolie. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The hackers of Hollywood can well only provide her with peace now: The film script by she, put into the net before, illegally as already so many. </seg>

<seg id="42"> It goes on to Hanover or Berlin to the next project in January. </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1"> The democratic routine </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The democracy movement in Latin America gets stronger like the support of private enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Crime is a greater problem than unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The influence of Brazil is greater than that one of the United States in many parts of the region. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Latinobarómetro survey which was carried out in 18 countries and published in The Economist exclusively arrived at these conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This survey is regularly carried out since 1995 and shows the change of opinion in this region so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two facts fall eye particularly into it in this year's survey of the September and October. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Firstly the good atmosphere in Latin America </seg>
<seg id="9"> and secondly the growing interest in democracy and her most important institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> (P. table 1) has gained in the democratic movement strongly in numerous countries at the South American pacific coast. </seg>
<seg id="11"> E.g. where the economy grows by approx. 6% since 2002 every year the number of the democracy supporters increased from 40% in the year 2005 to 61% this year in Peru. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Such a trend can be recognized also in Mexico where the economy recovers since the strong drop last year again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The half of the people asked is convinced democrats in Mexico and Brazil, the population richest countries of the region, what lowers the regional average (p. diagram 2) only? </seg>
<seg id="14"> Approx. 44% of the people asked explained that she be satisfied with the democratic practice of her country. These are so many like last year, however 25% more than in the year 2001 ( diagram 3). </seg>
<seg id="15"> About 34% trust the convention of her country and 45% of her government. Both values correspond to those of the last year, however, 2003 (17 % or 24% show a clear increase opposite). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> A decade ago Latin America's economic crises undermined the efforts around more democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Also this during the world economic crisis lasted, is due to it possibly that the countries of Latin America this experienced only a short one recession phase and have recovered fast again. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Furthermore the poor were caught by a stronger social net. </seg>
<seg id="19"> (According to the reports of the UN economic committee for Lateinamerika of this week the poverty instalment rose only insignificantly in Latin America in 2009 and has fallen by 32% this year again.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But there are strong atmosphere differences (p. diagram 4) of country to country. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Silva is reflected for presidents Luiz Inácio Lula Brazil's strong economy and the popularity the dividing in a common progress intellect there. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The case is this few in Mexico and Central America where the recession more strongly was noticeable and crimes of violence have increased. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Only for the second time since the survey beginning, in the crime, in Latin America, in her country, many people asked see a greater problem than in unemployment (p. diagram 5). </seg>
<seg id="24"> Either she herself or a member of the family last year victims of a crime became say approx. 31%, that. But opposite 38% last year the values have dropped and therefore reach the lowest level since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and the market economy: Approx. 71% of the people asked supraregionally said that the private industry is indispensable for the development, in the year 2007 it was 56% (p. diagram 6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> Approx. 58% explained that only the market economy can bring her country progress, compared with 47% last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> 62% of the people asked have interestingly enough kept this view in Venezuela (and are 80% for a private industry) although her left president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private enterprises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The greatest has 19% of the people asked (18% last year) Brazil loudly weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year). </seg>
<seg id="29"> The people asked in Mexico and most countries of Central America, however, see in the USA the most influential country, in which this role is taken on by Venezuela in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Nobody had expected the elections to want to be perfect in Haiti on November 28th. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But the facts surpassed the fears of the polling officers who hurried for the shaken country for the help by far. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Overcrowded ballot boxes, votes cast repeatedly, polling cards were only a part of the problems in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidations. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Polling stations opened with a delay lasting several hours. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Many Haitians from whom many had got homeless by the earthquake in January roamed on the search for a choice around. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Some finally completely gave up. </seg>
<seg id="8"> A dozen candidates for the presidency under this reconcile presumed leaders, required the abolition of the election results due to an alleged deceit. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It came to partly violent protests in the whole country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Edmond Mulet, the leader of the UN mission in Haiti, nevertheless described the election as quite good "in many interests". </seg>
<seg id="11"> According to a careful statement of observers of the organisation of American States and of The Caribbean Community these irregularities "do not" make trial invalid necessarily as seriously as they may be also. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Into other word, The show Goes on. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The election authority which allegedly is obliged to the unpopular departing president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the temporary results on December 7th. </seg>

<seg id="16"> The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former roof ridge Lady Girlande Manigat have withdrawn her initial invalidity complaint. </seg>
<seg id="17"> If Jude Célestin who meets with the electors' only little or not the slightest approval explained to the final ballot by the election authority to the winner, this could lead to problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 m. of the earthquake victims still live in tents a low poll was feared. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Many Haitians were prevented from the voting by lacking organisation on the election day. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Identity cards which are needed to the election were not distributed approx. 250.000 yet shortly before start of pulsing. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Much is at stake. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Secret to the middle </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Within the weeks after the sudden death of your husband Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, learned a wave from liking which drove her popularity instalment around 20 points on over 50% up. This is the highest value since her election in the year 2007. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Whether this helps her to get a re-election, however, next year depends on it, Cristina Fernández is willing to compromise than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner whether this one obviously mourning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The signs for it are not clear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Néstor Kirchner who steered the economic policy also after the election of his wife frequently built budgets which fully did not take into account the inland revenue receipts, the economic growth and the inflation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This permitted the president couple to spend the extra takings after a discretion of his own. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Fernández government lost the majority on the paper in the convention last year. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is and sexton split death after a heart attack on October 27th led to further disagreements. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some critics of the regime from the rows of the ruling peronists went and stood behind Cristina Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But the convention did not manage after chaotic meetings (during which a parliamentarian beat another into the face and others accused the government of the bribery) to say goodbye to the household for 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I will not discuss it", so the president. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The household 2010 is necessary to spend money after a discretion of its own now for the next year through which the president has still more opportunity, too. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy runs hot: She probably will grow this year by up to 9%. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official rate of inflation is 11.1% at present, but numerous private valuations and wage claims of the trade unions drive the value on almost 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner who assumed the office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises explained the inflation reduction to growth and poverty alleviation to his primary objectives and not. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He refused the cooperation with the IMF, the national institute for statistics and national census INDEC which embellished the official inflation statistics after that harassed the private sector and cleaned. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Can Fernández take a more moderate way now? </seg>
<seg id="18"> She has called upon the private industry and the trade union leaders for conversations. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And according to official statements increases in pay shall be limited next year on 18%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Argentina's agricultural products have the high world market prices given the economy a strong impetus. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the inflation undermined the growth push by a great devaluation in the year 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Cristina Fernández would possibly like to attach Argentina to the rest of the world for this reason financial world economically again. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The government reached an agreement with bond-holders at the beginning of this year which had declined the earlier funding of the country in the year 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> These seem now to press Fernández on an agreement with the sponsors from the Paris club, her approx. $ 6.7 bn owes. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The sexton had always declined a check by the IMF as elsewhere usual. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But the Minister of Trade and Commerce Amado Boudou announced last month that the fund will do a national cost-of-living consumer price index "technical support" at the construction of a new. It looks as if this were the first step towards the cleaning of the INDEC. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active also without the support by her husband after completion of her period of office. </seg>
<seg id="28"> She needs the support of the middle shift which has for the most part of the Kirchnerism enough if yes, to this. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the Argentines return from her summer holiday in March, the wave of the sympathy which was shown for her will have faded away. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If she liked to win another election, she must make up her mind, whether she cancels many political decisions of her husband quietly and quietly. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Weak applause for China </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Taiwan's electors approach slowly a closer connection to the mainland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> What does Taiwan think of his big brother on the other side of the strait? </seg>
<seg id="4"> On November 27th more than 7.5 m. made electors to themselves, these are 70% of all persons entitled to vote open to vote for mayors and town councils in the five municipal districts. This is judged to be a broad assessment of the president Ma Ying-jeou. </seg>
<seg id="5"> By the construction of pioneering business relations, incl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma is itself a symbol figure for the relations to the mainland. His policy has changed the relations to the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949 lastingly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Ma has passed the examination, however only scarce. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) puts mayors for three of five, she did not get any majority of votes. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The democratic progressive party (DPP), the one greater independence of Taiwan approved, almost 50% of the votes, which got KMT got 45% instead. </seg>
<seg id="9"> At a presidential election this would have meant problems for Ma. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Since his election two years ago the percentage of votes of his party has fallen by approx. 8%. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For the first time the DPP moved in to the town councils even together with KMT. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> During the choice it came usual occurrences like lorry convoys with rowdies, mass moves and flags swinging over only scantily dressed dancers, to this one in Taiwan. </seg>
<seg id="13"> There was even the obligatory, mysterious murder attempt. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman held KMT a speech on a KMT candidate on the evening before of the election, </seg>
<seg id="15"> when a man shot in his face from the crowd. Lien was wounded and an overleaf spectator killed. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the marksman wanted to kill Lien or settle a quarrel with the candidate. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The attack has independently of it impaired the election according to the Tsai Ing-wen, the leader the DPP, and moved the DPP in a bad light which has granted KMT more votes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> China was possibly the tallest winner of the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The relations to the mainland remarkably did not become picks out as a central theme. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The candidates over plans to council flats and the job creation debated instead. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The Taiwaneses love her actual independence and decline China's armed forces threat. </seg>
<seg id="22"> For this reason KMT does not like to put her relations to the government in Beijing to the foreground. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But the DPP avoided this time, too, stirring the anti Chinese feelings up too much. </seg>
<seg id="24"> She reacted thus anew consciousness, that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Ma would for his part like to be able to to confirm that the majority of the Taiwaneses approves his China policy. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Furthermore the government in Beijing will pursue his strategy, to lure back Taiwan with economic incentives to the community. </seg>
<seg id="27"> China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit meeting for investment safety and medical cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="28"> It surely also wishes a political integration. First but the important one. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It thus prefers to wait to after the presidential elections in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The DPP has invented himself newly by now. </seg>
<seg id="31"> She was weakened strongly two years ago: The former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison because of corruption. </seg>
<seg id="32"> During his presidency from 2000 to 2008 he stood up vehemently for the absolute independence. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But a new generation of moderate politicians developed under Tai's reign and the DPP fights for the voices of the working persons and the youth. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Tsai met with a great approval, like Su Tseng-chang under Chen, as a candidate for the presidency the DPP. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Your party does everything now to show that also she is able to build up close relations to Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Tsai plans a think tank as a contact point between the DPP and China. This presupposes however unprejudiced discussions. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Tsai explained publicly that her party offers a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas of rash approach towards China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Chen seems very annoyed about this change. </seg>
<seg id="39"> He explained from his cell the candidates would have done to this to the DPP better to insist on Taiwan's independence. </seg>
<seg id="40"> He even asked the pragmatist Su to do without the presidency candidature. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Also without Chen's interference the DPP has difficulties hardly to vote for her possible candidate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> KMT will have to undergo a self-analysis of her own. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Ma's values are bad despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to conduct her election campaign without him. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the still further scissors between the poor and the rich. </seg>
<seg id="45"> According to the statement of a KMT speaker he will alter his cabinet as well as the local facilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan approves a rapprochement only restrictedly. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Most Taiwaneses consider the economic cooperation with China unavoidable at the same time. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In view of the fact that Spalding is already one celebrated star in the jazz scene in 2008 since her album "Esperanza" the nomination seems a little unusual. But she corresponds to the Grammy rules according to which an artist may have returned not more than three albums before publication of the album with which he was confessed in the broad public. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Your ambitious album from the year 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is surely a step forwards. And with her elated voice and a good feeling for pop, radio and Latin Music one can compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003 safely whose great success comes as a jazz interpreter in this category of the nomination of Spalding most nearly in the year 2003. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Furthermore the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer trio was nominated in the category's instrumental albs. This darling of the critics experienced a smash hit through this. </seg>

<seg id="9"> The Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue got large group of well rightful attention in the category. He therefore competes with the Billy Childs ensemble with his chamber jazz and the Dave Holland fond of adventure and his octet whose Life album "Pathways" is a good example of a bass player as a democratic band leader. </seg>

<seg id="1"> An arsenic resistant microbe could make new life-forms possible on the earth or elsewhere </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The discovery of a strange bacterium type which can live among others on arsenic opens up new possibilities on the earth and elsewhere for new life-forms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on the earth, it is a sign in her opinion that a life is possible also without the elements considered to be essential till now. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "This organism has two possibilities." </seg>
<seg id="5"> "He needs either phosphorus or arsenic for growing." </seg>
<seg id="6"> This completely makes it to special something ", although it almost a type is 'strange' life-form ", of the Arizona State University and co. author of the report which appears to the magazine Science in the online version on Thursday Paul C.W. Davies declared. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Six main elements were regarded as essential till now, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> But as these found out scientists the bacterium grows mono brine in the Californian also then still further, if it replaces phosphorus by arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The co. author of the report told Ariel D. Anbar of the Arizona State University "one wonders anyway there otherwise what is still possible". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is an important step at the search for extraterrestrial life, so Anbar, since scientists must recognize lives and his forms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study deals with microbes which were found on the earth. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Reason for far common speculations announced a press conference in which no details on the discovery were announced that the report of the discovery of extraterrestrial life could act in the Internet the announcement. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery shows that organisms can put biochemical processes into walk in other planetary systems with the help of other elements " explained space Sciences research institutes of the open university of Milton Keynes to Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and in the United Kingdom and that the 'standard elements' which is absolutely essential in our opinion are not firmly predefined absolutely ". </seg>
<seg id="15"> Base was not part of the research team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "A novelty is this work because she shows that an element can be replaced by a different one in basic biochemical processes and structures", Cockell added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> This discovery was not coincidental. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The mono brine chose Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the astro-biological institute NASA which conducted the study due to the large arsenic content. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Arsenic and phosphorus chemically are, there himself she assumed that microbes which is exposed to both can replace an element possibly by the different one. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "The toxicity of the arsenic is primarily based on the fact that it behaves chemically similarly as phosphorus." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "Through this it is difficult for the organisms to distinguish an element of the other." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "But the difference is so big that arsenic seems different than phosphorus. It reaches our biochemical system where it smears everything virtually ", Anbar explains. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers exposed the bacterium to GFAJ 1 of an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Although the microbe grows in phosphorus better, anyway that she can survive also into arsenic, shows either on the earth or on either another planet or moon on which arsenic happens more frequent that of course an arsenic based life-form can happen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> According to the Jamie S. Foster, lecturer in microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new. There was no operating example but till now yet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Arsenic happened more frequent within the early earth years, she says, therefore science has assumed that early life-forms have used it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> This admits reason so Forster, this one ", that life can have developed also differently than in the early geological era ", not a member of Wolfe Simons assumed research team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The research was supported by NASA, the department of energy and the national health authorities. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> In accordance with the statements of the Thursday the plan fulfils the requirements of the U.S. bankrupt law so that the restart of MGM under the management of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass entertainment, nothing more in the way stands. Barber and Birnbaum will preside to the studio as a managing director slimmed down a little. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For MGM Chapter 11 actually becomes effective only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned loan of $ 500 m. for the financing of the new MGM productions. </seg>
<seg id="7"> A syndicate of the investment bank which brings in $ 75 m. itself is conducting the enterprise at the moment. The financing shall stand by the middle of December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In May 2009, the restructuring of the studio started to help at the solution of her financial problems with the order to Investmentbank Moelis & Co, the management who fought with payments of interest in the amount of $ 300 m./year. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In August became the managing director Harry Sloan by Stephen Cooper replaced, a former CEO at Enron and a restructuring expert who was confessed by his activity at Krispy cream doughnuts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The efforts of Moelis & Cooper, the finance worries about solving MGMs and paying this one out more than 140 Gläuber of the studio, lasted longer than expected. </seg>
<seg id="11"> After discussions of some months the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the enterprise for sale. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But the auction attracted only few bidders and no-one wanted to pay bn the $ 2 demanded by the creditors. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Everything of the front as which MGM team started with the restructuring plan after debates of some months and internal disputes which was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October started these in spring year. </seg>

<seg id="5"> I recently went to 80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, one Toys "R" U.S. and a BJ Wholesale club - on the search for three electronic toys below $. </seg>
<seg id="6"> I immediately got clear that Moore's law had become effective. This year the technology toys are more efficient and cost a little less simultaneously than last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> And although less new toys with a web page of their own appear, a broader supply is found on the best known of this type, Webkinz and club Penguin. </seg>

<seg id="10"> (If not indicated differently, all prices of Toys "R" U.S. are.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Singing a-Ma jigs (Mattel, $ 13 for children as of 3 years) are as greatly as guinea pigs which sing a note plush figures, if one pushes on her belly. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Corresponds to a note, by pushing repeatedly can play a song one once push. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Several singing a-Ma jigs sing into harmony. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Caution: If you have begun with pushing once, you cannot stop any more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The best choice a combination out confessed and dance is the Dance star for Mickey (Fisher-Price $ 60 for children as of 2) for. </seg>
<seg id="16"> On basis of Elmo developed last year Live-Technologie the animatronic doll offers interplays as tumble 'Simon says' and she masters thanks to the new hinge feet with wheel blocking for Moon. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="20"> If you did not like to entrust your Smartphone to your child, three independent alternatives are here. </seg>
<seg id="21"> MobiGo of VTech ($ 60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most userfriendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard.

<seg id="22"> None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> a system uses iXL of Fisher-Price ($ 90 for children from 3 to 7) for the games and eBooks like iTunes and thanks to the SD card disk drive family photos also can be looked at on this. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> There in the end still is scrabble flash ($ 30 of Hasbro for children as of 8). The five blocks are not larger than a matchbox and have a LED screen of their own. </seg>
<seg id="25"> At the game it is all about to fold the blocks to words before the time passes. It is excellently suitable for an improvised spelling bee. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Public prosecutor will not accuse senator Ensign </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Public prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have acquitted senator John Ensign of the accusations, these to his Affaire with a former election campaign helper and his attempt to provide her husband with a lobbying of members of parliament were lifted up against him, announced the advocates of the senator on Wednesday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This decision concludes the most difficult on the right reproach against senator Ensign, the republican from Nevada. Which nationwidely headlines provided and a silencer gave to his career, he was regarded as a possible candidate for the presidency of the republicans for 2012 until the scandal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As senator Ensigns announced office, he was "highly pleased" with the verdict after the one-year examination. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The ethic committee of the senate still could, however, impose a punishment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to statement of Ensigns advocates they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the examinations were stopped against senator Ensign and that in this matter no further charges are available. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The verdict was a surprise for many ethic advocates outside the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion there was an adequate proof that Ensign has disregarded the lobbying ban. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Interviews, e-mails and other documents which was disclosed in the New York Times for the first time in October 2009, admitted reason for the assumption that helped Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his polling officers, to get lucrative orders to pay for his silence about an Affaire with Hampton's wife Cynthia. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Cynthia Hampton was workingly as treasurer Ensigns during an election campaign. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Ensign made contact to some political friends to provide Hampton with work. According to the documents and interrogations he took on lobby work for her after Hampton's employment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Since Hampton recently still was in Ensigns election team was he was not allowed to take on lobby work for his former employer or the entire senate for one year. </seg>
<seg id="13"> According to the statement of ethic experts the unusual agreement violated between Ensign and Hampton who were close against the so-called ban on the revolving door lobbycracy in front of the Affaire. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> In accordance with the published circumstantial evidence "it is an arrangement and the violation of the revolving door statutes by all appearance", so Stanley Brand, a Washington advocate which has specialized in the defence of clients who are in the visor of the government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The reasons for the decision in the Ensign case public prosecutor which was pursued by the media with great interest, told Mr. Brand and other ethic advocates the ministry seemed very carefully in taking political charges after a variety of defeats, including the decision last year announce Stevens because of misconduct the fall while the Ministry of Justice said no officially, the charges against the former senator Ted, on the part of to drop. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Melanie Sloan, the chairwoman of the union, told obviously public prosecutors are "easily startled" (to "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" an organisation, her aim the fighting corruption is the USA in parliament and governmental circles this one), a group of lawyers which has brought different charges against Mr. Ensign ahead of court. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "In principle, this means that government officials of high standing can assume now, she added that the laws do not apply to her ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Paul Coggins, leader for the defence of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview he had a telephone call of a public prosecutor got and another day next the on Monday in which that the ministry will not take any proceedings against his client was informed about him. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with the public prosecutors to convince her that the senator has "sold the law in agreement" as his office repeated in an explanation on Wednesday once more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr. Coggins declined to explain the legal arguments more exactly which he had put forward opposite the public prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "I am not into the bargain well to go into the conversation details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much is said: We think to have taken the right decision ", he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The federal electoral commission has decided to stop the inquiries because of a separate complaint last month by the ethic group after which the Hampton has expelled a payment of $ 96,000 from Mr. Ensigns parents against the federal electoral act. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The electoral commission said there has not been enough proof that something else than a present has been the money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The long time supported the senator, NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign was. </seg>
<seg id="25"> An e-mail from December 2008 covered, that, when lobbyist has advanced, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a discussion had with Mr. Hampton in which he informed him that he "knocks" for the Home Office because of a thing after the company Mr. Hampton. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Mr. Ensign in addition had an appointment with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to agree on a meeting in the name of the airline company, after Hampton had taken on this Mr. for the purpose of lobby work. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> When information about this affair penetrated into the public last year for the first time, Mr. Ensign excuses himself with his electors and his position gave up in the senate, where he had been at fourth place in the ranking of the republicans. </seg>
<seg id="28"> After he had not stood out many months any more Mr. Ensign told reporters, two weeks ago which strives in the senate for a third period of office stories. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> His press agent, Jennifer Cooper who hopes for senator, explained that the ethic commission follows the example of the Ministry of Justice and very fast stops his inquiries in the announcement, that Mr. Ensign no more be the aim of police investigations. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada", she said. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Cheshire vocation draws one's attention on twitter attentively </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Half a dozen typed himself of them in the riots in the courtroom away. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Her reports on horrible testimonies sent her out about twitter in the minute interval. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Gave this end, so the defence more than 140.000 twittering reports to over the process around rape and children bound to beds in a house which went up in flames. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Thursday the process pursued attentively will find an official end of Steven J. Hayes which was accused to have three members killed a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, if the judgement falls about the death sentence which has said the jury. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Applications already have Mr. Hayes Anwälte submitted to court, which explain reasons for a vocation and which will employ the courts until years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This one is one of the most provocative reasons that by average reporters - has come to a "circus atmosphere" and such a far common, immediate penetration of rabble-rousing details so that the jury has been influenced by the public indignation in an inadmissible way - it twitter of also by the extensive use - by the intensive reporting about the process. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This objection could induce the appellation courts to deal with the question, whether the new technologies let new rules become necessary in the courtroom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I have experienced it like me during this process, think that it is really a danger, Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes Hauptverteidiger, said if the move of the new technologies influences the right of every individual to a fair process into the courtroom ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The chairman judge, Jon C. Blue of the colonel Supreme Court, rejected the applications by decision laconically last week when he said that the new media would be "carefully checked", and that there would be no proof of it, that the jury has been driven of passions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But this was not the last word in this thing certainly yet. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For decades court objections have noticed that the reporting lets doubt about the fairness of a process arise about famous notorious cases. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In his historical decision of 1966 the supreme court of justice of the United States has the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who shall have killed his wife, lifted, and said in his decision that there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some think that the television series and the feature film is based on this crime "on the flight". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some lawyers say court objections, which Mr. look at Hayes Verurteilung half a century later, could around the communication channels from the courtroom follow the argument that new rules have become necessary, these in the time of the case Dr. Sheppard were still inconceivable to regulate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "There is a good reason to be worried about the influence of the new media in processes which are pursued by a broad public", said John J. Donohue III, professor at the Stanford Law School who has examined the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report she is imposed arbitrarily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor Donohue said some appellation courts could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of an immediate communication out of the courtroom could make trials fairer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Only one is the twittering matter of many which explain the lawyers of Mr. to Hayes to discuss for years and one therefore delay Verurteilung. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defenders also claim for example that Mr. Hayes could already have been in front of sentenced when judge had not permitted them Blue to test the reactions of potential jurors, by one showing them horrible scene of the crime photos during the juror choice. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some of the jurors have said, photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and her daughter, Hayley, 17 years and Michaela would have fulfilled her with disgust for 11 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defenders say they also would question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution and argue that the judge has exchanged a juror wrongly which has been a critic of the public prosecutor's office and that he would more inadmissibly have performed way pressure on the verdict when he had taken the not usual decision to put the jury freely over the weekend. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The jurors were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But perhaps the greatest interest draws her arguments about the influence of the detailed reporting about the process on itself. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Has this one submitted her in a verdict contestation last month, stated her that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and lasting the election campaign was discussed by the candidates for the office of the governor and for the American senate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> You argued that the new media would have kindled the flames of the emotions about the case continuously newly. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "The lawyers wrote, ", " such a daily crowd the medium bleepers cameras and reporter outside the courtroom one has not experienced even nationwidely in New Haven and perhaps before yet yet." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Your main emphasis on the reporting through twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In interviews some journalists said that the assertion this direct news is more seditious than reports which is reported more slowly, a technophobic look, is this one the reporting becomes impoverished about future processes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> But some lawyers said appellation courts would be often confronted with the argument, social and technical changes bedürften of the adaptation by the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr. Hayers lawyers make this assertion grow. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In her objection they referred, in which to the decision of the colonel court of justice of 1966 the Verurteilung of Dr. Sheppard was lifted due to the reporting and made clear, that the new media require new rules. </seg>
<seg id="32"> "They wrote, ", " so this case Sheppard performs official duties toward Maxwell of the 21st century." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Can politeness do this dividing connect? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> After a campaign at swearwords and negativism this week little politeness has broken out in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Is it the omen of a real cooperation between two parties or a moment of the illusion, before one returns fast again to the fight of the parties in the capital? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The meeting on Tuesday between president Obama and tops of the convention did not bring about any breakthrough lame in the great questions one himself duck session the meeting at the end of a government period in which no more decisions are taken, with which during the so-called " ", to employ had. </seg>
<seg id="5"> All this what one hears, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor an attention of her split to rule over responsibility after, but one rather empties episode of a biassed point collection. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meeting of the deficit commission of the president on Wednesday was likewise civilized despite the political differences which there furthermore are between the members. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It the ideological ravine seems to be clear that a narrow interaction over a period of months lets a mutual respect arise, furthermore to it the members of each other this one separate veiledly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> This is hardly enough to claim it has opened a new era of the cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Both sides are in a test stage now - in this one the one of the other sign of the cooperation and willingness to compromise calls in while one is trying to weigh up the bounds of the public opinion and the patience of the electors after a renewed party warfare himself. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Were therefore the meeting itself on Tuesday and to demands or accusations his assessment by the participants open limits a minimum. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the republicans are too big and too deep in that one could expect a fast change of the atmosphere which prevailed within the last two years. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is about taxes, donations, health or candidacies, the two sides are for miles and miles remote from each other identical whether. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The November election has in the end Washington for short time at least mild voted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> No question, the intonation have changed " " which works, Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, said, for the "Ethics and PUBLIC Policy centre" now. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "This is unavoidable after elections. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elections arouse biassed passions which die again. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And this is so well." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> This one duck session " lame " in some questions particularly in these, this one on the agenda, stand, have hardly another election republicans and democrats but to find a solution." </seg>
<seg id="19"> Bushs tax reductions end at the end of the year and nobody approves this. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides claim to find a way, around some or even everyone to gets, it to be temporary or durable now. </seg>
<seg id="21"> A compromise has as well to be expected regarding the increased unemployment benefit, if also only lasting because the republicans cannot afford it that one thinks these favoured tax reductions for the rich they refuse unemployed workers a support. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House the optimism has increased, that in these questions during this one " one duck session " reach an agreement himself and lame can ratify the new start contract also. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The Brookings institution warns but a successful cooperation in urgent questions of the lame does not " that, have William Glaston duck session to lead to a durable cooperation of the parties mandatorily, if the new 112th convention is called in January. </seg>
<seg id="24"> He says so, a phase of the non-compliance is more probably, perhaps even inevitable instead. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> He "will after the things which must be done are done turn this short-term psychology over in confrontation", said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Wehner is also sceptical, and this scepticism is shared by many - this leads politeness to a real cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> I see much which happens from today to 2012 him when pre-fight or shadow-boxing said for the main event of 2012 " ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> For this many have to do with the presentation of the new republican majority in the White House and the reasons with the tea party electors these were useful to the education. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Being allowed to be the republican leaders also about this as got that they too highly play poker, they know that they must have a try to observe her promises to cut the expenses of the government and to suspend the health care reform. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> These party lines already get clear in the first reactions regarding the recommendations of the deficit commission which contain a tax reform and the raise some taxes as well as the increase in the retirement age and the cut the public expenditure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The acting chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have pressed in accordance with her own assessment so much to put the deficit question on the public agenda that these cannot be ignored any more. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need within the commission 14 of the 18 votes around her plan to make an official recommendation and they fight very much to this one to also only come this number into the proximity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The greatest resistance is found in the representatives of the committee voted for since only little room to move or some are liking in questions of finance, at least today for compromises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Alston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the republicans in the convention. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Later, the first fight then will followed by a phase's greater bilateral cooperation take place in the form of party collisions next year if the republicans challenge Obama with regard to the national budget, the taxes and the health care system. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will lead to this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> The public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It is proved that the American still wants the majority despite the partiality of the current election that the two parties work together. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If confrontation leads into a dead end as it has happened in 1995, then both parties must pay attention to the public reaction carefully. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Who is always condemned to losing, too will have to change the course and to seek the compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> This may be an optimistic position indeed. </seg>
<seg id="42"> As at that time, partiality and polarization are greater than in the middle of the 1990s years today and they seem between president Bill Clinton and the republicans to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the convention republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> 2012 consider the activists of both parties 2010 a pure prelude for one to consequence of far further-reaching Wahl at the same time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> So seen the politeness which is carried this week for the show may be welcomed by many Americans. </seg>
<seg id="45"> But it will require very much more effort on the two sides to find a common denominator in the questions which the two still separate from each other. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Control of the town is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and she passes a part of the bribes and the protection money which gathers her on to the Kremlin. So the American embassy in Russia reported in a Memo in February. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> It is so said both police and the state security service blackmail large protection moneys so that they can keep her expensive standard of living in Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="4"> You do not collect money only of legitimized business but also of organized criminal gangs. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Every shift of the bureaucracy has - as " vertical the authority " - what takes his part of the money, the ladder walks up described prime minister Vladimir Putin this. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Memo which was sent to Washington under the name of the ambassador John Beyrle was published by WikiLeaks on his home page on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Memo is based on sources whose names were edited. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It was written during Yuri Luzhkov Moscow's mayor still was and it accuses him of the corruption. </seg>
<seg id="9"> He was fired by president Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is hardly a proof that you would have tidied in the meantime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, whom a known building firm has have rejected corruption reproaches again and again over years and he has won numerous slander actions against such accusations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He explained to a Russian TV station in September as him after a documentation you asked, this one suggests, he is corrupt: "It is crazy, it is dirty, it is dirty." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> An unbelievably large number to believe Russians that her society is corrupt. Surveys have this devotedly. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But it is unusual that single persons are called as happened in the report of the ambassador, and it is unheard that this happens by a diplomat of a foreign country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "The direct connection of the government of Moscow" with the crime has the Memo been the reason that some describe her as "disturbed" and come to the end as a government that the government rather like one kleptocracy acts, so. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a concept from the world of the criminals/the mafia which "roof" or protection word-for-word means), this one, office of the public prosecutor extends over the police, the security of the state (FSB), the service supervisory authority (MVD) and this as well as by the complete Moscow government bureaucracy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Luzhkov is at a topmost place." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "FSB, MVD and the militia stand on the second step." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "The vulgar criminals and the criminal inspectors follow on the undermost step last." </seg>
<seg id="20"> "This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the town offers no help." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The report passes on that the police arrest little business people the FSB money of the largest companies collected and this. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> A source is so said, is, " explained, that Moscow's shopkeepers understand, the protection that it is the best, get by the MVD and FSB and not of the organized crime (), there she does not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law." </seg>
<seg id="23"> "For this reason the protection is no longer as in demand as early by criminal gangs." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The Memo notices that no the protection be itself very modest while collecting the monies is comprehensive; sometimes even the ones who pay are arrested. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The ones who does not pay find her business closed very fast in front of - due to the pretext. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Medvedev has repeatedly has at the same time said, however, that he only has made few progress talked about fighting the corruption. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The Memo of the embassy contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases which were presumably full of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> "Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats in his fight against corruption" told Georgy Satarov, director of by, a Moscow fact-finding mission, recently in an interview. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "But he is part of this bureaucracy." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "It is not a part of the political class because a political class does not exist in Russia any more." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Without politicians without an opposition without a separation of the forces, he says so, corruption is unavoidable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Nationwidely estimates so by the corruption costs Russia, more than $ 300 billion per annum. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The country shunts Transparence International on place 154 of a newer examination to the global perception of the corruption by the non-state organisation (countries are of listed too "most corruptly "least indeedly""). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> The uncovering of the Memos of the American embassy which was carried out late in the evening after Moscow time will arouse displeasure, although certainly within the Russian government, it also can be an opportunity for the Kremlin since Luzhkov can be accused for the faults of Moscow to claim that one solves the problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> In an interview with Larry King for CNN Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted furiously with the uncovering, that American diplomats have called him Batman and Medvedev Robin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> It "is the truth that it is about our interaction which is an important factor of the domestic policy in this country", he said. </seg>

<seg id="1"> White Russia agrees not further to accumulate uranium capable of bearing arms </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a surprising victory for president Obama's campaign to the worldwide safeguarding of nuclear material the government of White Russia has announced on Wednesday that one will collect highly enriched uranium no more which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The deal was announced to the Foreign Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton in an additional article of the safety summit in a common statement after a meeting with the Belorussian Foreign Secretary Sergei Martynov. </seg>
<seg id="4"> For years, the U.S. government had tried to convince White Russia to collect no longer highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The U.S. government told the Washington post that two secret agreements with White Russia were reached within the last two months to remove 187 pounds of uranium capable of bearing arms from a Belorussian research institute official. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material, approximately 500 pounds, this one anonymously has left according to an official employee due to the sensibility of the topic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The agreement seems one of Obamas most important results "to nuclear safety summit of the 47 nations" to be of April which had excluded White Russia. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And obviously it was good enough to safeguard the invitation of the former Soviet republic for the next summit in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I was really enthusiastic about the fact that want her a seat in the nuclear safety summit of 2012) (." </seg>
<seg id="10"> "This proves me that it works", told a group to Ken Luongo, president of the partnership of global safety, for the promotion of the nuclear safety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Clinton mentioned the agreement "a very important, important step" of White Russia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to safeguard all precarious nuclear material within four years. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The U.S. government has helped six countries since then her highly enriched uranium to get loose. </seg>
<seg id="14"> White Russia will be the seventh. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The Belorussian president has explained to Alexander Lukashenko in the time of Obama nuclear safety summit that the nation will never give up her uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "How hundreds keep highly enriched uranium - of kilo which basically is capable of bearing arms, Lukashenko said and less enriched uranium ", at that time. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "This is our raw material ... </seg>
<seg id="19"> We will not make any dirty bombs from this and we will sell it to nobody." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> White Russia approached nevertheless the USA few months ago when it reported interest in the meeting of an agreement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Attempt was particularly complicatedly the first say official to remove the uranium of White Russia in October because the material was contaminated by radiation easily. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It got special train loaded, the more than 1.300 miles to one Russian factory for storage say official into one and disposal for. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The second attempt was decided on on Monday and was carried out according to the official ones by aeroplane. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The U.S. government pays $ 14 million for these efforts, in which a large part of the money flows in the Belorussian research with weakly enriched uranium which cannot be used for nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "This which led to the agreement which was signed by Clinton was coordinated and coordinated extremely carefully to build up confidence", said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the department of energy which works on the global danger reduction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> James Martin Zentrum estimates this, that White Russia had at least 88 pounds of uranium capable of bearing arms this year as well as hundreds of uranium enriched pound highly for Nichtweiterzugebende studies. </seg>
<seg id="27"> White Russia wants to dissolve his store according to the joint agreement to 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Harsh disdain of the human rights was hard, primarily the relations between White Russia and the USA because of Lukashenkos for years. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But the statement of the Wednesday suggests a possible approach. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> An increased respect for the democracy and the human rights remains a central topic in the improvement in the bilateral relations in White Russia and it is essential for the progress of the country and his citizens " welcoming the progress of these global safety questions announce the United States of America and White Russia, that ", she declares. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The geriatric care centre confirms that the deaths cannot be explained by "missing measures" </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The owners of the old people's home in Olot do not rule out that her male nurse killed more than eleven older people </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The responsible parties of the geriatric care centre of La Carita in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday in which pointed her out Joan Vila Dilmés - the male nurse who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible during his work - had the criminal actions caused the facilities, which damage. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The head of the geriatric care centre, Joan Sala, got on in front of court the process and the civil law liability and announced "responsible parties would Laly like to accuse this one of Caritas (for the deaths)", however, " the right and our liability duty force us " to take care in the company of his lawyer, Joan Cañada. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The facilities must accept not only a social reputation loss because she had not established the criminal actions of the male nurse on time but pay a large amount of compensation now which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims, too. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime declines for August 2009 and that, since then, he has further murdered. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric care centre - since he suspected that no doctor has examined the decedents personally but the formalities were dealt with by phone due to the age and illnesses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The conductor of La Caritas denied this point flatly and explained, that "measures failing to appear could have been the reason for the occurrences at that time" </seg>
<seg id="9"> The lawyer of La Caritas added, that "would not" give any circumstantial evidence for negligent actions to another person than the accused in the lawsuit </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This one already as christened "angel of death" confessed eleven murders the day before yesterday and explained, the first crime commits on August 29th, 2009 and the second old lady murders one and a half months later to have. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this case he killed insulin with an overdose as opposed to the first crime at which he had given a mixture of different depressants. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The leader of La Caritas explained the entry of the staff to the medicine has to be checked only with difficulty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The male nurse used depressant cocktail at six of nine committed crimes to free the patients with the death of her suffering the insulin syringes and this. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But the results of the laboratory examinations will point out, whether Vila lies and actually chose for his first victims a less cruel death or whether he cauterized these from inside, by giving bleaching lye to them as he had done it according to the confession with three women whom he murdered between October 12th and 17th. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> In La Caritas who could absolutely be more one does not believe the statements of the male nurse, the number of confessed murders does even not concern what. This attitude is justified that Vila had made very different statements ahead of court and that it does not make sense to change his procedure suddenly after eight successful murders. </seg>
<seg id="16"> You say they provided themselves with her for this reason and to the enlightenment of the reach of these occurrences of the justice. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The investors reacted keenly on the threat of the ECB president Törichte who warned yesterday "the markets should not underestimate our speed of reaction" </seg>
<seg id="3"> The risk impacts of the euro periphery countries have increased dramatically and the shares of the European banks by more than 5%. </seg>
<seg id="4"> We nevertheless should not the possibility that the ECB can be mistaken and the euro has hardly improved its performance at points underestimate what arranges to the worry. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The events of yesterday are typically of an illiquid market, this one in the measure, in which he caves in recovers again though because of the shutdown of short and highly speculative positions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The institutional investor will not lose his fear yet for a long time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Today a month ago the European Central Bank invited us our liquidity measures, to make the ECB must back out within two years and probably still quite a few times in the future after what tomorrow for the fourth time. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The finalisation of the plan demanded the Federal Bank for sale of national debts since these are ineffective as well as liquidity measures limited the abolition of all unusual. Only a one-week permanent access shall be kept. </seg>
<seg id="9"> After the Irland crisis we expect the present liquidity measures "at least until March" prolonged and the quarterly advertisings with an unlimited access on the end of the quarter to ensure of the liquidity until at least June to want to keep. </seg>
<seg id="10"> We also expect the programme for sale of bonds continual and a signal being fortifying to want to distribute. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is, if the created expectations are not met, be the excellent reaction of the markets of yesterday thrown back again and insisted if obstinate we to take our liquidity measures back, only God can help us! </seg>
<seg id="12"> Could this story recur tomorrow not take the purchase of national debts papers into consideration and the markets caved in after that just like during the ECB meeting in May during which confirmed the bank. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The ECB must be credible and insistent. </seg>

<seg id="15"> The auction of one-year-old state titles was rather weak in Portugal yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The state portfolio management distributed only 500 million to 5.28% opposite 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Nevertheless the interest rates dropped around 30 base points in Portugal in the complete curve and funnel reflected a perception change of the markets according to the words with that. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The numbers of the fault hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland in Ireland. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The sum is valued at approximately 10 000 millions of at short notice and possible further 15 000. There is time until February to obtain private capital or these banks are nationalized. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Although Ireland has lost his credibility completely after it had not recognized the problem with the stress tests in July, the numbers are acceptable in the context of the rescue plan and help to reduce the uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The government must receive the parliamentary consent to his new budget next Tuesday, though. Since she still does not have the sufficient support, Ireland is one source of the uncertainty furthermore, too. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Angela Merkel has made her discourse more moderate with regard to the summit of the leaders and the government on December 14th. There political unity is in demand to point that these play the same score us together. </seg>

Measures which sound in the ears of the investors like vivaldi four seasons. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The double effect Zapatero and foolish explain twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges why the Spanish stock exchange has improved its performance by 4.5 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In comparison with February the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincing and we profit from the shock effect. </seg>
<seg id="28"> There is a substantial auction of a three-year government bond which will profit from the foolish effect today. Therefore we back a heavy demand which will remove all doubts about our funding ability. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> For Spain the application for a help plan would be a self-sacrifice. </seg>
<seg id="30"> We would get liquidity which we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros three times as much as in March at the disposal. The interest rates are extremely expensive and the entry to the markets would be closed without notice. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Our strategy nevertheless should Caesar's wife correspond to the motto: "Being only not but also the appearances are counting now." </seg>

<seg id="5"> On the other hand the acting head of the government, Elena Salgado, supports Felipe González with the help of the former district president, which brings about the present crisis the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible parties has. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How do these events have to be understood? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is, anticipated this Merkel's position is not a fault of her public relations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Germany takes a basically new perspective for the design of our future which collides with the retention of the traditional traditions of a large part of his partners. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In view of the resistances in Europe one starts with over three possible solutions for the crisis to speculate in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first one: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries during the south must leave the euro zone. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The second: The reintroduction of the German Deutschmark supports - although this at present rather sounds like science fiction - , of a large part of the public opinion, approx. 50 per cent of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The third party: A redesign of the euro in accordance with German suggestions. This means: moremacroeconomic control; absolute housekeeping; Punishment of the countries which break the specifications; possibly the stoppage of payments of some countries as well as the expansion of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is clear and stands out already for some time. Therefore there are no excuses now. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A constitutional reform pulled himself out of the sleeve to prevent this as of 2016, when first 2009 the IMF and the European Commission made incentives for deficits both and the German government. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This was the first symptom for it and the methods of his European partners including France diverge between this, what Germany considered necessary (severe tax plans and stable public finances). </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second sign put the Central European country when Merkel postponed the decision painfully to the rescue of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="18"> This was criticized strongly at that time. But the political agreement in Germany is fact that were, the public one and this one published opinion absolutely against a rescue of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Merkel finally comes out anew with a clear position within the last few October days. She demands a reform of the agreements of the European Union to bear a part of the costs to make the rescue of a country possible and engage the private lenders simultaneously. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Became this position as interpreted anti European since she advanced the Irland crisis and all following. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But her suggestion if sweetened also a little was accepted. Within the next months we will participate in the reform of the European Union which shall make these measures possible as of 2013. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has drawn a red line which does not intend to exceed it. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It tells everyone that the old operation of the euro will not exist any more as of this appointment even if unpopular measures must be taken now. </seg>
<seg id="24"> 2013 will this one be the year of birth of a new currency room, in which countries are punished hard for offenders, being able to be forced to explain oneself insolvent and in this case must the private sector take on a part of the costs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows us that we must smash a hard expansionist policy with high economize and rates of investment, moderation of consumption, improvement on the productivity and competitiveness as well as positive foreign-trade balances. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The other alternative which is based on indebtedness and building and construction industry with gigantic holes in the balance of payments, was specified by Spain in boom times like her simply will not be accepted. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The supply is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would do to this badly not to understand it. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not all about only to power the government's deficit on three per cent up to the year 2013. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much more mandatory. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And it is the worst which we could do under these conditions to deceive us ourselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the present turbulences change into more leisure. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And that, until spring 2013, we will use the possibilities which are commanded to us. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero has understood this also that way and rejects his double announcement (the promised reforms according to the meeting with the large-scale enterprises on last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) at this that has establish the hypothesis, order despite the criticism of Merkel in the house of one's own, prepared himself her way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But the red line drawn by Germany is there and does not see it so out that something would change to this. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Under the possibilities taken into consideration this one is not ruling out that we must leave the euro zone crammed full with little serious countries. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In this case Germany still could tell us it has warned us. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Sports and rule detour </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tricks like the one of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show ingenuity but not the will to avoid a sanction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The champions League was the reason that a lot of ink about this was spilled the putative of two players the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) instigated exclusion in the game of November 23rd against the Ajax in, you should the UEFA sanction whether it was around an unathletic action or not and whether perhaps two players of. </seg>
<seg id="4"> As is generally known, the two players lost (her team had already won obviously) time a couple of minutes before playing and several fouls played, so that the arbitrator showed them the second yellow card. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Real Madrid would lead his group this way and there, become the two players the specified sanction at the next league game against the fulfil Auxerre and get in without cards so into the next game phase. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Finally punished the disciplinary commission the UEFA players involved the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and these with different amounts of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, she has to be found rather frequently in the world of the football. </seg>
<seg id="8"> She is so far common that she is part of the ethos - the rules which are unwritten but followed in this kind of sport. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of the arisen debate around the represented case goes back that a team the football clubs Real Madrid (which in his hymn magnanimity and honour provides and on other occasions his players for similar occurrences had punished) played the leading role in and on the dramatization by Mourinho added an episode more to which for his long story as a theatrical and provocative technician has. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case the debate turns, whether this behaviour not forbidden by the statutes particularly contradicts the principles of the sports, this is said, whether these actions represent a rule detour. However, this procedure actually observes the statutes of the sports seems to avoid the meaning. </seg>
<seg id="11"> At this matter this one should sporting spirit caused damage examined be this. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sporting spirit defends the physical intactness of the opponents, an aspect which was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another aspect of a clean game consists in avoiding that the offenders players an unjustified use move from the counter-team. This did not happen either. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> It is Real Madrid the paradoxes of the action of the players that she does not correspond to what we usually understand by wrong game or rule detour, because the avoidance of the rule was not performed secretly to avoid a sanction but she should be as striking as possible, so that she is punished by the arbitrator. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players waited and accepted for the sanction joyfully. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is, which kind of advantage the offenders pulled out of the deliberate fouls. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Here the rival should be stressed that a more unfavourable position neither you took to nor advantages were commanded for the played game, because it was the obvious result of this action that the team of one's own had to play on with less players. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is not a useful strategy for the next game either because the club then does not have these players at its disposal. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Obviously the advantage consists that the players start with the next game phase of the champions League without cards which could threaten her participation in a future game. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a long-term one up to a certain degree uncertain advantage, since, sometime, the team also could leave. In addition, the players get a sanction with this procedure and change into the second card cycle in which they leave because of card accumulation with a card fewer than in the first cycle. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is not so clear with that whether it is really an advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Go such procedures not against the sporting spirit at long last of which also strategic decisions are part to profit from the regulations greatest possible. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case the players did not want to avoid a sanction (this actually would be a clear case of rule detour), they rather wanted to vote when they undergo this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> You took a strategic decision without evading a punishment or escaping in front of her. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Although the boundary between inventiveness and rule surroundings is blurred, I think that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the polemics have arisen because of two factors: Because it was all about two self exclusions and because of the way of the provoked rule assignment. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The damage which was damaged to the principles of the sports by these actions is less more ethical than a rather aesthetic way. </seg>

<p>

<seg id="19"> A Christmas menu was added to the six group menus for 30 euros or more than price hit. One has the impression that the customers are ready to distribute 10 per cent more than in the previous year and in return more wish details such as Cava. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> Interpol distributes a red warning for the following and discovery from Assange. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Everything which is connected with Wikileaks and whose founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts can be cleared up only difficult. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Interpol distributed a "red warning" for the "discovery and following" of Assange yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is not a traditional order for the arrest, though. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In addition, she is not new, she is of November 20th. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Nothing also has to do with the last uncovering of over four millions diplomatic documents from the USA but you must face those of the Australians in Sweden with the accusations of a sexual abuse. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Furthermore the advocate of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, insures " the police would know, where and how she can make contact with Mr Assange." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The international police authorities distributed the order with seat in Lyon (France) on application of Sweden already on 20th but she was not announced until yesterday upon receipt of the authority by the Swedish authorities. </seg>
<seg id="11"> So the things lie. The 188 interpol countries are instructed to identify and to find Assange "to arrest and deliver him for the time being" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Although interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning many member countries regard the red warning as royal charter after saying the organisation for an arrest - this one must particularly be carried out by the national police, if they dispose how it the case of Sweden and England is of a bilateral delivery agreement, where Assange stays presumably. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Assanges Anwälte filled with indignation proceeding, the gestures published a letter in which they informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference. </seg>
<seg id="14"> You also remind that Assange applied for the departure from Sweden and the corresponding one received approval from the public prosecutor who is compared with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, chief safety officer of Stalin. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "This is like a hunting, not like a legal following", is accused in the letter. </seg>
<seg id="16"> While the world is looking for him, and his mother declares the innocence of her son from Australia, Assange holds on to an unknown place open, being not silent, though. </seg>
<seg id="17"> On Monday he entered the head of the magazine time an interview by Skype from an uncertain place. He applied to the conversation for the resignation of the permanent secretary of the USA, Hillary Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Can that she was responsible spy diplomats, UNO out more North American for the order and has violated international agreements signed by the USA with that " if be proved ", he said do she must step down. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> His opinion was sentenced yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the application for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd". </seg>
<seg id="20"> He explained "I am not sure why we should attach importance to the opinion of a type with a web site" to the transmitter CNN. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Obama himself has engaged a high person responsible for the anti terrorism fight, Russell inhabitant of Trave, to do the prevention of new document uncoverings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The attempt of the spokesman of the president Barack Obama to give Assange less attention conflicts with the opinions which announce conservative politicians and commentators within these days. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The state department has asked the congressional representative Peter King who will lead the chairmanship in the national safety committee of the parliament as of January to examine the possibility of setting Wikileaks organisations on the list more terroristly " to confiscate around the monies and everybody, which supports her or makes a contribution to pursue " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> His statement Tom Flanagan, adviser of the Canadian president Stephen Harper, had gone still further and he must, Assange must "be murdered" revoked. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="26"> Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Huguet suggests a more pluralistic government and the end of the general meeting principle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe, around for the umptieth time of one this one to go ERC lacking a sense of direction in the rows after the loss of 11 representatives and the half of the votes from the way internal riot. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The party leader is conscious that the former party leader's Joseph Lluís Carod-Rovira does not suffice his threat to resign the being close. But he also knows that, today, the influence of this sector is weakened just like her mentor will not grant themselves and him the same headache, how other former flows. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Therefore the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with a wink which his position until the next local elections would safeguard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Yesterday, for the beginning announced on, that the over 200 regional fellow counsellors of ERC could speak secretly about his remaining in the office. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Hand not raised with ballot-papers. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If the parodists wanted to miss the president a ticket, they could do this without having to fear reprisals. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The boss would actually like to avoid the impression of splitting and the one of submission under his person both. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In several interviews he confirmed he would feel not confirmed with the half of the votes plus one and he added without detail of per cent values, a result would not be good "in the Bulgarian style" either. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The being close to Carod demands of the president more but to provide only the party with his office. An insufficient gesture, since Puigcercós checks the topmost organ of the conventions. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But since they do not have a sufficient majority at their disposal for the formation of resignations, they will agree on a procedure plan of now with the executive board until May. </seg>
<seg id="14"> For this they expect the line at the draft of the document about a strategic reorientation to want to present to the council for the coordination on 18th to be able to play a part. </seg>
<seg id="15"> It is your intention to guarantee Puigcercós. In return what the party leadership already regards as a fact shall promise to bring the convention forward in autumn 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The party leader of the ERC is of the opinion, the "polyphony" harms the stability and he strives once and for all to bring about the organisation to the position, to wash her dirty laundry behind closed doors. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The article is, in this meaning this one the incumbent Conseller Joseph Huguet signed blog symptomatically in his. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Puigcercós is in view of this one, an ideologue the owner of Innovació regarded as a fact that the party leader is supported "in the exchange for different aims". </seg>
<seg id="19"> He listed five, of which two are in the foreground. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The "restructuring" of the executive board firstly, the inclusion of new faces is so that this represents at least 90 per cent of the party members, that called environment from Carods. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The second could be the great news. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Suggests Huguet, ERC shall finally give up the general meeting principle as an operation. </seg>
<seg id="23"> He defends a reform with that of the statutes which shall make it possible to hold the conventions with delegates voted for. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Of the completion of the general meeting model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós ' is team which already fought at the last two conventions for it as had. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The party leaders were actually engaged to do the check of the general meeting principle at a convention at the shaking meeting of 2008 which should deal with the reformation of the statutes. </seg>

What is expected by me?", a cycle asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela who should open the second round of 'lot placeres de of La lengua', which the Spanish speaking literature celebrated and on this occasion the subtitle of her question used (she explained the round's table was dedicated to the sex in the language on another event)? </seg>
</p>

<seg id="4"> "The finger in the wound...takes us to difficulties", the Argentine spat document putting one sweet contrary to the audience, around this which mainly consisted of young people who came together at the international book fair in Guadalajara (FIL) of Marisol Shultz in whom Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero took part, Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, to be present at presented rounds table. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Luisa Valenzuela read a text which she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and indicated the Shultz after that as an excellent story. Luisa who is the search to learn what is a "wound" and goes from doctor to doctor on tells stories in first person and is the protagonist although she receives no answer but notes which for the guide of her story. </seg>
<seg id="6"> She leaves the infectiologists convincedly: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps this is my wound." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> For the end after a frustrating approach at the traumatologists which robbed her of the breath in the middle of the corridor, the psychoanalyst and, however, you explain to it that wound is not a scientific concept, revealed, the secret: "the really open ones, this are the wound symbolic is the scar." </seg>
<seg id="8"> The main character of the story sighs relievedly and closes, this she only "learned from the wound that this is really open and does not exist". But she is convinced that the desire at the language and its traps mix. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Valenzuela, the writer, played with both. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The Nicaraguans' Sergio Ramírez also introduced a delightful story which he called 'praise of the invention' and although is not mentioned but discovered in that one of the fingers in the wound. </seg>
<seg id="11"> With allusions to the magical realism he talks about a famous magician who touched the clouds, far brought travelled men back or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a three-point turn and reported of America, the big novel which did not lack his own chroniclers from the beginning, this one, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo of the conquer the abundance this one stories told stories criticized. </seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> He stresses, though, "it is the crazy and liars which imagine the things best" and reality and lie approach each other there, where one does not know any more of which side the story is part, where the fictitious literature reaches the summit. </seg>
<seg id="14"> He actually calls this the 'tradition Cervantes'. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "We have inherited from him what is told to be." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> When it was Mayra Montero's turn the writer commented on and praised the variety of the interpretations to which the invitation of the FIl for the round table of 'the fingers in the wound' had contributed. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The Cuban and puerto rican dedicated her contribution of the big wound of the social force which affects her country - like whole Latin America - as a result of the fights for the drug traffic. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In addition, in the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final two styles which are different and provided by her respective coaches contrast with themselves and the meeting indicated by contrasts is reflected in the results. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="4"> Rubén Omar Romano looks back in finals, at three defeats he is open on this and anti-lock braking system in his career experienced but three times has he had decisive games and has he kept himself good till now why this opportunity of quite special importance for him is. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Argentine has exaggerated himself with the medallion to the second Champion, he is unite step stayed behind the winners and he has amazingly delivered successive finals with the same team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The first final as a coach reached 'Torneo aperture 2002' the statistical strategist when del Morelia with which he learned a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2 had the reins in his hand; he reached the decisive duel later at the 'Clausura 2003' which he lost against Rayados also with 3-1. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Already with Santos Laguna Rubén had to plug a setback in again on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010' at which they played against Lo's Diabolos, the match with 2-2 undecidedly ended against Lo's Choriceros after 210 minutes of play but he made progress at the penalty kick with 3-1 and did two possibilities of plugging his title in but in the end inappropriate three of his players the eleven steps good and the game turned to 4-3 since. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diabolos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his big rival. Therefore he would not like to be pursued by the accident once again and escape from the bad magic to be able to celebrate a title for the first time although he confirms that for him the most important is the game itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I would like to become champion, I would not like to break statistics, this is for a club for my affection to which I devote myself, " and therefore the title will come to me but what happens before is the most important, the first mate commented when one questions him about the lost finals. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> He still has had the last final left in the memory strongly to have he learned from it insured, much: "The only lesson which we can draw from this is, that till the arbitrator does not whistle the end, we can not celebrate, we are prepared at the line, the players, also, and I think to leave because we were already prepared for it with two penalty kicks the last time that this is a teaching, is not ended to the game, there is no reason for celebrating." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Do not know that this series by sudden-death play-off could be decided him, worried, because he trusts his players: "One wants never to arrive at the sudden-death play-off, one would like to complete in the regular season but this left a message saying for us a little for this final sometimes there is no alternative and one must be prepared for it, sometimes we were prepared tour in the previous one but unfortunately, destiny prepared us a bad game because of nervousness or the intense efforts to hold the title in the hands already and we hope that it will not come to that this time." </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hydro Québec has allowed project planning companies 450 million dollars Eastman 1-A Sarcelle-Rupert by mutual agreement at contracts for the water-power project. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts a syndicate stands this the most important share consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe sm and Axor, namely that one of the project management has got, to a sum of 295 million dollars without advertising. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This syndicate 2004 as concomitant of the decision of hydro Québec, the private sector became her responsibility, this important, called "energy gérance", hydroelectric project in amount of a sum of 5 billion dollars to over-answers, formed. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The syndicate "energy gérance" got hold of the lucrative contract at the beginning of 2005 without there having been a public advertising. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For the Parti Québécois going back to enterprise syndicates represents a grave ethical problem which brings about the risk of the competition superseding as well as a price increase. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "This is a new way of a put-up job and weakens the competition." </seg>
<seg id="8"> "This means that one carries out in open form instead of put-up job instead of in a secret way now", explained Sylvain Simard, representative the PQ, yesterday at the press conference. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the early morning Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly because it seems to him in a way difficult to understand how, that way, the interest of the public can be used. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Resource minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted to it in the afternoon by denying vehemently that this contract would have been a put-up job. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "I remain faithful to my line", she cursed, she confirmed by, the PQ has been more important "dishonestly" and "she lacks" hardness. </seg>
<seg id="12"> She said it "was the least" that the PQ apologizes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The model of the syndicate is worldwide common practice. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It normally is a from the point of view of time so temporary alliance which permits two or more enterprises to bundle her expertises with regard to a commandment on an advertising for a complex project. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The project "Eastman" shows a high complexity standard regarding his work extent. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The construction method is in way and shall be built to 2012. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The contract nevertheless was allocated without a business struggle having been able to take place; there had already been negotiations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Moreover, more represents the model of the syndicate an exception in the Quebec even at relatively simple projects not at all. </seg>
<seg id="19"> As the newspaper "Le Devoir" made a note last week, the model of the syndicate used in the area of the civil engineer and advice nature is object of government inquiries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> A short overflight permits the Quebecer enterprise register more but to name 200 syndicates of which some of constant duration seem to be. </seg>
<seg id="21"> That way, for example the company Dessau works into partnership together with the majority of her nuclear competitors to whom SNC-Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult belong, CIMA+, Génivar. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Any combination, and of this it gives several up, dozen explains by the very same legal entity back, namely on Dessau. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> What the syndicate "energy gérance" concerns, has minister Normandeau emphasized so that the territory of the Baie of Jame is " subject to a special labour dynamics and that hydro Québec gives invoice to this fact in a special way for the seventies ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Réal Laporte has the great employer the Société this énergie de La Baie James (SEBJ) given an explanation the nose about the fact has had turned up which that the contract was allowed about the project management according to agreement, '. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "An advertising makes and there are only few applicants, your prices will jump if you." </seg>
<seg id="26"> "So you have two possibilities: You take people either, which is on this Mart and say to you: One will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price." </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is, however, the thought Laporte confirmed that the price is not decisive " but the expertise of the persons ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> This contract allowed the syndicate "energy gérance" is part of a long list dollar got of the Parti Québécois from contracts about more than . </seg>
<seg id="29"> The contracts were allowed to Eastman 1-A Sarcelle-Rupert by either the hydro Québec or the SEBJ for the project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> After check the branch offices, among this particularly resource laboratories, between 2002 and March more than 100 engineer and consultancy contracts, the companies counted the newspaper "Le Devoir" or 2010 were granted. </seg>
<seg id="31"> SNC-Lavalin had gathered 22 contracts to himself, Génivar had got 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without counting the participation in "energy gérance". </seg>
<seg id="32"> All these contracts have been negotiated. </seg>
<seg id="33"> You amount completely to $ in this, included the contract with "energy gérance" about $ in this. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Sylvain Simard had said, that this one " you declared yourself for Quebec well liberally " Parti the four companies, this one form the syndicate (BPR, Dessau, Groupe sm and Axor), is. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Minister Normandeau had had been touched on, the PQ is similarly connected to the companies which "financed" her before she specified that it rather is the executives. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Other results: The half of the consumers doubts the trustworthiness of the certificates which are official and attached to the putatively fair products but also the reliability of the products and brands which declares themselves as environment-conscious the barometer so. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the same sample the discourse of the politicians is taken seriously to this topic of merely 14.6% of the Quebecers population. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> Parallel, these did not have for enterprises his real cinematic function to over-answers, receivedly obvious what they have required the developer company Angus as well as this, around this again, hoped for a donation in the amount of seven million dollars of the Ministry of Education and the Arts for the take-over of the Daniel Langlois of belonging cinema complex eXcentris on the boulevard Saint Laurent. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The secret complex shaken Canada let some air in </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new, American diplomat lines which were spread by WikiLeaks reveal the secret about what the united nations consider under the inferiority complex of the Canadians opposite the Americans; however, they put the superiority complex Canada with the same blow opposite the last-named open. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The American diplomats consequently are astonished about it that the visit of president Obama would that according to have the Canadian elector at the ballot not the Canadian American relation has and they think helped the conservative government to succeed with her budget of 2009! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington which were spread publicly yesterday still offer more piquant details than the mere material contents at which one has to nibble. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A connection dating of September 22nd, 2008 not participating as of which point the united nations, report, any more, i.e. in the time period in which the federal election campaign was situated in the full gear in uses discussed by her political bosses. </seg>
<seg id="6"> To the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the ambassador who is employed in Ottawa and American. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Mr Wilkins offers different explanation possibilities of this situation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "An inferiority complex almost being inherent in the Canadians conditionally possibly much rather induces the Canadian, political executives to speak about inner points at issue of the weekday but push black Peter over to the United States in this election (as 1988 at the campaign about the free trade)", he describes so. </seg>
<seg id="9"> He concludes, so the united nation therefore is " proverbial Goliath this election: Omnipresent but too dangerous potentially to speak about him ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> All the less the ambassador understands this "deafening silence" since the two countries cherish intensive political and economic relations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "He judges, logically ", " so it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and still much more of a party leader for leading a such essential relation, according to that one of the electors at the going to the polls as a key factor has." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The other expression of this feeling of importance reads himself in the communication sent on January 22nd, 2009 of Terry Breese, representative in Ottawa, which president Barack Obama shall prepare on his first visit in Ottawa. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Your journey will help to ensure the government continuing to exist by the vote of confidence about the federal budget at the beginning of February at which his first deficit after more than a decade which has arisen due to a revival programme in the height of 30 to 40 billion dollar will announce Canada", Breese describes. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Nowhere he had the continuing to exist of the opposition parties so conditionally would have an effect on the quality of the suggested revival programme mentioned that the sitting of parliament before Christmas had the government had to adjourn around to prevent, that the parliament would be brought down by the coalition and himself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Notification which is another, dating of January 2008 and written on the part of the ambassador Wilkins contacts Washington of the picture getting more and more negative that the series which are broadcast about CBC and dramatic of the United States spread. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The ambassador is in which worried one little subtle allusions to Maher Arar over shipments like Border, Little Mosque on of The Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, CIA of examinations carried out can watch the the "no Fly cunning" or also payments to an end of by musclemen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Again another communication reports in detail how Hillary Clinten has asked Bernard Kouchner with her French counterparts at her first bilateral meeting, whether Europe is ready to take certain prisoners from Guantanamo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Mr Kouchner shall have answered the question though on the basis of an individual "case to case" decision. </seg>
<seg id="19"> He has a paper for the permanent secretary described Àm at the end of the meeting, so " with respect to handed over Omar Khadr, one 15-year-old Muslims Canadian origin " </seg>
<seg id="20"> The permanent secretary has accepted ", to have a look through the file once more ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> We finally still say that the people heat up with regard to the web page WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Tom Flanagan, an adviser who is old and suiting Stephen Harper very narrowly, had explained about CBC that these for this solid leak should become responsible parties "killed". </seg>

<seg id="1"> Worldwide plan for the renewal of the lights </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> UNO has suggested a plan in Cancun for the renewal of the illumination of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with regard to the obtainment of a reduction of the greenhouse gas (CFC) which almost corresponds to a third of the additional diminution which must be carried out yesterday to stabilize the earth climate to 2020. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This ambitious plan takes his position in the step of the concrete large-scale projects which hopes around the absence from mandatory diminution obligations of the industrial countries to compensate to convert UNO in Cancun. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to the plan put forward yesterday the main problem would be avoided in form of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of the CFC handed in due to the lights on the earth if light-emitting diodes (LED) would, the white-hot bulb which represents till now another monopoly from 50 to 70% on the market or still improve fluorescing by be replacing. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The lights are responsible for 8% of the worldwide emissions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the waste gases of the worldwide fleet of vehicles. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The great waste gas issuers like the United States, China, Europe and a different one under which Canada also counted which the global CFC emissions of 53 Gt should lower on 49 Gt had committed themselves to doing voluntary diminution plans in Copenhagen last year. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Of these balance sheets one still should remove 5 Gt, however, to stabilize the climate increase by 2 degrees centigrade of today up to the year 2020 around to prevent that this turns out out of control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the white-hot bulbs escapes 95% of the energy in the form of warmth and the remaining 5% produce the light. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The energy consumption goes down by 75% with the compact luminescent material bulbs, with the new LED light bulbs one reduces this energy requirement around the double one again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The compact luminescent material bulbs hold on average to 10,000 hours between 6000. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Has has a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and uses up 80% less energy than a white-hot bulb, what a hint of the one economizing possibilities of the exchange plan arranges which shall be used in 100 countries put the new LED light bulbs, such as those, that one of the manufacturers Philips, on the market this week, this society has by the way taken part in the UNO study. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Besides the fact that these completely new light bulbs only hand in very little warmth they can work also with a rheostat. </seg>
<seg id="14"> And they contain no mercury. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Several specialists has shown, that compact luminescent material pears show reserves, since they contain mercury and that one can dispose of her as a special waste because of what is not always possible in the developing countries unless the producers make a reception available. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The main source to mercury emissions on the planet, however, does not represent the compact luminescent material bulb according to the report but around which electricity rather wasted the coal power stations of the white-hot bulbs which ejects considerably more mercury to produce. </seg>
<seg id="17"> These coal power stations eject 25,000 tons of mercury alone in the United States every year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The report explains in detail the profits which every country thanks to this international programme would gain. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Indonesia would save such for example a billion dollar at the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2 every year, this means an equivalent of 3.5 coal power stations whose building Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Within more than six months of July 2009 until May 2010 the destiny of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was held tight because of "spying" in Iran, kept the French public in suspense, the diplomacy put on alert and accentuated the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Teheran. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This everything under the attentive looks of the diplomats of the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The American documents received from WikiLeaks and had a look by the newspaper "Le Monde" surrender some backgrounds of this crisis. </seg>
<seg id="5"> You describe how the Elysée had explained his strategy to the Americans who on the whole went to give these advice to dealing with her own crisis of "takings of hostages" in Iran (a small group of hikers). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Showing you as the French responsible parties have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young Frenchwoman does not have the release of Iranian held prisoner in France by Majid Kakavand, one and looked for due to trade with material in favour of the Iranian nuclear programme by the American justice for the service in return. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Finally they put the way with which the French committee has tried manipulate the media to an end to make these the idea credible, the Syrian president Bachar Al Assad has played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss in a glaring light. </seg>
<seg id="8"> He had done nothing in this regard in truth. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> A diplomat telegram edited on August 12th, 2009 in Paris bears the title Iran ": French commentaries on the way of dealing with takings of hostages ". </seg>
<seg id="10"> François Richter, Elysée adviser in strategy questions, talked the quay this in the company of Patrice Paoli, director ' Orsay for North Africa and the middle Orient with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> You explained the French method to her. </seg>
<seg id="12"> These advised the Americans to risk everything to lead her own nationals who would forcibly be held tight in Iran back. </seg>
<seg id="13"> They said "noise makes", " the word "basic human rights", "innocence", "immediate release" in the media, articulates loudly and considerably and without refrain ". </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is at a loss necessarily, around the Iranian regime to take, which very severely pays attention to his image. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> "All the more this operates, do not do this particularly since the Iranians ask you ". </seg>
<seg id="16"> Ways, the Iranians are because "silence solves nothing", past "masters in evasive actions" the discussion tests about on unobtrusive. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "common, Iranian tactics": "Taking of hostages to an end of political extortion". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> He is, heralded "the payment of a large sum of money asks (230,000 euro bail of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which should take place on August 16th on the day on which she flees to the French embassy) to the Iranians" the release). </seg>
<seg id="19"> And he lets announce, the Elysée anticipates further takings of hostages, a phenomenon which "will intensify". </seg>
<seg id="20"> The Iranians could " in the near future unite the approximately 1,800 arrest a French citizen, live this one in Iran ", others he said so. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="23"> Some information was taken to circulation: The Iranian Majid Kakavand whose delivery the united states demand due to an illegal trade with delicate electronic material to Iran has been dismissed from the custody after decision of a judge in Paris. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="24"> The American embassy faces, like numerous other observers, questions about this worrying coincidence. </seg>
<seg id="25"> For Washington which pursues the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of this for the nuclear programme scheduled material the release of Majid Khakavand represents a piece of bad news. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Has France accepted a horse-trading? </seg>
<seg id="27"> The liberation of the Iranian against the one of the Frenchwoman? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> On the occasion of a renewed discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4th François Richier assures that this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The Elysée, not he says so, was only "surprised" by the decision of the judge completely but also has tried to rebel against it. </seg>
<seg id="30"> (At present Michèle Alliot-Marie) "has given an active exchange between the French committee and the French Lord Chancellor" but he explains "the French government cannot change the judicial decision". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Mr Richier also would like to point out that furthermore Majid Kakavand stands under "strict" supervision of the French secret service. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Informs the American diplomat thereupon the Elysée adviser chooses a phone number, establishes again, the Iranian "would be in the buildings escorted by the Iranian embassy in Paris at present". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran and "influential mediator role" the Elysée does not spare his efforts, by means of announcements and "escape attempts organized by the media" thinks to make, the Syrian president Bachar Al Assad plays one "important". </seg>
<seg id="34"> The Americans do not watch this activity without irony and notice that the manipulation carries fruits, since several press articles reflect the official French version. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> A telegram dating of August 25th, 2009 brings about "the medium lightning of the French authorities". </seg>
<seg id="36"> The Parisian message asks herself what bases so much "intimation of gratitude" opposite Mr Assad on. </seg>
<seg id="37"> "Despite her explanations full of praise the French authorities admit secretly that they have only a vague idea about it what the syrians have actually done". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The document deals thereupon, with the reasons these have to become a slave to this fiction taken the Elysée. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The intensive communication efforts are " as of, aimed he analyses to confirm Sarkozys policy of the opening opposite Syria ". </seg>
<seg id="40"> A 2008 launched politics which "was perceived in France as well as abroad by numerous critic voices as premature and undeserved" at that time. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The distribution in 2022 then will turn out a little more exotic; the international football association hopes to be able to win for himself on the African continent in 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) or further to pursue his branch office in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) after the premiere. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="6"> Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his ministerial committee that the discrepancy of Spain amounts to 400 base points at the German interest rates. </seg>
<seg id="7"> His right hand, Gianni Letta, had spoken from direction Ireland of the "market turbulences" and a possible risk of infection, however, when "got heavily". </seg>
<seg id="8"> "The good news is that Italy, the third national economy of the euro zone, not as Greece or Ireland is." </seg>
<seg id="9"> It "is the bad news that Italy like Portugal is", explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson institute. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This in plain language means his problem is being able to cover the absence of economic growth and the control inputs which are accompanying with that and consumptive which take the state to danger his financial requirement no more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In future, an Italian growth is expected from 1.1% in 2011 and from 1.4% in 2012...although the household budget being at the senate for the examination expects 1.3% or 2%. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The EU commission calculates so, and 3.5% in 2012 ( instead of 2.7% the budget deficit will make up 4.3% of the GDP next year certainly (contrary to the one of the governments' predicted 3.9%) under these prerequisites). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Therefore also the riot around a new household collective which could be used for a sum of 7 billion euros after the holidays. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "If necessary new economy measures must be taken up", thinks accountant Olli Rehn. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At the hour Italy gets the support of international institutions. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Are OK the foundation of Italy's economy and his accounts are regulated, we repeat this already for long time", insured for Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the international monetary fund which is entrusted with Italy at the IMF. </seg>

</hl>

<seg id="2"> Since the debate is in full swing around the modernization of the traffic economy on the Ile-de France, it rains billions. </seg>
<seg id="3"> At least in the discussions. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> To arrange the start of building of the SGP, the state has exclaimed a capital donation of 4 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is the sum in the theoretical scheme which would make it possible for the SGP thereupon to award a part of the finance sum to double to hers on the markets. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Today, it finally has come to first projections. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The addition household of 2010 contains the scheduled measures to find the first part of these monies, had a look by the finance commission of the National Assembly this morning. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This is two lei measures: The creation of a special tax for the opening up and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> You one takes article 15 of the law outline, goes the former, " in favour of the institution under public law, Société, grand Paris " so. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is figured: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per annum". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> A reorganization of the enterprise taxation already existing is second: increase you by the product arising from her to modernize these " and this rise of the Société grand Paris to over-answers ". </seg>
<seg id="13"> How much would this bring in? </seg>
<seg id="14"> A puzzle. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This sum is not estimated in the text. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> One is far away the 4 billion. </seg>
<seg id="17"> It is executed that the tax resources are added to the capital donation to the 4 billion euros " this one be found by the state and the Société little by little is done to grand Paris for the project ", you have to be gathered from the explanatory exposition so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> One does not find this system offensive at the SGP at all. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "One can cover more than three years for a long time and then create only from the 4 billion the project planning since the moment at which one credits takings (the two taxes, d. R.)", is explained so. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Affaire WikiLeaks has a double meaning. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On a side she has this one turned out to be an obvious scandal merely a scandal is hypocrisy in the Sinner, the relations between the states, the citizens and the Presse ruled over which, a scandal. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other side she announces profound changes on international standard and gives a foretaste for the future dominated by regression. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But we follow the row. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any file (an any old nation) prepared by a secret service consists exclusively of newspaper cuttings. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary", American uncoverings about the sexual habits of Berlusconi throw nothing off further than this, sketches what one anyway got in every any old journal over months to read (the owner is Berlusconi apart from these) and the image of Gaddafis caricatured alarmingly offered cabaret artists substance for hers already for long time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule according to which the secret dossiers only may consist of already known news is not essentially the secret services and this for the dynamics only in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go to a library which devotes itself to esoteric publications, every work will recognize you, that (about the grail, the mystery of Rennes-Le chateau, the Templars or the rosicrucians) this exactly repeats what was already written in previous works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This does not come alone, that the author of occult texts does not want to publish enquiries (still therefore, that he would not know, news about this could not be found where existing), but because those which devotes himself to the occultism believe in nothing different from it she already known what and confirmed what they have already learned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also Dan Brown's success mechanism. </seg>
<seg id="12"> As well the secret files. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Bad and bad (or limited mind) is the informer the boss of the secret service also is (he could otherwise what also always be, for example editor at Libération), this one only considers to be true what he appreciates. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The same as those, were the top Secret information about Berlusconi which the American embassy in Rome had sent the state department the week had already the Newsweek published before. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Why so fuss was such a made around the uncoverings of these dossiers? </seg>
<seg id="16"> Mean on a side what every educated person already knows and to be more precise that the messages have lost her diplomatic function and have changed into spy centres with the exception of some small representation tasks at least be able to call the heads of the government each other or be able to take an aeroplane to meet for dinner. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Any arbitrary spectator of inquiry films knows this very exactly and it does not happen from hypocrisy that one is pretending, to ignore this. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Nevertheless: The fact to repeat it publicly hurts the task of the hypocrisy and serves to put the American diplomacy into a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In second place: The idea that an any old hacker can tap the most secret secrets of the most powerful country of the world holds the considerable blow against the prestige of the state department. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Moreover, the scandal of some brings about the sacrifices when rather the "executioners" into distress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we devote ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> One could bundle all power like a Big Brother who checked every gesture of his subjects formerly at Orwell's times. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwell's prophecy could have turned out perfect correctly since then where one can check every movement thanks to the telephone, any concluded transaction, the frequented hotel, the chosen motorway and so on; the citizen would get the power for the total victim of the eye. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Alone the secret crypts of the power cannot escape any more from control of a hacker, the inspection round stops being judged one-sided and gets circular so if, however, one makes clear to himself what goes off today that. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power checks each of citizen but everybody citizen or at least the hacker - chosen as an avenger the citizen, can find the secrets of the power out. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> How can hold himself a power which is not able to keep her own secrets any more, however? </seg>
<seg id="27"> Georg Simmel already said it is correct, an actual secret is an empty secret (and) an empty secret can be never revealed that; it is also true, about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel a secret is liberal secret in the reason since it surrenders the public sphere that each knowledge; but indicated in the style of WikiLeaks to disclose that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, rob her of any power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> WikiLeaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, against this but Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What wanting to be the consequences of this insult which was caused to such a tremendous power? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the states will make information reserved no in future more online, this would amount to a notice stuck up at the corner of the street. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is just as obvious that it is in vain with the current technologies to hope to be able to keep confidential reports on telephone secret. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is simpler but to find out whether and when a leader moves in an aeroplane and has contacted one of his colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could private and only meant for certain ears relations be maintained in future? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know very well that my forecast sounds like science fiction and like a novel at the moment but I feel forced to imagine the government agents, carrying her communications with himself moving in a secret way busily on uncontrollable routes nowhere else than in the bare memory, and furthermore the few written information which has got her in the heel concealing. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information would be stored in only copy in locked drawers: In the reason the spying test of Watergate had as WikiLeaks to record less success. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity namely backwards to write that the technology nowadays like a crayfish makes progress. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionized the communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with a (telephonic) wire. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The (analogous) video cassettes had made it possible to find a film out band for band for the film researchers, by one being able to spool forwards and reveal all secrets of the Mondays from behind while nowadays the (numeric) CDs are making nothing else possible but to jump to chapter therefore in macro portions from chapter. </seg>
<seg id="39"> One goes by high-speed trains within three hours of Rome after Milan while this requires hours three and a half by aeroplane including changing. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It therefore is not unusual that politics and communication technology come back to car and horse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> A last observation. </seg>
<seg id="42"> In earlier times tried the Presse to understand what kind of secrets were forged between the messages. </seg>
<seg id="43"> It is the messages, this one confidential information of the Presse demand at present. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Climate: As France is a smooth talker his finance promises </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It is time a year according to the Copenhagen contract to examine the compliance with the financing promises (also called "almost start" or premature financings) solved fast which were carried out by the developing countries. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And the rough French whitewashings are already uncovered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With the Copenhagen contract the developing countries have themselves obligedly to provide 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The EU has 7.2 billion euros over three years promised, France 1.26 billion euros, (i.e. 420 million per annum). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On the occasion of the opening of the COP16 the EU has pulled all the stops to convince her partners of the fact of her engagement regarding the almost start financings: Procedure report of her member states, press conference, great side events, booklet distribution, true to detail. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The operation transparency is remarkable and degrees valued for her real value: The countries developing and the civilian company would like to see it if all developed countries made the same on the same precision standard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The EU announces, released in 2010 2,2 billions euro to have got done what she sets on the right way to the admiration of her engagement of 7.2 billion in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If one, however, looks into the detail, the things lie a little more complicatedly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should be "new and additional" according to the Copenhagen contract to ensure that an additional use was brought in without doing the public foreign aid the disadvantage. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately, there is no agreement about what "newly and in addition" means. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Having certain member states, among this France which blocks methods, while the EU commission had suggested a harmonization. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Everybody chooses the reference value today which he considers when at the best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The EU commission has herself for the one of the year 2009 as a reference value chosenly, for example: The international financings will keep and "almost start" over three gives in the context of the financing 150 million for years to this. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries have similar reference values, elected either with regard to year or regarding conditions on level of the public foreign aid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> France thought in return to it "newly and in addition" the financings of "all new projects" of the year are 2010. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Expressed differently: There are no reference values at the versions of the year gone in front or at a global level of the public foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Said concrete the grand total of the French support of the developing countries can remain stable (or also decrease) - France pretends to observe his obligation with regard to the "new and additional" financings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another, decisive element is the itemized breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> About this there is no rule yet and everybody chooses his computing mode. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, such as France, are lent € 1 as equivalent with donated € 1. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Obviously this is only heavily acceptable: The effort is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use can be justified by loans for certain profitable investments (often projects bound to the issue checking which are based on the most effective technology), it is deceitful to present the euro which one takes as an equivalent for a donated euro... Moreover, only the costs of the loan for the capital owner country as engagement should be imputed, (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France has nothing according to consideration following as this one differently: It "respects" his obligation of 420 million euros by convince oneself of it around himself) it 91.5% loans (389,8 millions euro takes and % donates to 8.5 ) 36,1 millions euros), see the EU document also. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only one the EU land, that loan starts in large measure. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany demands 46% the Netherlands during Denmark or (among other things) Slovakia follow her obligations to 100% with donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If the vast majority of the European Union spends € 1 for the fulfilment of her obligations, France gives 10 cents just once and understands a comparable use by it differently, said. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Beautiful hey presto! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> France all in all operates in his almost start financing with a double dizziness: To a part with a further development of the action over the time and on the other hand part with the reality of financial use. </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is France successful to let think that it has distributed 420 million of "new and additional" millions in agreement with his promises and saves 36.1 million euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> This one seems that it was Bercy, (the manipulation the Treasury since it well the arbitrage has carried out), one could draw twice negative effect after himself; the other member states continue once EU internal (why, if with donating it suffices to lend anyway)?and then in the negotiations, since be able to not to deceive the countries developing completely ... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter of the premature financings only a small question until relatively short time in comparison with the totality to discussions about the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But the drop could be too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> We hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="35"> Like this also, always is, it is indispensable to learn his lesson from this first year of premature financings. </seg>
<seg id="36"> France could primarily announce a change in his booking way for the years 2011 and 2012 and to be more precise in spirit of the respect for his obligations and the compensating justice with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> France could primarily bring about the discussions about the matter in controversy of the long-term financings forwards, however, (another, decisive and short-term discussed topic:) One does not escape from the question of the "chargeability" or the booking type of his loans. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could change his position to be just as progressive with regard to the points at issue how it is this at other things. </seg>

<seg id="39"> So the hope is based on the new minister of the environment Kosciusko-Morizet who will arrive in Cancun next week. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A surprising announcement over the almost start of France and his vision of the "chargeability" as well as the use of loans would raise the international basis of trust from nature which is necessary for secondary discussions. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The plate balance sheets are shattering: 81 chemical substances, and five carcinogenically classified just like 37 substances with endocrine interference factor loudly when sure studies of several institutions, such as the international cancer research centre, under this 42 as possibly or probably carcinogenic classified. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "One takes so very well that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to possibly carcinogenic substances with endocrine interference factor is alarming even if the legal limits are not exceeded for every substance in approximate all the cases which is chemical and taken individually from this elevation", remarks the union. </seg>
