<seg id="1"> What should they do, the ČSSD? the Czech Social Democrats in Prague are not aware of Voldemort, "Konditorei." </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously certain language barriers should overcome their old-new colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and in the town of representation to understand at all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The newspaper Aktuálně.cz members of the new Council from the ČSSD a little "abgeklopft ', as they dominate the notorious slang, which in recent years has become established, in which the current coalition partner in Prague at the helm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The codierte vocabulary, in the long era of Mayor Pavel Bém was introduced by the Prague political elite, some of the most well-known actors, situations and Causae borrowed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Surprisingly, the new councils in relation to these new concepts somewhat in the dark. </seg>
<seg id="6"> They claim At least. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Who is Voldemort?" </seg>
<seg id="8"> "No idea." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am more of a newcomer in the Prague politics", Lukáš responded Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, on the test of the "godfather vocabulary". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But also the Council Mr Březina - a political veteran, responded in a similar way. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example on the concept of 'golf hole ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "This is the only expression of those which you present to me here which I use now and then." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "otherwise, I think that not much of slang." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> From the vocabulary of the daily newspaper Aktuálně.cz in this year's June before the choice Congress of the ODS had published the editorial staff picked six concepts, particularly with the Prague magistrate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Social Democrats should the concepts' Voldemort ',' biggest Prague golf hole, "" go in the bull necks "," betrayal of the capital "and" verblechen ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Mr Weinert, the future leader of the Prague school system - beginning his participation in the talks, but then not even the headphones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "These are things I don't care and how the Civic Democrats themselves talking about - I do not." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "For me, it is how we understand our programmes," he countered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> As already indicated, would have Lukáš Kaucký mentioned in the above headline claim not recognised by the influential entrepreneurs and friend of the ex-mayor who was Bém, Roman Janoušek. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The term "Voldemort" says Kaucky absolutely nothing and the only concept, which he correctly guessed at the test was "the biggest Prague golf hole". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, added to safety but added: "But I rather know this from the newspaper." </seg>
<seg id="23"> And jokingly: "I will probably have to show a language course." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> "The golf hole" will not only matador Karel Březina, but also by the town councillor for the Environment Lukáš Plachý right as a tunnel Blanka. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Both Social Democrats also know, however, for whom the term Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý senses even where this figure is and what it means to go "in the Konditorei </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "I believe that that is, in some kind of Prague restaurant company to go Plachý quite close to the solution to the problem, when we know that it is the seat of Janoušeks firms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> In line with Březina, but he claims that this knowledge to have drawn from the newspapers, rather than him this vocabulary would own. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The test participants, judging by the Social Democrats, in fact there seems no similar eingebürgerten slang. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I have also asked my colleagues, but there is obviously something we really not." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "We call on our behalf, sometimes we use words or nicknamed", says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - from his party to "Hulda". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "In school I was Bříza (Birke), but I do not know whether to call my colleagues," tells us Karel Březina his nickname. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried and behold - it works. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Mr Weinert Office is for the party of the kind of "Opa" or less friendly to the 'old', the representative Miroslav poche, ahead of the elections by machinations of the party's sponsorship, some Members' Igráček "(known Czech Lego-figure). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Moniker is the only one that the Social Democrats in the whose language. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Hulínský may not, "Hulda ', but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered yet another moniker of the Prague chairman. </seg>

<seg id="1"> A bone House fascinates even after 100 years. If you look at the Interieure of Gaudi </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The roof appears to the backs of prehistoric Echse, the stairs as the vertebral column of Dinosauriers and Balkone are aufgerissene Fischmäuler. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Of the local inhabitants, the house with his organic forms the nicknames "bones house." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, Kachelsplittern and mosaic, the scales facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all of these are typical features for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The facade of the House plays with wonderful lines, gentle colors and textures that remind of nature and living creatures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Only On closer inspection we noticed that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In the night, the whole façade, plastic, dramatic and the special Anleuchtung reinforces the glory of the colours. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The same dynamic lines and tortuous forms also dominate the interior of the House. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Waves geformtes wood copied the window frames, support, Zierelemente of doors, even Gucklöcher and trade. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The House Batlló in the quarter Eixample on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No 43 was created from the rebuilding of a House from the year 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese said. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The investor, the wealthy industrialists Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a wholly new building, but he agreed to the idea Gaudís on an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The rental house Casa Batlló devised Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone. </seg>
<seg id="15"> He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol together. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Just On the drawing board created the Dekorationen for the representative housing of the Realitätenbesitzers and also the use of mosaics of the façade was his idea. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In the design of the facade, but also many other Bildner and artists with. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The joint work on the drafting of the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So Jujol also involved in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá in the park Güell where other works of Antoni Gaudí. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Shortly after its completion, the home of the local inhabitants got the nickname "bone house" because of his organic forms. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Others called it the specific Fensteröffnungsmechanismus because of the "yawning House". </seg>
<seg id="22"> It also says that the top of the building is the sword of Saint George, of the existence of Catalonia. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But also further bildhauerische elements symbolize hidden religious motives. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Gaudí designed a central heating system unique for the time for the House with Entlüftungskanälen and typical Kaminen. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Something weird is their 45-degree slope already. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> In his creation Gaudí consistently ignored all the building codes and did not influence this. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before the start of construction - although he absorbed from the the city of it claims made about the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers were two years later so horrified by the result that they remedy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Gentlemen of the Council found that among other things, that the construction with its pillars even in the public pavement intervening. </seg>
<seg id="29"> To amendments, however, it was not quite the opposite - just 15 days after the call of the urban community, Josep Batlló a submitted an application to the approval of the lease of the two höchstgelegenen floors of the house - and was promptly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The homeowners themselves, in the lower floors. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In the gallery in the 2 Stock was a Gesellschaftssalon, on the third floor were bedrooms and private rooms of the house. </seg>

<seg id="33"> The whole sechsstöckige buildings undergoing a steps up to Dachterrasse. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="34"> The main elements of the redevelopments were all right corner and straight lines removed and replaced by bent and geschwungene walls. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Gaudí but also with a modern approach to mutual connection of rooms. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The social part through the opening of Salontüren completely combine and greater society chatting comfortably without vertraulicheren on talks with a certain degree of intimacy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The House received by Gaudís retrofit except a new facade of a very unusual roof and two other floors. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Impressive is also Gaudís game with the light, and the blue and white glasierten Kacheln with which the courtyard dressed and light. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The game of these two colours gives maximum light all floors of the House. </seg>
<seg id="40"> He made simply use the principle, that white better reflects the light and dark colors, sunlight on the contrary. </seg>

</p>

<seg id="44"> As we noted that this is a very profitable business, it has retained the surveys, and extended it to other common and the Dachgeschossräume, including the Dachterrasse. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The price for the inspection of the monument is no trifling matter, however, he is EUR 16,50, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get 20% reduction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> This figure exceeds the entry prices to other Gaudí-buildings in the city. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have other desires than men </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Not the tollste bed framework, but the quality of the deck area - mattress and rust make the good bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> These are, however, ways to meet the wishes of the specific user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In the choice many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the Schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Equally important is the Interieur where mattress and rust. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a Wochenendhaus, not regularly heated, are not well suited since they are much longer, "warm". </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition, they are significantly heavier than usual polyurethane foams mattresses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And, it should be changed regularly. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If they do not have enough Entlüftungskanälchen in the heart and still have a strong record, is congested and moisture, so it is not ruled out that the tape. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the election Of course also plays a role, to what one is used. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Anyone who has been a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with soft class, will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with hard surface. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "All you get from the NHL have returned, have complained to me that they can no longer sleep right here." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "For their abgeschundenen shoulders, and Hüften they simply need a soft layer from Visco-foam (memory Foam - a form of memory-polymer)." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "Among other things I recommend these to also diabetic people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the" information "from the ligaments and the skin is bad," says Sylva Hadamcziková, furniture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Therefore I have many years ago Eishockeyspielern, but also other customers this mattresses with Visco-foam (memory Foam) concerned. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "today, it is no longer a problem, because the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And one does not need to be a famous you get the benefits of the Visco-foam learn to appreciate. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" actually works quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The foam optimalisiert his toughness and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, he schmiegt downright warm body. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Nowhere is there, in the night one does not roll around as after a serious fight. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It is simply sleeping much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The viskoelastische foam also offers protection against Dekubitus (gangrene). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In the choice of the Matratzengröße should be to height is still the length of the Fußsohlen add some 21 to 34 inches. </seg>
<seg id="25"> A man and woman in the 180 cm are big need as a 210 to 220 cm bed. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Each of the Schläfer should at least 90 cm is widely available, is 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In Einzelbetten, for example in singles, 120 to 140 cm. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The comfort and also for the visitors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise the following rule of thumb for the ideal bed broad: "If you on the back, should have enough room for the easy angewinkelten arms," advises mine. Helena Prokopová, the guild masters of the and Raumausstatter for years the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and this discussion at a university. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> In a double bed everyone needs a own rust and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are too high. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise there is nothing different amounts than the Roste assembling and this is not possible in every bed framework. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, should be at least three centimetres in the form of class and the fine cushion. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "With the hand or the Hinsetzen the feathers on no account should we felt", warns Helena Prokopová. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Each mattress makes a special Rosttyp. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and under position as evolved Siamzwillinge have no place in the bedroom. </seg>
<seg id="36"> These mattresses can not be let drop and the reference you cannot wash, today already. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And since we are in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years slowly to a huge (and sieve). </seg>
<seg id="38"> Even so, experts advertising slogans in mattresses a lifespan of up to 25 years, yes even lifelong guarantee. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Every cause has its ifs and buts. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And so a practical Council by dealers: Mattresses of 120 or 140 cm diameter the hygiene of waschbaren abziehbaren salaries should not be afraid, however, it is recommended to use a Matratzenschoner, easy and washing. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even if today usually Matratzenbezüge with Rundumreißverschluss manufactured so that you get after the opening two halves (immensely important for the Waschvorgang and washing machines size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> They have in bed instead of a Rostes firm record? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Get out of it. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> So they should record to provide ventilation holes (if not included) and mattresses with the skeleton and 15 cm minimum level with so-called pockets of the core and finely cushion. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a pad. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For not verstellbare Lattenroste with 14 to 18 (Lamellen) are suitable Latex- or Sandwichmatratzen (possibly also combinations of Latex and Kokos), keep pay this Roste with a larger Lattenanzahl, of 28 and more Federleisten from, with Lordosenstütze in Lendenwirbelbereich and the ability to regulate the Lattenhärte. </seg>
<seg id="48"> On verstellbare Lamellenroste does not include mattresses with the skeleton, since they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Alongside the attitudes of stiff the pen will make special flexible shoulder modules. </seg>
<seg id="50"> This is a special strengthen the pen, which allows the einzudrücken or even afford to verwinkeln that they allow the individual Einsinken the shoulder of the Schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Especially for men with broad shoulders an important matter. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There is even Matratzenhersteller which have started to use soft Herrenmatratzen "zones for the shoulder area. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Also to the ladies is thought - they are fighting these soft zones in the Hüftgegend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For most demanding customers are punktelastische wing stroke systems (Lattoflex) or Roste burden with points of contact-Pads with so Multitorsionsfederung. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure will be distributed on several points, thus reducing the tension. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But, if the right mattress and right rust a bad (too big and fülliges), most are used Kopfkissen benefits lost. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Here too, a rule of thumb: The to the head, his top should only up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles relax. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Ideal is therefore a 50 x 60 cm big cushion, as for example the Scandinavians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In the side of the head cushion (along with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or soft zone in the bed) the shoulder height. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Have our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (fat) Strohsäcken but with hay. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern manufacturers use natural materials, or at least their mixtures. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Also In the new magic word "organic". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of oil raw materials used to manufacture of Polyurethanschäumen increasingly natural oils - for example Rizinus- and soya oil. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soya is used by all well-known manufacturers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> "Organic mattresses, which is in its core of materials purely natural origin is," said Petr Vašíček by the company Tropico Plus. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Natural materials, but also in the production of Matratzenbezügen - one of the first was Aloe Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> But one can also micro-capsules grant to sleep, Mr President fresh woodland or Lavendelduft spread. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Here too there is a difference between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While the men a "cool" Pflanzenextrakt from Birkenblättern used so that the Matratzenbezug absorb the heat and cool the body, the salary for women "wärmende" effect. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Extracts from red Paprikaschoten stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex when sleep wohlig warm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> And the current favorites? </seg>
<seg id="72"> Mattresses from cold sparkling (he has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and also much more flexible). </seg>
<seg id="73"> The combination of the various stiff (tough) of cold foams and from know exactly, where head, hip and heels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> For a high-quality mattress, though, has to fork out 7,000 kronor and more. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Gesundheitsmatratzen but are usually with lower value added tax, because they are regarded as medical device. </seg>
<seg id="76"> The first Czech companies were Gumotex this advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> You see, in the bed and the pair to save is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="78"> There are special offers of manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses for the price of one. </seg>
<seg id="79"> So the brand Magniflex offers the mattress Duofreeze with in relation verstepptem Visco-foam memory for 11.990 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="80"> The second will be free to do so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the material Tempur which the era of viskoelastischen sparkling substances with open Zellstruktur and high density in almost kosmischem pace. </seg>
<seg id="82"> No surprise, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the starts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83"> Tempur is in heat soft, cool environment cemented it again. </seg>
<seg id="84"> So it is to the human body perfectly and distributed the body printing in an optimal way. </seg>
<seg id="85"> It is therefore not only ideal for the prevention of fires increased pressure, but generally the sleep of comfort. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86"> Viskoelastische sparkling substances will not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special Fußpolstern used the legs and the vessels to provide relief. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Local producers use for example the foam materials Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Czech army has bought 445 kilometers Zündschnüre shopped with explosives were to be released. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The year Before, the Ministry of Defence has 224 miles powder to the army camp. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is reassuring to know that the armed forces for 225 years ausgesorgt. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The only problem is the durability of the Zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The army bought the Zündschnüre by the Company STV Group, including For paltry 40 million kronor. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In his reason for the purchase of this enormous amount of powder said the General Staff MF DNES, the soldiers would use per year to the 60 kilometres powder. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to the research from Armeepyrotechnikern, MF DNES point raised is clear from this data that the whole army of an intensive year pyrotechnic training - all generals and officers of the army commandos, up to the secretaries and cleaners. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Only then could the substantial annual consumption of 60 kilometers Zündschnüren reasonably justified. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This length to 25,000 Detonationen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> But even if this army inventory for more than ten years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But if the old rule of experts is that the training of each new professional soldiers two metres powder is quite sufficient, then the army by this Neueinkäufe - also from the point of view of the increased needs of the pioneering special units - a reassuring supply for the already mentioned 225 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> It complained soldiers of the quickly use Brigade recently, in the Defence Minister Vondra, they have almost no more cartridges for hand guns, so register are severely restricted because of the lack of resources. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "Me is not why they are such huge sums Zündschnüre buy." </seg>
<seg id="17"> But it is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need. " </seg>
<seg id="18"> "For us, the army is a good customer, which we, as traders to do as much as possible," says the sales manager of the STV Group. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the Ministry of Defence justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of powder, the army could so for at least ten years with this </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the expiry of the term use any ammunition to be tested thoroughly, whether it is reliable and must not endanger the lives of the soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="23"> These tests are not for nothing, but cost more money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers powder. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "It cost us 60% less than last year's supply of 244 miles," spokesman Pejšek tells us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Only by way of comparison, the annual consumption of Zündschnüren Pyrotechnikern of the police, the ammunition from the second world war or the Soviet brother army exceeds some years has barely 1,500 metres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> And the police always order just such quantities of ammunition it before the end of the Gebrauchsdauer can consume. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The safety of the Pyrotechniker because, in addition, one holds the possibility of more modern flexible purchases and therefore reliable Zündschnüre open. </seg>

<seg id="15"> Obviously against a fat compensation. </seg>
<seg id="16"> That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money in to arrest him. </seg>

<seg id="19"> At the time Luboš G. acquired the land fund, for example, land to build public roads were intended to be precise, more specifically, in the place where the construction of the area Borské Pole was planned. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Later He exchanged this very favourably with the government against a house directly in the historic center of the city, the value of the land far exceeded. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="10"> "WikiLeaks Amazon server." </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Free speech in the land of the free," shared the Enthüllungs activists by short news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time). </seg>
<seg id="12"> Shortly before the Internet company Amazon the Wikileaks documents from its servers. </seg>

<seg id="9"> But who would like to know more about ice, is not "gelato-University" the Italian firm Carpigiani over. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The ice-University has set up the manufacturers of Eismaschinen in 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines everywhere the high Italian ideals. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The three-day course for future Gelatieri has the largest feeder and visitors from around the world. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But there are also more day Spezialkurse around the Schokoladeneis and internships in the domestic Eisdiele. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Some dreams in the midlife Crisis of a new career, other cars simply let the treacherous ice of vague aspirations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil and Hungary to Saudi Arabia. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow-food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari declared the participants first of all, the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is not only good taste, but also the seidige fluidity and good consistency. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Luciano forgets his training but also not the icing on the cake of the national and even construction: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still plenty of romanticism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first step to manufacturing seems very simple. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Luciano dump the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a major Mixgerät with an electronic program everything to 85 degrees heated and then immediately to four degrees. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Then he turns to a tap on the machine, and is a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all Milcheissorten. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The teacher immediately with questions: Can ice cream only with natural substances without stabilizer? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How can one of their own Experimentierlust free rein? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Luciano warns, the spirit of the age to be fooled. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients", has probably still stabilisers - usually a natural product, such Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Of course you can ice without stabiliser, only it must then be sold within a day in, and the customer bite on Eiskörnchen louder. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Certain variations in the mass are allowed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It gets more thrilling with the flavours. </seg>
<seg id="32"> For the taste in the ice maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients which one buys in the fruit-department or the sweets of the supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, there are powder and Pasten. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "The suppliers are all trying to foist onto dozens of aromatic additives." </seg>
<seg id="35"> "But you should just experiment." </seg>
<seg id="36"> Either the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruit. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Or in the ice cream from the white Grundmasse, with eggs on the yellow cream and cocoa powder into the basis for all kinds of Schokoladen-Verführungen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Now the course participants in the Eismaschinen. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano will each have four different types of Vanille-, Schokolade-, Mokka- and produce Haselnuss-Eis - with or without eggs in the mass with more or less Vanillearoma or other natural additives. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The same experiment will also be subject to the Fruchteissorten. </seg>
<seg id="41"> More flavourings, more fruit Püree - geschmacklich is not necessarily better. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Haselnuss-eis tastes to nussiger if it contains more hazelnuts. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The most popular kiwi ice, the working group, the more fruit, using less water and less stabiliser. </seg>
<seg id="44"> A balanced mixture stresses the taste of a Gelato properly first, says Luciano. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: Will peach-Püree used with a lot of sugar, the sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For Zitroneneis an extra dose of sugar is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano a device, with which he prefers the sugar content of the fruit varieties (wine fairs so that the Oechsle in musts). </seg>
<seg id="48"> Fortunately for the calculation of tables. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Ice to make requires not so much physical use as before. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Not only the device for the automatic restoration of basic mass helps. </seg>
<seg id="51"> There is also a device in which the ready-made ice-mix at the same time cremig beaten and cooled on minus temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Despite all the automated remain accidents. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The Brazilian Gustavo acquitted him and his colleagues from top to bottom with Fruchtpüree than the colossal hand blenders spiral out of control. </seg>
<seg id="54"> "In every direction," says Maestro Luciano, "it is only a matter of time until something happens." </seg>

<seg id="8"> And because the universities no data on the performance of their students, is trying the exceptional talent in practice projects to spot and keep. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> On the second day of the workshop at the Tu Brunswick the car company group solicits the talents. </seg>
<seg id="10"> A young lady from the personnel department distributed pens, wine gum and Mappen with VW logo. </seg>

<seg id="17"> "otherwise, the focus was on the technical project", says Selle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The battle for fresh graduates will be even harder. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In many industries, companies no longer their employees can choose from a large flock of candidates. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But they must praise and particularly for highly skilled workers balzen. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Mainly graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position. </seg>
<seg id="22"> According to the Association of German engineers VDI remained in October about 40,000 engineers are vacant. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Also New drilling off the Atlantic coast remain banned for now. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This informed Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The trigger for the strict ban, at least for the next five years, is the explosion of Bohrplattform "Deepwater Horizon" in April. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Before the accident that claimed the lives and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had pressure from the opposition and the industry his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The supporters want to reduce the dependence of the US of oil supplies from abroad. </seg>

<seg id="15"> At present, the competent authority, which was in disrepute, radically reformed after numerous corruption charges. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In parallel, Obama has announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and Gaskonzerne. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Just two weeks ago it was in the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth come to a violent explosion. </seg>

<seg id="9"> The bodies have not been recovered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Now family and friends with a commemoration reminiscent of the deaths. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Ten thousand people had gathered at a radiant sunshine in Greymouth on the New Zealand South island. </seg>
<seg id="12"> They were silent for Two minutes. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In honor of the verschütteten miners were 29 tables, where helmets, lamps and the names of the sidekick. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Splatter fits the art cinema? </seg>
<seg id="3"> The director Nicolas winding Refn testing with his fighters-epic "Walhalla Rising". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In what may the Danish director Nicolas winding Refn have thought, when he has turned "Walhalla Rising"? </seg>
<seg id="5"> A captured Viking warriors with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) freed themselves from his Peinigern and places with almost superhuman powers his opponents to - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody Action, precisely because our hero like thuggish killing methods and his enemies at the Gedärme from the living body, if he has bad mood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On the other hand, says Einauge, as he is called, the whole film about a word, and the other characters can at most times to one or two sentences or a few painful death shouting. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Otherwise, silence and the gruselig beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland geschwelgt, the Vikings world of about a thousand years ago the scene. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Ideal for adult Cineasten with interest to Existentialismus and very quiet camera journeys. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Well, if a film has several target groups, it is a shame if they are mutually exclusive. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Director Winding Refn is regarded as a kind of Danish his wild and gestylten drug dealer trilogy "Pusher" version of Quentin Tarantino, but refuses stoically, his works with something more humour to the mainstream or a little less brutality the Arthouse accessible. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Most art cinema-friends are around the spritzenden brain mass and the Gedärmen deterred. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Action-fans will die from boredom, if Einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and pins an eternity in depression and fog before the team arrives in America and there is silent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" has found no cinema-lending in Germany and now only on DVD. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is particularly the magnificent pictures a shame, but also because, behind the prätentiösen until bluttriefenden facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In This film is not about dialogues or a stringent action, it is all atmosphere, a film a fever dream. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> And there is no escape for the viewer. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Refn takes him barely a moment of détente and drawn him with his icy images and the dark drift-like sound track very slowly cut the throats, but above all with the incredible hatred of him from the heart of the characters. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Only a small blonder boy, faithful to the Einauge retains as something as innocence, all others are driven by anger. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The vast majority of the one-eyed man hero whose motives are never explained, but for enemies and temporary allies at some point warriors from hell, perhaps the Ambassador of the devil himself. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It means destruction, but perhaps only for the Verdorbenen anyway. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> "Walhalla Rising" is an unexplained film you hate and admire, the angry, upset and astonishment. </seg>
<seg id="22"> An experience. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Mysterious Erdarbeiten </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Atomic Energy authority IAEA has new evidence of a clandestine nuclear program in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But the country refuses to comment, nor is it controls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> About midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 fighter planes, a mysteriöses würfelförmiges building in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is on the banks of the Euphrates; the next bigger city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair as-Saur. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Your name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, Syria allegedly built with help from North Korea in the Quader, hidden in a valley by the electricity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing of the US foreign secret service by the end of April 2008 would also under the name of the nearby town of el-Kibar normal have been well suited to produce plutonium - to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes against the technology from the fifties. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA ran a video presentation with fuzzy satellite images. </seg>
<seg id="10"> By Computeranimation ignored it, where the components of the reactor before the destruction, a verkleinerte copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Moreover, it presented photographs that show the buildings from near or even the interior space. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor is just before the operation, it said, but not yet with pellets peppers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more than it was then known, the mystery with time rather bigger. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Former U.S. President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack was fairly certain that Syria in el-Kibar built a reactor, but hardly saw evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some intelligence officers in Europe are even more cautious and only talk of an "alleged reactor," even if the CIA presentation for "plausible". </seg>
<seg id="16"> You lack of hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Asked how confident he was to have a reactor, said a senior UN diplomat in summer just flat, the IAEA "has enough material to ask questions". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The ruins of the alleged "unused military building" in the Syrians are urgently and planierten thoroughly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, an IAEA team in June 2008 under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium, which has been produced by people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Moreover, the IAEA about a member State satellite pictures of commercial providers in the period immediately after the attack, which might be more powerful than the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, these recordings on the market, because of the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - it has bought exclusive. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The IAEA can therefore not independently verify its authenticity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always claimed to have operated a secret nuclear programme or to have built a reactor. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium comes from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But the IAEA to analyse the particles as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss - as well as on the satellite images. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Inspectors also denied a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the ruins of bombed-out building. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But Israel says pugnaciously. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We will never comment on," said recently at the time of the attack acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> So the investigation of the case since June 2008 and fruitless "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna gives - after all, is a grave violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area, about which the IAEA watchdog. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As a key to progress in the investigation to the IAEA apparently sees three more bodies, "functional link" with the alleged reactor And this still exist. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The inspectors have not disclosed what plants are, or what they are or what they seem suspicious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung they are in the IAEA internally as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah described, in turn, derived from nearby towns. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and on a complex in Masyaf, in which it is most probably one of the suspicious objects. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It is probably in or directly next to a military base - just with this justification refused Syria IAEA access to the three locations. </seg>
<seg id="36"> It is said In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA by the United States will vorgeschickt auszuspähen military installations. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Because the nuclear detectives were the result of a tip of the US secret services on the institutions closely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that between the three locations and the Euphrates Quader material was moved back and forth. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could "in connection with the fuel production". </seg>
<seg id="40"> But there were "no indications of sensitive activities", uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes that are necessary to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The reactor will be operated with uranium, not enriched. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But where the uranium could have come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated on these central issues there are plausible conjecture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> It is also unclear whether other debris that could bring valuable traces were stored at the three locations. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As if the hundreds of truck loads of disappeared, nobody wants information about where the debris. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Only a few kilometers from al-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, salt mine al-Tibni Syria 1998 to investigate its suitability as a camp for radioactive waste, the IAEA as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had it in a recent analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Footage from the orbiting point, however, that Syria to the three suspect sites Erdarbeiten and large container, after the IAEA had demanded access. </seg>
<seg id="48"> This can be coincidence, but has hardly helped dispel the suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> It is also stated In diplomatic circles, have spent many months to develop a plan for inspections there, it should allow Syria to keep possible military secrets alone shows how much interest the inspectors is the effort. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte this proposal too. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Had Western diplomats in Vienna even a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, therefore, have no high urgency, approximately US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months so-called special inspections into the game, one of the toughest means the Vienna nuclear authority to control. </seg>
<seg id="52"> IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, these inspections should propose, has been "an option, for which I am open in the future" he hesitates. </seg>
<seg id="53"> It is a high risk in this way: On the one hand, it needs a majority in the board of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented there are keen for an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other hand, as a diplomat recalled: "What if they end up nothing? </seg>

<seg id="1"> The demokatrische routine </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The democracy movement in Latin America will be stronger, such as the support of private companies. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="5"> These results came the Latinobarómetro survey carried out in 18 countries and exclusive was published in the Economist. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This survey is being carried out regularly since 1995 and shows that the change in this region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two facts in this year's survey in September and October, particularly in's eye. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First the good mood in Latin America </seg>
<seg id="9"> And secondly the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In many countries of the South American Pacific coast has greatly increased the democracy movement (see table 1). </seg>
<seg id="11"> In Peru, for example, where the economy every year since 2002, at around 6%, the number of democracy advocates of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In Mexico, where the economy since the onset last year recovered, is such a trend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries of the region, are what lowers the regional average (Diagram 2). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Approximately 44% of the respondents said that they be satisfied with the democratic practice of the same as last year, 25% more than in 2001 (diagram 3). </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some 34% trust the convention of their country and 45% of their government. Both values are those of last year, but show a sharp increase from 2003 (17% and 24%). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> A decade ago Latin America's economic crisis undermined the efforts to bring more democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Also during the global economic crisis continued, perhaps that the countries of Latin America experienced only a brief recession and a speedy recovery. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Moreover, the poor were caught by a stronger social network. </seg>
<seg id="19"> (According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week the poverty rate in Latin America only slightly and is again this year by 32%.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But there is strong atmosphere differences (from country to country. Diagram 4). </seg>
<seg id="21"> Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread Fortschrittsdenken. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In Mexico and Central America, where the recession mount and violent crime have increased, this is less the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Only the second time since the poll began many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country, a bigger problem than in unemployment (5). </seg>
<seg id="24"> Some 31% say that either they or a family member last year were victims of a crime. But declined the values and 38% last year, reaching the lowest level since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and the market economy: Approximately 71% of respondents on regional said that the private sector is essential for the development, in 2007 it was 56% (6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> Approximately 58% said that only the market economy their country can bring progress, compared with 47% in the last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela this view maintained (and 80% for a private sector), though their leftist President, Hugo Chávez, nationalised many private companies. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> In the weeks after the sudden death of your man told Argentina's President, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, their popularity rate by 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Whether this helps her to a re-election next year, it depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández is willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The signs are not clear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Néstor Kirchner, even after the election, his wife economic policy, was often budget plans, the tax revenue, economic growth and inflation does not fully into account. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This allowed the couple to spend the extra revenue as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On paper, the Fernández-government lost the majority in Congress last year. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is divided and Kirchners death after a heart attack on 27 October, leading to further disagreements. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But after chaotic meetings (which a member of another in the face, and others accused the government of corruption), the Congress, the budget for 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I will not discuss," the President. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The 2010 budget now for the next year, which the President has more opportunity to spend money as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy is hot: Probably it will increase this year by up to 9%. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official inflation rate is z.Z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - up to almost 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner took office in 2003, when Argentina was beset by economic crisis, said growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not reduce inflation. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He refused to cooperate with the IMF, has singled out for bullying as the private sector and säuberte the National Institute for Statistics and census INDEC, prompting the official inflation statistics schönte. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Can Fernández take a more moderate way now? </seg>
<seg id="18"> It has business and union leaders for talks. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And According to official statements should be limited to 18% next year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have a strong boost to the economy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the inflation undermined the growth spurt by a large devaluation in the year 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Perhaps for this reason, Cristina Fernández Argentine financial economically back to the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with shareholders, the former rescheduling of the country in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Now it seems Fernández on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which it owes about $6.7 billion. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Kirchners have had a review by the IMF, as happens elsewhere, always rejected. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But last month, the economy minister, Amado Boudou known that the funds in the drafting of a new national consumer price index "technical support". It looks as if this were the first step to clear up the INDEC. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not known whether Fernández after leaving office without the support of her husband politically active. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If so, it needs the support of the middle class, most of Kirchnerismus. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the Argentinians in March from their summer holidays, the wave of Sympatie she was shown abgeebbt. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If they would like to win another election, she must decide whether they many political decisions of their man quietly lifted. </seg>

<seg id="4"> On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the electorate, to elect mayors and city councils in the five city districts. this is a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou. </seg>
<seg id="5"> By building a cutting-edge business relations, einschl. of a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbol for relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Ma has the test, but only just. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party, three of the five mayors, it received a majority vote. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has a greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In a presidential election would mean for Ma problems. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Since his election two years ago, the percentage of his party about 8%. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For the first time, the DPP, together with the KMT in town councils. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as truck convoys with Krawallmachern, flag-shift end mass parades and only scantily clad dancers. </seg>
<seg id="13"> There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT held a speech at a KMT candidate on the eve of the election, </seg>
<seg id="15"> When a man shot in his face from the crowd. LIEN was wounded and a umstehender spectators were killed. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Bizarre wiser is not clear whether the shooter Lien kill or wanted to settle a dispute with the candidates. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Regardless of the attack, according to Tsai mine-whom, the leader of the DPP, the election and the DPP in a bad light, what the KMT has brought more votes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Remarkably the ties with the mainland. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Instead, the candidates discussed on plans to housing and the creation of jobs. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat. </seg>
<seg id="22"> For This reason, the KMT their relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But this time the DPP avoided, the anti-Chinese feelings too much. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Ma in turn would like to confirm that the majority of the Taiwanese its China policy. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The government in Beijing will continue to pursue his strategy, Taiwan with economic incentives in the Community. </seg>
<seg id="27"> China sent a negotiator to Taipei, immediately prepare for a summit to investment security and medical cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Certainly it wants a political integration. But the most important things first. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is thus prefer to wait until after the presidential elections in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The DPP has since reinvented. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Two years ago it was strongly weakened, the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption. </seg>
<seg id="32"> During his presidency from 2000 to 2008 he was strongly for the absolute independence. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But under Tais reign has developed a new generation gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the employees and the youth. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Tsai took place as the presidential candidate of the DPP approval, such as Su Tseng-Chang Chen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Their party is doing everything now to show that it is capable of building close ties to Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Tsai is planning a think tank as a contact point between the DPP and China. however, this requires open-minded discussion. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Tsai stated publicly that their party is a "reliable alternative" offer to Mas vorschneller rapprochement with China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Chen seems very angry about this change. </seg>
<seg id="39"> From his cell, he said, the candidate of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence. </seg>
<seg id="40"> He called the pragmatists Su even to abandon the presidential candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even without Chen's intervention does the DPP hard to choose their possible candidates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The KMT will have to undergo own self-analysis. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Mas values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidate wanted their campaign without him. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The main reason for his unpopularity unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="45"> According to the statement of a KMT spokesman he will alter his cabinet and the local institutions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> The strong performance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is a rapprochement only restricted. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Arsenic-resistant microbe could allow new forms of life on the planet or elsewhere </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The discovery of a foreign variety, among other things, of arsenic can live opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on the planet and elsewhere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, it is their view, a sign that a life without the hitherto considered vital elements is possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "This organism has two options." </seg>
<seg id="5"> "He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "That makes it a very particular reason, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' way of life is," said Paul C.W. Davies of the Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears in the online edition of the journal Science on Thursday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> So far six main elements were regarded as vital - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> But as the scientists figured out, there is a growing bacterium in the Californian mono Lake even further if it phosphorus by arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "One wonders what else is possible," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar of the Arizona State University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is an important step in the search for außerirdischem life since scientists life and his forms must recognise, Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study deals with microbes which were found on the earth. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The announcement of a press conference in which no details on the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report by the discovery Außerirdischen life could act. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "shows that in other planet systems organisms with the help of other elements biochemical processes can set in motion and that the 'standard', which we believe are absolutely vital, not necessarily said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute held University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockel was not part of the research team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "This work is a first, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures element can be replaced by another," added Cockell. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> This discovery was not accidental. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Felisa Wolfe-Simon from Astrobiologischen NASA Institute, who led the study, chose the mono Lake because of the high arsenic levels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Since arsenic and phosphorus chemically identical, that microbes that both are exposed, perhaps they can replace an element from the other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "The toxicity of the Arsens is based mainly on the fact that it is behaving chemically similar as phosphorus." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "This the organisms find it hard to separate an element from the other." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "But the difference is so great that arsenic different than phosphorus. it in our biochemisches system, where it covered almost everything," says Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers used the bacterium GFAJ-1 rising arsenic concentration. It suited to and grew. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The microbe is growing phosphorus better, but that they also can survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based life form can happen, of course, either on the ground or on another planet or Moon on the arsenic occurs more frequently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> According to Jamie S. Foster, Dozentin for microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic But so far there has been no functioning example. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Arsenic happened in the early Erdjahren more, she says, the science is therefore assumed that early life forms have used it. </seg>

<seg id="6"> But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted applications to court, the grounds for an appeal and the courts for years to come. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> One of the most provocative reasons is that it through intensive reporting on the process, even by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - a "circus atmosphere" and such a widespread, swift penetration rebel details, so that the jury was improperly influenced by the public indignation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This protest Appelationsgerichte could lead to deal with the question of whether the new technologies require new rules in the court. </seg>

<seg id="18"> The Twitter issue is just one of many, the lawyers of Mr. Hayes explain to discuss years and thus delaying a condemnation. </seg>

<seg id="21"> The defenders say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge mistakenly a jury have exchanged views, a critic of the department, and that he improperly exerted pressure on the ruling, as he had taken the unusual decision, the jury over the weekend. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The judges were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But their arguments about the impact of the extensive reporting on the process is perhaps the greatest interest. </seg>

<seg id="2"> After a campaign to Schimpfwörtern and negativity is little civility in Washington this week. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It is the sign of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion, before quickly back to the fight of the parties in the capital? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress produced no breakthrough on the big issues, while the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a period of government in which no decisions to be taken. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After all, what we hear, it has not been a polite discussion between two sides an account of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a party points. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meeting of the deficit of the President's on Wednesday was also civilised, despite the political differences between the members to continue. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months a mutual respect, of the ideological divide that separates them, the members. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> This is hard enough to claim that it is a new era of cooperation here. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Both sides are now in a testing phase - one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise, while tried the limits of public opinion and the patience of the electorate, </seg>
<seg id="10"> So the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants at a minimum requirements or accusations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep for rapid change the atmosphere in the past two years </seg>
<seg id="12"> Whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or benefits, the two sides are miles apart. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Finally, the November election Washington at least for a short time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center" works. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "It is inevitable after elections. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elections are partisan passions die. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And that is good. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the "lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution." </seg>
<seg id="19"> Bush's tax cuts at the end of the year, and no one </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, either temporarily or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that believing that favors tax cuts for the rich, while unemployed workers support. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House is the increased optimism that, in these issues during the "lame duck session" and also the new START treaty can ratify. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation in pressing issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation of the parties must, if the new 112. Congress in January. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead, he says, is a stage of the Nichtübereinstimmens likely, perhaps even inevitable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "After the things that have to be done is done, this short-term psychology in turn confrontation," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - courtesy of genuine cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "I see a lot of what is happening from today until 2012, when Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event in 2012," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Teeparty-voters who serve their education. </seg>
<seg id="29"> How worried the Republican leaders also may be that they too high poker, they know that they must try to their promises to reduce government spending and healthcare reform. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> This party lines are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the deficit Commission clearly what a tax reform and raising some taxes and raising the retirement age and reduce government spending. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles took one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, according to their own assessment, pushed the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes with its plan to official recommendation and they are very close to this number. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The biggest opposition in the elected representatives of the body, because in finance, at least, little room or little sympathy for compromises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Galston says two stages in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The first battle next year in the form of party clashes, if the Republicans in the state budget, taxes and the health care system, later followed by a period of major zweiparteilicher cooperation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> Public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It is proven that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties work together. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If confrontation leads to a dead end as it happened in 1995, then both sides must carefully on the public reaction. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Who is always condemned to losing, will have to change tack and seek the compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> In fact, This may be an optimistic view. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Partisanship and polarization is greater now than in the middle of the 1990's, and they seem to have a more ideological gulf between Obama and the Kongress-Republikanern to be between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At the same time activists on both parties 2010 as a mere prelude to a far wider choice to 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> So seen the politeness which is carried this week for the show will be welcomed by many Americans. </seg>
<seg id="45"> But it will require very much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the issues that the two still separated. </seg>

<seg id="10"> With each of these developments the fear under the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs hindered their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "There is still disagreement and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organisation, the regime. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "For them was the life under the Khmer Rouge is glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "It is splitting families." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> During the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, revision or hunger. </seg>

<seg id="32"> The mission of the Court it is the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities to condemn, but it is not said whether it will pursue further action beyond these four cases. </seg>
<seg id="33"> That has done little to the fears in Anlong Veng. </seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="3"> The deal was in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The US government has for years tried to convince Belarus, not collect more highly enriched uranium and appeared to have reached a hurdle last spring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But officials of the U.S. government told the Washington Post that in the last two months, two secret agreements with Belarus have been taken to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a research center. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The setting the stage for the agreement on Wednesday, to remove the rest of the material, according to an official staff because of the sensitivity of the subject, anonymous, about 500 pounds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear security summit of the 47 nations" in April, the White ruled Russia. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And it was obvious good enough, at the invitation of the former Soviet republic to secure the next summit in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I was really enthusiastic about the fact that they want a seat in the nuclear security summit (2012)." </seg>
<seg id="10"> "It shows me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the partnership Global security, a group promoting nuclear safety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Clinton called the agreement "a very significant step" of Belarus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials within four years. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since then, the U.S. government six countries, their highly enriched uranium to get rid of. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Belarus will be the seventh. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, the Byelorussian President Alexander Lukashenko has said that the nation will never give up its uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "How retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which basically weapons is capable of, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at that time. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "This is our raw material... </seg>
<seg id="19"> We will not make any dirty bombs from this and we will not sell it to anybody. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Belarus still approached a few months ago the United States, interest in the meeting of an agreement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The first Attempt to remove the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material easily contaminated by radiation, say officials. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It was in a Spezialzug load, the more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, officials say. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The U.S. government pays $14 million for this effort, with a large part of the money flowing in the Belarusian research with depleted uranium, which can be used for nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "This was extremely careful coordinated in order to build confidence," which led to the agreement which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, the global threat reduction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende study estimates that Belarus this year at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium, and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Belarus will be under the joint agreement camps until 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But the statement Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement. </seg>

<seg id="2"> The president of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility that it could come to a merger wave of the savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry will be restructured. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Zapatero and the red line Germany </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin has opted for keeping the euro, but at the same time, conditions for the whole of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tension on the markets have triggered a double response of the government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has submitted new adaptation measures, starting with tax rebates for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary work agencies or the abolition of the 426 euros support for unemployed up to the privatisation of 49 per cent of AENA, the management of airports Barajas and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former government Minister Felipe González the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis presents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How are these transactions to understand? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their public relations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is Germany a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future to maintain ancient traditions of a large part of his partner. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Given the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south to leave the euro area. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Second: The reintroduction of the German Mark - although it is more science fiction sounds, supported by a large part of public opinion, approximately 50% of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The Third: A transformation of the euro in accordance with German proposals. This means: More macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; Punishment of the countries, crossing the requirements; möglichereweise the default of certain countries, as well as the expansion of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is clear and has been for some time. So there are no excuses now. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits, and the German Government constitutional reform in order to prevent it from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It was the first signs of the polarisation between what Germany was thought necessary (strict fiscal plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second sign the Central European country when Merkel postponed the decision to save Greece painful,. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Then it was strongly criticised. But the fact is that the political agreement in Germany, the public and the published opinion absolutely against a rescue of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally, Merkel in the last October days again with a clear position. It calls for a reform of the agreements of the European Union in order to facilitate the rescue of a country and at the same time, to a part of the cost. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position was interpreted as anti-European as Ireland crisis and everything is as follows. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But her proposal, if a little sweetened, was approved in the coming months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which these measures from 2013. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has drawn a red line that it intends not to exceed. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It says all that - even if unpopular measures must be taken, as of that date will no longer be the old ways of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="24"> 2013 will be the birth of a new currency area, in which the countries to ban be severely punished, be forced to declare themselves bankrupt and in this case, the private sector must take on a part of the costs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows us that we need a strong growth path, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improve productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as was mentioned by Spain in boom times, will simply not be tolerated. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would do badly not understand it. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not just about the deficit to 3% by the year 2013 runterzufahren. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much tougher. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Under these conditions, And the worst thing we could do is to cheat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the current turbulence in more rest. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And that we will use the opportunities offered to us by early 2013. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero has taken this so well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the major companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, in order to make their way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But Germany-red line is there, and it is not that something would change. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Among the possibilities is that we are the countries with little serious full gestopften euro area, not to be excluded. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Sports and rule bypass </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tricks as Alonso and Ramos in the match against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will of a sanctions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The alleged two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) instigated exclusion in the game of 23 November against Ajax in the champions League led to much ink has been spilled about whether it was a unsportliche act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA. </seg>
<seg id="4"> As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before game end (their team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls, now that the referee showed them the second yellow card. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way, and since the Real Madrid his group, the two players the prescribed sanction the next league game against the Auxerre and without maps in the next game phase. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Finally, the Disziplinarkommitee of UEFA, the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with various sums of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow card in this or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but followed in this event. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of the debate that have arisen outlined the case goes back to that a team of the football club Real Madrid (which in his anthem blocked and honour and on other occasions his players for similar incidents had punished) played in the drama by Mourinho, an episode to its long history as theatralischer and provocative technicians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case, the debate about whether this is not explicitly banned by the statutes behavior contradicts the principles of the sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a rule circumvention. Indeed, this approach to the statutes of the sport, but its meaning. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The damage caused to the sporting spirit should be examined. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect which was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the offending players an unjustified benefited from the team. that has not been done. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradox of the action of the Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally under wrong game or rule bypass understand, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly taken to avoid a penalty, but it should be as striking as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players waited and took the sanction happily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is what kind of advantage the offender from the deliberate fouls. </seg>
<seg id="17"> It should be emphasised that the rival either in a disadvantageous position was still benefits for the feigned game were erheischt, because the obvious result of this action was that the team had to play with fewer players. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because then the club does not have these players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Obviously the advantage is that the players the next phase of the Champions League game without tickets, their participation in a future game could begin. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a long-term, up to a certain point uncertain advantage, because the team eventually leave. In addition, the players with this approach a penalty and in the second Kartenzyklus because of card accumulation with a card less than in the first cycle. </seg>
<seg id="21"> So it is not clear whether it is really an advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the sporting spirit, also strategic decisions at a maximum benefit from the rules. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case the players wanted to avoid any penalties (that would be a clear case of Regelumgehung), they wanted more choose when they undergo this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They took a strategic decision without a sentence or to flee before her. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Although the boundary between inventiveness and rule surroundings is blurred, I think that this issue is a clear case of inventiveness. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the controversy has arisen because of two factors: Because it was two exclusions and because of the way the provoked Regelübertragung. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The damage done to the principles of the sport by these acts is less ethical than aesthetic. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for the umpteenth time an internal rebellion in the ranks of the after the loss of 11 Members and half of the rows </seg>
<seg id="5"> The party chairman is aware that his threat of resignation the close to the former party leader, Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the impact of this sector is now so weakened as her mentor, and he will not bring the same headaches as other former currents. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Therefore the leader of Esquerra with a nod to the new critics to win, which would secure his position until the next local elections. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> For the beginning kündete yesterday that more than 200 regional council members of ERC on his secret could stay in office. </seg>
<seg id="8"> With ballot papers, not with superior hand. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If the Carodisten wanted to miss the Präsidenen a parking ticket, they could do this without fear of reprisals. </seg>

<seg id="12"> The Carod close to demand the president is more than just the party office. An inadequate gesture, since Puigcercós the supreme body of controlled congresses. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But since they do not have a sufficient majority to speeding up of resignations, they will be the chairman of an action plan from now until May. </seg>
<seg id="14"> For this they expect that in the drafting of the document on strategic reorientation that the leadership on 18 will submit to the vote in the Council to be able to participate. </seg>

<seg id="17"> In this sense, the article, which the President-in-Conseller Josep Huguet signed in his blog, symptomatic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Given the Puigcercós is an ideologue, kept the holders of Innovació it for a fact that the party chairman "in exchange for various objectives" will be based. </seg>
<seg id="19"> He was one of five to two. </seg>
<seg id="20"> First, the "restructuring" of the board, so that at least 90 percent of the party members, that means the inclusion of new faces from Carods environment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The second could be the great news. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Huguet Suggests ERC should the General Assembly principle as a functioning finally abandon. </seg>
<seg id="23"> He verfechtet a reform of the Statute, which should make it possible to hold the meetings with elected delegates. </seg>

<seg id="5"> The lights are responsible for 8% of global emissions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is the equivalent of 70% of emissions of global vehicle fleets. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen keep on average between 6,000 and 10,000 hours. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The new LED bulbs, such as those that the manufacturers Philips has put on the market this week - this society has taken part in the UN - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-hot pear, a hint of the savings of the Auswechselungsplanes should be applied in 100 countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Besides the fact that iese completely new light bulbs very little heat, they can work also with a rheostat. </seg>
<seg id="14"> And they do not contain any mercury. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The affair WikiLeaks has a twofold significance. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On one hand, it proved to be an obvious scandal dictator, a scandal that only a scandal in Sinner hypocrisy is the Beziehunge between states, the citizens and the press. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other Hand announces it profound changes at international level, and is a foretaste of the future dominated by regression. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But we are going in the right order. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any drafted by a secret service) composed exclusively of newspaper cuttings. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi's throw anything more than what you over several months anyway in any other Journal to read (except for those whose owners Berlusconi), and the frightening karikaturierte profile Gaddafi's offered Kabarettkünstlern for a very long time for their Sketche. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The principle of the secret dossier should only be already known news is essential for the dynamism of the secret services, and not just in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go to a library, esotherischen publications, you will see that every plant (on the grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) exactly what happened in previous works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is not, therefore, that the author occult texts does not want to publish enquiries (still therefore, that he would not know where exist to find), but because those who are the Okkultismus, nothing other than what they already know and confirmed what they have learned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> As the secret files. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informant is lazy and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (for example, it could otherwise be whatever editor in Libération), the only true considers what he acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Top Secret information on Berlusconi, the American Embassy in Rome had sent the Staatsdezernat were the same as those who already Newsweek published the week before. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> So why was such a fuss about the revelations of this dossier? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On one side suggests that any educated person already know and that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the Government can call each other or a plane, in order to make dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of a couple of small have changed. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Any viewer of investigation films knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that acting to ignore it. </seg>
<seg id="18"> However, the fact to repeat it publicly, violated the task of hypocrisy and serves to American diplomacy in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In second place: The idea that an any old hacker can tap the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world, is the most significant blow to the prestige of the Staatsdezernats. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, rather than victims, the scandal the "Executioner" in trouble. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we are the profound nature of what happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Previously, Orwell's time, it was all power as a Big Brother pool, every gesture of his subjects. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwell's prophecy could have where one can control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction, visited the hotel, the elected motorway and so on; the citizens would total victims of the eye of power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But if we see what is happening today, that even the secret Krypten power no longer control of a Hackers can escape, to be directed Kontrollgang and will circle shaped. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - chosen as avenger by the citizen - the secrets of power in experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> How can a power that is no longer able to protect their own secrets? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be unveiled); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel of Geheimis, because it exposes the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks disclosed that the secrets of Hillary Clinton any power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> WikiLeaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What are the consequences of this injury, which has caused a big power? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the states in future no longer online information - that would be a reserved in the street corner angeklebten form. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is also clear that with the current technology in vain hope is confidential reports on telephone secret. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is easier than finding out whether and when a Head of state in a plane and continuing contacted one of his colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could in future private and only to some ears certain relationships? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know very well that my prediction at the moment for science fiction and novel prison, but I am forced to imagine the government agents in secret way preoccupied on uncontrollable march routes shattering, their communications anywhere else than the mere memory of decay, and the few written information they received in the footwear (verbergend. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information would be stored in single copy in closed drawers: Basically the Spionageversuch of Watergate had less success, as WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity to write that the technology as a cancer progresses, namely backwards. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionised the communication, the Internet reconstructed a telegraph with (telephone) line. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The (analogue) video cassettes, the film allows them a film band for broadband auszukundschaften by forward from behind spulen and could reveal all mysteries of the assembly, while the (digital) CDs, today nothing other than from chapter to chapter to jump in macro-portions. </seg>

<seg id="8"> The EU announced that in 2010 2.2 billion euros to have released what they are on the right path to Respektbezollung commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But if you look in detail, things are a little more complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should be according to the Copenhagen treaty "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional deployment, without detriment of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what "new and additional" means. </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the Commission had proposed a harmonisation, certain Member states, including France, the procedure blocked. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today everyone chooses the benchmark, which he considers the best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The EU Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those of the year 2009: The international funding are maintained, and 150 million in "the framework of the fast-start" over three years. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries have similar standards, either on year or about conditions at the level of public development aid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In return, France was of the opinion that the funding of all new projects "of the year 2010 are" new and additional ". </seg>
<seg id="17"> In other words, there are no guidelines on the spending of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Specifically, the sum total of French support for developing countries remain stable (or decline) - France, his commitment to the "new and additional funding". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is still no rule, and everyone chooses his Rechenmodus. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, such as France, 1 borrowed €as being equivalent to €1 donated. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Obviously this is only reasonable that the effort is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to the emission reduction projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro, for a donated euro... should also hijacked only the cost of the loan for the capital donor country than commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France has nothing else in terms than the following consideration: it "respected" his obligation of 420 million euros by 91.5% loan (389,8 million euro) and of 36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to convince themselves. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only land the EU that loans to a great extent. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among other things) their commitments to 100% with donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €to fulfil their obligations, France just 10 cents and understands including a comparable effort. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Fine Hokuspokus! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> All in all, operates France in its fast-start financing with a double fraud: To A part with a Weiterentwicklkung of the action over the period and partly with the reality of financial support. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France manage to think that 420 million "new and additional" millions in agreement with his promise and saves 36.1 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the Treasury (as it appears that it was Bercy, the arbitrage has carried out) could be a double negative impact; even EU internally (why the other member states with the donations, if there is to lend?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries not completely fooled... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter of the premature funding only a small issue on relatively short time compared to the discussions on the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it could be too much in the massive machinery of the UNFCCC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> We hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As always, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year of early funding. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In the first France could announce a change in its accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, and in a spirit of respect for his obligations and the counterbalancing justice with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> But especially France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of long-term financing dispute (another and at the moment: You can escape The question of "Verrechenbarkeit" or the recording its loans. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could alter his position to be just as progressive with regard to the disputes, as it is in other things. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The hope is based on the new environment minister Kosciusko-Morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A surprising announcement on the fast-starting of France and his vision of the "Verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loans would increase the international confidence by nature, which is necessary for further discussions. </seg>
