The altenpflegeheim reaffirms that the deaths were not due to "lack of action" are 
The owners of the altenheims in olot not conclude from that their carers on eleven elderly people killed 
The leaders of the altenpflegeheims la caritat in olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday, in which she highlighted the damage the criminal actions of Joan Vila dilmés - the nurses, who during his work at least eleven of old people, for which he was responsible, had killed - the establishment had caused. 
The head of the altenpflegeheims, Joan sala, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan cañada in court and announced, "la caritat would like the responsible (for the deaths) charges," but "the right and our accountability require the process and the civil liability." 
The establishment must be not only a social being discredited, because they accept the criminal actions of the pflegers had not reached in time, but now also a high repay figures from the rechtsvertretern the families of the victims will be calculated. 
Joan Vila dilmé acknowledged that the first crime in August 2009, and has since continued that he was murdered. 
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the altenpflegeheims - because he suspected that a doctor had examined the deceased personally, but the formalities due to their age and disease were handled by telephone. 
The head of La caritat verneinte this point and flatly declared that "a lack of measures keinerzeit the reason for the incidents could have been." 
The lawyer of La caritat added that there was "no evidence in the case of reckless actions by a different person than the accused there." 
The already as "todesengel" let confessed to the 11 murders and explained that the first crime perpetrated on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later, the second old lady to have murdered.

The head of La caritat stated that the access of staff to the drugs was hard to control. 
The insulinspritzen and the beruhigungsmittelcocktail, the nurses in six of nine crimes committed in the patients with the death of her suffering. 
But the results of the laboratory, will be whether Vila is lying, and for his first victims actually have a less cruel death, or whether he ausbrannte this from within, by offering them, as he bleichlauge verabreichte according to his confession in three women had done, he between 12 and 17 October. 
In La caritat listens to the testimony of the pflegers no faith, not even as the number of a murder, which could be much more. This attitude is justified that Vila very different statements before the Court, and that it had made no sense, though its approach after eight successful murders suddenly changed. 
They say that they made, it is for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents to the judiciary.
