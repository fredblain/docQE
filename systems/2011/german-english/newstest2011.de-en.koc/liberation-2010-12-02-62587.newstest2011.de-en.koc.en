Grand Paris métro: first financial vignettes 
Since the debate about the modernisation of the transport industry in the Paris region is in full swing, it rains billion. 
At least in the discussions. 
We call on this, in particular, the 23 billion for the metro grand Paris, in memory of the Société du Grand Paris is to be built. 
At the start of construction of the SGP to launch, the state has a kapitaldotation sighting of EUR 4 billion. 
In a theoretical way, this is the sum, which would allow the SGP then, on the markets of a part of the finanzsumme to her twin. 
Today it is finally came to first projections. 
The amending budget by 2010, this morning sifted from the Finance Committee of the National Assembly, which contains the measures envisaged, in order to raise money for the first part of this. 
It is of two types of measures: the creation of a special tax on the erschließund and higher taxation of offices on the ile-de France. 
The former, so remove one Article 15 of the draft law goes, 'for the benefit of the public clinic Société du Grand Paris. " 
This is quantified: "the product of this tax amounts to EUR 117 million per year." 
Zweitere is a reordering of the already existing business taxation: "in order to ensure that, in order to modernise the germ from it to increase product and this increase of the Société du Grand Paris to circumstances." 
How much would the whole? 
A mystery. 
This amount is not in the text. 
Of the 4 billion is still far off. 
"It is said that the fiscal resources to the EUR 4 billion of the kapitaldotation added, which will be paid for by the state and the Société du Grand Paris to and after the project to be done," says is the explanatory presentation. 
At the time of the SGP is this system do not offensive. 
"since the moment in which they scored revenue (the two taxes, D. R.), you can see the studies cover over three years, and then only from the 4 billion alive," explains. 
"This will be listed in the budget and progressively away." 
The SGP estimates that will be launched in 2013, the 4 billion for the budget to take note of 2014. 
This measure, whose 4 promised billion will still be able to seek, runs the risk of a very troubled, parliamentary discussion. 
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
