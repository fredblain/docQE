Public Prosecutor will Senator Ensign not 
Prosecutors in the justice department, have Senator John Ensign, acquitted of the charges after his case with a former wahlhelferin and his attempt to have her husband, a lobbying to gain, have been filed against him, gave the lawyers of the senator on Wednesday. 
This decision to end the worst rechtsvorwurf against Senator Ensign, a Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, the nationwide headlines and sparked a drubbing of his career, he was regarded as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. 
As Senator ensigns office announced that he was on the judgment after the year-long investigation "delighted." 
The ethikkomitee of the Senate, however, could still impose a disziplarstrafe. 
According to the ensigns lawyers from the justice department, they were informed that the investigations against Senator Ensign were recruited in this matter and that no further charges. 
The ministry did not comment on the case. 
The judgment was for many ethik-anwälte outside the justice department, a surprise. Her opinion there was sufficient evidence that the lobbying-verbot Ensign has ignored. 
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, which for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times have been revealed, gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election, to lucrative contracts that gave his silence about a case with hamptons wife Cynthia to charity. 
Cynthia Hampton ensigns during an election campaign, was working as a treasurer. 
Ensign, contact with few political friends in order to give Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogation he assumed for them after the cessation of hamptons lobbying. 
Since Hampton recently in ensigns wahlteam was, it was not for a year, he was allowed to lobby for his former employer, or the entire Senate. 
According to ethik-experten, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, before the case were chummy, against the so-called ban on the drehtür-lobbykratie. 
According to the published evidence "is apparently in order to make an agreement and to the violation of the drehtür-statuten," said Stanley brand, a Washington lawyer, to the defence of clients specialising in the sights of the government. 
While the ministry officially rejected it, the reasons for the decision in ensign-fall to announce, said Mr. fire and other ethikanwälten, the department notes include very careful on political charges after a large number of failures, the media have been followed with great interest, including the decision last year that the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens because of malfeasance on the part of the public prosecutor to drop. 
Prosecutors "are clearly schreckhaft," said Melanie sloan, the chairman of the association ," citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington" (an organisation whose aim of combating corruption in parliamentary and government circles in the United States is), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr. Ensign has brought before the courts. 
"This means, in principle, hochstehende government officials are now able to assume that the laws do not apply to you that," she added. 
Paul coggins, hauptverteidiger of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview on Monday that he had received a phone call to a public prosecutor and another the next day, in which he was told that the department, no complaints against his client will speak. 
Mr. ensigns defenders had cooperated with prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator, as his office in a statement on Wednesday repeated again, "in accordance with the law." 
Mr. coggins refused to take the legal arguments that he had brought to the public prosecutors to explain more. 
"I was not, in the gesprächsdetails between the Department of Justice and me to move. Only so much to be said: we believe, to have made the right decision," he said. 
Last month, the bundeswahlkommission decided that the investigation for a separate lawsuit by the group, after the payment of $96,000 of Mr. ensigns parents to the hamptons against the bundeswahlgesetz read. 
The electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money is anything other than a gift. 
NV energy, a large company in Nevada, which for a long time supported the senator, was one of the companies, in which Mr. Hampton thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyisten-arbeit took place. 
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that, after the company Mr. Hampton has helped as a lobbyist, Mr. ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a conversation with Mr. Hampton had, in which he announced that he is in the Interior Ministry for a cause, "anklopfe." 
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and other customers in Nevada, and allegiant air, agreed to lunch and asked the Transport Secretary, a meeting in the name of the airline to agree, after Mr. Hampton had hired to lobby. 
Last year, for the first time, information about this affair to the public, Mr. Ensign flats, apologize for his constituents and gave his position in the Senate, where he is in the order of precedence of the Republicans in fourth place. 
Not many months after he was struck, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he seek a third term in the Senate. 
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign would no longer be the objective of police investigation, said his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, the senator hope that the ethics committee is very quickly, the example of the justice department and as a result of its investigation einstelle. 
"Senator Ensign looks forward to his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada to continue," she said.
