Puigcercós addiction with a nod to the Carod close to peace in the ERC 
The Republican leader, allows the party a secret vote on his continuance in office. 
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the vollversammlungsprinzips. 
Joan puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for the umpteenth time, to an internal rebellion in the ranks of the following the loss of 11 Members, and half of the votes and rudderless ERC from the way to go. 
The leader is aware that his threat of resignation to the close of the former Labour Party Whip, Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira is not enough. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is now so weakened as her mentor itself and not give him the same headaches will spread, like other former currents. 
That is why the leader of Esquerra tries with a nod to the new critics to win, what its position until the next local elections. 
For the earlier announced yesterday that the more than 200 regional members of ERC over stay in office secret could express. 
With ballot papers, not sign of superior hand. 
If the carodisten the präsidenen wanted to miss a parking ticket, you could do this without fear of reprisals. 
Indeed, both the boss would give the impression of division, as well as the submission to his person. 
In several interviews, he stressed that he would deal with half of the vote plus one to feel not confirmed, and he added prozentwerten added, without giving a result "in Bulgarian style" would also not good. 
The Carod close to the President for more than just the party of his office to provide inadequate gesture, as the supreme body of the puigcercós congresses controlled. 
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to further resignations, you will have with the board of a policy plan from now until May. 
For this, they expect in the drafting of the document on strategic reorientation that the guidance on 18 of the Council will put to the vote, to be able to participate. 
It is their intention, for puigcercós. In return, these promises, the Congress in the fall of 2011, the leader of what is already a fact. 
The chairman of the ERC is of the opinion, "the polyphonie" a pity the stability and he wants to once and for all, the organisation in the situation, to bring their dirty linen wash behind closed doors. 
In this sense, the article, which the President-in-Office of the conseller Josep huguet, signed in his blog, symptomatic. 
In the light of the puigcercós is an ideologue, kept the holders of innovació it for a fact that the party leaders "in exchange for various objectives." 
He was five, two of which are in the forefront. 
Firstly, the "restructuring" of the Board of Governors, so that at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from carods environment. 
The second could be great news. 
Huguet proposes that ERC should finally abandon the vollversammlungsprinzip than functioning. 
So that verfechtet he mentions a reform of the Statute, which should make it possible to hold the Congress with elected delegates. 
By the end of the vollversammlungsmodells - an exception in the Spanish party system - is puigcercós' team, which had been in the past two congresses fought obsessively. 
In fact, on the bebenden assembly of 2008 the party leadership with the review of the vollversammlungsprinzips on a Congress, which deals with the reform of the statutes, should look at. 
This date is still out, because infogle of internal aufruhe of recent years, it was advisable not to tackle this issue. 
Now, without the critical sectors could be on the lookout, the time has come to be and the matter again for ever.
