With the results on 28 November, could the PP in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona play a pivotal role 
After the major stimmen- and abgeordnetenzuwachs at the last regional elections, the PP has its eyes on the parliamentary elections - or not. We would have preferred to have their expectations are more than a good thing, because the numbers, this party in this election, we have achieved is normally twice as high as the during the elections in Catalonia. 
So, the Catalan people 's Party 610.473 votes in the parliamentary elections of 2008, while the paragraph in the regional elections in 2006 only 316.222 fraud. 
Last Sunday, the PPC 384.091 votes. 
If this emerging trend - the result of the diversion of the cut rich-country voting shares at the PSC and the pegging of the electorate should continue - of the PP, analysts are forecasting that the PP in the parliamentary elections the PPC from 8 to 12 Members could rise, while also ciu four (she now has 10) dazugewinnen and the PSC at least 9 members (25) would lose. 
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for the PP and the PSOE. 
According to the analysis of the people " s Party would lose the ERC Members - currently has three - while icv or a dazugewinnen keep their members. 
However, the wahlkalender should be retained, the next date with the local elections in May 2011.

Both the nationalists as well as the people " s Party agree, the PSC, the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists did not achieve a majority on its traditional allies (ERC and icv) can will lose. 
After the Republican debacle is it not absurd that this party their representation in the local council, Barcelona was taken in which they should reach 5% of the vote is going to lose. 
However, the PP recorded an increase in the four cut rich-country voting shares at provinzhauptstädten and could, on the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona. 
The nationalists are convinced that the key role to play in tarragonas swing. There you had before the current mayor, Josep Félix ballesteros, together with the PP. 
En Lérida lies the PP just 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the recent election campaign, they met on several occasions. 
Also in other important places, such as, for example, in castelldefels reus badalona, or the people " s Party could have a significant increase. 
The PP is currently represented in 34 municipalities of Catalonia, and they are seeking the creation of lists in so many places as possible.
