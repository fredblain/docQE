Khmer Rouge veterans to confrontation with the past, forced 
In a weak pointed betonierten classroom with dirty and abblätternden walls, recalls the director of anlong veng high school to the man who built it, in the future, the Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok. 
"everyone loves Ta Mok here." 
"He was a good leader and he has taken care of its people," said sreng kor Ma, 42 years. 
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the schlachter," remains the commander in this remote former Khmer rouge-hochburg in north-west Cambodia where he is popular, hospitals and bridges built, the infrastructure has developed and where thousands of former soldiers are still alive. 
But this year, 12 years after the defeat of the Khmer Rouge to the government, are longstanding supporters in anlong veng. 
In April, allowing a local truth and versöhnungsforum the victims of the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime. 
In June, the government its, which for the first time children of former soldiers of the history of the Khmer Rouge being told. 
And in July, a gemeinschaftstribunal Cambodia and the UN for the first time, a former Member of the Khmer Rouge, when the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing khek iev, better known as Duch, sentenced to 35 years in prison. 
With each of these developments, the fear among Khmer Rouge veterans alnlong vengs, hindered their efforts to bring about reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia. 
"There are still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said youk chhang, head of the documentation centre of Cambodia, an independent organization, which studied the regime. 
"for them was the live under the Khmer Rouge glorious, but the regime is a symbol of evil." 
"It is divisive even families." 
During the Khmer Rouge reign over Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, revision or starvation. 
When the Vietnamese in 1979 and causing the Pol pot-ied government toppled, fled to the remnants of the regime and its military on the border of Cambodia to Thailand. 
This widespread until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered, unrest. 
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary guerrilla warfare from its base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok, the next generation in anlong veng. 
But in the mid-1990s, when a peace agreement in 1993 by the UN, promoted to the first democratic elections in the country, began to large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, the government urged, leading to the kapitulationen of Ieng Sary in 1996 and 1998, Khieu Samphan nuan Chea and led. 
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not been given in 1999 by government forces in the dangrek mountains were arrested. 
He died in 2006 in a prison in Phnom Penh, where he was waiting at his trial. 
As their benefactors they are no longer protected, the majority of former Khmer Rouge fighters in the bring relief from grinding poverty of the rural Cambodia, and many retained the movement in a nostalgic memory. 
Even if a few elitist official Khmer Rouge their local regierungsposten because they kept their weapons on the ordinary soldiers remained poor, ill-educated peasants. 
"These people have very little of the capitulation," said Sok leang benefited by the Center for justice and reconciliation in the whole of Cambodia in anlong veng, also holds public forums 
"They are enshrined in the utopian agrarideologie of the regime." 
"they grew up without any berufswissen." 
Sor Lim, 55 years in 1974 as a teenager, who had joined the rhmer Rouge, fought in the jungle by anlang veng, before he niederließ in 1998, to a life of poor reisbauer to lead. 
"The live under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said. 
"Ta Mok, each have something to eat." 
"But now is the life difficult, because we have to ourselves." 
The current, the Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also brings out here concerns. 
At the beginning of next year, the Court will try Khieu Samphan live freely, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng thirith, another former Khmer Rouge ministers, to court. 
The order of the Court, it is, the old leaders and those who are responsible for the atrocities, to condemn them, but it has not said whether it is on these four cases further actions will follow. 
This has done little to alleviate fears in anlong veng. 
Current media speculation has focused on in the chaem, 64 years, that during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s distriktchefin in the province had been manteay meanchey. 
In 2007, they are representative of the documentation centre of Cambodia and tells you that you have the construction of the trapeang thma barrage, a project, in which thousands of forced labour probably died. 
On a hot night in the chaem came from the work in the fields to their holzhaus in a dirty streets outside of anlong veng. 
As the sun long shadow over the desiccated grass threw in the chaem rejected it, about their history with the Khmer Rouge to discuss. 
Should the Court they vorladen, so they would refuse to go, she said. 
"Cambodia live in peace and stability," she said. 
"There would be no prosecutions would be more of this war." 
Prime Minister Hun Sen, the back of the Khmer Rouge has fled, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, the Court more suspects on trial, although experts and historians to discuss this. 
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said. 
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to be able to go forward, "youk chhang said the documentation. 
"reconciliation with the khmer-zeiten means build-up of the broken pieces," he said. 
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together, so that they can understand how everything." 
The Centre has created the first approved by the government, its about the Khmer Rouge, the 75seitige "history of the democratic Cambodia." 
There, the book was published in June in anlong veng, as an appendix to the history books for the high school of the Ministry, which is less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge. 
As often happens in Cambodia know the young people in anlong veng, little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the links of the city to the regime. 
Touch valeak, 19 years, a student at anlong veng high school, said that the new its students, is an important part of your history to understand. 
But his parents were sceptical when he brought the book home, in order to read it. 
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the Court," he said. 
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people will be sentenced by the Court." 
Such a resistance makes the reconciliation process was complex and complicated, "said Sok leang. 
But the public forums that its and the Court and to gain influence, "he said. 
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction.
