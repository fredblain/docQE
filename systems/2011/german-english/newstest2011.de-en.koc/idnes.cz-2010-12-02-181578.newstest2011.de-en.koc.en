A knochenhaus fascinates even after 100 years. Look at the interieure of Gaudi to 
The roof seems to be like the back of a prehistoric echse, climbing the stairs as the spine of a dinosauriers and the balkone are aufgerissene fischmäuler. 
This is the Casa batlló of Catalan architect, Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. 
It was by the local inhabitants of the House, with its organic forms the nicknames "knochenhaus." 
Organic forms, wild colours that the unusual use of stone, kachelsplittern and mosaic, which related to shed fronts and ubiquitous soft lines, all of these are typical features for the jugendstil of Antonio Gaudi. 
The facade of the House is playing with beautiful lines, zärtlichen paints and texturen in nature and living things. 
Only on closer inspection, we note that everything from geometry, rhythm and profound order dominated. 
In the middle of the night, the whole facade still graphically, dramatic and the specific anleuchtung augments the glamour of the colours. 
The same schwungvollen lines and petition forms also dominate the interior of the House. 
Parliament geformtes wood copied the geländer, zierelemente window frames, doors and even gucklöcher and do. 
The House of the eixample quarter batlló in a busy shopping road passeig de grácia no 43 was created by the conversion of a house from the years of 1877, the architects Emilio sala cortese said. 
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906. 
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but in the end, he agreed to the idea of gaudís on an unusual and even cheaper reconstruction. 
The mietshaus Casa batlló Antoni Gaudí noted, however, is not alone. 
He was working with the architect Josep Maria jujol together. 
It emerged on the drawing board for the rhetorical representative apartment of the realitätenbesitzers and also the use of mosaiken on the facade was his idea. 
In the shape of the facade was working but also many other bildner and artists. 
The joint work of the drafts for the Casa batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation of jujola and Gaudí. 
So jujol also participated in the construction of gaudís house, Casa milá in the park güell, which also further works of Antoni Gaudí. 
Shortly after its completion, the House of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the nicknames "knochenhaus." 
Others described it as the specific fensteröffnungsmechanismus due to the "yawning external house." 
It also says that at the top of the building was the sword of St George, the barons of Catalonia. 
But it also further bildhauerische elements symbolize hidden religious motives. 
Gaudí outlined for the House for the time zentralheizungssystem unique, with entlüftungskanälen and typical kaminen. 
It seems rather bizarre to have their 45-grad-neigung. 
During his create Gaudí ignored all the building codes and by no means these. 
Before the start of construction - studios, although the appropriate planning permission by the city, which he made a but details on the planned reconstruction were so vague that the stadtväter two years later at the completion of so horrified by the result was that they demanded redress. 
The ratsherren amongst other things, also found that the building, with its pillars even in the public sidewalk intervention. 
It was not to make changes, however, quite the opposite - only 15 days after the initial call from the stadtviertels, Josep batlló a request for approval of the rental of the two höchstgelegenen floors of the House - and was promptly given him. 
The homeowners themselves, in the lower floors. 
In the gallery, in the second floor was a gesellschaftssalon, on the third floor were bedrooms and privaträume the apartment. 
The ground-floor level was leased to a juweliergeschäft. 
The entire sechsstöckige buildings is going through a step up to dachterrasse. 
With the main elements of the redevelopments were all right corner and precise lines has been removed and replaced by bent and geschwungene walls. 
Gaudí worked but also with a modern approach to mutual connection of rooms. 
The social part is explained by the opening up of the salontüren completely combine and so could a larger society, without chatting comfortably in vertraulicheren talks to a certain degree of intimacy up. 
The House was given by gaudís refitting except a new facade and a rather unusual roof and two other floors. 
Impressively is also gaudís game with the light and the blue and white glasierten kacheln with which the private courtyard dressed, and is the lichthöfe. 
The game these two colours gives all floors of the House of a maximum amount of light. 
Yet he made, quite simply, the principle that knows better reflect the light, as a dark colors, on the contrary, to absorb sunlight. 
The House, Casa batlló in 2005 was included in the welterbe-liste UNESCO today everybody can visit. 
In the first floor is the geräumigste and prächtigste apartment made available to the public. 
The homeowner decided only in the years to this step, and this on the occasion of the 150.geburtstags of the famous creator. 
When it was discovered that this is a very profitable business, retained the surveys, yes you, they also extended to other common and the dachgeschossräume, including the dachterrasse. 
The price for the inspection of the monument, however, is no trifling matter, it is 16,50 euros, students, pensioners, groups, and holders of touristenausweisen get reductions of 20%. 
This figure dwarfs the eintrittspreise to other gaudí-bauten in the city. 
Whoever the real atmosphere of the House, with its drachentürmchen know wants to learn should try, friendship with one of the inhabitants to visit him at home.
