Arsen-resistente microbe could new life forms on earth or elsewhere allow 
The discovery of a foreign bakterienart, down by arsenic can live opens up new possibilities for new life forms on earth, and elsewhere. 
Although scientists this unusual bacterium discovered here on earth, it is their view, a sign that a life without the previously deemed vital elements is possible. 
"This organism has two possibilities." 
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." 
"It makes it to something quite special, though it is almost a kind of 'alien' way of life is," said c.w. Paul Davies of Arizona State University and co-autor of the report, which the Internet on Thursday in the journal Science. 
So far, there have been six key elements as vital views - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. 
But, as the scientists figured out the bacterium in the Californian mono lake and then even further, if it phosphorus by arsenic replaced. 
"one wonders but what else is possible," the report said the co-autor Ariel that Anbar of Arizona State University. 
The discovery is an important step in the search for außerirdischem lives since scientists need to see life and his forms, such as Anbar. 
The study, which deals with microbes have been found on earth. 
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet, that the report by the discovery of außerirdischen life could act. 
This is not the case. 
The discovery "shows that, in other planetensystemen organisms with the help of other elements of biochemical processes can set in motion and that the 'standardelemente', which in our opinion, are absolutely vital, not necessarily clear are imposed," said Charles cockell, professor at the planetary and space sciences Research Institute of the open university in Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. 
Cockel was not part of the research teams. 
"This work is a first, because it shows that, in fundamental biochemical processes and structures of one element can be replaced by another," added cockell added. 
The discovery was not accidental. 
Felisa wolfe-simon from astrobiologischen Institute of NASA, who led the study, chose the mono Lake because of the high arsengehalts. 
Since arsenic and phosphorus chemically identical, it started to that microbes, which both are suspended, may be an element by which others can replace. 
"The toxicity of the arsens is based above all, that it is chemically similar to behaving like phosphorus." 
"by the organisms, it is difficult to distinguish between an element from the other." 
"But the difference is so great that arsenic different acts as phosphorus. It reaches into our biochemisches system, where it is almost covered everything," said Anbar. 
The researchers exposed the bacterium gfaj-1 a rising arsenkonzentration. It is suited to and grew. 
The microbe is growing in phosphorus better, but also that it can survive in arsenic, shows that a arsen-basierte form can happen, of course, either on the ground or on any other planet or moon, on the arsenic frequently occurs. 
According to Jamie S. foster, female teacher for Microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus by arsenic can be replaced, not new, but so far there is still no functioning example. 
Arsenic came in the early erdjahren more common, she says that is why the science assumed that early life forms have used it. 
"that gives reason to believe that life may have developed differently than in the early erdzeitalter," Forster, who was not a Member in wolfe-simons research team. 
The research was carried out by NASA, the Department of Energy and the national health authorities.
