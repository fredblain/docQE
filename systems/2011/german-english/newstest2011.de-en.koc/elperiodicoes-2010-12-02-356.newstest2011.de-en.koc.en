Sport and regelumgehung 
Tricks, such as that of Alonso and Ramos in the match against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the desire to avoid a penalty. 
The supposedly of two players of real Madrid (xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) has instigated exclusion in the game on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League that caused much ink has been shed, about whether it is a unsportliche act and whether or not was probably both players should be sanctioned by UEFA. 
As is well known that the two players lost a couple of minutes to go (her team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls, so that the referee showed them the second yellow card. 
In this way, and as the Real Madrid his group would be that the two players the prescribed sanction in the next ligaspiel against auxerre, and so fulfil without playing cards in the next spielphase. 
Finally, the disziplinarkommitee UEFA the coach of the club, José mourinho, with two to play, and the parties involved players with different sums of money. 
The provocation of a yellow card in this or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football. 
It is so widespread that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport rules - is visible. 
Part of the law debate to outline the case back to a team from the football clubs, Real Madrid (who in his anthem edelmut and honor and, on other occasions, his players had punished for similar incidents), the major role, and in the drama by mourinho, an episode more to its long history as theatralischer and provocative technician has added. 
In any case, the debate about whether this is not explicitly banned by the statutes of the principles of the sport, that is to say, whether these actions represent a regelumgehung. Indeed, this approach holds to the statutes of the sport, but appear to circumvent its meaning. 
In this matter of the sporting spirit damage caused should be investigated. 
The sporting spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that was put in jeopardy by these activities cannot, because there was no aggressive game. 
A further aspect of a clean game is to prevent the offender players an unfair advantage from the gegenteam. This, too, was not done. 
The paradox of the plot of the players of real Madrid is that they are not the same as we normally under falschspiel or regelumgehung understand, because the circumvention of the rule was not taken surreptitiously, in order to avoid a penalty, but it should be, so long as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. 
The players waited and withdraw the sanction happily. 
Another question is, what kind of advantage the offender from the deliberate fouls. 
This should be stressed that the rival either in a disadvantageous position still has advantages for the feigned game erheischt were, for the obvious result of this action was that the team had to continue, with fewer players. 
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club has not then on these players. 
The benefit is clear is that the players for the next spielphase the Champions League without maps, their participation in a future game could begin to threaten. 
But it is a long-term, up to a certain extent uncertain advantage, because the team could eventually retire. It gives the players with this approach, a sanction and go in the second kartenzyklus about where they are because of kartenanhäufung with a card less than in the first cycle. 
So it is not clear whether it is really an advantage. 
Ultimately, such practices are not against the sporting spirit, which is also of strategic decisions are part of the rules, in order to derive maximum benefit. 
In this case, the players wanted to avoid any penalty (this would really be a clear case of regelumgehung), they wanted to vote, when you are on this subject. 
They met, without a strategic decision to avoid a penalty before her, or to flee. 
Although the border between imagination and regelumgebung blur is, I believe that this issue is a clear case of inventiveness. 
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because it was two selbstausschlüsse and because of the nature of the unprovoked regelübertragung. 
The damage to the principles of the sport by these actions inflicted is less ethical, rather than aesthetic nature.
