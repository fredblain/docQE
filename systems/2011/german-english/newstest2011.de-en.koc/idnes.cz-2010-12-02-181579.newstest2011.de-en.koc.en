The right mattress and the right bettenrost? women have other wishes than men 
Not the tollste bettrahmen, but the quality of the liegefläche - i.e. mattress and rost, the good bed. 
But they need to be harmonious to complement the desires of the specific user. 
With regard to the choice of many things - a role to play, the weight, size, health, and, last but not least, the gender of the schläfers. 
Just as important is the interieur, in the mattress and subordinate rost. 
Typical example? 
In a wochenendhaus, in which not regularly heated, are not well suited latexmatratzen much longer, since they need in order to "warm." 
Furthermore, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethan-matratzen. 
And, they should be turned on a regular basis. 
If it is not enough entlüftungskanälchen heart and even to have a solid record,, moisture, so it is not impossible that under their mould. 
In the election, of course, also plays a role in what you have to get used to. 
For long periods of time, who was abroad, where very high mattresses with weichschicht customary practice, will find it hard to a low mattress with hard surface can get. 
"probably all hockey players, who have returned from the NHL, have complained to me that they are no longer able to sleep properly." 
"for their abgeschundenen shoulders, heels and hüften, they need a simple weichschicht from visco-schaum (memory foam - a formgedächtnis-polymer)." 
"This, I recommend including diabetic people under a disorder of the nervous system, so that they are suffering from the" information "from the ligaments and the skin can receive bad," said hadamcziková Sylva, which is on the polstermöbel. 
That is why I have many, many years ago eishockeyspielern, but also other customers these mattresses with visco-schaum (memory foam) worried. 
"Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses provide tempur among the manufacturers, the Italian company magniflex or the Czech manufacturer tropico." 
And it need not necessarily be a famous hockey players, to have the benefits of the visco-schaums will learn to appreciate. 
This "miracle" works really quite simple. 
The foam optimalisiert his toughness and form, according to the absorbierten heat, in other words, he is a schmiegt on warm body. 
Nowhere is there, in the middle of the night shifts we are not as around after a tough fight. 
You simply sleep much better. 
The viskoelastische foam also offers protection against dekubitus (wundbrand). 
The election of the matratzengröße to body size, it should still be the length of the fußsohlen, is approximately 21 to 34 feet. 
As Mrs Mann, of the 180 cm are large need as a 210 to 220 cm long bed. 
Each of the schläfer should be at least 90 cm liegebreite available, is a total of 180 cm. 
In einzelbetten, for example in singles, are 120 to 140 feet. 
For the sake of comfort, and also for any visitors. 
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb for the ideal bettbreite: "If you are on the back, should still have enough room for the poor," angewinkelten easily traceable. Helena prokopová at ING, the zunftmeisterin the polsterer and raumausstatter, which has for many years the issue of the healthy and makes the ergonomics of furniture is devoting to this issue and nursing schools. 
In a doppelbett each with its own needs and its own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are high too. 
Otherwise there is nothing, as the roste in different size to fit, and that is not in any bettrahmen possible. 
Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high with mattresses, federskelett 15 cm, should be at least three centimetres on the formschicht and the feinpolster alone. 
"with the hand or sit down, we must in any case, the feathers are," warns Helena prokopová. 
Each mattress makes a special rosttyp needed. 
Ganzgepolsterte beds with bed and document as zusammengewachsene siamzwillinge have nothing to look in the bedroom. 
These mattresses cannot drop and you cannot wash the terms, which today is already. 
And because you are in a single night between 0.2 and 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years to an enormous (and congested sieve). 
Even so, the experts are opposed werbeslogans mattresses in a lifespan of up to 25 years, and yes even lifelong guarantee promises. 
Every cause has its ifs and buts. 
And it is therefore a practical advice from dealers: mattresses of 120 or 140 feet wide should the hygiene of the waschbaren abziehbaren salary, not be afraid, however, it is recommended that a matratzenschoner, it is easy to use and wash them. 
Even if today, in the rule matratzenbezüge with rundumreißverschluss be produced, so that after the opening of two halves gets (immensely important for the waschvorgang and the waschmaschinengröße!), it seems the manipulation with larger mattresses, particularly pointed out, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. 
Have you in bed instead of a rostes a plate? 
Get out. 
Or a maximum for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night. 
Also, as you should, rather, the record with lüftungslöchern AAA (if not inside) and mattresses with federskelett and 15 cm floor with so-called taschenfederkern and feinpolster use. 
Polyurethan-matratzen belong on such a document is not. 
For not verstellbare lattenroste with 14 to 18 federleisten (lamellen) are latex- or sandwichmatratzen suited (possibly even combinations of latex and kokos), always pay for it with a larger lattenanzahl roste, 28, and more federleisten, with lordosenstütze in lendenwirbelbereich and the ability to regulate lattenhärte. 
On verstellbare lamellenroste include no mattresses with federskelett, because it does not verstellung react to the workplace. 
In addition to the suspension of the stiff the federleisten will also be offered special flexible schultermodule. 
This is a specific integration of the federleisten, allowing the federleisten einzudrücken or even to verwinkeln, that it is the specific einsinken the shoulder of the schläfers. 
Especially for men with broad shoulders of an important matter. 
There is even matratzenhersteller have started, "herrenmatratzen" weichzonen to use for the schulterbereich. 
Also on the ladies is intended - these weichzonen takes them in the hüftgegend. 
For ambitious customers are punktelastische flügelfedersysteme (lattoflex) or with punktelastischen roste kontakt-pads with so-called multitorsionsfederung. 
The pressure will be distributed on a number of points, which reduces the tension. 
But, if you are on the right mattress and correct rost a bad (too large and fülliges), most are used kopfkissen lost benefits. 
Here, too, a rule of thumb: the kopfkissen is the head, his tips should only up to the shoulders of rich, so that the schultermuskeln can relax. 
Ideal is therefore a 50 X 60 cm big cushion which, as it may, for example, the Scandinavians. 
In the seitenlage should the kopfkissen (along with the schulterentlastungszone in rost, or the weichzone in the mattress) the schulterhöhe balance. 
Rather, our modern mattresses have with the former (with hay receptacle) strohsäcken but in common. 
Modern manufacturers increasingly use natural materials, or at least their mixtures. 
Also in mattresses is the new magic formula "organic." 
Instead of erdölrohstoffen we used for the manufacture of polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturelle oils - for example, rizinus- and soya oil. 
Soya is aware of all the well-known manufacturers used. 
"organic mattresses, which is, in other words, your heart from materials purely natural origin is there," said Petr vašíček by the firm tropico plus. 
Naturstoffe but they are also used in the manufacture of matratzenbezügen - one of the first was thinking of aloe Vera. 
You can also indulge in the sleep mikrokapseln fresh woodland or lavendelduft spread. 
Here too there is a difference between a man and a woman. 
While the men a "kühlender" pflanzenextrakt from birkenblättern is used, so that the matratzenbezug absorb the heat and cool the body can have the salary for women "wärmende" effect. 
Extracts from red paprikaschoten rain of blood, the weaker sex will the sleep wohlig warm words. 
And the current favorites? 
Mattresses from kaltschaum (he has greater poren with devastated zellstruktur and is therefore atmungsaktiver than standard polyurethan and also much more flexible). 
Through the combination of the various stiff (force) by kaltschäumen and visco-schäumen arise mehr-zonen-matratzen who know exactly where the head, hip and heels. 
For a high-end mattress has, however, and 7000 kronor to fork out more. 
Gesundheitsmatratzen are, however, usually with a lower value added tax, because they are considered as medical devices. 
As the first Czech companies were gumotex this advantage. 
You see, on the bed and on rost save is not so easy. 
And there is a special offer of manufacturers and dealers, the two mattresses for the price of an offer. 
So does the brand and the mattress duofreeze magniflex with in relation verstepptem visco-schaum memory for 11.990 CZK. 
The second one gets free of charge. 
It was the tempur material, that the era of the viskoelastischen schaumstoffe with open zellstruktur and dense in almost kosmischem pace. 
Not surprisingly, they were developed for NASA, however, because the astronauts are with the launch of enormous excessive impositions. 
Tempur will heat soft, in a cool place, which in turn strengthens it. 
So it fits perfectly in the human body and is distributed in an optimal way, the körperdruck. 
It is therefore not just ideal for the prevention of druckbrand, but increased schlafkomfort generally. 
Viskoelastische schaumstoffe but they are not only in mattresses, but also in other gesundheitsprodukten, such as in the case of special fußpolstern, used in the legs and the gefäßen to relief. 
Domestic producers, for example, the use schaumstoffe eucatherm C, twinsaver or similar products.
