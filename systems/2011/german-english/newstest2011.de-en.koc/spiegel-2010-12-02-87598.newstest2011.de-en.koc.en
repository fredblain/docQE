Hell, warriors! 
The kunstkino splatter fits? 
The director Nicolas winding refn is testing with his kämpfer-epos "walhalla rising" old genre-grenzen newly. 
To which the audience may be the Danish director Nicolas winding refn thought, when he "rising" walhalla, revolved around? 
A prisoner wikinger-krieger with only one eye (Mads mikkelsen) freed himself from his peinigern and sets with almost superhuman powers multitudes of his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, it is precisely because our hero like rough used to kill his enemies and already the gedärme from the vibrant limb to rival, if he has bad humour. 
On the other hand, einauge says, as he is called, in fact, the whole film about a word, and also the other characters can at most times to one or two sentences, or take a couple of painful todesschreien. 
Otherwise it is avoided in silence and in the gruselig beautiful hügellandschaft Scotland geschwelgt, the wikingerwelt of about a thousand years ago the scene. 
Ideal for adults cineasten with interest for existentialismus and very quiet kamerafahrten. 
Well, if a film has several target groups, it is a shame, if they are mutually exclusive. 
Director winding refn since his wild and gestylten drogendealer-trilogie "pusher" as a kind of Danish version of quentin tarantino, refuses to but stoically, his works with a little more humour to the mainstream, or a little less brutality to make available to the arthouse. 
Most kunstkino-freunde are around the spritzenden gehirnmasse and the gedärmen. 
The latest action-fans will die from boredom, if einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons with a bunch of violent Christian missionaries via ship after Jerusalem areas and an eternity in the doldrums and fog before the team appears to be stuck in America is arriving and continue to remain silent. 
No wonder that "walhalla rising" in Germany has found no kino-verleih and now only on DVD. 
This is particularly due to the superb images of a shame, but also because, behind the prätentiösen until bluttriefenden facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema, which deserves some attention. 
In this film is not about dialogues or a rigorous act, it is all atmosphere, a filmgewordener fiebertraum. 
And there is no escape for the viewer. 
Refn takes him barely a moment of relaxation and drawing pictures of him with his icy and the dark trance-artigen soundtrack to the throats of very slowly, but above all with the incredible hatred of him from the heart of the characters envelops you. 
Only a small blonder young, the einauge is faithful to the side, retains something of innocence, as all the others are driven by anger. 
Most of the einäugige hero, whose motives are never explained, but for enemies and temporary allies at some point to the warriors from hell, perhaps to the Ambassador of the devil himself. 
It means, but perhaps only for the verdorbenen anyway. 
Walhalla "rising" is a puzzling film, which you can admire and hate to annoy, and marvel at. 
An experience.
