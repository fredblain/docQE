What can you do that? ČSSD in Prague, the Czech Social Democrats are not aware of voldemort, nor the "konditorei." 
The new ratsherren the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously certain language barriers to be overcome in order to maintain their alt-neuen colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and in the stadtvertretung understand at all. 
The newspaper aktuálně.cz, members of the new Council from the ČSSD time a little "abgeklopft ', as they dominate the notorious slang, the popular in recent years, in which the current coalition partners in Prague were at the helm. 
The codierte vocabulary, which in the verflossenen era of mayor Pavel bém of the Prague political elite was introduced, is some of the best-known actors, situations and entlehnt causae. 
Surprisingly, showed the new councils in relation to these new notions of something in the dark. 
At least they say so. 
"who is voldemort?" 
"No idea." 
"I am more of a newcomer in the Prague policy," responded Lukáš kaucký, the new town councillor from for culture, to the test of "paten-wortschatzes." 
But the town councillor from Karel Březina - a political veteran, responded in a similar way. 
For example, to use the word "golfloch." 
"This is the only expression of which they are submitting me, which I use now and again." 
"otherwise, I believe that not much often infiltrated by slang." 
From the vocabulary of the tageblatt, aktuálně.cz in this year " s June before the electoral congress of the ODS had published, pickte finalizing the six terms, in particular, the notoriously with the Prague Government. 
The Social Democrats should the concepts of 'voldemort,' 'biggest Prague golfloch, "" in the konditorei go, "" stiernacken, "" betrayal of the capital, "and" verblechen. " 
Three Prague ratsherren agreed to the test, the fourth - Mr weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - first promised his participation in the conversation, but then took no time policemen pick up the telephone. 
The fifth town councillor from Petr dolínek, rejected the test. 
"these things are me, and no matter how the Civic Democrats, each other, about the judgments I not." 
"for me, is important, as we understand, within the framework of our programs," he countered. 
As already indicated, would have Lukáš kaucký in the above headline allegedly failed to recognize that the influential businessman and friend of the ex-oberbürgermeisters bém, Roman janoušek. 
The term "voldemort" says kaucky absolutely nothing and the only one he had on the test correctly erriet, was "the greatest Prague golfloch." 
"This is the tunnels," says kaucký blanka, added to its security, but added: "But I know this more out of the newspaper." 
And jokingly: "I will be a sprachkurs must show." 
The "golfloch" will then not just of matador Karel Březina, but also from the town councillor for the environment Lukáš plachý right as a tunnel entziffert blanka. 
Both Democrats also know, however, for whom the notion of voldemort, and Lukáš plachý senses even where this figure is to find and also what it means, "in which to go konditorei." 
"I believe that that is, in some kind of Prague company to go," is plachý fairly close to the conundrum solution, if we know that this is the seat of janoušeks firms. 
In keeping with Březina, he asserts, however, that this knowledge is more likely to have drawn from the newspaper, that he would embrace this vocabulary. 
Judging from the testteilnehmern, it appears to be among the Social Democrats, in fact, no similar eingebürgerten slang. 
"I have asked my colleagues, but there is obviously something we really not." 
"We call upon us in the name, and we also use acronym or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr hulínský - by his own party who put "hulda." 
"I was in the school bříza (birch), but I do not know whether I am also my colleagues call it," tells us Karel Březina his nickname. 
The newspaper deník aktuálně.cz has the name have been tried and lo and behold, it works. 
Town councillor from weinert is for the party, in a friendly way of "OPA less hospitable," or the "old," the representative, Miroslav poche, before the elections by activity in the partei-sponsoring vocal is seen by some of my colleagues, "igráček" (well-known Czech lego-figur). 
Nicknames are so the only thing that the Social Democrats in the intra-party parlance. 
It may hulínský allegedly not if hulda "calls him," but deník aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman. 
His spitzname 'doctor who allegedly gummiknüppel-rechte "has to do with the fact that Petr hulínský juris doctor title at the bratislaver police academy has garnered.
