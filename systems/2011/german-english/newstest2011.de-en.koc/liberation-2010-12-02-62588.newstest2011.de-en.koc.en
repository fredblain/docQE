Rachsüchtige hackers and race spies 
The case brings WikiLeaks has a twofold significance. 
On one hand, it turns out is as obvious scandal, a scandal, only one scandal in sinner hypocrisy, which is the beziehunge between States, the citizens and the press. 
On the other hand, it has to be substantial changes at the international level, and gives a taste of the future, dominated by a recession. 
But we walk of the series after. 
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each by a secret service produced acts (one cannot nation) exclusively from press cuttings. 
The "extraordinary," American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi 's throw from nothing more than what you for months on end in any Journal to read (except for those whose owners Berlusconi is), and the terrifying karikaturierte profile Gaddafi kabarettkünstlern already provided the material for a long time for their skits are. 
The rule, according to the secret dossier only from already well-known news should insist, is essential for the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not just in this century. 
If you go into a library, which is esotherischen publications, you will realise that each work (on the grail, the mystery of the rennes-le-chateau templer, or the rosenkreuzler) exactly the repeatedly in previous works, which has already been written. 
This is not only, therefore, that the author occult texts do not want to publish research (still, therefore, that he does not know how, where news about the nicht-existierende to), but because those who are the okkultismus, of anything else other than the belief that what you already know and confirms what you already have learned. 
This is also the erfolgsmechanismus by Dan Brown. 
As is the secret files. 
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or restricted spirit) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example, editor at Libération), the only true considering what he acknowledges. 
The top-secret information on Berlusconi, the American Embassy in Rome, had been sent to the staatsdezernat were the same as those who already Newsweek published the previous week. 
So why was such a fuss about the revelations of this dossier? 
On one side, this is what every literate person already knows, namely, that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the government can call each other or an aircraft can take in order to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small virtue in spionagezentren. 
Any old viewers of ermittlungsfilmen knows this very well and it is not for hypocrisy, so that we are doing this to ignore. 
Still, the fact that it publicly to repeat, violates the task of hypocrisy and serves, American diplomacy in a bad light. 
In second place: the idea that a business-as-usual hackers of the geheimsten secrets of the most powerful country in the world can tap, involves the substantial blow to the prestige of the staatsdezernats. 
In addition, the scandal is less the victims rather than the "executioner" in trouble. 
But we are giving the profound nature of what happened. 
Formerly, George Orwell " s times, we could all power like a big brother pool, every gesture of his subjects controlled. 
George Orwell " s prophecy could have been quite right since then as can highlight any movement, where you can control thanks to the telephone, each made transaction, visited the hotel, the elected highway and so on; the citizens would result in the total victims of the eye of the power. 
If it is, however, bearing in mind what is happening today, that even the secret krypten of power is no longer under the control of hackers, so as to escape the kontrollgang listens to unilaterally and will continue to be directed zirkelförmig. 
The power of controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - acquired as avenger by of the citizen - the mysteries of the power of that. 
But how can a power, which is no longer able to preserve their own secrets? 
It is true, Georg simmel has already said that a real mystery, a mere secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi or Merkel 's, in fact, a secret free of geheimis is, as it surrenders the public sphere; but in the styles of WikiLeaks reveal that the secrets were empty secrets of Hillary Clinton, is to deprive it of any power. 
Wikileaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama. 
What are the consequences of this affront to be such a huge power has been done? 
It is obvious that the Member States in future, no more online information system - that would be put on the street corner angeklebten prominently displaying. 
But it is also clear that there will be disappointed with the current technology is to be hoped, confidential reports about phone to be able to keep secret. 
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a Head of State is in a plane and fortbewegt contacted one of his colleagues. 
How could in future private and only for certain ears certain relationships? 
I know very well that my prediction for the moment, according to science fiction and romanhaft sounds, but I am compelled me to present the government agents in secret way to score and uncontrollable marschrouten moving, their communications anywhere else than in a mere memory with order and, moreover, the few written information they received in the schuhabsatz verbergend. 
The information would be in single copy in closed drawers of stored: basically, the spionageversuch of Watergate had less success when WikiLeaks. 
I had the opportunity to write that the technology today is like a cancer, namely backwards. 
A century after the wireless telegraf had revolutionized communications, the Internet is a telegrafen assignments with (telephone) line. 
The (analogue) cassettes had the filmforschern allows, a film band for band auszukundschaften by spulen from back to front, and all the mysteries surrounding the installation, while the (digital) CDs are now nothing more than to make it possible to jump from chapter to chapter, in makroportionen. 
With the high-speed trains, we within three hours from Rome to Milan, while it by plane, including the switching three-and-a-half hours. 
It is therefore not extraordinary that, policy and communications equipment to car and horse shortly. 
A final observation. 
In earlier times tried to understand what the press for secrets, between the embassies were forged. 
Currently, there are the messages that confidential information from the press.
