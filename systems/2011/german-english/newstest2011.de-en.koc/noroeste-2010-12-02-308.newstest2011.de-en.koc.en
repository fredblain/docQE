NASA announces the discovery außerirdischen life 
The American space agency summoned a press conference tomorrow, a fund vorzustelle, the impact on the search for life in all of this will have. 
The National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) of the United States tomorrow, Thursday, a astrobiologische discovery announced that the theory of the existence of außerirdischen life could confirm. 
The fund will be at 1 p.m. tomorrow at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington, presented by experts of the astrobiologie. This is a science that is at the root of the development, distribution and the future of life in the universe. 
In scheduling the NASA press conference, he assured, you will "have a aufsichtserregenden fund for the search for außerirdischem lives," which triggered speculation among experts in other countries. 
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments, which felt so far for unbwohnbar human-like creatures exist. It was the hypothesis is that these are raised in intelligent creatures - like people - could turn when their living conditions improved. 
Apparently, it is a microbe, which was at the bottom of the mono lake in California, was found, yosemite-nationalpark. She lives there, in an environment that was too toxic for all possible forms of life, because the sea was kept arsenhaltig is strong. 
The mikrobie used in any way the arsenic than überlebensressource. Taking into account these capacity increases the chances that it on other planets, who do not have our protective atmosphere, similar life could be. 
If these organisms that arsenic verstoffwechseln, according to the astrobiologen proved that "there is a real a different way of life, a second way of life that differs from the US." 
The space agency is tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference, the actual scope of their funds. 
At the conference will be the geobiologin pamela Conrad part, with the possibility of life on Mars, and a biologist Steven benner, one of the scientists, the titan (the largest moon saturns) under the issue of whether its chemical composition of the earth, studied resembles.
