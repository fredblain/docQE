Ogoniland is burnt 
The water in the rivers is ölbraun, it looks like at the petrol station: billion litres of ausgelaufenes crude oil, the nature in Ogoniland in Nigeria. 
The people of theft, corruption and illegal ölkochen. 
Celestine akpobari mean well. 
"Do not suppress it," has plagued the ökoaktivist reassured the journalists: "You will still have enough oil before the lens wars." 
The 37-year-old Nigerians has pursued a until the chest in water watenden young with the surrounding schlieren abzulichten: in the regenbogenfarbenen wasserglanz, the scene almost function. 
Under the surface that Brown rohölschwaden tops, is not to be seen. 
Here you have previously eimerweise prawns, gathered on the shores of badom Esther told bodo-jetty-flusses. 
Now is the sluggish fluid waters completely dead. 
Five years ago, poured from a geborstenen pipeline legions of crude oil in the vast wetland. 
Fishermen from the nearby städtchen Bodo, now have six hours rowing, in order to reach fischhaltige waters: in the heart of the Niger Delta, Ogoniland is regarded as one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world. 
On the journey from the river realignments mangrovensümpfe criss-crossed the full extent of the devastation is visible. 
Instead of bright water wühlt the motorboot Brown brühe at who his hand into the water, he said ölige finger. 
The roots of the mangrovenbäumchen as black lakritzstangen sticking out of the ground and, sad to be able to hang their wedel, palm trees. 
Vogelschwärme, as usual in wetlands are meted out: once the außenborder remains silent, is spreading in the as a filling station in previous paradise of ghastly calm. 
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says celestine akpobari gloomy: "We are living in constant danger for the health." 
The substitutes war for soccer is appropriate. 
The stand of the Ogoni is a controversial battleground for decades: flats here, more than 60 years ago, the first explorateure from Europe, organised here in the 1980s with the later death writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance here in 1993, the shell-konzern had to stop its production, because it was too dangerous for its oil workers. 
Nor is today the company denied the return after Ogoniland: while across the delta region of the triple the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 bohrquellen and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, every day, more than two million barrels of the black gold, the pumping of oil fields in Ogoniland, the corporation is too unstable the situation. 
Every few hundred metres stählerne sticking gestelle as bizarre sculptures from the water: "christbäumchen" are the heads of the boreholes have much to zärtlich. 
They are up to 50 years old, the most korrodiert to the core. 
Again and again, such a bohrkopf breche apart, says akpobari rinne, then a constant stream of crude oil into the water. 
More than two billion litres in 50 years, according to estimates in the Delta ecosystem is gone: year after year, the quantity of oil, as they had at the time of the accident involving the supertankers' Exxon Valdez '21 years ago, into the sea off Alaska drive - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of humanity. 
Who should pay for the ultimate environmental catastrophe is to blame, it is argued. 
During the shell-konzern sabotage and the organised öldiebstahl for more than 90 percent of the pollution, berstende environmentalists see as a major bohrköpfe and lecke pipelines. 
Shell in Nigeria, insist on much lower safety standards than usual in the world, accused the us-wissenschaftler Richard Steiner, 2008 the company: only the rate of defects in the pipes was "much higher" than elsewhere. 
In one place, which from a distance as an abandoned, ölverschmierte open-air workshop looks up from the mangroven characters: they are splitternackt and up to our necks ölverschmiert. 
Under one of the many barrels, some with tubes, partly arbitrary scattered on the site are, and future has come a fire: an illegal kleinraffinerie. 
In the barrel is the crude oil on the fire several hours fervid, says Michael, the head of the group. 
First dawning petrol through the pipes in the auffangtopf, later, at the end of the tröpfelt led kerosene and diesel fuel. 
So producing Michael and four staff on a daily basis up to four barrels diesel à 300 litres of: "it brings us 34.000 naira a" - around 22 dollars. 
The deltabewohner benefits the chronic treibstoffknappheit in the largest erdölstaat in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Nigeria has a single refinery. 
The with nearly 40 euro-cent per litre of ridiculously low price of diesel oil can the illegal kocher has undercut their raw material: because you can get for nothing. 
He comes from "bunkerern," which pipelinenetz across Ogoniland on tap: in this way, we go to the country, according to experts in the entire Niger delta on a daily basis, at least 16 million litres of crude oil lost. 
Only a tiny part of the provisionally zwischengelagerten raw material is processed illegally, however: the lion 's share fill organised criminal networks, including politicians and senior military should belong to him, in tankers and basement to the world market. 
The debate as to whether the environmental disaster rather the activities of the population or the lax production is due to akpobari, keeps the activist for purely academic. 
"If the oil companies are not as invaders, and they would have the livelihood of the fishermen do not so thoroughly destroyed, there would be neither sabotage or theft and illegal refineries." 
Now is the ratio of the Ogoni, above all, Shell but destroyed so that only a withdrawal of the corporation, the question would be: "perhaps are indeed other nationalities such as the Chinese as a better." 
There is Michael nervous. 
"high time that their disappears," says the muskulöse ölmann. 
"Every minute, the soldiers can." 
The illegal ölveredler of the special unit of the armed forces are caught, although not to the threat of arrest, but a painful bribe. 
Also, the mainly from the landesnorden sections of soldiers want - like all Nigerians - from the raw material benefit. 
"This damn stuff, our country in every respect to the dog," says akpobari brought.
