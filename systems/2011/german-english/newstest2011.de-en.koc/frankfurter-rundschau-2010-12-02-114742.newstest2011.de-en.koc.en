Controllers in the zwielicht 
The European Food Safety Authority, was recognised by the with genpflanzen experimental industry at all. 
This accusation testbiotech now formulated in the expert group, which regards itself as the independent institute for the impact of biotechnology understands. 
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well documented," said testbiotech-chef Christoph then on Wednesday in Munich. 
The head of the efsa-expertengruppe for genetically modified plants, Harry kuiper, and another efsa-experte for years, are also in the lobbyistenverband ilsi under contract. 
The will of the corporations like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer. 
Kuiper had been instrumental in the efsa-prüfvorschriften for genpflanzen and am so that, in a clear conflict of interests, then criticized. 
The efsa-vorschriften were absatzweise word for word with position papers by the ilsi and deceive the hallmark of the industry, which is actually of the authority in the Italian Parma should be controlled. 
It was the second time that a interessenskollision testbiotech share your criticism. 
So is a high-level efsa-managerin recently without restrictions or transitional period for the Swiss agrarkonzern Syngenta - and have the sides. 
Also the mitteldeutsche broadcasting (mdr) had recently kontrollierender personal links between medicine and industry lobby, reveals what the umweltbundesamt as MEPs sit up and take notice. 
The EFSA can however, see no conflict of interest. 
We use every serious data back, even to those of the industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, it says in a statement. 
The experts, the work of EFSA, not that they have no contact with the industry. 
But they would have to disclose them. 
Kuiper gives his work for the international life sciences Institute (ilsi) in the United States. 
This describes himself as a neutral forum for experts from the science, industry and politics - among other things, on risk assessment without lobbyauftrag for biotechnology. 
In the case of independent experts criticize how then that genetically modified crops are currently without any fütterungsversuch in animals will be allowed and the reaction of genpflanzen environmental not tested. 
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize on the field is," says then. 
Current practice is only isolated proteins, but not the whole genpflanze to test what no reliable results covering. 
"If the risks are not addiction, how do you find it?" asks then point an accusing finger. 
It also provides for Angelika hilbeck so. 
The scientist are since 1994 in the engineering and is currently at the technical University of Zurich. 
The industry attempts in this area, as in the United States is now in Europe is becoming more critical scientists to influence or discredit. 
There is, therefore, are scarcely even researchers who do not are interwoven with corporations. 
For business critical studies were in the rule does not apply. 
"The industry controls the security research hilbeck," claims.
