A longer fingers than ringfinger means a lower risk of developing cancer 
Men whose fingers is long, than the ringfinger, are clearly a lower risk of developing prostate cancer. 
That is the surprising results of a study on Wednesday by the British journal of cancer, has been published. 
This is the mirror of the male hormone testosterone. 
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer can serve this specifically for men to 60," said the joint author of the study, Ros eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Centre at the University of WARWICK. 
The finger could help to determine what men is necessarily a prostatakrebs-test should undergo, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors are absent, such as, for example, family health problems, added Mrs eeles added. 
In the period of 1994-2009 haunted them with their counterparts in Britain more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men. 
In more than half of the participants in the study was the fingers of the right hand of quicker than the ringfinger. 
For these men was the same likelihood of prostate cancer, such as for 19% of those men, whose 'ring' and finger were the same length of time. 
In men, whose finger was longer than the ringfinger this risk, however, fell by 33 per cent for men to 60 even by 87 percent. 
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned finger, which is already in the prenatal age, clearly reflects the different mirror of to be administered, which the child in the womb. 
Less testosterone is a long fingers. 
Previous research found that the testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer. 
Václav pačes, leading Czech geneticists and former chairman of the National Academy of Sciences, said he emphasized that he is aware of this study renegades, he nevertheless consider the relationship between the fingerlänge and the risk of cancer so far has not proved to be "completely."
