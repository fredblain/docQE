In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 treaties a consortium consisting of the firms that bpr Dessau, Groupe sm and axor, the main part, namely the projektleitung, to a total of 295 million dollars without invitation to tender has been given. 
This consortium, known as the "énergie gérance," was the decision of 2004, as a corollary, hydro-québec, the private sector their responsibility, this important, hydroelectric project to the tune of a total of $5 billion to the control. 
At the beginning of 2005 ergatterte the consortium "énergie gérance" the lucrative contract, without there being a public invitation to tender. 
For the Parti québécois is resorting to unternehmenskonsortien a serious ethical problem, which is the risk of wettbewerbsverdrändung, as well as an increase in prices in the making. 
"This is a new way to a conspiracy and refuted the competition." 
"This means that rather than abgekartete games rather than on a secret way and now in the form of carrying out yesterday," said Sylvain simard, a Member of the PQ, at the press conference. 
In the early morning simard had raised the issue before the national assembly, because it seems to him hard to understand how the interests of the public in this way can be served. 
Ressourcenministerin Nathalie normandeau had reacted by the afternoon she vehemently denied, that it is in this Treaty had acted in a stitch-up. 
"I am sticking to my line," lashed out, by the PQ, confirmed it was "dishonest" and called it "ring lacked toughness." 
She said that it "was the least" that the PQ is sorry. 
The model of the consortium is standard practice in the world. 
It is usually a temporary order such temporary alliance, which allows it to two or more of the companies, their expertise on a necessity in a tender for a complex project. 
The project "eastmain" has a high komplexitätsniveau relating to its arbeitsausmaßes. 
The bauverfahren is now under way and should be set up to 2012. 
However, the contract was awarded, had, without a competition can take place; there had already been negotiations. 
Furthermore, the model of the consortium in Quebec, with relatively simple projects, no longer an exception. 
As the newspaper Le Devoir published "last week, is the recognition in the field of bauingenieur- and beratungswesens applied model of the consortium have been the subject of regierungsermittlungen. 
A brief overflying the quebecer unternehmensregisters allows more than 200 consortia to name of steady, some of whom appear to be permanent. 
In this way, for example, the company operates Dessau in partnership with the majority of their kernkonkurrenten, Cima +, génivar, snc-lavalin or even Roche and tecsult, together. 
Any link, and there have been several dozen, at one and the same legal person back, namely in Dessau. 
What the consortium "énergie gérance," Minister normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James a special arbeitskräftedynamik hydro-québec is subject to this fact, and that since the 1970s in a special way pays to account." 
Réal laporte, the big employers of the Société d 'énergie de la Baie James (sebj), has made a statement, the Fed has put hull on the fact that the Treaty on the projektleitung after agreement was approved. 
"If you get an invitation, and there are only a few candidates, will your prices to soar." 
"You have two possibilities: either you nimmst the people who are in this Mart and say: we will give you a satisfactory agreement to negotiate a good price." 
"The idea is, however, that is not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," added laporte. 
Of these the consortium "énergie gérance" approved contract is part of a long list of treaties is about more than 50,000 of the Parti québécois received dollars. 
The Treaties have been either from hydro-québec or the sebj for the project eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert approved. 
After review, the newspaper, "Le Devoir published" more than 100 ingenieurs- and beraterverträge companies or their branches, including, in particular, ressourcenlabors, between 2002 and March 2010 conferred. 
Snc-lavalin had 22 contracts in itself, génivar gerafft had 14 and 16, tecsult Dessau 10, without their participation in this, "énergie gérance" mitzurechnen. 
All of these contracts are negotiated. 
They amount, in the entire to 449 783 344 $, including the Treaty with "énergie gérance" about 295 131 564 $. 
Sylvain simard had indicated that the four companies, which the consortium (bpr, Dessau, Groupe sm and axor) "the Parti libéral du Quebec, well known." 
Minister normandeau had let slip that the PQ is equally with the firms that they "funded," before they specify that it was their executives.
