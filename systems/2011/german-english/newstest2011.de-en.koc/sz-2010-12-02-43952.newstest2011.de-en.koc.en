In times of war, love 
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer, with the work on her still nameless regiedeb端t has begun, there is trouble. 
The script, she has even written a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man. 
A lot more we know about - but it is not enough for unrest. 
It is rumoured, the woman, a Muslim, this during the jugoslawien-krieges in their Serbian rapists. 
Bosnian women " s associations have immediately protested in Sarajevo, after which some drehtage planned in the short term, were transferred to Hungary. 
Now film is in Hungary, marginalised, and in the postproduktion, but it will still protested in Bosnia. 
Bakira hasecic from the organization of female victims wrote about the un-fl端chtlingshilfswerk UNHCR of Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, now a Bosnian newspaper has reported, Jolie is itself as Ambassador of the un-fl端chtlingshilfswerks. 
Diplomatically, it is not - it has a few weeks ago the women already held a meeting in Hungary, which rejected the offer, however. 
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, so hasecic. 
Liebesgeschichten in vergewaltigungscamps did not exist, and Jolie attitude of the victims would not be betraying her enough about the script. 
According to the un-fl端chtlingshilfswerk their organization has recommended that Jolie as Ambassador to dismiss, the guardian reported. 
But what exactly has Jolie for scenes written? 
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got their script to read, after some back and forth a drehgenehmigung for Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie is still not happened. 
The jungautorin even asserted that they had no political intentions with her film, with a lot of trouble in the jugoslawien-konflikt incorporated wants the terrible consequences of the war and give voice to all parties involved. 
The content, however, remains vague. 
So too a second synopsis of the film in the network, which then but rather different sounds: the loving knew already caught before war and once again when they meet, a Bosnian Muslim, in a Serbian camp being hijacked, in which he is working as a guard. 
Which is considerably different sounds when the variant "rape victims in verknallt torturer." 
Indeed, that Jolie film begins before the war - as is safe. 
The pressure on you, so Jolie, was "unfair and is based on misinformation." 
Their well can now only the hackers of Hollywood peace: by the script, as so many before, illegally on the web.
