The movement for democracy in Latin America will be more, such as the support of private companies. 
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment. 
In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil greater than that of the United States. 
These results, the latinobarómetro-umfrage in 18 countries, which has been carried out and published in The Economist. 
This survey is carried out regularly since 1995, and shows such as the meinungswechsel in this region. 
Two facts fall in the year " s survey of September and October, particularly in 's an eye. 
First, the good mood in Latin America 
And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions. 
In many countries in the South Pacific coast, the democratic movement increased greatly (S. table 1). 
In Peru, for example, where the economy annually since 2002 by around 6% rise in the number of demokratiebefürworter, rose by 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. 
Also in Mexico, where the economy has been the sharp drop in the last year to recover, is such a trend to see. 
But only half of those polled in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (S. diagram 2). 
Around 44% of respondents said that they, with the democratic practice of their country to be satisfied. These are as much as in the past year, but 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3). 
Some 34% trust the Congress to their country and 45% of its government. Both values correspond to those of the past year, show a sharp increase from 2003 (17% and 24%). 
A decade ago, undermined the efforts of economic crises in Latin America for more democracy. 
Also during the Great Depression, is a reminder that the countries of Latin America and experienced only a brief recession quickly recover. 
In addition, the poor, by a stronger safety net - instead. 
(according to reports by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America in 2009, rose only slightly to and is again this year have fallen by 32%.) 
But from country to country, there are strong stimmungsunterschiede (S. graph 4). 
Brazil, strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread fortschrittsdenken. 
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was felt and violent crime have increased, this is less the case. 
Only the second time since umfragebeginn see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country, a bigger problem than in the unemployment (S. graph 5). 
Some 31% say that either they or a family member in the past year, were victims of a crime. But, compared to 38% in the past year, the values to plummet, reaching the lowest level since 1995. 
The rising economic performance is reflected in the increased support for the family and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents surveyed cross-regional level, that the private sector is essential for development, in 2007 there were 56% (S. graph 6). 
Some 58% said that only the market can bring progress in their country, compared with 47% in the last year. 
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela this view is maintained (and 80% are for a private sector), though their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, many private companies nationalized. 
Brazil has according to 19% of those polled (18% last year), the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared with 11% last year). 
The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see in the US, the most influential country, and this role in the Dominican Republic, will be taken over by Venezuela and Nicaragua.
