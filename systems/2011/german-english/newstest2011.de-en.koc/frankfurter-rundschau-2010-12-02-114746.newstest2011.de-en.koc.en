The trail of stones 
Uli gsell has also what concerned, a total of about 400 kg. 
He was on Monday night have Stuttgart station, on the backs of the tuba. 
It was demo. 
It snowed heavily. 
The story is well known: in September were the excavator angerückt and had started a large chunk of the nordflügels it off. 
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the multi-billion dollar tieferlegung of the railway station. 
When it came to "freeze," there was a large proportion of the left in ruins. 
Shattered in 6,000 to 7,000 pieces. 
Crailsheimer produce, a soft rough stone, between 1914 and 1920. 
Gsell is sculptor in ostfildern, 43 years old. 
He has a few of the slice. 
"These stones are reliquien." 
"They must not disappear." 
He schwärmt: "a cheap and poor Stein, simple and erdenhaft." 
When he was a aufsägte after zigarettenqualm gerochen. 
What he will do with the scraps, he knows not yet. 
Stones have time. 
Uli gsell, too. 
The trail leads the Stuttgart stones in a forest in Tübingen to a former munitionsdepot the French army, where Manuel rongen his stein-reich has built. 
The 44-jährige acts with old bricks. 
He has bought all the demolition in Stuttgart fell. 
"It would be a shame to Schotter, they would gemahlen or in the landfill will disappear," he says in his office, a holzbüdchen, which was once a wachhäuschen. 
They have insulted and threatened him, tells it, when, in September in the newspapers that he has the remnants of the nordflügels bought by the abbruchunternehmer. 
But he has with the s-21-gegnern talk, for several days. 
And he has stated that he does nothing for the demolition. 
And if it is, then it is but the most sensible, if the stones were used. 
About 200 s-21-gegner took one of the signature, on average, 80 kilos of serious quader with, stückpreis 6,50 to 14 euros. 
As a memory, but some in the hope of him in a reconstruction to be able to return. 
500 tonnes rongen had bought 25 large truckloads. 
About half is still in the forest, the rest is sold. 
Gartenbesitzer, gardeners of the countryside, häuslebauer. 
Whether they come from everywhere, and would have weggeschleppt what boot and supporters could bear. 
The Stuttgart stones of contention have long in "mäuerle" or limits of kräuterbeeten. 
"In fact, this is nothing special," says rongen. 
"would not be the political component." 
He is rising in his sport-utility vehicles, power a tour through his 20 hectares of great empire. 
Law has been broken off, and he later studied biology, then he is for computers and steinhändler is, after all. 
And steinliebhaber. 
He is being stored stones 40000 tonnes. 
From across Germany karrt he his treasures. 
He says that he is the biggest altsteinhändler of the Republic. 
He put brakes on it. 
In the snow are skilful behauene sandsteine. 
"They were even in the Dresden marienbrücke," he tells. 
Elbsandstein, amber, warm, he schwärmt. 
"My lieblingsstein." 
It is the way high through the forest. 
It shows a bunch: red sandstein, previously part of the Karlsruhe railway station. 
And on. 
"beautiful travertin." 
Once included the quader on the balcony of the Stuttgart neckarstadions. 
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, cannstatter travertin from Stuttgart is, rötlicher stone is complemented with from the cathedral, St. blasien tuff from Heilbronner hospital. 
What kind of work that effort, which sweat. 
If rongen thinks about how the stones by hand earlier and riddled with simple flaschenzügen and ochsenkarren were mobilized, it is not reverential. 
"It is a scandal that, if you would schreddern something." 
He is not rich has become very rich, certainly not. 
But the steinhändler employs 14 people today, furthermore, high up in the forest steinmetze, a sculptor, a Smith, a glasbläser and a gartenbauer settled. 
"We work hard, but it is satisfactory," says the resteverwerter. 
He must soon after Cologne. 
Also, there are obstacles to the rescue.
