Cheshire-berufung power on Twitter closely 
Half a dozen of them tippten itself in the riots in the courtroom. 
In the minutentakt verschickten you on Twitter their reports on grausige testimonies. 
In the end, so the defense, there were more than 140,000 twitter-meldungen on trial for rape and beds gekettete children in a House, the flare-up. 
On Thursday, the process will be closely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to have been killed, a formal end to find out if the sentence on the death sentence, which the jury has spoken. 
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted proposals in court, to outline the reasons for an appeal, and the courts in years. 
One of the provozierendsten reasons is that, by the intense media coverage of the process, also through the extensive use of Twitter by durchschnittsreporter - to a "zirkusatmosphäre" and such a widespread, swift penetration rebel details, so that the jury in an improper manner by the public outrage had been affected. 
This protest could lead the appelationsgerichte, to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules will be required in the courtroom. 
"as I have seen during this process, I believe that there is a real danger that if the arrival of the new technologies in the courtroom every individual " s right to a fair trial," said influenced Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes hauptverteidiger. 
The presiding judge, Jon C. blue by the Supreme kammergericht, rejected last week, the applications by ruling, briefly and succinctly when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled," and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion. 
But it was certainly not the last word in this matter. 
For decades gerichtseinsprüche have found that the coverage of famous cases of doubt on the fairness of a process. 
In his historic decision by 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States the judgment against Dr Sam sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland who is supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision, that it is because of the new media, "a karnevalsatmosphäre in the courtroom." 
Some believe that the show and the movie "on the flight" on this crime is based. 
Some lawyers say, gerichtseinsprüche what Mr. Hayes condemnation of half a century later, could see the argument that new rules are necessary, in order to make the communication channels from the courtroom, who at the time of the fall of Dr sheppard to rules that were unimaginable. 
"There is a good reason, on the impact of the new media in processes, which will be followed by a wider public, to be anxious," said John J. donohue III, a professor at Stanford law school, the death penalty in Connecticut has investigated. According to his report, will it arbitrarily. 
Professor donohue said that some of appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restrictions on a prompt communications could have emerged from the courtroom, the processes of fair. 
The twitter-angelegenheit is only one of many that the lawyers of Mr. Hayes outline for years, in order to discuss and thus a conviction. 
The defenders claim, for example, too, that Mr. Hayes had already been regarded with hostility under any circumstances could be, as judge blue had not allow them to test the reaction of potential judges, by giving them during the jurorenauswahl grausige tatortfotos showed. 
Some of the judges have said that photos of the victim, Jennifer hawke-petit, 48 years, and their tüchter, hayley, 17, and michaela, 11 years, they would have with horror. 
The defenders say that they would also be the constitutionality of the death penalty to the Constitution in question, and argue that the judge mistakenly a jury have exchanged views, a critic of the public prosecutor 's office, and that he was improperly exerted pressure on the ruling would have been, as he had made the unusual decision, the panel released over the weekend. 
The judges were not isolated. 
But their arguments about the influence of the extensive coverage of the process, perhaps the greatest interest to them. 
In a urteilsanfechtung, which you have tabled last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the post of Governor and for the American Senate has been discussed by the candidates. 
They argued that the new media continually fan the flames of emotion on the case would be reopened. 
"such a daily crush of medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," his lawyers wrote, "has even beforehand in new haven, and perhaps even have not yet seen nationwide." 
Its focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial. 
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages were rabble-rousing but effective as reports, the slower be reimbursed, a technikfeindlicher view was that the reporting on verarme future processes. 
However, some lawyers said, would appelationsgerichte often with the argument that social and technological changes to approve the adaptation by the courts. 
Mr. hayers lawyers reinforce this assertion. 
It referred in its opposition to the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, in the conviction of Dr sheppard because of the coverage was lifted, and made it clear that the new media, new rules require. 
"this case," they wrote, "represents sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
