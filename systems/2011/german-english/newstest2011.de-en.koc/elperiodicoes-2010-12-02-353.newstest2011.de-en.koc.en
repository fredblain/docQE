Zapatero and the red line of Germany 
Berlin has decided for the keeping of the euro, but at the same time, conditions for the entire European Union. 
The tension on the markets have a two-fold response of the government. 
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, has put forward new measures, ranging from tax rebate for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary work agencies or the lifting of the 426 euros in support for the unemployed, no unemployment benefit, to the privatisation of 49 per cent for aena, the management of airports, particularly Barajas and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery. 
On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible, along with the current crisis herausbeschwört. 
How are these events? 
It is anticipated that Merkel 's position is not mistakes of their past. 
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro. 
It is Germany, a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future, which has ancient traditions with the maintenance of a large part of his partner. 
Given the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis spekuliern. 
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South to leave the euro area. 
The second: the restoration of the German mark - although that now sounds more like science fiction - supported by a large proportion of public opinion, around 50 percent of the population. 
The third: a transformation of the euro, in accordance with German proposals. That means: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of the countries that the requirements being broken; möglichereweise the failure of some countries, as well as the extension of the costs of adaptation to the private sector. 
The German position is clear and it is looming for some time. That is why there is now no excuses. 
First, in 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission incentives for deficits, and the German Government is a constitutional reform, withdrew from the sleeves in order to prevent this from 2016. 
It was the first signs of the drift between what Germany was thought necessary to (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. 
The second sign, the Central European country, as Angela Merkel, the decision to rescue of Greece was painful. 
At the time, was heavily criticised. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion absolutely against a bailout of Greece. 
Finally, Merkel in the last oktobertagen anew with a clear position. It calls for a reform of the agreement between the European Union, in order to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time, private lender to oblige, part of the cost. 
This position was interpreted as anti-European, since they irlandkrise and everything the following on. 
But your proposal, if somewhat sweetened, has been adopted. In the coming months we will be in the reform of the European Union that these measures should enable from 2013 to participate. 
Germany has drawn a red line that it intends not to exceed. 
It says all that - even if, now, unpopular measures must be taken - it from this date, the old ways of the euro will not be. 
In 2013 it will be a new monetary 1854, in which the offender countries severely punished, that can be forced to declare themselves bankrupt and in this case, the private sector a portion of the costs. 
Germany shows us that we must take a hard reviving, with high savings and investment, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances. 
The other alternative in the debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments is based, as she was led by Spain in boom times, simply will not be tolerated. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would do it, it is not to understand. 
It is not only a question of the budget deficit by 2013 runterzufahren three per cent. 
The demands are much tougher. 
And the worst we could do under these conditions, we even to cheat. 
I hope that the current turbulence in more calm. 
And that we need the opportunities offered to us, will use until spring 2013. 
It seems that Zapatero also understands, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, to create its own house in order, in their way. 
But the from Germany battered red line is here, and it does not seem that would bring about change. 
Among the possibilities are contemplating is that we are with little serious countries in the euro area, fully gestopften cannot be ruled out. 
In this case Germany might still tell us that it had warned us.
