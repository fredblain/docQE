Clotilde Reiss, case: the Elysée Palace exaggerates his act for Syria. 
During more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, kept the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher in Iran for "espionage" was held, the French public in suspense, left the diplomacy on red alert and akzentuierte the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran. 
All of this under the attentive eye of the diplomats of the United States. 
From WikiLeaks and received by the newspaper Le Monde durchgesehenen American documents give some background to this crisis. 
They describe how the Elysée had stated his strategy of the Americans, who went so far as this advice to deal with their own crisis of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of wanderern). 
They show on, such as the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman not the release of Majid kakavand, one in France and held prisoner by the American justice because of trade with material in favour of the Iranian nuklearprogrammes wanted Iranian to gegeleistung. 
Finally, they put the manner with which the French Presidency for the purpose of the media has been trying to manipulate the idea to make them credible, the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss, played in a harsh light. 
In truth, he had done nothing in this respect. 
A on 12 August, 2009 in Paris redigiertes diplomatentelegramm bears the title of "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostage taking." 
François richier, elysée-berater strategy that is discussed in the company of Patrice paoli, director of the Quai d " orsay to North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen allegrone. 
They declared it the French way. 
The advised the Americans to do everything possible to rückzuführen their own nationals, who were forcibly detained in Iran. 
"power of noise," they said, "articulated, loudly and clearly and without letting" the words' grundmenschenrechte, "" innocence ,"" immediate release "in the media. 
This is necessary to the Iranian regime to embarrass the very sensitive to his image. 
"since this is all the more so given that you ask the Iranians not to do that." 
Because "silence solves nothing," over the diskussionsversuche over on unauffälligem ways, the Iranians are "master in ausweichmanövern." 
Mr richier adds that the detention of foreigners, "a normal, Iranian tactics" was: "hostage taking for political blackmail." 
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss, from prison on August 16 (which should come in the days on which they are located in the French Embassy, unstoppable) "demand the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians' (230,000 euros) bail. 
And he does state that the Elysée antizipiere further hostage-taking, "a phenomenon that will worsen." 
The Iranians could "in the near future, another of the roughly 1,800 French citizens arrested in Iran," he said. 
August 28, 2009. 
Clotilde Reiss is 12 days, has been released from prison, but will continue to be held in Iran. 
An information was brought into circulation: the Iranians Majid kakavand, whose extradition to the United States because of illegal trade in empfindlichem elektronikmaterial to Iran, demand is after ruling of a judge in Paris, has been released from detention. 
The American embassy presents itself, like many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence. 
For Washington, which is the illegal Iranian networks of purchases on the nuclear programme planned material, is the release of Majid khakavand bad news. 
France has taken a fool? 
The liberation of the Iranian against the French woman? 
Following a further meeting with Kathleen allegrone on 4 September, François richier assured that this was not the case. 
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the decision of the judge," but have also tried to revolt against it. 
"It has a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Justice Minister, Michèle Alliot-Marie had been" (now), but "the French Government, the judicial decision does not change," he says. 
Mr richier would also like to point out that Majid kakavand continue to be under "strict" oversight of the French secret service. 
The elysée-berater selects a telephone number, is back on, then informed the American diplomat, the Iranians "are currently in the Iranian Embassy in Paris' buildings." 
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss, in Iran, too, the Elysée his efforts are not, by pronouncements and the media organized, "" believe fluchtversuche, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad Games a "significant" and "influential role as mediator." 
The Americans are monitoring this activity, not without irony, and I have to say that the manipulation bears fruit, because several articles reflect the official French version. 
A Council on 25 August 2009 datierendes telegram presents "the medienblitz the French authorities." 
"so much of what is based dankesbezeugung" towards Mr Assad, wonders the Paris Embassy. 
"in spite of their declarations, full of lobpreis give the French authorities to secretly, that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have done really well." 
The document deals then with the reasons which have brought to the Elysée this fiction. 
The intensive communication activities "aims to Sarkozy policies of opening to Syria to confirm," he analysed. 
A 2008 launched policy, which then "by numerous kritikerstimmen in France and abroad as premature and undeservedly was perceived." 
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" attempts by Paris "Syria, which can laud by playing a constructive role in the region." 
It is also, "discord between Syria and Iran to sow." 
The American embassy knows this from good source. 
On 11 August had François richier to her: "of course we do not know whether the Syrians have done whatever." 
"but we have, despite everything, is grateful to you." 
"This should at least create confusion on the part of the Iranians." 
Clotilde Reiss, returns on 16 May 2010 to France. 
Nicolas Sarkozy will conceive it in the Elysée. 
In a communiqué owes it to the President of Brazil, of Senegal and Syria, for their "active role in favour of the release of our compatriot."
