In the pursuit of WikiLeaks head 
Obama will appoint a high is responsible for the antiterrorismuskampf on the prevention of new revelations. 
Interpol has a red warning to pursue and find Assange has. 
Everything with WikiLeaks and its founder, jullian Assange has, is a complicated maze, in which the difficult situations into. 
Yesterday Interpol "red warning" to "detect and pursue" of Assange has. 
It is, however, this is not a traditional layout on the arrest. 
Moreover, it is not new, they came on 20 November. 
It also has nothing to with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but to do with the accusations of sexual abuse, which the Australians in Sweden must confront. 
Further assurances of the lawyer of the founder of WikiLeaks, mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they contact with Mr Assange has." 
On 20, the international police body, with headquarters in Lyon (France), at the request of Sweden 's ordering from, but it was not until yesterday after receiving the power by the Swedish authorities have not announced. 
So things are interpol-länder. The 188 are Assange has to identify and that "in order to provisionally arrest and extradite him." 
Although Interpol for the arrest of a of a red warning affected individual can impose, see many Member States according to the organisation of the Red warning as a licence for a arrestierung - which, by the national police forces must be carried out, particularly when they have a bilateral extradition treaty, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange has probably. 
The approach is causing assanges lawyers, the gestures, published a letter in which she was about it, the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks is prepared by video conference, the issues of the Swedish authorities to provide an answer. 
They also recall that Assange has the departure from Sweden and requested by the prosecutor, with the sagenumwobenen pavlovich lavrentiy Beria, security chief of Stalin, the permission. 
"This is like a hunt, not as a legal persecution," will be charged in the letter. 
While the world is him, and his mother of Australia from the innocence of their son, Assange has asserted itself to an unknown location on, but not in silence. 
On Monday he was the head of the magazine time via Skype from an unspecified location. In an interview, he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, the United States. 
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for ordering North American diplomats, the UN and spy on the United States has signed international agreements, it should resign," he said. 
His opinion was yesterday by the Pope of the White House, Robert Gibbs, was convicted of the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd." 
"I am not sure why we value on the opinion of a type with a website should place," he told the broadcaster CNN. 
Obama himself has a high is responsible for the antiterrorismuskampf, rusell Travers, with the prevention of new dokumentenenthüllungen. 
The attempt by the Secretary-General of the präsidenden Barack Obama, Assange has to pay less attention to, in contrast to the views of the Conservative politicians and commentators in these days. 
Congressman Peter King, from January, the Chair of the House of Deputies in the national sicherheitskommitee will lead the staatsabteilung, has been asked to investigate the possibility of WikiLeaks' on the list of terrorist organizations, "in order to put their money and to seize all those who support it, or to make a contribution to follow." 
Tom flanagan, an adviser to the Canadian President Stephen Harper, has gone even further, and he had to his statement, Assange has to be "murdered" retractions. 
"Obama would have to turn it into a target and a manned aircraft or so what use." 
Anyone who has not apologized, was Mike Huckabee, baptistischer Minister, a former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate. 
"if there ever was, the leaked information in the government, he is guilty of treason and everything is no execution, is eiine lenient sentence," he told the broadcaster Fox.
