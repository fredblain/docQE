Erdarbeiten puzzling 
The Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria. 
The country does, however, to take a position on this - and nor does it controls. 
About midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007 to take at least four Israeli F-15 fighter I, a mysterious, würfelförmiges building in Syria. 
It is on the shores of the Euphrates, the next major city, 30 miles away, is as-saur dair. 
Her name comes up in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, Syria allegedly with help from North Korea in the quader has built, hidden in a valley by the electricity. 
According to a briefing of the us-auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA from the end of April 2008, also would be under the name of Middle village have been well suited el-kibar normal reactor to produce plutonium - from which to build nuclear weapons. 
For other purposes, by contrast, is hardly the technique from the fifties. 
The CIA has led a videopräsentation before with blurred satellitenbildern. 
By computeranimation they ignored a, where the components of the reactor, from the destruction, should have been a fell copy of the North Korean model from the atomzentrum Yongbyon. 
Moreover, it presented photographs, above, the buildings from the vicinity show or even the innenraum. 
The reactor was shortly before the operation, it said, but not yet with brennstäben peppers. 
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is scarcely more aware than it was then, and indeed the mystery at the time were more likely greater. 
The former US President George W. Bush has recently in his memoirs, revealed that the CIA before the attack is fairly sure that Syria was in el-kibar built a reactor, but saw little evidence that it is in the country, "an active nuklearwaffenprogramm." 
Some intelligence officers in Europe, there are rather more cautious and only talk of an "alleged reactor," even if the cia-präsentation for "plausible." 
They lack of hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. 
Asked how confident he was of a reactor is to have a high un-diplomat, replied to me only in the summer, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have "enough material, to ask questions." 
The rubble of the supposed "dormant" militärgebäudes while the Syrians were hastily aside and planierten the site thoroughly. 
Nevertheless, took place in June 2008, a iaea-team under former chief inspector Olli heinonen, in el-kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people. 
Moreover, the IAEA about a Member State of satellite imagery of commercial providers from the period immediately after the attack, which may be more meaningful than, presented by the CIA. 
But are these recordings, not to get on the market, because of the unknown purchaser - perhaps Israel - it has bought. 
The IAEA can therefore not independently verify its authenticity. 
Syria has always asserted, has never been a secret nuclear program, farms or to have built a reactor. 
The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus. 
But it warned the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely. 
Since then, refuses to Damascus to discuss - as well as on the satellite pictures. 
The inspectors also denied there was a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the rubble of a bombed-out building. 
But Israel too Stony silence. 
"We never comment on the recent," at the time of the attack acting Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, the official position. 
So, the investigation of the case since June 2008 and fruitless "is becoming an increasingly serious problem of credibility for the office," as a senior Western diplomat in the headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna, authorises - there is a serious violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area on which the IAEA watchdog. 
As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which seems to have three more bodies in "functional link" with the alleged reactor should be - and unlike this still exist. 
The inspectors has not disclosed what the assets are, or what they are or what they seem suspicious. 
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are in the IAEA, as-sultan internally as marj masyaf and iskandariayah, in turn, derived from nearby towns. 
The independent institute for science and international security in Washington (ISIS advises) has identified these places and on satellitenbildern masyaf located in a complex, where it is most likely one of the suspects objects. 
It is probably in or adjacent to a military base - precisely with this justification, Syria has refused IAEA access to the three locations. 
In Vienna, says that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of the United States, in order to vorgeschickt will auszuspähen military equipment. 
Because the nukleardetektive goods through a tip of the US intelligence services on the institutions has become. 
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the quader on the Euphrates material was moved back and forth. 
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna, said that at least one of the plants could "in connection with the brennstoffproduktion." 
"But there is no evidence to sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes, which are needed for the construction of nuclear weapons. 
With the type of reactor will not enriched uranium, which is operated. 
But where the uranium would have to come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated on these central issues, there is certainly plausible conjecture. 
Also unclear is whether the valuable pieces of debris, traces of mountains, could have been stored at the three locations. 
As if the hundreds of stands the face disappeared, no one wants information about where the debris. 
Only a few kilometers from el-kibar, on the other side of the Tigris, al-tibni salzmine Syria, 1998 to their suitability as a camp for radioactive waste, the IAEA has investigated as unlikely. 
The former iaea-inspektor Robert kelley had recently in an analysis for the influential magazine from Jane 's intelligence review with the reactor. 
Recordings from the orbiting show, however, that Syria to the three suspects places erdarbeiten and large containers distant, after the IAEA access had requested. 
It may be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped, the suspicion. 
In addition, it says the IAEA in diplomatic circles, have used a number of months, a plan for inspections there to develop, which should allow it to Syria, to preserve any confidential - the effort shows how great is the interest of the inspectors. 
Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte also this proposal. 
Western diplomats in Vienna had even a year ago, soothed the reactor was destroyed, so the matter was not a matter of urgency, bring about US ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months' sonder-inspektionen into the game, one of the strongest tool that the Vienna atombehörde has, to impose controls. 
Iaea-chef yukiya Amano, these inspections should propose, has been of "an option, for which I am open in the future," but even then it is. 
There is a high risk in this way: it needs for a majority on the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and many of the represented 35 countries are anything other than eager for an escalation. 
On the other hand, like a diplomat to: "What is that, if they can find nothing in the end?"
