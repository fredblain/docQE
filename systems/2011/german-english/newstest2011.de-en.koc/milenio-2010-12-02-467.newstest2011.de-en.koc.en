China maintains its targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases upright 
The representatives of China said at the COP16, his country would have a huge effort to reduce the kohlenstoffspuren transition and it would maintain its offer of 40 to 45 percent by 2020 and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. 
China considers his offer the emission of greenhouse gases by the year 2020 by 40 to 45% assured, Su Wei, the representative of the country on the COP16. 
In his first public appearance at the 16th world summits of the United Nations (COP16) assured Su Wei, his country would be a huge effort to lower the kohlenstoffspuren and convert its industry. 
He said that in the last four years, his country is investing $245 million, in order to limit the emission of greenhouse gases. 
On the other hand, he declared that China would not change its objectives, but together with the international community would work in this matter. 
He said that the Chinese strategy on climate change in four aspects sub-parts: dialogue, capacity building, the establishment of institutions and support of pilot programmes. 
In all its aspects, we have made progress, including the adoption of a new energiegesetzes last year that the targets for the reduction of the emission of gases posts, he said. 
On the other hand, he stressed that, in China, the authorities of the states with which the centralised state and to the municipalities had worked the targets for energy saving, effective use of energy and the reduction of emissions. 
Moreover, he said, are already some multi-annual plans or been concluded, both those who have been funded by the Chinese Government, as well as those that received the money from other countries. 
For example, he was referring to the programme for the efficient use of energy, which in the past five years has been introduced and investment by the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands. 
It is also a project at the provincial level on climate change, another for the replacement of the traditional incandescent light bulbs by energy-efficient light bulbs and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said. 
Martin krol, scientific regierungsberater in climate change in this country, confirmed that China 's efforts are far greater than is commonly believed. 
He showed that per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China in six tonnes per person, while it is in the United States 100 tonnes. China is for a neunprozentigen overall contribution to environmental pollution. 
Just do it an unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. The energiewirksamkeit was in the last five years increased by 20 percent by 2020 and to another, he said.
