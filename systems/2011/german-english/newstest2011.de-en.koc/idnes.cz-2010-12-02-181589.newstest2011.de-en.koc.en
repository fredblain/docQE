The army has so many firecrackers that completely from the Czech Republic umwickeln could they keep but only two years. 
The Czech army has 445 kilometres Firecrackers, bought with explosives will be released. 
In the year before, the Defense Department already 224 miles but to the double. 
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces for 225 years ausgesorgt. 
The problem is only the shelf-life of firecrackers - two, a maximum of four years. 
The army bought the firecrackers from the company stv group, A. S. for paltry 40 million crowns. 
In his explanatory statement for the purchase of this huge crowd but mf dnes, the army said the soldiers were in a year, but consume 60 kilometres. 
The research by armeepyrotechnikern mf dnes, according to the point of this is raised, indicating that the whole army, each year, an intensive training course pyrotechnics - of all the generals and commanders of the armeekommandos, up to the secretaries and cleaners. 
Defense minister Alexandr Vondra and army general Vlastimil picek not excluded. 
Only in this way could be of considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres zündschnüren reasonably justify. 
This length to 25,000 detonationen. 
But even so they would be armeebestände for more than ten years. 
But if even the old rule of experts is that for the training of every new professional two metres but quite sufficient, that it is the army through this neueinkäufe - from the point of view of the increased needs of the key and special forces - a reassuring stock for the already mentioned, 225 years created. 
They complained the soldiers of the schnelleinsatzbrigade recently with the Defense Minister Vondra, you would have almost no cartridges for small arms more, so that is the lack of resources for severely constrained. 
Not to mention the unterhosenmangel. 
"I also do not understand why they are such a legion of US buy firecrackers." 
But it is ultimately their decision, you will already know, what they need it. " 
"for us, the army is a good customer, which we very largely as a dealer would like to come forward," says the vertriebsmanager of stv group Jan děcký. 
Jan pejšek, the spokesman for the Department of Defense based on the purchase of hundreds of kilometres, but the army had moved so for at least ten years with this "ammunition" heckle him. 
Jan děcký from stv group but talks only of a four-year gebrauchsdauer of firecrackers and police and armeepyrotechniker even only by two years. 
"in perfect storage are arguably the four mentioned years possible," one of them, but wants to remain unnamed, not as a soldier, the criticism of the army to be accused of. 
After the expiry of the gebrauchsdauer must any ammunition to be tested thoroughly, whether they still is reliable and not the lives of the soldiers at risk. 
These tests, however, are not in vain, but it costs more money. 
A further argument of the Ministry of Defence is the mengenrabatt but for the 445 kilometres. 
"It cost us 60 percent less than the last delivery of 244 miles," spokesman pejšek tells us the position of the rushing of the Ministry of Defence. 
Only by way of comparison, the annual consumption of zündschnüren of pyrotechnikern of the police, the munitions from the second world war or the Soviet bruderarmee, liquidate some years barely 1,500 metres. 
And the police have only ever been such amounts of ammunition it before the end of the gebrauchsdauer can consume. 
The safety of the pyrotechniker because, in addition, it holds the possibility of more modern flexible purchases and therefore reliable firecrackers open. 
The Defense Department has already huge problems in the winding up of the tens of thousands of tonnes of munitions from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, as the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak army in their campaign to the Rhine. 
According to the pyrotechnikern mf dnes raised, expects the Czech armed forces, in a few years ago, the same problem with the elimination of hundreds of kilometres of old Firecrackers, which you now so "favourable" has bought.
