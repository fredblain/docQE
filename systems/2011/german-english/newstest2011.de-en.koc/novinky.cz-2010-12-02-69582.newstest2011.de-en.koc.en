Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum, beer is out - it is simply too slowly 
Fernet, rum and vodka, and time for a good whisky, the father of the hausbar has stolen. 
These are the drinks, for whose benefit from drunken Czech teenager under fifteen most must be notbehandelt. 
No exceptions are children, the ausschlafen repeated their hangovers in the hospital. 
This comes from the experience of doctors, with similar cases in the inclusion of the kinderabteilungen of clinics. 
"beer or wine are completely out of fashion, because there is simply too long to be drunk." 
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol," said právo luděk Pelikán, the senior physician of the kinderabteilung in the mittelböhmischen clinic hořovice. 
"whisky, if it succeeds, the father of a bottle from the hausbar to entwenden, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka. 
"vodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then it looks not so much," said the senior physician. 
The speaker of the fakultätskrankenhauses motol Eva jurinová gives him right. 
"most often refers to Fernet or rum." 
"This is the current alkoholtrend, particularly at primary school." 
"It was also able to slivovice, take it from home," said Mrs jurinová. 
According to senior physician Pelikán are dreizehn- or fourteen-year-old drinkers in the krankenhausaufnahme does not breed. 
Before the clinic in hořovice, from which he has been working this year, he was 10 years in the pädiatrie-abteilung of the hospital motol, where the ambulances angetrunkene pupils from both near and far ablieferten. 
"A girl four times and had to be taken." 
"It began her career with 12 years ago, when it is the first time with 3.5% alcohol in their blood and in combination with" extase "was," the doctor described a particularly severe case. 
"It was in the ausstellungsgelände in centers on any tanzparty." 
"The interesting thing was that it was strange not even their mother that her daughter came home 48 hours not surprised," the senior physician. 
The lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance where with the own sprösslingen is regarded as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children. 
In order to have a real dependence in the true sense of the word, is it not in children, according to experts. 
"alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and related phenomenon to understand and that is not the case in these children." 
Among those who enjoy repeatedly alcohol, is mostly a negative familiär-sozialer background characteristic Pelikán, "said senior physician. 
The spokesperson for the hospital, according to motol, Mrs jurinová until the middle of November, were around 40 drunken children in the abandonment of department of child and jugendmedizin instructed. 
However, only the cases with severe five-year auction, a hospital, go in the statistics. 
Drunken children for non-hospital treatment of the parents or, if necessary, by the police to be brought home, are not registered. 
Apart from the cases in which children only times as a bottle of spirits in the schulbank austrinken, there is the opinion of Mr Pelikán three jahreszeitliche amplituden, on the 100% is good: walpurgisnacht, Sylvester and the end of the school year. 
"the latter for two reasons - either because of the poor testimony from grief or joy to the holidays." 
"in the walpurgisnacht, I have also already been seven drunken children at once in the inclusion of experienced," said Dr Pelikán. 
A betrunkenes child that spending the night under medical supervision, paradoxically, is better off as a child, the very next day, only with a nasty hangover. 
The headaches in the morning, then, by May, and by the glukosemangel arrived, it is in hospital with a flüssigkeitsspendenden infusion with glucose and nutrients, which is the body missing, remove them. 
"They are clearly better off, because after the" beautiful "experience in the evening, raise them with good humour to, without something hurts." 
"They are just a little confused about where they are," admits he is a doctor Pelikán, with patients at least sometimes the good humour is polluting, by offering them, which they are listed on the cost of the treatment will cost. 
Because the transport with the ambulances and the night in a akutbett well and are happy to come to a few tens of thousand kronor. 
"and then I saw this as an educational instrument, if I used directly to the children in the visit have summed up their drunkenness, which has cost, and that it can happen, that it is time the whole holiday on must work to have the money for a single such fete to earn more," added Dr Pelikán added. 
In his view, the health insurance companies do not, however, in order to regressverfahren to cure the trunkenen children necessary costs of the parents.
