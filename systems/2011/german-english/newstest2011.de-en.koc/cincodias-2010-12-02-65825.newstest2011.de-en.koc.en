Red Bull triumphs in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens 
The car will be improved with a software in real time. 
For Red Bull in 2004, the world of Formula 1 racing, is their history in this splendid universe of speed of surprises and successes. 
Initially, no one paid much attention to the newcomer, and despite his sharply rising education over the last few seasons, in the final sprint in the last November, all on the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso. 
Without the skills of the German pilots and champion Sebastian vettel, or the performance of the motors of Renault to want to belittle, is the "secret weapon," the multinational Siemens Red Bull in the hands of, and thus a siegerteam created on the legend. 
In reality, is a powerful software to simulate processes, which the German company in 2007 for purposes not with motor race have to do, on the market. 
This as plm informatikprogramm was called for the development of montageketten in factories around the world, energiewerken and precise instruments are used. 
What this is doing is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is built, in order to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs. 
Plm, the development of the cameras from canon, the aircraft of Sukhoi and one of the most famous vehicles from Nissan relieved. 
Siegfried russwurm, head of the industrieabteilung from Siemens, says that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 - factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes and improvements to the race, and the tests are observed, and can carry out. 
Russwurm reveals that in 1992, in the rennst√§llen 10 technicians were working on average in a season than three or four improvements. 
In red bulls team are now employs 180 highly qualified young people with powerful edv-anlagen they lead analyses and all sorts of changes to the rennwagen through. 
The siemens-manager said that the plm-software had all the ingredients of the rennwagen of Red Bull to analyse and to improve, with the exception of the motors, for the only Renault are responsible. 
The materials for the fuel, the aerodynamik and the security elements are changing. 
The changes can thanks to advanced production facilities and hightech-autoklaven within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulators in reality. 
The only border, which is set this insane technical perfect, the $40 million, which is a Formula 1 - team for his race may spend in a season. 
Red Bull has its hightech-fabrik for the development and production of its rennwagen 50 kilometres from London in a remote location. 
There are two buildings in which visits - particularly of journalists - heavily circumscribed. 
What is happening there, everything is top secret. 
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion vettel and mark webber. 
But red bulls true Formula 1 - zweifelslos hero is the latest world champion Sebastian vetell. 
Behind the huge technological resources, the energy-drink-hersteller in the services of his participation in the race tracks, hide other protagonists, whose support is priceless, and whose fame is nil. 
The technologichef of the plant, Steve nevey, emphasizes that, five years ago, it was possible to say that the progress made in the area of R & D for rennwagen with 50 per cent to victory and earned the pilots were responsible for the rest. 
Today, the anteilswerte changed. The technology makes 85 per cent of success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent. 
Nevey recognises that vettel and webber by processing can never be replaced, because they "are not voraussagbare gladiators."
