Under the arm of a file, with three new rental to three homes: for our own and the homes of his daughters and his son, who had just served a prison sentence. 
All three were in the framework of the so-called "deregulation" just the rent increases. 
Instead of 3,500 kronor monatsmiete is the son of next year for a 2-zimmer-wohnung with kitchen fork out the second category of 4100 crowns. 
"and because there is not time in the apartment, a fluent hot water and heating must be in a simple kohleofen," if he upset the finger at the new lease of the son, signing a warrant. 
"But what I signed," he says half of upset and half resignedly. 
Bytyokd.cz 's citizens' Association, the new mietbedingungen as "incorrect and immoral," advises the tenants, the new contracts are simply not to sign and to wait until 7 December, at which it intends to publish guidance as it against such contracts.

Just beside the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and with a aufrufgerät. 
"rent" in 2011, it would be a special tastfeld on the touch screen situated. 
And already touched upon this briefly spuckt the device from a nummernzettel. 
Hardly, we have the number "157" entziffert and already piepst them on the large display on the ceiling of the warteraums. 
More than half a second later, one is in the series. 
A little later enters an older couple, the waiting room, after the rent to ask questions, but the onslaught in the waiting room is apparently not even the new rent. 
Most people are here to the usual problems to solve - reparaturanträge, face, and so forth. 
From the middle of November, fly in the region, the kuverts Ostrava with new rental most tenants out of a total of 44 000 homes of the portfolios of the rpg in the letter boxes. 
The rpg byty proposes to you in the letter, a mieterhöhung of around 15 to 38%. 
The special switch to the new rent is klientenzentrum opened since the November 18. 
"The action is a little over a week, that is to say, this is just the beginning," answers the ladies behind the counter for a moment of hesitation, when the "client" turns as a journalist. 
The deregulation and bakalas former bergarbeiterwohnungen are a hot topic. 
Before the elections, the Lubomír zaorálek Ostrava parlamentsvizepräsident connected by the ČSSD quite loudly, picked up on this issue, it is no surprise that today the newspapers are full of them.

Until now, according to the researchers, especially pensioners on counters, in order to convince them, whether they will receive the promised mietermäßigung rpg promises to them if they spezialangebot sign up in time. 
In the benefit of a half reduced februarmiete should also take the other tenants, the new lease until 15 December sign.

Rpg offers both on their websites, as well wandtafeln individual mietvereinbarungen, where it seems necessary. 
Should the mietparteien but not to the new rent for some, they will be set by an independent court.

The regulated rent ends in the largest part of the Czech Republic byty new year and in 2011, according to the mieterhöhung rpg is an economic necessity. 
"the existing level of rent is not enough time for the upkeep of the wohnfonds from," argues Pavel klimeš, the director of the society wohnungs-portfolios rpg and byty - particularly those of the disgruntled tenants criticised neglect of the wohnungsfonds is the view of the homeowners as the main reason for the mieterhöhung.
