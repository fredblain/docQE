The eis-universität 
In the "gelato university" will be eiskonditoren in Bologna on better seasons prepared. 
The three-day grundkurs for future gelatieri has the most numerous and visitors from around the world. 
Where does the whole ice? 
The gelatiere and the gelataio. 
The gelatiere slightly old-fashioned, in German, the cream of the eiskonditor following all the rules of Italian eismacherkunst. 
The gelataio fetches with a spachtel the ice cream from the kühltheke, discard it in the waffel and then selling them. 
In order for it to know that we must not after anzola Dell 'Emilia in the province of Bologna. 
But who still want to know more about ice, which is not on the "gelato-university" the Italian firm carpigiani over. 
The eis-universität, the manufacturer of eismaschinen set up in 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines around the high Italian ideals. 
The three-day grundkurs for future gelatieri has the most numerous and visitors from around the world. 
But there is also mehrtägige spezialkurse around the schokoladeneis and work placements in the such thing as eisdiele. 
Some in the midlife-crisis dreams of a new career, other cars simply time on the treacherous ice of their vague aspirations. 
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia. 
Jacky, kunstlehrer from California, loves the slow-food-bewegung and wants the country to the industrial ice-cream in future, a European quality product offer. 
Anke from Berlin is unternehmensberaterin and wants to after years in a nervenaufreibenden job eintüten something of their own. 
Two young Egyptians dream in Cairo to open a eisdiele. 
A man from Malta and a from Brazil want the quality of the ice cream in their bars improve - and the Canadian housewife Julia, because their children Italian ice cream love. 
Maestro-gelatiere Luciano Ferrari declared the participants to the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream. 
What is crucial is not only good taste, but also the seidige fluidity and the good consistency. 
Luciano forgets, in his training but also not the icing on the cake of the national and südländischen überbaus: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still plenty of romanticism." 
The first step to manufacture seems quite simple. 
Luciano dump the grundzutaten milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilisers in a large mixgerät which, with an electronic programme everything to 85 degrees heated and then immediately to four degrees cools. 
Then he shoots a tap on the machine, and out comes a pasteurised White basiscreme, basis for all milcheissorten. 
The lecturer will immediately they were all practically crowding me with questions: can one ice cream only with natural substances without stabilising factor? 
How can one of their own experimentierlust free rein? 
Luciano warns the zeitgeist, led astray. 
Who of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" speech, has probably still stabilizers used - usually a product of nature, such as guarkernmehl from the guarbohne. 
Of course you can ice without stabiliser, only there must then be sold within a day, otherwise it sackt in together, and the customer eiskörnchen bite on rooftops. 
Certain variations in the grundmasse are allowed. 
There will be more exciting with the flavourings. 
For a taste of the ice is what distinguishes Maestro branded consumer Luciano between the ingredients, the one in the obst-abteilung or the sweets of the supermarket, buy. 
Moreover, there are powder and pasten. 
"The suppliers will all try to foist onto them dozens of aromatised additions." 
"But they should simply time to experiment." 
Either the fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruits. 
Or just the ice cream from the White grundmasse, with eggs to yellow cream and with kakaopulver became the basis for all kinds of schokoladen-verführungen. 
Now, the kursteilnehmer to the eismaschinen. 
Luciano leaves them four different types of vanille-, schokolade-, mokka- and produce haselnuss-eis - with or without eggs in the grundmasse, with more or less vanillearoma or other natural additives. 
The same experiment will also be subject to the fruchteissorten. 
More flavourings, more frucht-püree covered - that is not necessarily better. 
Haselnuss-eis tastes nussiger, if it is not necessarily more hazelnuts. 
The most popular kiwi-eis, the working party, which more fruit, use less water and less stabiliser. 
Only a balanced combination would emphasise the taste of a gelato rightly stressed, says Luciano. 
Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: will pfirsich-püree with a lot of sugar used in the grundrezept sugar must be reduced. 
For zitroneneis is a extraportion sugar necessary. 
Luciano prefers a device with which he stressed that the sugar content of the fruchtsorten (wine fairs so that the oechsle in grape must). 
Fortunately, the calculation will facilitate tables. 
Ice does not require longer to make so much physical use as before. 
It is not just the equipment for the automatic production of the grundmasse helps. 
There is also a device, in which the final eis-mischung cremig beaten, and at the same time, minustemperaturen cooling. 
Despite all the automated remain small glitch. 
The Brazilian Gustavo acquitted himself and his kurskollegen from top to bottom with fruchtpüree, when the überdimensionale hand blenders spirals out of control. 
"in every course," says Maestro branded consumer Luciano, "it is only a matter of time before such a thing has happened."
