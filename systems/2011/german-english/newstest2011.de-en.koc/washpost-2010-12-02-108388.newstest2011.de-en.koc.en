Durchgesickertes portrayed us-dokument Moscow as a haven of corruption. 
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and they are a part of the bribes and of the schutzgeldes that you einsammelt. Further, to the Kremlin as reported in February, the American Embassy in Russia in a memo. 
Both police and the state security service blackmail high protection money, so that they keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, so it is said. 
You collect money not just of legitimate businesses, but also of organised criminal gangs. 
Each layer of bureaucracy - Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as a "vertical the authority" has described - takes its part of the money that the head to the top. 
The memo, which, under the name of the ambassador John beyrle was broadcast to Washington, was on Tuesday of WikiLeaks published on its web site. 
The memo is based on sources, whose names have been edited. 
It was written while Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov was still there, and it accuses him of corruption. 
He was in October by President Dmitry Medvedev fired, but there is little proof that in the meantime, would have been sorted out. 
Luzhkov, and his wife, Yelena baturina, who owns a construction company, have repeatedly rejected allegations of corruption for years, and he has many for libel against such accusations. 
In September, he told a Russian television station, when he was asked, according to a documentary, which suggests that he is corrupt: "It is crazy, it is dirty, it is dirty." 
An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. The surveys show. 
But it is unusual that, as the report of the ambassador, individuals are listed, and it is unheard, that this by a diplomat of a foreign country. 
"The direct link to the government in Moscow with the crime has meant that some people they describe as" disrupted "and come to the conclusion that the government is more like a kleptokrat as a government," according to the memo. 
"criminal elements" enjoy a kryshna " (a term from the world of criminal / of the mafia, what word for word" roof "or protection means), which is about the police, the Stasi (FSB), the dienstaufsichtsbehörde (MVD) and the office of the public prosecutor, as well as by the entire Moscow regierungsbürokratie. 
Experts have a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow. 
"Luzhkov is paramount." 
"The FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage." 
"least consequences of the ordinären criminal and the criminal inspectors at the bottom." 
"This is a inkompetentes system, in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap, because the city is offering no help." 
The report goes on to say that the FSB money from the biggest companies in the police and small business people were arrested. 
One source, so that is, "said that Moscow shopkeepers understand that it is the best protection from the MVD and FSB to receive (and not from the organised crime), since they are not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law." 
"This is why the protection by criminal gangs, not more so asked as they used to." 
The memo noted that, while the collection of the money is, to protect himself very modest no; even the, the figures are sometimes arrested. 
Those who do not pay very quickly closed their businesses find - on the basis of one or other under. 
Medvedev has repeatedly spoken to fight corruption, but at the same time, noting that he has made little progress. 
The memo the message contains descriptions of men who, with suitcases full of money, which probably were, in the Kremlin. 
"in his fight against corruption must Medvedev left to the bureaucrats," said Georgy satarov, director of by, a Moscow think tank, in a recent interview. 
"But he is part of the bureaucracy." 
"It is no part of the political class, because a political class in Russia is no longer exists." 
Without an opposition politicians, without without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable. 
Nationally, it is estimated by the corruption of Russia, will cost more than $300 billion per year. 
The country ranks at number 154 to a recent study on global perceptions of corruption by the non-governmental organisation transparence international (countries will be of "most corrupt" to "most corrupt"). 
The disclosure of the memos from the American embassy, which happened late after Moscow time, will surely displeasure within the Russian Government, even though, as Luzhkov for the mistakes of Moscow 's, can be blamed for the Kremlin can also be a way to say that we will resolve the problems. 
In an interview with Larry King on CNN, Putin claimed that the wikileaks-dokumente might be a forgery and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats him Batman and Medvedev Robin listed. 
"The truth is that our interaction is an important factor of domestic politics in this country," he said. 
"But, to be honest, we would not have expected that this would happen with such arrogance, such pressure and so unethical manner, you know."
