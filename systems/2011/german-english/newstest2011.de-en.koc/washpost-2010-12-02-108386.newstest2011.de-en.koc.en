Can courtesy of what divides us? 
After a campaign in schimpfwörtern and negativity is little courtesy in Washington this week to erupt. 
It is the sign of a real zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion, before it was quickly back to the struggle of the parties in the capital, is returning? 
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress produced no breakthrough on the big issues to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck" session of the meeting at the end of a period in which no decisions will be taken to employ more. 
After all this, what one hears, it was neither a polite debate between two sides or an account of their shared responsibility to rule, but rather an empty episode of a biased punktesammelns. 
The public meeting of the deficit Commission of the President on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences between the Members to continue. 
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months, a mutual respect, and the emergence of the ideological divide, which is still the Members divides, disguises. 
That is hardly enough to claim that it was a new era of cooperation now upon us, in my opinion. 
Both sides are now in a testing phase - in one of the other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise, while it tried to claim, the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters, according to a new parteienkriegsführung weigh. 
This was why the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants on a minimum requirements or accusations limited. 
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep, but rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, might hope. 
Regardless of whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or the benefits is concerned, the two sides are miles apart. 
Lastly, the novemberwahl Washington, at least for a short time, bribed. 
"No question, the tone has changed," said pete wehner, a official representatives of the Bush administration, now for the "ethics and public policy center" works. 
"It is inevitable after the elections. 
Elections are partisan passions that again. 
And that is good. " 
On some issues, particularly in those who are on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. " 
End of the Bush tax cuts at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it. 
Both sides want to find a way to receive some or even all, whether temporary or permanent. 
Similarly, it is a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits to be expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that it believes that the supported tax cuts for the rich, while they refuse to help unemployed workers. 
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House is the optimism, that it is in these issues during the "lame duck" session of some and, at the same time, the New START Treaty can ratify. 
But William glaston of Brookings insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame duck session, "not necessarily to a lasting cooperation between the parties must lead if the new 112. Congress convened in January. 
Instead, he says, is a phase of the nichtübereinstimmens more likely, perhaps even inevitable. 
"After the things that have to be done is done, this short-term psychology in confrontation reversal," he said. 
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - the courtesy to real cooperation. 
"I see from today, much of what happens in 2012, when vorkampf, or posturing, for the main event, from 2012," he said. 
The reasons for this have much with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House to do so, and with the teeparty-wählern, which were useful for their education. 
How worried the Republican leader also may be that they vie too high, they know that they must try to their promise to cut government spending and health-care reform, to comply with them. 
This parteilinien are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the deficit Commission clearly, which is a tax reform and raising some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and reducing government spending. 
The Deputy Chairman, Alan Simpson and erskine Bowles, one of the toughest jobs in Washington, and we have accepted, according to their own judgement, so very insisted that the defizitfrage on the public agenda that they no longer can be ignored. 
But they need within the Commission for 14 of the 18 votes to their plan to make the official recommendation and they are very well only in the vicinity of this number. 
The greatest opposition is the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters, today at least, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises. 
Galston says two stages in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress. 
The first battle next year in the form of parteizusammenstößen take place, if the Republicans Obama in terms of the state budget, taxes and the health care system, then later followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation. 
What will lead to this change? 
Public opinion. 
It has been proved that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties to work together. 
If the confrontation is a blind alley, as happened in 1995, then both sides must carefully on the public reaction. 
Whoever is doomed to lose the will to change tack and seek the compromise. 
This may in fact be an optimistic outlook. 
Partisanship and polarization are greater now than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem to have a wider ideological divide between Obama and the kongress-republikanern than at the time to be between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. 
At the same time, to see the activists from both parties in 2010 as merely prelude to a far wider choice of consistency in 2012. 
It may be the courtesy which display this week, will be welcomed by many Americans. 
But it will on both sides of a lot more effort, a common denominator in the questions, to find the two as separate from each other.
