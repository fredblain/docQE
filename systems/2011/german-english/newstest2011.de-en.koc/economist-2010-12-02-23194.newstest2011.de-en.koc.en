Secretly, in the middle of 
In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband, Argentine President, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy that their beliebtheitsrate by 20 points to more than 50%. This is the highest value since its election in 2007. 
However, whether this is a re-election next year, depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández entertain a compromise than her late husband, your predecessor, Néstor Kirchner and political partner. 
The signs are not clear. 
Néstor Kirchner, even after the election, the economic policies of his wife was often on the budgets of tax revenues, growth and inflation does not fully into account. 
This allowed the presidential couple then, the extraeinnahmen spend as it sees fit. 
On paper, the fernández-regierung lost in the last year, the majority in Congress. 
But the opposition is divided and the Kirchners death after a heart attack on 27 October, led to further divisions. 
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández. 
But after chaotic meetings (with a member of a different face to face and others suggested the government of the bribery accused) managed the Congress not to pass the budget for 2011. 
"I will not discuss it," said the President. 
The 2010 budget now applies also to the next year, allowing the President still has more chance of spending money as it sees fit. 
The economy is hot: probably it will this year by up to 9%. 
The official inflation rate is z.z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - the value of up to almost 30%. 
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was ridden by economic crises, said growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not the inflationssenkung. 
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, singled out for bullying the private sector and säuberte the National Institute of statistics and census indec, prompting the official inflationsstatistiken schönte. 
Fernández now can we path? 
It has the private sector and the trade union leaders for talks. 
According to official statements and wage increases next year are limited to 18%. 
The high world prices for Argentina agricultural products have a strong boost to the economy. 
But the inflation undercut the burst through a big devaluation in 2002. 
Perhaps for this reason, Cristina Fernández would like Argentina and economic back to the rest of the world to follow. 
At the beginning of this year, the government made an agreement with shareholders holding the previous debt restructuring of the country in 2001. 
Fernández now appears on an agreement with the other donors from the Paris Club, which she owes about $6.7 billion. 
The Kirchners have had a review by the IMF, as elsewhere, always rejected. 
But in the last month, the economy Minister Amado boudou announced that the fund in drawing up a new national consumer price index will provide "technical support." It looks as if this is the first step to clean up the indec. 
It is not known whether Mr Fernández after the end of their term even without the support of her husband will be politically active. 
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which is largely has enough from Kirchnerism. 
If the Argentinians in March to return from their summer holiday, the wave of sympatie, which was shown to be fizzled. 
If you want to win another election, which it must decide whether to many political decisions quietly, her husband is lifted.
