Second mandate: the offenkundigkeit 
De Gaulle was really being whittled away. 
Mitterrand had faith that he stutze. 
Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation. 
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that. 
A mandate in the Elysée calls on the next. 
The current head of state is so candidate in 2012. 
But the offenkundigkeit is at the side of the mysteriums, which cannot, not good to face. 
We must therefore act as if the doubts went bankrupt. 
In one, as well as the other senses. 
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac, a third mandate was not ruled out, without even to believe in it. 
On 15 November, assured Nicolas Sarkozy in serious by his decision "some time in the autumn of 2011." 
On Tuesday evening that he was in the Elysée before the ump-parlamentariern the prospect of "two mandates" would let me, therefore, had a little fieberhaftigkeit. 
This was the official announcement of his candidacy? 
Far from it. 
The President, just to remind you that the Constitution in 2008, the number of five-year terms to just two. 
He made a statement that no announcement. 
It is not the first time, that he is the presidential election, on the occasion of such meeting in a humorous tone. 
"You have the worst case scenario, even seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009. 
On a new in May 2010: "does not believe that I do not think about the stage after that." 
His words from the day before the candidates do not make him more than the previous day, but also no less. 
The comments, then you should be cause for a twofold reason. 
The acceleration of the wettlaufes for the candidacy with the hp on one side. 
But it is not the inclusion of the competition with Segolene Royal, Nicolas Sarkozy, is driving to unfold. 
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which many Members of the PS early than to challenge must cease. 
The bad polls, on the other side. 
The first time would the voters of the right with a candidacy by François Fillon, of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to survey the bva-l 'express). 
"We have a candidate with the UMP and there are no discussions," responded immediately and restrained the environment of the Prime Minister. 
"if he would be a defeat as possible, he would not candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin shares with. 
"He will always believe in it, to be able to win," corrected Alain Juppé, who, with the offenkundigkeit has resigned.
