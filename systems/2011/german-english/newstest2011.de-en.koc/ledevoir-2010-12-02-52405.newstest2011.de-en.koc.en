A global plan for the renewal of the lighting 
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN has a plan for the renewal of the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries, with a view to achieving a reduction of the greenhouse gas (CFC) suggested that the nearly a third of the additional reduction is the equivalent, which must be implemented in order to stabilise the earth 's climate by 2020. 
This ambitious plan takes his position in the steps of the specific projects, which hopes to implement the UN in Cancun, in the absence of compelling reduction to compensate for the developed countries. 
After the last of the plan would be the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (GT) because of the lighting on the earth " s CFCs are to be avoided, if the weißglühenden pears, which still has a monopoly of 50% to 70% on the market, are by fluoreszierende or, better still, by light-emitting diodes (led) would be replaced. 
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. 
This is the equivalent of 70% of the exhaust fumes of global vehicle fleets. 
In Copenhagen last year had the big abgasemittenten, such as the United States, China, Europe, and others, including Canada, reduktionsplänen to volunteers, the global fckw-emissionen of 53 GT to 49 GT should lower. 
From this assessment we would, however, in order to deduct 5 GT between now and 2020 the klimaanstieg by 2 degrees Celsius, to stabilise in order to prevent this spirals out of control. 
In the weißglühenden pears escaping 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% of the light to produce. 
With the kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs we are once again to these energy needs twice that. 
The kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen hold, on average, between 6,000 and 10,000 hours. 
The new LED bulbs, such as those of the manufacturer Philips this week has been on the market - this society has also participated in the uno-studie - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80 percent less energy than a weißglühende pear, which is a suggestion the savings of the auswechselungsplanes gives, which is to be applied in 100 countries. 
Besides the fact that iese entirely new incandescent light bulbs, only very little heat, they can also with a regelwiderstand work. 
And they do not contain any mercury. 
Several specialists have pointed out that kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves, because they contain mercury, and that they were as hazardous waste must, therefore, in the developing world, which is not always possible, but the producers are a bring centre. 
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, is not the kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit far more mercury, the weißglühenden pears wasted to generate electricity. 
In the United States alone, these are 25,000 tonnes of mercury from coal-fired power plants a year. 
The report sets out in detail the profits, which each country thanks to this international programme would generate. 
Indonesia, this would, for example, a $1 billion a year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose interests of Indonesia would cost around 2.5 billion.
