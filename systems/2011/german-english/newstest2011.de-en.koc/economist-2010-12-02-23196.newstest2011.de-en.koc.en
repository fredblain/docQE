Weak applause for China 
Taiwan voters are nearing slowly a closer link with the mainland. 
What does Taiwan from his big brother across the Straits? 
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, which is 70% of the electorate, in the five city 's to elect mayors and councillors. This will be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou. 
Through the development of pioneering business, einschl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland. His policy has the relationship to the Chinese motherland sustainably for the first time since 1949. 
Ma has the tests, but only barely. 
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT), three of the five mayor, it received no majority. 
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has a greater independence for Taiwan supports, almost 50% of the vote, the KMT received 45%. 
In a presidential election this would mean for Ma problems. 
Since his election two years ago is the support of his party by around 8%. 
For the first time, the DPP even, together with the KMT in the councillors. 
During the election, there was the usual events such as convoys of lorries in Taiwan to reclaim flaggen-schwenkende massenumz체ge and only a dancers. 
There was even the obligatory, mysterious attempted assassination. 
Sean LIEN, the son of Lien Chan and ehrenvorsitzender the KMT held on the eve of the election, in a speech at a kmt-kandidaten 
When a man from the crowd in the face of womb. LIEN was wounded and a umstehender spectator was killed. 
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter LIEN kill or a dispute with the candidate wanted to settle. 
Regardless of the attack, according to tsai ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the election, and the DPP in a bad light, what the KMT has more votes. 
China may have been the biggest winners in the campaign. 
Remarkably, the relations with the mainland. 
Instead, the candidates debated over plans to housing and the creation of jobs. 
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and are opposed to China " s milit채rbedrohung. 
For this reason, the KMT its relations with the government in Beijing, much to the fore. 
But this time, the DPP, also avoided the anti-Chinese feelings too much. 
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan 's economy cannot survive without China. 
Ma has, in turn, would like to confirm that the majority of the Taiwanese its policy towards China. 
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of Taiwan with economic incentives in the Community zur체ckzulocken. 
China sent immediately a negotiator to Taipei, for a summit to investment to prepare and medical cooperation. 
Certainly, it also wants a political integration. But the most important thing first. 
It would prefer to wait until after the 2012 presidential election. 
The DPP has now joined the newly invented. 
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: the former leader Chen Shui-bian sat in jail for corruption. 
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was very much in favour of the complete independence. 
But under tais reign has developed a new generation of gem채ssigter politicians and the DPP struggling to find the voices of the professionals and young people. 
Tsai took place as a presidential candidate of the DPP great support, such as Su tseng-chang under Chen. 
Her party is doing everything now, to show that they, too, is able to establish close relations with Beijing. 
Tsai is planning a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this requires broad discussion. 
Tsai said publicly that their party a "trustworthy alternative" offer to Mas vorschneller rapprochement with China. 
Chen seems very angry about this change. 
From his cell, he said, the candidates from the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan independence. 
He urged the pragmatists Su even on, on the presidential candidacy. 
Chen also without interference by the DPP is hard, to elect candidates of their potential. 
The KMT will need to undergo a own self-analysis. 
Mas values are poor, despite the rapid economic growth; the kmt-kandidaten their campaign wanted to lead without him. 
The main reason for his unpopularity seem to unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor. 
According to the testimony of a kmt-sprechers will he, his cabinet, and the local institutions. 
The strong action by the DPP suggests that Taiwan is a rapprochement only restricted. 
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese economic cooperation with China as inevitable. 
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist at, "there is no return."
