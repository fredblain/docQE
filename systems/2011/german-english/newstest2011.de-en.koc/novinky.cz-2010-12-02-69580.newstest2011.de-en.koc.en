In the building of the bodenfonds in Pilsen, the antikorruptionspolizei arrests in the last few days. 
It was the abandonment of medien-unternehmer and immobilienhändler luboš G. from the detektiven in handcuffs. 
These had allegedly tried to just a public competition to be held restitutionsansprüchen so to manipulate, that the competition offered a specific plots zufielen interested. 
This should luboš G. for half a million have paid out. 
"At this point I can only confirm that the police have a person for the offence of fraudulent practices followed by a public competition," said antonie zelená, the head of the pilsner public prosecutor, "the newspaper právo further details could be made in relation to the ongoing investigations. 
24 hours later, the 46-jährige entrepreneurs of the police again dismissed.

The speaker of the bodenfonds Lubomír černá led to the question of právo to police in the pilsner branch of the bodenfonds indeed arrests and this during a public competition. 
"It was a client, and nothing to do with one of our staff," she specified. 
The public competition, according to Mrs černá had the correct title "call for tenders of entitlements for the transfer of land under the land law" and would take place in cases in which several applicants interested in the bezeigen land offered. 
"These persons are in the context of the call for a higher value of their through the transmission begleichenden restitutionsansprüche than the proclaimed grundstückswert."

Later, he exchanged this very favourably with the government against a House directly in the historic centre of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land. 
At the town hall had to kleinbeigeben with a heavy heart, for the works not by the blocking of the land.
