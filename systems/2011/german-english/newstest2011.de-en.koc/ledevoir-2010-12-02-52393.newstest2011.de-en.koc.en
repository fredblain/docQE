Staatsanleihe for the takeover of excentris 
The quebecer government, of the Société Angus and the company urged parallèle itself financially to the adoption of the kinokomplexes to participate in excentris, explains with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive bond. 
The entwicklergesellschaft Angus, as well as the company parallèle, a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture has provided for the adoption of the Daniel Langlois Molokai kinokomplexes excentris on the Boulevard saint-laurent had hoped to bring this back to the control of his actual cineastischen function, do not seem to get what they have demanded. 
The government has accepted, to involve themselves in this matter, but on their own terms. 
Instead of the expected donation offers the quebecer government instead a bond in less than initially hoped that a viable solution to create favourable conditions could, at least in the opinion from the State scaremongers entnehmbaren sources. 
A first action plan as well as a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, the bittgesuch was again since the summenmäßig downwards. 
A proposal, together with an action plan has already been made by the President of the 'Société de Développement des Entreprises culturelles " (sodec), François macerola, Minister st-pierre, which broadcast the acts of excentris. 
Several days ago, he had sent her a last sachbericht. 
The counter-proposal from the cabinet, the sodec, however, on Wednesday. 
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December to respond to this time. 
In any case, the premise of the staatsspende seems really to have been pushed to the side. 
Let us bear in mind that the quebecer eigentümergemeinschaft cinemas and kinokomplexe against a direct staatsinvestition to support the takeover of excentris had rebelled, by making the argument, the Culture Ministers have no financial aid for immobilienprojekte there, which he does not also gave other cinemas. 
Several other market participants, however, of the light klagten, by contrast, there are substantial economic assistance. 
Kinochef Daniel Langlois, after the eigenfinanzierten assemblage of cinema over ten years, with great difficulty, the autorenkino in the premises of his kinokomplexes is presenting what the exception from the treasury could justify. 
The lack of cinemas, the independent films show in Montreal, is more than obvious, and excentris knew his clients in the bar. 
Société Angus, as well as the company parallèle with Christian yaccarini taxes, for its part, the head of a privately financed campagne, of which they are hoping for a sum of $700 000, in order to boost the acquisition. 
Since the spring of 2009 is powered by just a single screen, continues to show films in excentris, namely Le parallèle. 
The objective of the future buyers, it is, the three theatres on 27 February of next year with the showing of the well-written film of Xavier beauvois "des hommes et des dieux 'again. 
Christian yaccarini but the newspaper, "Le Devoir published" not removed, and it ignores what he and his group from the revised downwards proposals, which we think has made them.
