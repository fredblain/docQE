The kindsmörderin recognises, that they had on the Internet about the "hardship" motherhood complained. 
The young woman spoke of the child, than this already was dead and they had a blog: "terror on Galician nature." 
Monica juanatey Fernández is on the Internet, "muki." 
Under this beinamen, from an early age, does it with a kusine and at least one friend contact. Both date from noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, in which she was born. 
The communications are out of the year 2008. 
In order to understand this, you need to know your love life, the daily newspaper ABC, on the basis of evidence of their families. 
The 30-year Galician Mrs began in 1998, a relationship with Iván túñez, an industrial. 
They held a year ago. 
Their relationship shortly after she had dissolved, it was revealed that she was pregnant. 
He wanted to know whether the baby was of him, but his former left him never to conduct DNA analysis. 
Shortly afterwards, it was already a different relationship. 
The chosen was Alberto, a young man from lousame, a nachbargemeinde. 
She lived with him for a long time. 
César lived on them. 
As the young woman on the Balearic Islands, are on the labour market, the small shop with her partner, even for a week to Palma. 
But from the content of their news, their liebesbeziehung disintegrated and they parted. 
In March 2008 she is alone on Minorca and writes: "Alberto is a very strange and annoyed, because I am has to work." 
"When I told him, he found it well, but now, of course, it is obvious what it means, with the young, throughout the day, to be alone and not to be free to do what he wants." 
Later, she mentioned a communication, which it has received precisely on the cell phone: "I would like to see you this month zurückkommst me or an address, in which I can send you to the young." 
She complains: "if he does not like the young, that I am my mother, I back him, if I am." 
In May, it addresses by the return to their village, said: "this week, I am going there, but I will only until 19 stay there, because I imagine on 20 to a work, if I do not want to lose." 
They declared that they will take their erstgeborenen, if all goes well. 
"he will be, in which he needs to be done, that is, to me, I will never in their lives him again on someone except for my mother," a dubious intent, if one whose bad relationship. 
In July, there is a further mail. 
As of this writing, it is assumed that the young, of the 1st of the month, came to the island and supposedly on 10 was assassinated, is dead. 
"on the one hand, it is not, on the other hand, César satisfied." 
For me he is "on the one hand, and the place like him a little bit, but on the other hand, he must go to school every day." 
She speaks of a process of moving to Mallorca. 
"There will he (the boy) to attend a sommerkurs, so I have less expenditure on the Nanny." 
On 17: memories and complaints. 
"a riesenkuss of César, the asks me, 'you are." 
"Alberto is saying that he had sent to e-mail me with any videos. You see, if he wants, it finds me, so a dung." 
On 30 one more thing: "the young is doing well, he is in a sommerkurs Catalan, in order to learn." 
By Víctor, her current partner, there is a saying: "He shoots me money." 
On the Internet, in anime- and mangablogs, there are communications from her. 
They even had their own blog on MySpace, which is now closed, and in which they are "muki, the gefängnisentlasserin called." 
"terrorism a la gallega (headline)." 
The last man, who with her zusammenlebte, a vereidigter jagdaufseher explained, to have any hesitation, because he felt guilty. 
He may not catch everything that happened because she had not told him that she was a single mother. 
Monica was yesterday by the Centre for gerichtsgefangene on Menorca into provinzgefängnis of Palma. 
The officially appointed lawyer, Carlos Maceda, declared that she could not recall the expiry of the facts, "and they have no intention, the little harm." 
However, before it had confessed, César drowned in the bathtub and his body in a suitcase verstaut. 
Defense and prosecutors have requested a psychiatric assessment.
