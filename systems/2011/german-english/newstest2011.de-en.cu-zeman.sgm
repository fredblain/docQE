<seg id="1"> What can you do, the čssd? the czech social democrats in prague are not aware of voldemort, nor the "employs." </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new ratsherren of capital from the ranks of čssd will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers, to their old - new colleagues from the ods in prague council and in the stadtvertretung to be able to understand at all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The newspaper aktuálně. cz members of the new council has cut off from the čssd time a little ,"" as they dominate the notorious slang, which has been established in the last few years, in which the current coalition partners were in prague at the helm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The encoded vocabulary, in the, era of mayor pavel bém was introduced by the prague political elite is, some of the most prominent actors, situations and causae borrowed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils in relation to these new concepts something groping in the dark. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The claim that it is at least. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Who is voldemort?" </seg>
<seg id="8"> "No idea." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am a newcomer rather in the prague policy ', lukáš responded kaucký, the new ratsherr on culture, on the test of the" godfather - vocabulary'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But also the ratsherr karel březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar way. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example, on the concept of 'golfloch'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "It is the only expression of which, i present here, which i use now and again." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "I do not think otherwise a lot of often infiltrated by slang." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> For the vocabulary, the tageblatt aktuálně cz in this june had before the electoral congress of the ods published, pickte the editors six concepts, particularly those that are notoriously associated with the prague magistrate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The social democrats should the concepts of "voldemort," "the greatest prague golfloch ',' in the employs,," "stiernacken," "betrayal of the capital," and "verblechen" define. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Three prague ratsherren agreed to the test, the fourth - mr weinert, the future head of the prague school system - promised first its participation in the conversation, the listeners, but then did not time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The fifth ratsherr, petr dolínek, rejected the test from the outset. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "These things are indifference to me whether and how the civic democrats with each other, as i do not judgments." </seg>
<seg id="19"> 'Is important for me, as we understand, "he responded within the framework of our programmes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> As already indicated, lukáš would have kaucký in the above - mentioned headline supposedly not recognized that the influential entrepreneurs and friend of the ex - mayoress bém, roman janoušek is the speech. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The term 'voldemort' kaucky purely says nothing at all, and the only concept, the he was on the test erriet correctly, "the greatest prague golfloch." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "It is the tunnels, blanka," says kaucký, added to security but still: "but i know this from the newspaper rather." </seg>
<seg id="23"> And jokingly: "i will be required to attend a language." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The "golfloch" will not only by matador karel březina, but also by the councillor for the environment lukáš plachý rightly described as tunnel blanka them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Both social democrats know but also, for whom the concept of voldemort and lukáš plachý senses even to find, where this figure and this is also what it means to "in the employs to go." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "I believe, in other words, to go into any prague gastronomiebetrieb ', plachý is quite close to the solution to the problem, when we know that there is the seat of janoušeks firms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> In line with březina, but he claims this knowledge to have drawn in the newspapers, rather than to him this vocabulary, it would be. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> According to the testteilnehmern judgments, it seems to give amongst the social democrats is really no similar naturalisations slang. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I asked my colleagues too, but obviously there are something we really not." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "We call upon us by name, and we also use acronym or nicknamed" again, says the chairman of the prague čssd petr hulínský of his party rather loosely, called 'hulda'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "I bříza (birke) was called in the school, but i do not know whether i am also mention my colleagues so ', tells us karel březina its nicknamed. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The newspaper deník cz has tried and see aktuálně. there, and it works. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Ratsherr weinert is for the party friendly 'grandfather' or less friendly the "old" miroslav representative saying that before the elections by machinations at party sponsorship in drew attention, is "igráček" (known by some colleagues czech lego - figure). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Nicknamed are so the only, the social democrats in the whose language allow that to happen. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The right mattress and the right bettenrost? women have other wishes than men </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Not the tollste bettrahmen, but the quality of liegefläche - in other words make mattress and rusteth the good bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This must, however, harmonising, in order to fulfil the wishes of the specific user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Many things a role to play in the selection process - the weight, the size of the health and, last but not least, the sex of the schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Equally important, is the interieur, in subordinate the mattress and become rusty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a wochenendhaus, in the regular heated, are latexmatratzen is not well suited to because they need to be "hot" for much longer. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethane - mattresses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And they should be regularly. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If you do not have enough entlüftungskanälchen in heart and are still on a solid record, they so snarled humidity: it is not excluded, that under its mould. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the election, of course, also plays a role, and what we are used. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Who was longer time abroad, where very high common mattresses with weichschicht will be difficult to have become accustomed to a low mattress with hard surface can. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "All hockey player, from the nhl have returned, have complained to me that they are no longer able to sleep properly." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "For their abgeschundenen shoulders goons and hüften, they simply need a weichschicht from visco foam (memory foam - a formgedächtnis - polymer)." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I recommend including diabetic people who suffer from a disruption of the nervous system, so that they are the 'information' can receive from the gelenken and skin bad," says sylva hadamcziková, the specialised in polstermöbel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> I am, therefore, many years ago eishockeyspielern, but also other customers these mattresses concerned with visco foam (memory foam). </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Today, it is no longer a problem because provide such mattresses. for example, the manufacturers. tempur, the italian firm magniflex or the czech manufacturers tropico." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And we must not necessarily be a famous hockey player, they will learn to appreciate the benefits of the visco - schaums. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" actually works quite simply. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The foam optimalisiert his rigour and form in accordance with the absorbed heat, in other words that he schmiegt downright on warm body. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Nowhere is it, in the night shifts not around as well as a serious fight. </seg>
<seg id="22"> We simply sleeping much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The viskoelastische foam in addition to offering protection against dekubitus (gangrenous). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In the election of the matratzengröße we need to height still along the length of the fußsohlen, i. e. approximately 21 to 34 cm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Men as women, to the 180 cm are in need of such a large 210 to 220 cm bed. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Each of the liegebreite sleepers should at least 90 inches available, so together 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In einzelbetten, for example in singles are 120 to 140 cm appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And also, for the sake of the comfort for any visitors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise the following rule of thumb for the ideals bettbreite applies: "if you on the back, should still be easy enough room for the angewinkelten poor ', advises helena prokopová, zunftmeisterin ing. the polsterer and raumausstatter, have been working for years the issue of healthy sleep and devoting ergonomics of furniture and also on this subject colleges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> In a doppelbett, everyone needs a own rusteth and its own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattress also at the same level. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise nothing else is left, as the roste in different level assembling and that is something that is not in every bettrahmen possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high with federskelett 15 cm, mattress, should be at least three centimetres accounted for by the formschicht and the feinpolster. </seg>
<seg id="33"> 'With their hands or to sit down the feathers in any case felt "helena prokopová warns that. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Every mattress makes a specific rosttyp required. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document as zusammengewachsene siamzwillinge have nothing to seek the bedroom. </seg>
<seg id="36"> These mattresses not lift the veil and the terms, we cannot wash what today and there is already motion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And since we in a single night loses between 0.2% to 0.75 l sweat, it is clear that the mattress, after five to seven years, beginning to be a huge (and congested sieve). </seg>
<seg id="38"> For this reason also experts sales patter reject, the lifespan of up to 25 years in mattresses, yes even lifelong guarantee promise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Every matter has its ifs and buts. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And is therefore a practical council of the distributors: in mattresses of 120 or 140 cm broad should be the waschbaren hygiene, abziehbaren references to not hesitate, nonetheless, it is recommended that a matratzenschoner to deduct the it is easy to use and can wash. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even if today in the rule matratzenbezüge be established with rundumreißverschluss, so that they can get open after the two halves (immensely important for the waschvorgang and the waschmaschinengröße!), seems, especially the manipulation with greater mattress alone, often carried out as the unequal struggle between david and goliath. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> Have you in bed instead of a rostes firm record? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Out so that! </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or for a maximum of a bed for undesirable guests and for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They should also provide the prosaic prefer with lüftungslöchern (if there are already not) and mattresses with federskelett and 15 cm minimum with so - called taschenfederkern and feinpolster use. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethane - mattress on such a document not belong. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For not verstellbare lattenroste with 14 to 18 federleisten (lamellen) are suitable latex - or sandwichmatratzen (where necessary. also combinations of latex and kokos), ever more figures are roste with a larger lattenanzahl, in other words, from 28 and more federleisten with lordosenstütze in the lendenwirbelbereich and the possibility to regulate the lattenhärte. </seg>
<seg id="48"> On verstellbare lamellenroste with federskelett does not include mattress, since it is not on the ergonomische subterfuge respond. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> In addition to the attitude of the stiff federleisten also need special flexible schultermodule. </seg>
<seg id="50"> We are talking about a specific securing the federleisten, which makes it possible to federleisten einzudrücken or even to verwinkeln so that they allow the selective einsinken the back of the schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Particularly for men with broad shoulders an important matter. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Indeed, there are matratzenhersteller which have started to use, "herrenmatratzen" weichzonen for the schulterbereich. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Also the ladies is intended - you at this weichzonen in the hüftgegend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For ambitious clients are punktelastische flügelfedersysteme (lattoflex) or roste contact with punktelastischen - pads with so - called multitorsionsfederung. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure will be distributed on a number of points, thus reducing the tension. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But, if we at the right mattress and right rusteth a bad (go to great and fülliges) kopfkissen used, lost most of the benefits. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Here, too, a rule of thumb: the kopfkissen should uphold the head, its leaders should only up to the shoulders of rich, so that the schultermuskeln can relax. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Ideal is therefore a huge 50 x 60 cm cushion, as it may, for example, the scandinavians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In the seitenlage should the kopfkissen (together with the schulterentlastungszone in rusteth or compensate the weichzone in the mattress) the schulterhöhe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> To have our modern mattress with the former (hay fat) strohsäcken but common. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern manufacturers use increasingly natural materials or at least whose mixtures. </seg>
<seg id="62"> The new magic formula 'bio' also means in mattresses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead erdölrohstoffen we used for the manufacture of polyurethanschäumen are becoming increasingly frequent naturelle oils - rizinus - and soya oil, for example. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soya will probably used by manufacturers of all known. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> "Organic, in other words mattress which is at its heart from materials purely natural origin," says petr vašíček by the firm tropico plus. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Naturstoffe but are also used in the manufacture of matratzenbezügen - it was one of the first aloe vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> But one can also be mikrokapseln sleep, the fresh pausing forest - or lavendelduft spread. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Here too we make a difference between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While the men a "kühlender" pflanzenextrakt from birkenblättern is used, so that the matratzenbezug can absorb the heat and cooling the body, have the salaries paid to women 'wärmende "effect. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Extracts from red paprikaschoten rain the blood circulation to sleep, the weaker sex with so wohlig warm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> And today 's favorite? </seg>
<seg id="72"> Mattresses from kaltschaum (he has greater poren with zellstruktur destroyed and is, therefore, atmungsaktiver than standard polyurethane and also much more flexible). </seg>
<seg id="73"> By the combination of the various stiff (tough) by kaltschäumen and visco - foaming does occur, the more zones - mattress know exactly where head, hip and closely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> For a high - quality mattress, however, it has 7,000 kroner and more to fork. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Gesundheitsmatratzen, but are usually burdened with lower vat, since they apply as medical device. </seg>
<seg id="76"> The first czech companies have received this advantage gumotex. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> We see, but to save the mattress and on rusteth is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Now and again there are special of manufacturers and distributors, the two mattresses for the price of a offer. </seg>
<seg id="79"> So the mattress duofreeze offers the brand magniflex with in relation verstepptem visco foam czk memory for 11.990. </seg>
<seg id="80"> The second will be free to do so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the material tempur, the era of the viskoelastischen schaumstoffe with open zellstruktur and dense began in almost kosmischem pace. </seg>
<seg id="82"> No wonder, when they were developed for nasa, because the astronauts are exposed in the launch huge excessive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83"> Tempur in heat soft, operate in a cool it again. </seg>
<seg id="84"> So it is the human body fits perfectly and distributed in the best possible way körperdruck. </seg>
<seg id="85"> It is therefore not only increased ideal for prevention of druckbrand, but in general, schlafkomfort. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86"> Viskoelastische schaumstoffe, but not only in mattresses, but also in other gesundheitsprodukten, such as, for example, used in specific fußpolstern the legs and is intended to provide relief gefäßen. </seg>

<seg id="2"> The czech army has 445 kilometres of install detonators, with explosives detonation purchased. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the year before the ministry of defence had already 224 kilometres zündschnur delivered to the army. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is reassuring to know that the armed forces for ausgesorgt 225 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The problem is only the shelf - life of install detonators - two, but no more than four years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The army bought the install detonators, s. a. by the company stv group for mere 40 million kroner. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In his explanatory statement for the purchase of this huge quantity zündschnur replied the general staff mf dnes, the soldiers would annually to the 60 kilometres zündschnur consume. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The research of armeepyrotechnikern according to the mf dnes point raised, is for this information, that the whole army should every year a very intensive pyrotechnic training - of all the generals and officers of the armeekommandos, up to the secretaries and putzfrauen. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Defense minister alexandr vondra and army vlastimil picek not excluded. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Only in this way can the substantial annual consumption of 60 kilometres zündschnüren reasonably justified. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In fact, this length corresponds 25,000 detonationen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> But even so, these armeebestände for more than ten years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But if is the old rule of experts, that two metres to any new professional training zündschnur quite sufficient, then the army by this neueinkäufe - and also from the point of view of the increased needs of pioneer - and special units - created a reassuring supply for the above - mentioned 225 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> It complained soldiers of schnelleinsatzbrigade the defense minister vondra recently that they no longer have almost no cartridges for small arms, so that firing because of the lack of resources are severely restricted. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Not to mention the unterhosenmangel. </seg>

<p>

<seg id="22"> After the expiry of the gebrauchsdauer, any munitions are thoroughly tested, must be reliable, and if they are not endanger the lives of soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="23"> These tests are not in vain, but cost more money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Another argument of the ministry of defence is the mengenrabatt for the zündschnur 445 kilometres away. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "They cost us sixty per cent less than the last supply of 244 kilometres," spokesman pejšek tells us with the position of the purchasers of the defense. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Only by way of comparison, the annual consumption of zündschnüren pyrotechnikern by the police, the munitions from the second world war, or of the soviet bruderarmee liquidate exceeds even some years hardly 1 500 metres. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="27"> And ordered the police only always such quantities of these munitions which it before the end of the gebrauchsdauer can consume. </seg>

</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Men, whose finger long, than ringfinger, are is obviously a lesser risk, prostate cancer of the uterus. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This is a surprising result of a study, which was published on wednesday by the british journal of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This is the mirror of the male hormone testosterone contexts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer and this specifically in men and 60," declared the joint author of that study, company ros eeles, professor on cancer research centre at the university in warwick. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The finger could help to determine what men is necessarily a prostate cancer - test should, above all, if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as, for example, family health burdens, mrs eeles added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In the period 1994 - 2009 we had with their colleagues in britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time also 3000 healthy men. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In more than half of the participants of the study was the finger right - hand shorter than the ringfinger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> For these men was the same likelihood of prostate cancer, as well as for ring - vaccination and 19% of those men, whose finger were the same length. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In men, whose finger longer than the ringfinger was, however, this risk fell by 33%, to sixty even by 87% for men. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The relationship between the length of the two finger, mentioned the forming itself in prenatal age, obviously reflects the different mirror of sex, which was subjected to the child in the womb. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Less testosterone responds to a longer finger. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Former research show that it is precisely the testosterone accelerate the growth of prostate cancer. </seg>

<seg id="21"> Luciano does not forget in his training but also the icing on the cake of the national and south überbaus: "italian gelato is simply the best - and then is still a lot of romanticism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first step towards achieving seems quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Luciano dump the grundzutaten milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilisers in a great mixgerät, that with an electronic programme everything on 85 degree heated and then cool immediately to four degrees. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Then in the machine a hahn revolves around it, and is a milcheissorten pasteurised white basiscreme basis for all. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Luciano warns, let itself be the zeitgeist in which mislead. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Who of ice cream "only from natural ingredients' speech, has probably still stabilisers used - usually a natural product, such as guarkernmehl from the guarbohne. </seg>
<seg id="29"> We can, of course, ice, they also produce without stabiliser but it must then be sold within one day, otherwise sackt it together, and the client biting its own tail of louder eiskörnchen. </seg>

<seg id="34"> "The suppliers are all trying to you dozens of aromatised additions." </seg>
<seg id="35"> "But they should simply time experiment." </seg>
<seg id="36"> Either in the fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruit. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Or just on the ice cream from the white grundmasse, with eggs to yellow cream and with kakaopulver the basis for all sorts of chocolate temptations offered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Now, the kursteilnehmer on the eismaschinen. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano, they each four different types of vanilla whatsoever, chocolate, mokka - and hazelnut - ice - with or without eggs in the grundmasse, with more or less vanillearoma or other natural additions. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The same experiment will also undergo the fruchteissorten. </seg>
<seg id="41"> More flavourings, more fruit - püree taste is not necessarily better. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Hazelnut - ice tastes not necessarily nussiger, if it contains more hazelnuts. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The most popular kiwi - ice is the working group, the more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser used. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Only the taste to highlight a balanced combination of a gelato rightly stressed, says luciano. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Eisherstellung is a mathematical exercise: will peach - püree used with a lot of sugar, the sugar in the grundrezept must be reduced. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For zitroneneis a extraportion sugar is needed. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano prefers a equipment, with which he measured the sugar content of the fruchtsorten (winegrowers so that the oechsle grape must). </seg>
<seg id="48"> Fortunately, facilitate tables the calculation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> To make ice physical use requires no longer so much as before. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Not only the equipment for the automatic manufacture grundmasse helps. </seg>
<seg id="51"> There is also a device, or in the final eis mixture will at the same time cremig beaten and minustemperaturen cooling. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The international atomic energy agency has iaea new references to a secret nuclear programme in syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The country is opposed, however, to take a position on this matter - nor does it controls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Against midnight from 5 to 6 september 2007 i at least four israeli f - 15 fighter a mystery, würfelförmiges building in syria. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is; the next major city on the shores of the euphrates, 30 kilometres away, is dair as saur. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Its name is in documents of the international atomic energy agency (iaea), when it comes to the reactor, the syria supposedly with help from north korea has built in the quader, hidden in a valley, the electricity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing of the us - auslandsgeheimdienstes cia at the end of april 2008 would be the also under the name of middle town el - kibar normal reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which we can build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes against the technology from the 1950s is very little. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The cia led a videopräsentation with satellite blurred. </seg>
<seg id="10"> By computeranimation played a, where the components of the reactor before they have been the destruction of a verkleinerte copy of the north korean model from the atomzentrum yongbyong. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also, photographs before they clearly show the buildings from the proximity or even the innenraum. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor is on the verge of operation, was it, but not yet been with pellets alarms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombing that is little more aware than they were then, have been the mystery is increasing rather than with the passage of time. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The former us president george w. bush has recently in his memoirs, revealed that the cia before the attack was quite sure that syria in el - kibar built a reactor, but little evidence that it was in the country were "an active nuclear weapons programme '. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some intelligence in europe there are even more cautious and only talk of a "alleged reactor," even if they hold the cia 's presentation for "plausible,." </seg>
<seg id="16"> They lack hard evidence, as well as the iaea. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Asked, as it is, a reactor before have replied to a high un diplomat in summer only baldly asserts that the iaea, "enough material to ask questions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The rubble of the supposed "unused militärgebäudes' surpassed the syrians hastened to one side and planierten thoroughly premises. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Nevertheless took place in june 2008 an iaea team under the former chief inspector olli heinonen in el - kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Also the iaea on a member state satellite imagery received commercial service providers from the period immediately after the attack, which should be stronger than the presented by the cia. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, to get these recordings on the market does not, because the unknown customer - perhaps israel - it has bought exclusively. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The iaea can therefore not independent verify its authenticity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always claimed that never to have built a secret nuclear program or a reactor. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium come declared by the israeli weapons, damascus. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But the, the iaea back after analysis of the particles as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then, damascus, refuses to discuss - as well as on the satellite imagery. </seg>
<seg id="27"> It also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el - kibar and access to the ruins of the bombed - out building. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But also israel, staunchly is silent. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We will comment on the never," confirmed recently at the time of the attack president - in - office of the prime minister ehud olmert, the official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> So the investigation of the case since june 2008 has been dragging out fruitless and 'is becoming a serious credibility for the authority', as a high western diplomat at the seat of the iaea in vienna admits - after all, it is a serious breach of the treaty on the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons in the area, about the iaea. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As the key to progress in the enlightenment, the iaea appear three other institutions, the "in functional link 'with the alleged reactor should - and other than this still exist. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Yet the inspectors have so far not disclosed, about what installations, or what it is they are or what they appear to be suspicious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to information from the süddeutsche zeitung, you are in the iaea internally than marj described as sultan, masyaf and iskandariayah, again derived from nearby towns. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent institute for science and international security in washington (satellite isis) has identified these places and on a building in masyaf, in which it is probably one of the suspects objects. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It is probably in or directly quite apart from a military base - precisely with the explanatory statement denied syria of the iaea access to the three places. </seg>
<seg id="36"> It says in vienna, the syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the iaea ahead will be to military auszuspähen by the united states. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Because the nukleardetektive were marked by a piece of advice for the american secret services of the institutions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The iaea has evidence, including satellite photos that between the three places and the quader on euphrates material out - and hertransportiert. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A high western diplomat in vienna said that at least one of the installations could 'in connection with the brennstoffproduktion ." </seg>
<seg id="40"> But there are "no indications of sensitive activities', in other words, uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes, the construction of nuclear weapons are necessary. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The type of reactor will be pursued with uranium, which is not supplemented. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But where the uranium should have come from and where it should be separated later the plutonium for the bomb on these central issues, there are only plausible guesswork. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> It is also unclear whether debris, could the valuable traces of mountains, have been stored in the three places. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As if the hundreds of trailers disappeared from the face of the earth, nobody wants to have any information about them, has remained where the rubble. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The only a few kilometers from el - kibar located on the other side of the euphrates salzmine al - tibni, syria in 1998 to their suitability as camp has studied for radioactive waste, the iaea as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The former iaea inspector robert kelley had it in an analysis of satellite recently for the venerable jane 's magazine associated with the reactor in intelligence review. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Photographs from the orbit show, however, that syria in the three suspects places erdarbeiten and big container distant, after the iaea access had requested. </seg>
<seg id="48"> This can be accidental, but little has helped, the suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Also says in diplomatic circles, the iaea several months later used to develop a plan for inspections there, which should allow syria to maintain that any military secrets - the burden alone shows, is how much interest the inspectors. </seg>
<seg id="50"> However, damascus bügelte this proposal too. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Had western diplomats assuaged, even a year ago in vienna the destroyed reactor is, therefore, the matter have no high urgency brings us ambassador, glyn ford davies since, for example, a few months ago, the so - called special inspections into the game, one of the harshest means that the vienna nuclear organization has, in order to enforce controls. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Iaea chief yukiya amano, these inspections should propose, has of "one option, for which i am open in the future ', but it is dragging its feet yet. </seg>
<seg id="53"> There is a high level of risk in this way: on the one hand, there needs to be a majority in favour in the board of the iaea, and several of the countries represented there 35 are anything other than keen on an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other hand, as a diplomat are concerns: "what is, if you find in the end nothing?" </seg>

<seg id="1"> The demokatrische routine </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The democracy in latin america is more, as the support of private companies. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Crime is a greater problem than the unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In many parts of the region, brazil 's influence is greater than that of the united states. </seg>
<seg id="5"> To these results, the latinobarómetro survey carried out in 18 countries and exclusively in the economist was published. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This survey is being carried out regularly since 1995 and shows the meinungswechsel in this region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two facts, particularly in this year 's survey of september and october in' s eye. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Firstly, the good mood in latin america </seg>
<seg id="9"> And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In many countries of the south american pacific coast has increased considerably the democratic movement (s table 1). </seg>
<seg id="11"> In peru, for example, where the economy has been growing at an annual rate of around 6% since 2002, the number of democracy rose by 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Also in mexico, where the economy recovers, since the sharp drop in the last year is such a trend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But only half of the people polled in mexico and brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, reducing the regional average (s graph 2). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Around eur 44% of the respondents said that they be satisfied with their country 's democratic practice. these are as much as in the past year, however, 25% more than in the year 2001 (graph 3). </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some 34% trust the congress of their country and 45% of their government. both values correspond to those of the last year, but show a clear increase in relation to 2003 (17% or 24%). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Undermined latin america 's economic crisis a decade ago the efforts towards more democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This also lasted during the great depression, is perhaps due to the fact that the countries of latin america only have a brief recession, and a speedy recovery. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, the poor have been absorbed by a stronger net. </seg>
<seg id="19">  (According to reports from the un economic commission for latin america by this week, the poverty in latin america only slightly and 2009 has fallen again this year in by 32%.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But there are strong stimmungsunterschiede from country to country (s graph 4). </seg>
<seg id="21"> Brazil 's strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing president luiz inácio lula da silva is reflected in a widespread fortschrittsdenken. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In mexico and central america, where it was the recession more tangible and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Only the second time since umfragebeginn see many respondents in latin america in the crime in your country a bigger problem than in the unemployment (s graph 5). </seg>
<seg id="24"> Some 31% say that either they themselves or a person in the last year have been victim of a crime. but fallen compared with 38% last year, are the values and thus achieve the lowest level since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The rising economic performance is reflected in the increased support private - and the market economy: around 71% of those surveyed cross said that the private sector is crucial for the development, in the year 2007, it was 56% (s graph 6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can bring to your country progress compared with 47% in the last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly, 62% of respondents in venezuela (retain this view and 80% are in favour of a private sector), even though its left - wing president, hugo chávez, many private companies nationalized. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil has according to 19% of respondents (18% in the last year) the biggest weight in the region, followed by the united states (9%, unchanged since last year), and venezuela (9%, compared with 11% in the last year). </seg>
<seg id="29"> The respondents in mexico and the vast majority of countries in central america, on the other hand, see the influential country in the us, but this role in the dominican republic and nicaragua of venezuela will be accepted. </seg>

<seg id="4"> Votes cast, ballot papers on several occasions in the rinnstein overcrowded ballot box and intimidation, destroyed polling stations were only a part of the problems. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Polling stations opened with hours late. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Many haitians, many of whom have been displaced by the earthquake in january, around off in search of a choice. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Nevertheless described edmond mulet, the head of the un mission in haiti, the election "than rather well in many respects." </seg>
<seg id="11"> According to a cautious statement by observers of the organisation of american states and the caribbean community "to make these irregularities, so they may be seriously, the process does not necessarily" invalid. </seg>

<seg id="18"> Because of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the victims of the earthquake was still living in tents, fear of a low turnout. </seg>
<seg id="19"> On the day of the election, many haitians prevented by a lack of organisation of the vote. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Shortly before wahlbeginn were approximately 250,000 laissez - passer on the election will be needed, not yet distributed. </seg>
<seg id="21"> There is a great deal at stake. </seg>

<seg id="2"> In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband, argentina 's president, cristina fernández, a wave of sympathy, the their ratings for 20 points to about 50% upwards. this is the highest value since your election in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, whether it on a re - election next year, depends on whether the is visibly mourning cristina fernández compromises than her deceased husband néstor kirchner, your predecessor and political partner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The omens are not clear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Néstor kirchner, even after the election his wife, drew the economic policy, often budgets, the tax revenues, economic growth and inflation not fully into account. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This allowed the präsidentenpaar, spend the extraeinnahmen as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On paper lost the fernández - government over the last year, the majority in congress. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is divided and kirchners death after a heart attack on 27 october has led to further divisions. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling peronisten, rallying around cristina fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But, after chaotic meetings (in which a parliamentarians another in the face, and other accused the government of bribes) the congress have not managed to adopt the budget for 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I am not going to discuss," the president. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The 2010 budget is now also true for the next year, thereby giving the president will have more opportunity to spend money as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy is hotly: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official inflation for such. in 11.1%, but many private estimates - wage and the trade unions - drive the value at almost 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner, in 2003 the took office, as argentina was battered by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction on its main objectives, and not the inflationssenkung. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He refused, bullying the private sector and the cooperation with the imf säuberte the national institute for statistics and census of the population indec which then the official inflation schönte. </seg>

<seg id="18"> It has the private sector and the trade union leaders called for talks. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And according to official statements, wage increases are limited to 18% next year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Argentina 's high world prices for agricultural products have a strong boost to the economy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the inflation undermined the spurt of growth through a great devaluation in the year 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Cristina fernández for this reason argentina economic may wants to return to the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="23"> At the beginning of this year, the government took an agreement with the former owner, the restructuring of the country had rejected in the year 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Now it seems fernández on an agreement with the other donors to push from the paris club, which it owes around $6.7 billion.. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The kirchners have had a review by the imf, as is customary elsewhere, always rejected. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But in the last month, the minister amado boudou aware that the fund, the creation of a new national consumer "technical support" will make. it looks as if this is the first step towards the cleansing of the indec. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not known whether fernández after the end of its term of office, even without the support by her husband will be politically active. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If so, it needs to get the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of kirchnerism. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the argentines return from their summer holiday in march, the wave of sympatie, which she has been shown to be, abgeebbt. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If you a further to win, it must decide whether they lift many political decisions quietly, her husband. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Although researchers discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, in your view, it is a sign that a life without the so far too regard as vital elements is possible. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="4"> "This body has two options." </seg>
<seg id="5"> "He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "The makes it a very particular reason, even though it is almost a sort of 'alien' way of life ', paul c. w. davies declared by the arizona state university and co - author of the report, on thursday in the online edition of the magazine science seems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> So far, there have been six main elements - carbon, hydrocarbons, nitrogen, regarded as a vital oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="8"> But as the scientists figured out, is growing the bacterium in california 's mono lake even further, even if it phosphorus replaced by arsenic. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study deals with microbes that have been found on the planet. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The announcement of a press conference, in which there is no details were given to the discovery of known, gave rise to widespread speculation on the internet, that the report of the discovery of aliens life could act. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "shows that with the help of other elements biochemical processes in other planetensystemen organisms can set in motion and that the 'standardelemente', which, in our opinion, are absolutely vital, not necessarily see have been laid down," declared charles cockell, professor at the planetary and space sciences research institute of the open university of milton keynes in the united kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockel was not part of the research teams. </seg>

<seg id="20"> "The toxicity of arsens is based above all on the fact that it is behaving chemically similar as phosphorus." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "By these organisms are finding it hard to distinguish, an element from the other." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "But the difference is so great, that acts as a phosphorus differently arsenic. it in our biochemisches system, where it covered almost everything," says anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers, the bacterium gfaj 1 a rising arsenkonzentration. it suited to and grew. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The microbe is in phosphorous better, but that they also can survive in arsenic shows that a arsenic - based way of life, of course, can occur, either on the earth, or on a different planet or moon, on the arsenic often. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> According to mrs foster, dozentin for microbiology jamie s. at the university of florida, is the idea that phosphorous can be replaced by arsenic, not new, but so far there were still no functioning example. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Half a dozen or so you tippten in the riots in the courtroom. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the minutentakt verschickten you on twitter their reports on grausige testimonies. </seg>
<seg id="4"> At the end, so the defence, there were more than 140 000 twitter - reports about the process in order to rape and beds gekettete children in a house that up in flames. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Pursued attention on thursday, the process of steven j. hayes, who was accused, killed three members of a family from cheshire, connecticut, to have a formal end to find, if the judgment on the death sentence, the jury, falls. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But mr. hayes lawyers have already tabled amendments in the court, explain the reasons for an appeal and the courts in years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> One of the provozierendsten reasons is that it by the intensive reporting on the process - and also by the extensive use of twitter by durchschnittsreporter - to a "zirkusatmosphäre" and such a widespread, immediate penetration rebel details, so that the jury came in an improper manner has been influenced by the public indignation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This objection could appelationsgerichte act, to deal with the question of whether the new technologies can be new rules are necessary in the courtroom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> 'As i have seen it during this process, i believe that it is a real danger, if the arrival of new technologies in the courtroom influenced each individual' s right to a fair trial, "said thomas ullman, mr j.. hayes main. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The presiding judge, jon c. blue by the supreme kammergericht, last week the applications by ruling short and concise back, when he said that the new media "would be carefully controlled ', and that there is no proof that the panel has been driven by passions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But this was certainly not the last word on this matter. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For decades gerichtseinsprüche have discovered that the reporting on famous cases raising doubts about the fairness of a process. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In his historic decision from 1966, the supreme court of the united states the judgment against sam sheppard, dr. a osteopaths cleveland have killed, his wife is lifted, and said in his decision, that because of the new media, it had been a "karnevalsatmosphäre in the courtroom." </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some people believe that the tv and the movie "based on the flight" in this crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some lawyers say, gerichtseinsprüche, what mr. hayes sentencing a half - century later, could follow the argument that the new rules are necessary, communication from the courtroom, at the time of the if dr sheppard were still inconceivable to rules. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "There is a good reason, on the impact of the new media in processes, which will be followed by a broad public," to be concerned, said john j. donohue iii, professor at stanford law school, the death penalty has studied in connecticut. according to his report, they arbitrarily imposed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor donohue said, some appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction out a prompt communication from the courtroom could make the processes fair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The 'twitter affair is only one of many, the lawyers of mr. hayes, in order to discuss for years and therefore delay a condemnation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defenders of claim, for instance, that mr. hayes already been cage could be, as judge blue had not allowed you to test the reactions of potential judges, by giving them during the jurorenauswahl grausige tatortfotos showed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some of the judges have said, photographs of the victims, jennifer hawke petit, 48 years, and their tüchter, hayley, 17 years, and michaela, 11 years, they have filled with horror. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defender say, they would also call into question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge mistakenly a juror have exchanged, a critic of the public prosecutor 's office was, and that he would have unacceptable pressure exerted on the judgment, as he had the unusual decision, the jury freely over the weekend. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The judges were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But their arguments on the influence of the detailed report on the process, perhaps the greatest interest in itself. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In a urteilsanfechtung, which you have tabled last month, it is clear that the case had dominated the news in connecticut and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the american senate has been discussed among the candidates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They argued that the new media continually the flames of the emotions rather than the case, would have rekindled. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "Such a day - to - day crush of medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," wrote the lawyers, "we have seen in new haven, and perhaps not even nationwide do." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Your emphasis on the reporting by twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In interviews some journalists, have said that the claim that these direct news are rabble than reports to be reimbursed for the slower, a technikfeindlicher view is, on the report on future processes verarme. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> But some of the lawyers said, appelationsgerichte would often faced with the argument, social and technical changes need of adaptation by the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr hayers lawyers reinforce this claim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In its action they were based on the decision of the supreme court of 1966, in the condemnation of dr. sheppard due to the reporting been lifted and made it clear that the new media require new rules. </seg>

<seg id="4"> The meeting between president obama on tuesday and leaders of the congress, no breakthrough in the major issues, with during the so - called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government, in which no more decisions be taken, had to employ. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After all, what we have heard, it was neither a polite debate between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode a partisan punktesammelns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public deficit of the president on wednesday meeting was also civilised, despite the political differences that exist between the members continue to exist. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems clear that, to be a close interaction over a period of months can create a mutual respect, the ideological divide, which continues to separating the members to make. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> This is hardly enough to claim that it is a new era of cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Both sides are now in a test phase - in the one of the other signs of the cooperation and compromise, while it tried to the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a renewed parteienkriegsführung. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Therefore, the meeting on tuesday were itself and its assessment by the participants of demands or accusations limited to a minimum. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between obama and the republicans are too large and too low, given that a rapid change in the atmosphere, which prevailed in the last two years, might expect. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Whether we are talking about taxes, donations, health and pension rights, the two sides are miles apart. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Last but not least, the novemberwahl washington has at least mild voted for a short time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "No question, the tone has changed," said pete wehner, an official representatives of the bush government, which now for the "ethics and public policy center" works. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "After elections this is inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elections again give partisan passions, the death. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And that is a good thing. " </seg>

<seg id="18"> In some issues, particularly in those that are on the agenda of the "lame duck session ', republicans and democrats have barely a choice, than to find a solution'. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Bush 's tax cuts, and no one is in favour of the end at the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way to some or all receive, whether it is temporarily or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="21"> A compromise on the increased unemployment is also to be expected, if only because the republicans cannot afford that it believes that the tax cuts for the rich, while they favored unemployed workers reject a support. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting on tuesday at the white house is increased, the optimism that in these issues during the "lame duck session 'some can ratify and, at the same time, the new start treaty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But william glaston the brookings insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent questions the lame duck session 'does not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation of the parties must, if the new 112 will convene. congress in january. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead, he says, is a phase of the nichtübereinstimmens likely, perhaps even essential. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "After the things that have to be done, which is done, will turn this short - term psychology in confrontation," he said. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="26"> Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - leads the courtesy of true cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "I see a lot of what is happening as an vorkampf by 2012, as of today, or shadow for the main of 2012," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons for this have a great deal to do with the presentation of new republican majority in the white house and everything to do with the teeparty - voters who were serve their education. </seg>
<seg id="29"> As the republican leaders also concerned may be that you vie too high, you know, that they must try to their promises, to reduce the expenditure of the government and the health - care reform to be repealed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> This party are already in the first reactions in relation to the recommendations of the deficit, which is a tax reform and the raising of certain taxes, as well as the increase in the retirement age and the lowering of public spending. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The deputy chairman alan simpson and erskine bowles have one of the most difficult jobs in washington and have, in accordance with their own assessment, so much insisted that the defizitfrage on the public agenda, that they can no longer be ignored. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the commission, in order to make their plan to official recommendation and they are fighting, in order to come even in the vicinity of this figure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The greatest resistance will take place in the elected representatives of the body, because in finance, today at least, is little room or little sympathy for compromises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Galston tells us two stages in the fight between the white house and the republicans in congress. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The first fight will take place in the form of parteizusammenstößen next year, when the republicans obama challenge in terms of the state budget, taxes and the health system, then followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will lead to this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> The public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It is a proven fact that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of americans are still hopes that the two parties work together. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If confrontation in a cul - de - sac, as has happened in 1995, then both sides must have a careful look at the public reaction. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Whoever is doomed to lose, will change the approach and the compromise must be sought. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> This may in fact be an optimistic view. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Partiality and polarisation today are greater than in the mid - 1990 's, and they seem a greater ideological divide between obama and the congress - at the time to be republicans than between president bill clinton and the republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> While at the same time, the activists of both parties of consistency 2010 as a mere prelude to a far greater 2012 election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Seen as may be borne the courtesy to flaunt the this week will be welcomed by many americans. </seg>
<seg id="45"> But it will require a great deal of more effort on both sides, to find a common denominator in the issues that the two separate still. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The red line zapatero and germany </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin has opted for the keeping of the euro, but at the same time drawn up conditions for the whole of the european union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tension in the markets have a dual response from the government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand, josé luis rodríguez zapatero has submitted new adaptation measures, starting with the tax reliefs for small - and micro - enterprises, and the regulation of temporary or the abolition of 426 euro support for the unemployed, which no unemployment benefit, relate to the privatisation of 49% of aena, the management of airports barajas and el prat and 30% of state lottery. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand supports the deputy head of government, elena salgado, with the help of the former prime minister felipe gonzález as responsible, chancellor angela merkel 's criticism of the current crisis herausbeschwört have. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How are these events to be interpreted? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is anticipated that merkel 's position is no fault of their public. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it is about a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is germany a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, the with maintaining the old traditions of one large parts of its partners. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In the light of the resistance in europe begins in germany spekuliern on three possible ways out of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first: a strong euro with germany, austria, the netherlands and in other countries, while the south have to leave the euro area. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The second: the reintroduction of the german mark - although it sounds currently more science fiction, supported by a majority of public opinion, approximately 50% of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The third: a transformation of the euro in accordance with german proposals. this means: more macro - economic control; rigorous financial management; penalise the countries, the targets; möglichereweise exceed the default a few countries, as well as the extension of the costs of potential adaptation to the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The german position is clear and has for some time been looming. that is why there is now no excuses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First of all, 2009, as both the imf and the european commission incentives for deficits created and the german government is a constitutional reform from the sleeves drew in order to prevent it from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> That was the first signs for the divergence between what germany was thought necessary (strict tax and stable public finances) and the practices of its european partners, including france. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second signal, which is a central european country, than to the rescue of greece painful hinausschob merkel the decision. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Criticised at the time this was very much, but the fact is that the political consensus in germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally, merkel in the last oktobertagen anew with an unambiguous position. it calls for a reform of the agreement which the european union, in order to save a country and at the same time allow the private lenders to commit itself, a part of the costs. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position was interpreted as anti - european, since they are the irlandkrise and all the following. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But your proposal, even if it is somewhat sweetened, was adopted in the next few months, we will be in the reform of the european union, which these measures should be able to participate from 2013. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has drawn up a red line, not to exceed the it does. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It says, all that - even if unpopular measures must be taken, it has now, as of that date will no longer be the old functioning of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="24"> 2013 will be the geburtsjahr of a new currency, are punished in the recalcitrant countries hard, insolvent, cannot be forced to explain and in this case the private sector must assume a part of the costs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth, with high savings and investment, moderation of consumption, improving the productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The other alternative, the debt and construction with enormous holes in the balance of payments is based, as it has been led by spain in boom times, simply will not be tolerated. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would do bad thing, it does not to understand. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not only a question of, the government deficit to 3% runterzufahren until the year 2013. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much harder. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the worst thing we could do so under these conditions, is ourselves to cheat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the current turbulence in more calm. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And that we examine the possibilities offered to us, will use until the spring in 2013. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that zapatero has understood this so well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large last saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) points out that, in spite of the criticism to merkel to create the hypothesis, put his own house in order in the forced their way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But the outcome red line by germany is there, and it does not seem to, that would be a change. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Among the options into account is that we leave the full gestopften euro with little serious countries should not, be ruled out. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In this case, germany still tell us that it could have warned us. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Sport and regelumgehung </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tricks as by alonso and ramos, on game against the ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to circumvent a sanction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The supposedly by two players of the real madrid (xabi alonso and sergio ramos) instigated exclusion in the game of 23 november against the ajax in the champions league led to much ink has been about the fact, whether it is a unsportliche act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by the uefa. </seg>
<seg id="4"> As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before match (playing their team had already been clearly won) time and several fouls, so the referee you showed the second yellow card. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way, and as the real madrid would cite his group, the two players will meet the prescribed sanction in the next ligaspiel against the auxerre and so without maps in the next spielphase. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Finally penalising the disziplinarkommitee uefa the coach of the clubs, josé mourinho, two games and the players involved with different sums of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often to be found in the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is so widespread that they form part of the ethos of the unwritten rules - is being followed, but in this game. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of the debate that have arisen is outlined the case to the fact that a team of the real madrid (the football club in its national anthem rotating and honour and on other occasions had chastised his players for similar incidents) are the major role, and to the drama by mourinho, of an episode its long history of more than theatralischer has added and provocative technicians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case, the debate about whether this does not explicitly banned by the statutes behaviour runs counter to the principles of sport, that is to say, whether these actions constitute a regelumgehung. indeed, this approach to the statutes of the sport, but whose sense seem to deal. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this matter should be examined the sporting damage caused. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sporting defends the physical integrity of antagonist that one aspect, which was not compromised by these acts, because it was not a aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the players at fault an unjustified also benefit from the gegenteam. it did not happen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradox of the action of the players of the real madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally under deceit or regelumgehung understand, because the circumvention of the rules of procedure has not been secretly, in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as striking as possible, so that the referee will be punished. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players waited and took the sanction relish. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is what kind of benefit the offending from the deliberate fouls went. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Here, it must be stressed that the rival has not been placed in a situation of disadvantage and benefits for erheischt played the game, because the obvious result of this action was that had to continue to its own team with less players. </seg>
<seg id="18"> There is also no useful strategy for the next game, because then the club does not have these players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It is clearly the advantage that the next spielphase the players of the champions league without cards, which could threaten their participation in a future game, begin. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a long - term, up to a certain extent uncertain advantage, because the team might eventually leave. also gives a sanction the players with this approach and, in the second kartenzyklus on, in which you because kartenanhäufung with a card less than in the first cycle. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is not clear whether it is really is an advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> At the end of the day, such practices are not directed against the sporting, belong to the strategic decisions also, of a to derive maximum benefit from the regulations. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case, the players wanted to deal not a sanction (which would actually be a clear case of regelumgehung), they wanted to vote before, when they undergo this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They took a strategic decision to avoid without a punishment or refuge before her. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Although blurs the border between inventiveness and regelumgebung is, i believe, that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because there are two selbstausschlüsse was, and regelübertragung because of the way the cause. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The damage that has been inflicted on the principles of sport through these actions, rather than ethical, is aesthetic nature. </seg>

<seg id="25"> "If you an invitation to tender power and there are only a few candidates, there is your prices soar." </seg>
<seg id="26"> "You have two options: either you " the people who find themselves in this mart and say you: it is a satisfactory agreement to negotiate a good price." </seg>
<seg id="27"> "The idea, however, that is not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the persons', laporte reiterated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> This consortium 'énergie gérance' treaty is part of a long list of approved treaties on more than 50,000 received from the parti québécois dollars. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The treaties have been either by the hydro - quebec or the sebj for the project eastmain - 1 - a - sarcelle - rupert approved. </seg>

<seg id="4"> On the other hand announces profound changes at international level, and there is a foretaste of the dominated by regression future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But we are in turn. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of wikileaks is the confirmation of the fact that each act (a x - drafted by a secret service any nation) composed purely from press cuttings. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary," american revelations about the sexual habits berlusconi are nothing more than the anyway, what you over several months to read any journal (except those whose owners berlusconi is), and the appalling karikaturierte profile gaddafi 's kabarettkünstlern already provided for a long time substance for their skits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule, in accordance with the secret dossiers only must consist of already known news is essential for the dynamism of the secret services, and not just in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> When they go in a library, which focuses esotherischen publications, you will realise that every plant (via the grail, the mystery of rennes - le chateau, the templer or the rosenkreuzler) repeatedly exactly what has been written in previous works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is not alone, therefore, that the author wishes to occult texts not publish research (still, therefore, that he does not know where to find news on the non - existing would be), but because those who devote itself to the okkultismus, to nothing other than the to believe what you already know, and confirmed what you have already learnt. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the erfolgsmechanismus dan brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> As well as the secret. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret services (otherwise he may be whatever, editor, for example in libération), the only regarded as true, what he recognises. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The top - secret information about mr berlusconi, the american embassy in rome had had sent staatsdezernat, were the same as those who newsweek had already published the week before. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> So why was such a fuss made about the revelation of this dossier? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On one side, this say what any educated person already know, and that the messages - at least since the end of the second world war and since then the government can take can mutually call or a plane, in order to meet the dinner - have lost their diplomatic role, and, with the exception of a few small representative in spionagezentren have turned. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Any spectators of ermittlungsfilmen knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that we pretend to be unaware of this fact. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Nevertheless,: the fact, to repeat it publicly, violates the task of hypocrisy and serve to integrate the american diplomacy to put in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In second place: the idea that an x - any hackers can tap into the geheimsten secrets of the most powerful country in the world, the considerable blow against the prestige of staatsdezernats. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Moreover, brings the scandal less victims than the 'executioner "in trouble. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we ourselves to in - depth nature of what has happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Formerly, orwell 's time, one could unite all power as a big brother, the controlled every gesture of his subjects. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwell 's prophecy would turn out to be absolutely right, since then, where we can monitor any movement thanks to the telephone, made any transaction, the hotel, visited the elected motorway and so on; the citizens would be in power at the total victims of the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="24"> If people are bearing in mind but, what expires today, that even the secret krypten power can no longer control of a hackers escape, so be listening to the kontrollgang directed at, unilaterally and will zirkelförmig. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker elected - - as a sent vindicator of the citizen, can bring the secrets of power in experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> But how can a power that is no longer in a position to maintain their own secrets? </seg>
<seg id="27"> , Mr simmel has already said, it is true that a real secret an empty secret (and is an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of berlusconi or merkel is in essence a secret free of geheimis, since it exposes the public sphere; but in the style of wikileaks intermediaries, that the secrets of hillary clinton empty secrets were, means deprive them of any power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Wikileaks but it has neither sarkozy nor merkel wronged, clinton and obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What will be the consequences of this affront, which has caused such a huge power? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the member states no more online information be reserved in the future - that would be a angeklebten posting in the street. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is equally obvious that it is with the current technologies in vain to hope to be able to keep confidential reports on telephone secret. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of state in a plane moving and has been in contact with one of his colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In future, how could private and only for certain ears certain relations be? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know very well that my forecast on science - fiction and romanhaft sounds at the moment, but i am forced to imagine the government, based on secret nature and active way to uncontrollable marschrouten moving, their communications anywhere else, than the mere memory with fundamental, and, in addition, the few written information, which you have, in the schuhabsatz verbergend. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information would be stored in single copy in closed drawers: basically, the spionageversuch by watergate success, less than wikileaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I have had the opportunity to write that the technology today as a cancer progresses, namely backwards. </seg>

<seg id="9"> But if we look into detail, things are a little more complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> According to the copenhagen, this money should be new and additional 'treaty', in order to ensure that an additional use has been tabled, without detriment to the detriment of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what the "new and additional" means. </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the eu commission had proposed a harmonisation, certain member states, including france, have blocked the procedure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today everyone elects the benchmark, he is considered best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> We see, for example, the eu commission has picked out a benchmark for those of 2009: the international funding are maintained, and it is within the framework of funding 'fast - start' 150 million over three years. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries have similar benchmarks, either in terms of year elected or concerning conditions at the level of public development aid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In return, france was of the opinion that the funding of "all new projects" of the year 2010 are "new and additional." </seg>
<seg id="17"> In other words, there is no reference in the spending of the previous year or at global level of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Specifically, the total amount of french support of developing countries remain stable (or are also decrease) - france, its commitment regarding the "new and additional funding. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is still no rule, and everyone chooses its rechenmodus. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, such as france, for example, is 1 borrowed €than equivalent with €1 donated. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Obviously, this is only difficult: the trouble is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loans for certain types of profitable investment (often linked to the emissionseindämmung projects can be justified, based on effect technology), it is deceptive, to present the euro, you donated as equivalent for a euro captured... only the costs of the loan for the kapitalgeberland should also be counted as commitment (i. e., the equivalent of an interest rate). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But france has nothing in a different sense than the following thought: it respects ,"" his commitment of eur 420 million by 91.5% loan (389,8 million euro) and 8.5% accorded) 36.1 million euro - see the eu document, in order to convince itself. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only country in the eu, that loans to a great extent. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany is calling for 46%, while denmark, the netherlands, or slovakia (among other things) pursuing their commitments to 100% of donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In other words, if the vast majority of the european union spends €1 to meet their commitments, france just 10 cents and understands including a comparable use. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Fine hokuspokus! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Everything in france operates in all its fast - start financing with a dual fraud: to part with a weiterentwicklkung action over the period of time and partly with the reality of financial commitment. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France to manage it, believe that it 420 million "new and additional" million has spent in accordance with its promise, and saves eur 36.1 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the treasury (as it seems well, that it was bercy carried out the arbitrage) could lead to a doubly negative impact; even eu internally (why the other member states with the donations continues, if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries does not completely misled... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> This chapter of the premature funding only a small question at relatively short time in comparison with the whole of discussions on the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it could be the straw too far in the immense machinery of the unfccc. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Let us hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As it always was, it is essential, its lesson to learn from this first year premature financing. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In first and foremost france could a change in its verbuchungsart for the 2011 and 2012, and in a spirit of respect for its commitments and the counterbalancing justice with the other countries of the european union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> But above all france could the discussions on the dispute the long - term financing, bring forward (another issue discussed, decisive and at the moment): you can escape the question of the verrechenbarkeit 'or the does not verbuchungsart its loans. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France to alter its position, that could also be progressive with regard to the disputes, as it is in other areas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The hope is therefore based on the new environment kosciusko - morizet, the next week will arrive in cancun. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A surprising announcement on france 's fast - start and his vision of the "verrechenbarkeit' as well as the use of loans would increase from nature, the international trust, which is necessary for further discussions. </seg>
