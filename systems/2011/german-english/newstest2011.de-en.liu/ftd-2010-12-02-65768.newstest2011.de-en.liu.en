Ogoniland is spent 
The water in rivers is ölbraun, it looks like petrol stations: Billion gallons of crude oil spills have destroyed the nature of the Nigerian Ogoniland. 
The people of theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking. 
Celestine Akpobari means well. 
"Didn't haunts' reassured the activist ecopoints journalists:" You'll still enough oil sludge before the lens. " 
The 37-year-old Nigerianer has the attempt, a until the breast in water watend boy with the Schliere abzulichten around it: In the water regenbogenfarbenen glamour, the scene almost pretty. 
Under the surface brown Rohölschwaden system, is not to see. 
In the past, they have gathered here Solonic bucket prawns, tells Esther Badom on the shores of Bodo flow Jetty. 
Now is the lazy running water entirely dead. 
Five years ago poured from a pipeline geborsten loads of crude oil in the vast wetlands area. 
Fishermen from the nearby city Bodo must now row to six hours in fish containing waters: The Ogoni Nigerdeltas located in the heart of the country is regarded as one of the worst reminding regions of the world. 
On the journey through the river realignments mangrove Sümpfe will run through the full extent of the devastation striking. 
Instead of light water wühlt the motor boat brown gruel, who appears his hand into the water, attracting case--had ölig fingers. 
The roots of the Mangrovenbäumchen inserted as sub-Saharam Lakritzstangen from the soil, sad face occasionally let their palms Wedel. 
Bird Schwärme, as usual, wetlands are meted out: Once the foreign Border, silence is spreading in the as a petrol station stinks former paradise eerie silence. 
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari sinister: "We live in constant danger for the health." 
The war comparison is appropriate. 
The area of settlement of the Ogoni PSZÁF up-for-grab democratic-related battlefield: Here, more than 60 years the first Explorateure from Europe, organized themselves here in the 1980s, with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, it had to stop its production Shell--which company in 1993, because it was for its oil worker too dangerous. 
Even today, the company is the return after Ogoniland denied: While across the delta region of triple the size of Switzerland, with over 5,000 Bohrquellen and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines daily more than two million barrels of black gold will be pumped, the oil fields in Ogoniland bare, the company is too unstable. 
Every few hundred metres inserted steel Gestell as bizarre sculptures from the water: " Christbäumchen mentioned the minds of many boreholes to zärtlich. 
They are up to 50 years old, most korrodiert until the mark. 
Always such a Bohrkopf breaking apart, says rinne Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil into the water. 
More than two billion litres are experts estimate that in 50 years into the ecosystem of the delta gone: Year after year the quantity of oil in the sinking of the super tanker Exxon Valdez " 21 years ago spill--some in Alaska -- became one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of humanity. 
Who for the ongoing ultimate environmental catastrophe is to blame, it will be fought. 
While the company Shell--which sabotage and organised theft of oil for more than 90% of the pollution, see environmentalists--adopted berstend Bohrkopf and quaint pipelines than Hauptverursacher. 
Shell in Nigeria, attach much lower safety standards than else in the world, accused the US scientist Richard Steiner, the group's 2008: The rate of defects in the pipes was "several times higher than elsewhere." 
In a place that from a distance as an abandoned, open-air workshop ölverschmiert looks, emerge from the Mangrove characters: They are ölverschmiert cluster naked and up to our necks. 
Under one of the many cellars, which partly with flasks, partly arbitrary dispersed spot on the site, a fire flackert: An illegal small refinery. 
In the pot the crude oil on the fire several hours of heated, says Michael, the head of the group. 
First stops petrol through the pipes in the fishing pot, spits later at the end of the pipeline kerosene and diesel. 
So produce Michael and four staff barrels a day to four diesel à 300 litres: "This is a" Naira 34,000 -- roughly $22. 
The delta residents use the chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Nigeria has only a single refinery. 
The with EURO-Cent barely 40 per litre ridiculously low price of diesel can non-lawful Kocher still undercut: Because their raw material they get in vain. 
He comes from "Bunkerern" that the pipeline network across Ogoni land tap: In this way, lost the country according to experts throughout the Niger Delta daily at least 16 million gallons of crude oil. 
Only a tiny part of the provisional intermediate raw material, however, will illegal refined: The lion's share of filling organised criminal networks, including politicians and senior military officers should belong in tankers and command him on the world market. 
The debate about whether the environmental disaster rather the effectiveness of the population or the lax method of production is due to the activist Akpobari for purely academic. 
"If the oil companies are not perceived as invaders and they would have the livelihood of the fishermen not so thoroughly destroyed, there was no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries." 
Now is the relationship of the Ogoni, above all, to Shell--which but so devastated that only a withdrawal of the corporation came into question: "Perhaps, other nationalities as the Chinese as better." 
As Michael nervous. 
"Past-time that their disappears," says the muskulös put. 
"Every minute of the soldiers." 
Will the illegal Ölveredler of the special of the armed forces, caught the threat of no arrest, but a painful bribes. 
The mainly from the Dual-Use Landesnorden soldiers want to benefit -- like all Nigerians -- from the raw material. 
"This damn toys, our country in every respect on the dog brought," says Akpobari.
