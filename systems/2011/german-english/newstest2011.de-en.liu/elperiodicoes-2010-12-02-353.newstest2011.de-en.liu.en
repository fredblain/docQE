Zapatero and the red line of Germany 
Berlin has argued for keeping the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the whole of the European Union. 
The tension on the markets have triggered a double response from the government. 
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation, starting with tax rebates for small and micro-entities, the regulation of work agencies or the lifting of the 426 euro support for the unemployed, which no unemployment benefit, referring to the privatisation of 49 per cent of AENA, the management of the Barajas airport and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery. 
On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel, which have herausbeschwört as the head of the current crisis. 
How are we to understand these events? 
It was anticipate that Merkel's position is no fault of their public work. 
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro. 
It adopted Germany a radically new perspective to shape our future, which is at odds with the maintenance of the ancient traditions of the bulk of its partners. 
In the face of resistance in Europe is beginning to be spekuliern in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis. 
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro area. 
The second: The reintroduction of the German mark - although this rather poverty-focussed science fiction sounds - supported by a large part of the public opinion, around 50% of the population. 
The third parties: A transformation of the euro under German proposals. This means: More macroeconomic control; strict financial management; punishment of countries that the cross premisses; möglichere Solonic the default of certain countries, and the extension of the cost of potential adjustments to the private sector. 
The German position is clear, and for some time. That is why there is now no excuses. 
First, in 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government is a constitutional reform from the English in order to prevent this from 2016. 
It was the first sign of the polarisation between what Germany was necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. 
The second sign, the Central European country than Merkel postponed the decision to the rescue of Greece painful. 
It was then that strong criticism, but the fact is that the political consensus were in Germany, the public and published opinion absolutely against a bailout of Greece. 
Finally, Merkel in the last October days again with a clear position. It calls for a reform of the European Union agreement to the rescue of a country and at the same time to allow the private lenders to implement a part of the cost. 
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as they embarked on the Irish crisis and all of the following. 
But its proposal, although slightly sweetened, was adopted. In the next few months, we will be in the reform of the European Union, which these measures from 2013 to participate. 
Germany has a red line, which it does not to exceed. 
It says everything that, even if now unpopular measures must be taken - will no longer be as of this date of the old workings of the euro. 
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency zone, in which the perpetrators against countries hard will be punished, this could be forced to declare itself insolvent must take and, in this case, the private sector a part of the cost. 
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances. 
The other alternative on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments based as it from Spain in boom times, is simply unacceptable. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would do poorly to understand it. 
It is not just a matter of runterzufahren the deficit by 2013 to three per cent. 
The demands are much tougher. 
And the worst thing we could do in these conditions, is to cheat ourselves. 
I hope that the current turbulence converted into more rest. 
And the opportunities that are available to us, will use until spring 2013. 
It seems that Zapatero has understood it that way, and his double announcement (which promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, in order to create their own house, their way. 
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not seem that would change that. 
Among the options considered is that we walked away with a few serious countries euro area, not exclude 
In this case, Germany could still have said that it had warned us.
