Pilsner soil funds - arrests of police in a public tender 
In the building of the soil fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police in the last few days arrests. 
It was paid the local media entrepreneur and real-estate dealer Lubos G. from the detectives in handcuffs. 
This had allegedly tried to a public competition which is taking place on the handling of Restitutionsanspruch to manipulate the competition to land offered a specific names. 
This is paid Lubos G. for half a million. 
"At this stage, I can only confirm that the police a person for the offence of fraudulent activity in a public competition followed," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner Prosecutor of the newspaper, Právo ', further details could not give them in relation to the ongoing investigations. 
24 hours later, was sacked the 46 year-old entrepreneur by the police. 
How he was able to manipulate public competition, that can only speculate in the face of the little official information. 
The spokesman for the soil fund Lubomír Cerná led to the question of homogeneity-even Právo, the police had in the antenna Pilsner of soil arrests and this fund actually made during a public competition. 
"It was a client and nothing to do with one of our staff," reality. 
The public competition was Mrs Cerná, the correct designation 'call for tender of claims on the transfer of land in accordance with the Bodengesetz "and would take place in cases in which several applicants bezeigen interest in the piece of land offered. 
"These people offer within the framework of the call a higher value of their by the transfer to begleichenden Restitutionsanspruch than the proclaimed land value." 
"According to the claims will be offered the order of potential buyers, then transferred to the ground fund the land on the person with the highest offer," said the spokesman for the fund. 
Lubos G. was obvious information available to those who are on the request, and because he himself had Siljanet person was justified, because he is a series of Restitutionsanspruch had bought, he offered a Grundstücksinteresse that he is withdrawing from the competition. 
Apparently against a fat compensation. 
It would also be an adequate explanation of why he was in his arrest such a large amount of money on themselves. 
Lubos G. was already in the past too good contacts on the ground Pilsner Fund. 
So he played in the issue of the former head of the soil fund Václav Sankota a role that prosecuted because he finalised in Ersatzrestitutionen land, which had already been passed location decisions on construction projects. 
At the time, acquired by the ground Lubos G. Fund, for example, land for the construction of public roads, more precisely, to the point where the construction of the entrance to the main route industrial area Borské pole was planned. 
He later exchanged this very favourable with the magistrate directly against a house in the historic centre of the city, which exceeded the value of the land. 
The City Hall then had to give small heavy heart, to threaten the construction project not by the blocking of the land.
