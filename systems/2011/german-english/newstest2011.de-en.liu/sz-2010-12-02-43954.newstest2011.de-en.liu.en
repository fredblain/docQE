Nothing like away here 
This evening is finally back right around for the Irish. 
No trace of Betrübnis. 
That dominates the home team of his guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States. 
The fans johlen before pleasure in krachend loud music, they scratch with their feet. 
The local pub one Sunday lunchtime Bailey in southern Ireland Cork, because the players table tennis balls on a three metre distance in beer mug -- and throw. 
" Bierpong is called the bizarre spectacle to win, there are 500 euro victory premium plus tickets to Las Vegas for the beer Pong World Cup in January. 
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this shrill drinking game and the guarded computer scientist, that does not really together. 
And yet the 26 years trying to divert themselves amused by the niggling question that the future will bring. 
On his plan is not game fun in Las Vegas, it will result in January bid talks in New Zealand. 
"I have a go pear-shaped feeling about this," he says. 
"It is so far away from home, and I have no work there." 
After all, his girlfriend waiting in Auckland of him --- "she had startled zuck their wish Eventmanagerin, perhaps a job as a good sign," says the young man and is smiling. 
Because of poor prospects at home have already sought two of their luck Tanners three siblings abroad. 
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London. 
The boys: As with the Tanners looks on the island in many families. 
100,000 Irish will be the country in next time, say experts from the economic and social research ESRI in Dublin. 
By 2015, they expect even with 200,000 emigrants. 
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, a heavy loss. 
Materialize the forecasts, there will be a wave of emigration comparable with that, under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s. 
After a decade of expansion for the Irish great prosperity, is now back into the broad. 
The economic crisis unsettled mainly well-educated young Irish, for which it was up to date, only. 
Job loss and social decline during the boom years seemed absurd. 
Any money was needed, there were in abundance. 
Meanwhile, however, are three in ten men and women under 30 without work. 
In the Irish Times abound reader letters young emigrants who complain: "Anything goes in Ireland cut out of the window." 
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers --- but who can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation." 
"The last thing will then ask the light." 
Law student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish student union, is a bleak future because the government was window dressing and offer more young people no future prospects. 
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they do not have a strategy, such as new jobs will be created," says the aged 20. 
They watched as their colleagues from an unpaid internship feel to the next. 
Your main concern, she says, was to have it, even in four years. 
"This idea is sad and depressing." 
It try to fill men like Stephen Mc Larnon the issue of positive. 
Mc Larnon organised the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a fair, which offers a Rundumservice on the subject of work abroad. 
"For people without professional experience is the work abroad but a great opportunity, which first steps on the career ladder," says the manager. 
On its website show photos in Australia and Snowboarder fields in Canada. 
The message is clear: Work abroad is no similarity Gale service, but also brings freedom and fun. 
Similarly, as it is to build something else knows Seán O 'Donovan for half a year. 
Because it for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland had nothing more to do, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on the building in Germany. 
In Gelsenkirchen take just a fashion house high. 
In January it goes after Hanover or Berlin, for the next project. 
His home, O 'Donovan now only rarely, because it makes special classes in order to take the credit for his house to pay back home. 
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says, when he comes after a long time for the first time on the eve of his home. 
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I am never more." 
He laughs at something and goes through ausgekühlt spaces. 
The small house is on a fine residential area with well-kept front yard, in the park entrance of large, expensive cars. 
Together with a sister has this O 'Donovan the House for four years for 380 000 euros -- bought 100%. 
"It was crazy times, there were just money without a lot of questions," he says. 
He is afraid that it could go wrong with the credit? 
O 'Donovan thought for a while, writ large hot tea, and says: "I have no children, which I must feed and I am young; even when things go wrong, I can start anew." 
The construction engineer may not regrets that he often heard at the moment. 
"Nobody needs to starve -- our situation is far less dramatic as in previous times here on the island," he says. 
"For a while to work abroad, this is not the worst thing that can happen -- perhaps we feel it first as Irish." 
He laughs at and then told of his father, who has gone in the last major economic crisis after England. 
"After seven years, he was back and living in Ireland went further, very simple." 
Cian Tanner like this idea. 
The future open and simple cats--or look to see how it is working with the life elsewhere. 
A couple of years of work in London, he is already behind it and why it should not run in New Zealand also good for him and his girlfriend? 
One thing, but it is still there, which it worries associated these days: The ceremony on his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin. 
He fears that it could result in a Lebewohl Party. 
"Just not too much emotion," says he and drink a great quality of his beer. 
"Goodbye, but it sounds scary." 
"We call it a path non-surfactant Party, very loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a couple of games."
