Durchgesickertes US document portrayed as a port of corruption Moscow 
The control of the city is in the hands of the " kleptocracy and they have a part of the bribes and protection money, which they einsammelt in the Kremlin. As reported in February, the American Embassy in Russia in a memo. 
Both police and the State blackmail high protection money to make their expensive standard of living in Moscow, so it is claimed. 
They collect money not only of legitimate business, but also by organised criminal gangs. 
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as "vertical of authority" - takes its part of the money that the head ends. 
The memo, which is under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was sent to Washington, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on its website. 
The memo edited were based on sources, whose names. 
It was written, while still Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov was, and it accuses him of corruption. 
He was in October by President Dmitry Medvedev fired, but there is little evidence that would have been cleared up in the meantime. 
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, a well-known construction company has, over the years have repeatedly rejected accusations of corruption, and he has won numerous libel actions against such allegations. 
In September, he declared a Russian television station, when he was asked after a documentary that suggests that he was corrupt: "It is crazy, it is filthy, it is dirty." 
A huge number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. Surveys have shown that. 
But it is unusual, as in the report of the ambassador, individuals are known, and it is unheard of that happening through a diplomat of a foreign country. 
"The direct link of the government of Moscow with the crime has meant that some of them as" upset "and to conclude that the government is more like a Kleptokrat acts as a government," the memo. 
"Criminal elements enjoy a" kryshna " (a concept from the world of criminals / the mafia, which literally means" roof "or protection), which is on the police, the State Security Service (FSB), the Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the public prosecutor's office, as well as covered by the whole of the Moscow government bureaucracy. 
Experts have discovered a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow. 
"Luzhkov is paramount." 
"The FSB, and the MVD Militsya are on the second stage." 
"Least follow the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors at the bottom." 
"This is an incompetent system, in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap, because the city is offering no help." 
The report goes on to say that the FSB money from the largest firms and cashed in which the police arrested small business people. 
A source, it means, "said that Moscow's business owner to understand that it is best protection from the MVD and FSB (and not by organised crime), because they are not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law." 
"This is why the protection by criminal gangs are no longer so ask how former." 
The memo noted that, while the collection of the money is comprehensive, protecting themselves very modest not; even those who pay, sometimes to be arrested. 
Those who do not pay, find their business very quickly close before - because of a pretext or another. 
Medvedev has spoken several times to fight corruption, but at the same time has said that he has made little progress. 
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who, with with suitcases full of money, which is likely to go in the Kremlin. 
"In its fight against corruption Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of When, a panel of Moscow, in a recent interview. 
"But he is part of the bureaucracy." 
"It is not part of the political class, because a political class in Russia no longer exist." 
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable. 
Nationwide, estimates by voting, costing the corruption Russia more than $300 billion per year. 
The country is ranked 154 a recent study on global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparence International (countries of "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt '). 
The disclosure of the American embassy Memos, which happened at night after Moscow time, with security displeasure within the Russian government, although, as Luzhkov for the mistakes of Moscow, it can be blamed for the Kremlin also could be a way to claim that we deal with the problems. 
In an interview with Larry King on CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks data transmission could be a fake and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats have called him BATman and Medvedev Robin. 
"The truth is that it is our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country," he said. 
"But to be honest, we would not have expected that this happened with such arrogance with such pressure and so unethical way, you know."
