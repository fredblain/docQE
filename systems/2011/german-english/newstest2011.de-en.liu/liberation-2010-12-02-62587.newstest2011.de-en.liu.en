Métro Grand Paris: First financial vignettes 
Since the debate about the modernisation of the transport economy on the Ile de France in full swing, it rains billion. 
At least in the discussions. 
Recall, in particular, the 23 billion for the metro Grand Paris in memory, which is being built by the Société du Grand Paris. 
For the construction of the start of the SGP MEPs, the state capital has called a $4 billion euros. 
In the theoretical scheme, this is the amount of money, which would allow the SGP MEPs then to give to the markets in a part of the Finanzsumme on her Zweifachen. 
Today, it has finally come to first projections. 
The addition of the 2010 budget, this morning by see the financial Commission of the National Assembly, contains the planned measures to secure the first part of that money. 
There are two ways: The creation of a special tax to Erschliessund and higher taxation of offices at the boredom de France. 
The former, one person's Article 15 of the draft law, "is in favour of public service station Société du Grand Paris." 
This is quantified: "The product of this tax amounts to EUR 117 million per year." 
Zweitere is a reorganization of the existing business taxation: "In order to modernise the resulting from their product and to increase this increase Société du Grand Paris to entrust." 
How much it would bring? 
A mystery. 
This sum is not quantified in the text. 
From the 4 billion is far away. 
"It states that the fiscal resources for the euro 4 billion of capital allocation added, which will be paid by the state and the Société du Grand Paris to the project to be done," according to the explanatory statement. 
In the SGP MEPs will take place this system is not offensive. 
"For the moment in which one recorded revenue (both of which taxes, that R.), can you explain the paper over three years and then cover first from the 4 billion of talent,." 
"This is noted in the budget and gradually withdraw." 
The SGP MEPs estimates that in 2013, which will be started to take note of 4 billion for the budget in 2014. 
This measure, whose 4 billion promised long will still be able to seek, runs the risk of causing a right-wing, parliamentary debate. 
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
