In the hunt for the WikiLeaks chief 
Obama appoints a highly responsible for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new revelations. 
Interpol has a red warning to prosecute and discover of Assange. 
Everything associated with WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, hydrocarbons, is a complicated maze, in which the matters only difficult. 
Yesterday Interpol a "red warning" to "locating and persecution" of Assange. 
However, it is not a traditional warrant for the arrest. 
In addition, it is not new, it comes from the 20 November. 
It also has nothing to do with the recent revelation of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the allegations of sexual abuse, which the Australians must face in Sweden. 
It also assured the lawyer of the founder of WikiLeaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they contact with Mr Assange to take." 
Already on 20, the international police authority with headquarters in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden ordering from, but they were given until yesterday after receiving the power by the Swedish authorities are not known. 
As is the case. The 188 Interpol-Länder depend, Assange to identify and access, "provisionally arrest and extradite him." 
Although Interpol the arrest of a warning of a red taxfree individual can order not many member countries, according to the Organization of the red warning as a licence for a Arrestierung - which of the national police must be carried out - especially if it on a bilateral extradition treaty, as is the case of Sweden and England is, presumably, where Assange. 
The action while simultaneously Assanges lawyers who gesten published a letter in which they informed that the 39 year-old founder of WikiLeaks is prepared to answer the questions by video conference of the Swedish authorities. 
They also recall that Assange the exit from Sweden and requested by the prosecutor, which with the sagenumwoben Lavrentiy Beria Pavlovich, security chief of Stalin, in comparison, received the permission. 
"It is a hunting, not as a legal persecution," will be charged in the letter. 
While the world is looking for him, and his mother of Australia from the presumption of her son, Assange has pledged to an unknown location, but not silent. 
On Monday he gave the head of the magazine Time via Skype from a vague place from an interview. In the conversation, he asked for the resignation of the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. 
"If it can be proved that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats, UN and spy on them against international agreement signed by the United States, it would have to resign," he said. 
His opinion was yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, condemned the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd." 
"I am not sure why we value on the opinion of a guy with a website should set," he told the station CNN. 
Obama himself has a high level of responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, with the new preventionary Anti-fraud Enthüllungen documents. 
The attempt by the spokesman for the Präsidenden Barack Obama, Assange little attention, announcing stands in contrast to the opinions, the conservative politicians and commentators in these days. 
The Congressman Peter King, from January chaired the national Sicherheitskommitee of the House of Representatives will lead, the State Department to investigate the possibility, WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "in order to seize and any money to support them, or a contribution to pursue." 
Tom Flanagan, adviser to the Canadian President Stephen Harper, was still further, and he had to his statement, Assange "murdered" revoked. 
"Obama would have to turn it into a target, and not a manned flight or so what use." 
Who is not apologized, was Mike Huckabee, baptistischer Minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate. 
"Whoever it always was, in which the government information leaked, he is guilty of treason and everything is no execution is too mild eiine penalty," he told the station Fox.
