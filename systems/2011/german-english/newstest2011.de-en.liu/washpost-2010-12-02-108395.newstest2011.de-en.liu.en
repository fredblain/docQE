Belarus is not agree to continue to accumulate weapons-grade uranium 
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to global security of nuclear material, the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it no longer will gather highly enriched uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons. 
The deal was in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the security summit announced. 
The US government had for years sought to convince Belarus, not more highly enriched uranium to collect and seemed to have achieved a hurdle last spring. 
But the US government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements with Bailers have been taken to remove about 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center. 
That paved the stage for the agreement on Wednesday, the rest of the material to be removed, according to an official employee who, because of the sensitivity of the issue remains anonymous, roughly £500. 
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear security summit of 47 nations' in April, which had to be excluded Bailers. 
And it was obvious good enough to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet republic of the next Summit in 2012. 
"I was really enthusiastic about the fact that they have a seat on the nuclear security summit (from 2012)." 
"It shows me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of Global Security Partnership, a group promoting nuclear safety. 
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" of Bailers. 
Obama promised to secure in Prague in April 2009, within four years of all vulnerable nuclear materials. 
Since then, the US government six countries, helped her highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus will be the seventh. 
A dozen countries did under the administration of George W. Bush. 
At the time of Obama's nuklearem Sicherheitsgipfel weissrussisch President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never give up its uranium. 
"How highly enriched uranium reserve - hundreds of kilos, which fundamentally weapons is capable of, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time. 
"This is our raw material... We will make this a dirty bombs and we will sell it to anybody." 
"We use it only for research purposes, that is all." 
Bailers neared a few months ago, however, the United States, as it indicate interest in the meeting of an agreement. 
The first round of the uranium of Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was easily irradiated, officials say. 
It was in a Spezialzug loaded with more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say officials. 
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the officials by plane. 
The US government pays for this effort $14 million, with a large part of the money in the Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which can be used not for nuclear weapons. 
"This was extremely cautious coordinated and to build up confidence" that the agreement, which was signed by President Clinton, led, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, which operates in the global risk reduction. 
The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende studies estimates that Bailers this year at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus, according to the joint agreement his camp until 2012. 
The relations between Belarus and the US have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights. 
But the statement on Wednesday suggests a possible rapprochement. 
"The progress of this global security issues welcome heissend, the United States of America and Bailers known, an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus, a central issue in the improvement in bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
