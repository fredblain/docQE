What divides us courtesy can link? 
After a campaign of negativity Schimpfwort and broke out this week little civility in Washington. 
It is the sign of a real Zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion, before returning to the fight again quickly of the parties in the capital city? 
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and Congressional leaders produced no breakthrough in the big issues that will be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government session, in which no decisions had to be taken, employing more. 
After all what we hear, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan ecopoint Sammelns. 
The public meeting of the deficit Commission President on Wednesday was equally civilised, despite the political differences between the members still exist. 
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months a mutual respect, which can cause the ideological divide, which remains the members, separating disguised. 
This is hardly enough to say that it was entered a new era of cooperation. 
Both sides are now in a test phase, in which one of the other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise, while calling itself is trying to measure the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a new party Kriegsführung. 
This was why the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants on a minimum requirements or accusations limited. 
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to be a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, could expect. 
Regardless of whether it is taxes, donations or health benefits, the two sides are miles apart. 
Finally voted the November election Washington, at least for a short time mild. 
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, which now for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center works. 
"It is inevitable after the elections. 
Elections give partisan passions that die again. 
And that is a good thing. " 
In a number of issues, particularly those that are on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. " 
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports it. 
Both sides want to find a way to receive some or all of them, whether it is temporary or permanent. 
It is also a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits to be expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that people think the favored tax cuts for the rich, while they are refusing to give an unemployed workers support. 
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House is the increased optimism that these issues during the "lame duck" session agreement can be ratified and at the same time the new START treaty. 
But William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent questions, the lame duck session "not necessarily to a lasting cooperation between the parties must lead if will convene the new 112. Congress in January. 
Instead, he says, is a phase of Nichtübereinstimmens more likely, perhaps even inevitable. 
"After the things that have to be done are done, this will turn Short-run psychology in confrontation," he said. 
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - that courtesy to true cooperation. 
"I see much of what is happening from today until 2012, when Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said. 
The reasons for this, many with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and to do with the Teeparty-Wählern, which were their education. 
How worried the Republican leaders also may be that they too high poker, they know that they need to seek their promises, government spending and reduce the health reform to be repealed. 
This party lines are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the deficit Commission, which has a tax reform and the raising of taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and that sinks of government spending. 
The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, so very pressed the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored. 
But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes with its plan to official recommendation and to make it very struggle to come only in the vicinity of this figure. 
The greatest resistance will take place in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters today at least, little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises. 
Galston says two stages of the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress. 
The first battle will be next year in the form of party Zusammenstössen place until Obama Republicans in the state budget, taxes and the health system challenge, then followed by a period larger-mesh zweiparteilicher cooperation. 
What will lead to this change? 
The public opinion. 
It is proved that, despite the current partisanship of the election, the majority of Americans are still hopes that the two parties are working together. 
If confrontation in a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties need to look carefully at the public reaction. 
Whoever the losers will be sentenced to change tack and have to find a compromise. 
In fact, it may be an optimistic view. 
Partisanship and polarization today are larger than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem a larger ideological divide between Obama and the Kongress-Republikanern than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. 
While at the same time, the activists of both parties in 2010 as a prelude to a much broader consequence of 2012 election. 
So it may be that the courtesy of this week will be welcomed by many Americans. 
But it will be on both sides much more effort, a common denominator in the issues that divide the two still.
