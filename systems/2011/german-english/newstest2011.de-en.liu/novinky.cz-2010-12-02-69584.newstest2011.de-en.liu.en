A longer finger as a ring finger means a lower risk of cancer 
The men, whose finger is long, as the ring finger, are developing cancer obviously a lower risk of prostate cancer. 
This is the surprising result of a study on Wednesday, which was published in the British Journal of Cancer. 
This is associated with the mirror of the male hormone testosterone. 
"Our results show that the relative length of fingers as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer and can serve this role-call in men until 60," said the study of Mitautorin Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick. 
The finger could help to determine what men are necessarily a Prostatakrebs test under the Sand, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health problems, added Mrs Eeles added. 
In the period of 1994-2009 they shared with their colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time, 3,000 healthy men. 
For more than half of the participants in the study was the finger of the right hand shorter than the ring finger. 
For these men were the same likelihood of prostate cancer, as for 19% of those men, whose ring and pointing fingers were in the same period. 
In men, whose finger longer than the ring finger was, however, that risk fell by 33% for men and 60 even 87 percent. 
The relationship of the length of the two fingers, which is already mentioned in the form of prenatal age, obviously reflects the different mirrors be administered by the child was exposed in the womb. 
Less testosterone is a longer finger. 
Earlier research found that the testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer. 
VÃ¡clav Paces, leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said that he did this study CTK fugitive known, but it seems the relationship between the finger length and the risk of cancer has not been completely for ".
