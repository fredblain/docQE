Czech children get drunk with beer and rum Fernet out -- it is simply too slow 
Fernet vodka, rum and, for once, a good whisky, which has stolen the father from the Hausbar. 
These are the drinks, after the Czech drunk teenagers under 15 most notbehandelt. 
No exception are children that their hangovers repeated in hospital from sleep. 
This is from the experience of doctors, which are faced with similar cases in the inclusion of children's departments of clinics. 
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion, because it is simply too long before you get." 
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Ludek Pelikán, the chief doctor of child department in the clinic mittelböhmisch Horovice. 
"Whisky, if it succeeds, the father of a bottle Hausbar to ours, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka. 
"Vodka has the advantage that it can mix with juice, then he looks not so strong," says the chief doctor. 
The spokesman for the Faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him right. 
"On most common concerns Fernet or rum." 
"This is the current alcohol trend, notably in primary schools." 
"It was also about slivovice, which we take from home," Mrs nominal-wage Jurinová. 
Chief doctor Pelikán, according to thirteen or four drinkers, was in the hospital admission long no exception. 
Before the clinic in Horovice, in which he works for this year, he was ten years in the department of paediatric hospital Motol, where the ambulances angetrunken pupils from Middle and Far deliver. 
"A girl had to be hospitalisiert four times." 
"Your career, it began with 12 years ago, when the first time with 3.5 per alcohol in the blood and even in combination with " Extase was hospitalized," described the doctor a particularly difficult case. 
"You was in the exhibition site in Holesovice on any dance party." 
"The interesting thing is that it was her mother not strange found that their daughter 48 hours not came home," surprised the chief doctor. 
It is the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance infringed malheur with their own offspring is regarded as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children. 
A real energy-dependence in the true sense of the word, it is not in children, according to experts. 
"Support alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomenon and to understand this is not the case in these children." 
Among those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol is mostly a negative family background anti-social characteristic, "says chief doctor Pelikán. 
The spokesman for the hospital Motol, according to Mrs Jurinová, have been locked up in the middle of November around 40 drunken children in the local department for children and young people medicine. 
However, only the cases with severe alcohol poisoning, a hospital stay was needed to go in the statistics. 
Drunken children who, in outpatient treatment of the parents or possibly from the police home, cannot be registered. 
In addition to the cases in which children just as a bottle of spirits in the school bank from drink, there is the opinion of Mr Pelikán three seasonal zeitliche Amplitude, on the 100% reliance is: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year. 
"That this for two reasons -- either from distress because of the bad certificate or pleasure at the holidays." 
"In the Walpurgisnacht, I have also been seven drunken children at once in the reception," stresses experienced doctor Pelikán. 
A drunken child, the night under medical supervision spends, paradoxically, is better off as a child, the next day only has to contend with a nasty hangover. 
The headaches on the morning after the Dehydration and the lack of glucose, one can be in the hospital with a flüssigkeitsspendenden Infusion with glucose and nutrients that lack the organism marketing. 
"You are clearly better off for after the 'beautiful' experience in the evening, raise them with good humour, without something somewhere hurts." 
"You are just a little confused about where they are," gives a doctorate Pelikán, recognising the patients at least sometimes this good humour rots by providing them with the cost, which they will cost the treatment. 
Because the transport with the rescue car and the night in an emergency bed come good and a few tens of thousands of kroner. 
"Bouncing back and again, this is what I have than education, if I used to direct the children in the visit, which meant their drunkenness has cost, and that it can happen that they cats--or the whole holiday must work on the money for a single such Fete", added to earn a doctorate Pelikán added. 
In his view, the impact of health insurance but not for redress procedures, which claim to cure the costs of trunken children's parents.
