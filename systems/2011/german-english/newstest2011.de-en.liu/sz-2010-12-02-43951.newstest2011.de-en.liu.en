Mysterious global work 
The Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria. 
The country stayeth but, to take a position -- nor can it controls. 
At about midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli B1s I fighter-planes a mysterious, würfelförmiges building in Syria. 
It is on the bank of the Euphrates; the next major city 30 miles away, is as Dair Saur. 
Your name is in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, which is supposed to Syria with help from North Korea in the Quader has built, hidden in a valley, which is being deprived of the electricity. 
According to a briefing of the US Auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA by the end of April 2008 would be the under the name of the near town el Kibar familiar reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium -- which could build nuclear weapons. 
For other purposes against the technology from the fifties. 
The CIA had a video presentation before with vague satellite imagery. 
They ignored by Computeranimation, where the components of the reactor before the destruction, which should have been a pared-down copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center. 
In addition, it presented photographs which show in the vicinity of the building, or even the interior space. 
The reactor was just before the operation, it would have been entered, but not yet with fuel rods. 
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more than it was then known, and indeed the mysteries were with the rather more time. 
The former US President George W. Bush has recently in his memoirs revealed that the CIA before the attack is fairly certain that Syria in el Kibar a reactor built, but little evidence that it was in the country, "an active nuclear weapons program." 
Some intelligence officers in Europe, there are still rather cautious and speak of a "alleged reactor," even if the CIA presentation for "plausible". 
They lack of hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. 
Asked how sure he was a reactor ahead, a high Mapsuta UN diplomat in the summer of only briefly, the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions." 
The rubble of the alleged "unused military building" created the Syrians may be in a hurry to one side and the terrain planieren thoroughly. 
But they held in June 2008, a IAEA team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el Kibar traces of uranium, which was made by people. 
In addition, the IAEA on a Member State commercial satellite imagery provider in the immediate aftermath of the attack, which could be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA. 
However, those recordings on the market, because the unknown client has bought -- perhaps Israel -- they exclusive. 
The IAEA can verify their authenticity not independent. 
Syria has always claimed that never a secret nuclear program operated or to have a reactor being built. 
The uranium hails from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus. 
But that indicated the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely. 
Since then refuses to Damascus to discuss the issue -- as well as on the satellite imagery. 
It also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el Kibar and access to the ruins of the only building. 
But also Israel zeren silent. 
"We will never comment on that," recently confirmed at the time of the attack President-in-Office of the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position. 
So dragging the investigation of the case since June 2008 inconclusive and "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority," as a senior Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna denies -- after all, it is a serious breach of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area, about watching the IAEA. 
As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA apparently three other institutions that "in functional link" with the alleged reactor should be -- still exist and differently than this. 
The inspectors have so far not disclosed what facilities are, or what role they have, or what they suspect. 
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they will be in the IAEA internal than Marj as Sultan, and in turn Masyaf Iskandariayah, derived from nearby towns. 
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS advises) has identified these places and satellite imagery on a building complex in Masyaf tracked down, in which it is one of the most likely suspect objects. 
It is probably in or directly next to a military base -- precisely with this argument, the IAEA Syria denied access to the three places. 
In Vienna, it says the Syrians feared a rather than fishing expedition -- that the IAEA from the United States will vorgeschickt auszuspähen military installations. 
Because the Nukleardetektive had become a bet on the institutions of the US intelligence services. 
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos that between the three places and the Quader on the Euphrates material was transported to and fro. 
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna, said that at least one of the plants could "in connection with the fuel production". 
But there is "no evidence of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are on the construction of nuclear weapons. 
The type of reactor will be operated with uranium, which is not enriched. 
But where the uranium would have to come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated, on this key questions, there are only plausible assumptions. 
It is unclear whether rubble, which valuable traces could cause, were stored in three places. 
As if the hundreds of lorry cargoes of the earth is gone, nobody wants to have information on where the rubble. 
The only a few kilometers from el Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates situated Salzmine al Tibni that Syria in 1998 on their suitability as a camp for radioactive waste has investigated, the IAEA as unlikely. 
The former IAEA-Inspektor Robert Kelley put it in a recent analysis of satellite imagery for the prestigious journal Jane's Intelligence Review associated with the reactor. 
Recordings from the orbit but show that Syria to the three suspected places global work and large containers removed after the IAEA has asked for access. 
That may be accidental, but hardly helped to dispel the suspicion. 
It also states in diplomatic circles, the IAEA have spent many months, a plan for inspections to develop Syria would allow any military secrets -- to maintain the burden alone shows how large the interest of the inspectors. 
Meanwhile, Damascus also iron this proposal. 
Western diplomats in Vienna had a year ago, placating the reactor was destroyed, therefore, the cause any high urgency, brings some US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a couple of months så Sonder-Inspektionen into the game, one of the strongest productsfalling the Vienna nuclear authority to impose controls. 
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, which would propose these inspections, has already been of "an option, for which I am open in the future," said, but he hesitates. 
There is a high risk in this way: It needs for a majority of the board of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented there are anything other than keen on an escalation. 
On the other hand, as a diplomat to bear in mind: "What if they find nothing in the end?"
