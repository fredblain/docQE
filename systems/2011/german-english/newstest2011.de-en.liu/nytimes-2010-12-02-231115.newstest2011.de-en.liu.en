High-tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance 
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect Videokonsole. Both games can open a huge hole in your gift budget. 
An iPad costs as much as five BMX-Rad for $99, while the price for a game Kinect about 10 classical Springseilen or around 48 cans are play. 
But you can protect your gift budget. 
Recently I visited on the search for three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, Toys' R US and BJ's Wholesale Club. 
I was immediately clear that Moore's law came into force. This year, the technology toys cost efficient and at the same time, a little less than last year. 
And although less new toys with its own website, will take place on the best-known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, a wider offer. 
There will always be more Knopfzellen powered toys on the market, and many of them contain wiederaufladbare Akkus. 
Here are a few recommendations. 
(If not otherwise indicated, are all prices of Toys' R US.) 
Sing a-ma jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are Plüschfigur, as large as guinea pig, who sing a note, if one puts pressure on her stomach. 
Even ­ is a note by successive pressure can play a song. 
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony. 
Respect: If you with the pressure even started, you can no longer stop. 
For a combination of Gesand and dance is the Dance star Mickey (Fisher Price $60 for children aged 2) the best choice. 
On the basis of the last year Elmo Live technology offers the doll animatronische Wechselspiele as Simon says' 'and, thanks to the novel Scharnierfüsse with wheel blocking they dominated the Moon Walk. 
Children who tested the machine, use Mickey as dance teacher. Your parents, however, complained about the lack of Lautstärke regulation. 
If you have a child of the 1980s, you surely remember to Alphie, one of the first computerized learning Spielzeuge. 
Now he is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for children from 3), with a whole bunch Fragekarten, with a car journey to a teaching moment, with a Besserwisser with Autokorrektur function as a teacher. 
If your child does not like to entrust your Smartphone, here are three independent alternatives. 
Mobi Go of VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and user friendly solution, equipped with a QWERTY keyboard. To contain the Games, however, are not as instructive as those on the Explorer eliminated Leapster ($70, for children from 3 to 12), the first major overhaul of the everyone-minus-one Leapfrogs Leapster number with a new, brighter screen is equipped. 
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes. 
IXL of Fisher Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) used for the Games and eBooks a system similar iTunes and, thanks to the SD Kartenlaufwerks can also be seen to it. 
Finally, there are still high Scrabble ($30 by Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no bigger than a Streichholzschachtel and have their own led screen. 
In the game, the blocks to words together, before the time is running out. It is great for an improvised book Staff beer competition. 
More and more toys have a kind of online link. 
If you are alone after the supply in the toy stores, and Club Penguin Webkinz are the most important. 
For your child, an online animal in Club Penguin, you can, for example, a Disney Club Penguin 2 "mix 'n match Figurenpaket ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code. 
If you see the code online eingeben, your child receives the club Penguin Store Credits enough for a further two parts. 
They can be rolling shoes or a Puffle Stofftier. 
The latest diesel Kopfzellen Mikroroboter, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children aged 5) is greater than the head of your toothbrushes. 
The Käfer moves quickly to 12 vibrierend Silikonbeinen in any direction. 
It makes fun to send him through a maze of blocks. 
And he does a lot. 
Our fell from the dinner table and even survived some time in the foot of our dog.
