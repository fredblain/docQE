Global plan to renew the lighting 
The UN has yesterday in Cancun, a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in terms of achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (CFCs) proposed, which almost a third of the additional reduction, which must be implemented in order to stabilise the global climate by 2020. 
This ambitious plan adopted its position in the step of concrete large-scale projects that the UN in Cancun, hopes to implement to compensate for the absence of compelling reduction commitments from developed countries. 
After yesterday's plan would put the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) because of the lighting on Earth CFC's cast be avoided if the weissgl端hend pears, which has a monopoly of 50 to 70% of the market, by fluoreszierend or, better still, by diodes (led) would be replaced. 
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. 
This is an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust emissions of the global fleet. 
In Copenhagen, last year the large gas emitters like the United States, China, Europe, and others, including Canada, voluntary reduction plans, which the global FCKW-Emission should downsized from 53 to 49 GT Gt. 
From this review, it would still 5 Gt withdraw from now until 2020 climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius to stabilise, in order to prevent this spiralling out of control. 
In the white gl端henden pears built 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the rest of the 5% to produce the light. 
With the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, with the new LED bulbs reduced in this energy demand double again. 
The compact fluorescent pear, on average, between 6,000 and 10,000 hours. 
The new LED bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips this week on the market -- that society has, by the way UNO-Studie -- have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white pear gl端hende, a suggestion of savings of Auswechselung plan, which is intended to be used in 100 countries. 
In addition to the fact that novel iese incandescent light bulbs, very little heat, they can work with a rule resistance. 
And they do not contain any mercury. 
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent pear reserves, because they contain mercury and that it must therefore as hazardous waste dump, which in developing countries is not always possible, except producers are an adoption unappointed available. 
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, not the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal-fired power plants that emit far more mercury in order to produce from the white gl端henden pears wasted electricity. 
In the United States alone meet this coal-fired power stations 25 000 tonnes of mercury annually. 
The report lays out in detail the profits that every country would generate thanks to this international programme. 
Indonesia would such a billion dollars annually in buying electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2 saved, that means would cost an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose edification Indonesia 2.5 billion.
