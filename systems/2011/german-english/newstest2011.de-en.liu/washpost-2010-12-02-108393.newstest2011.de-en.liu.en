Khmer Rouge veterans to confrontation with the past forced 
In a weak, betoniert class room with dirty and abbl채tternd walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School to the man who put him in the subsequent Europe--shared, Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok. 
"Everybody loves Ta Mok." 
"He was a good leader, and he has worked for its people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years. 
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the" Schlachter, remains the commander in this remote former Khmer Rouge Hochburg in north-west Cambodia's popular, where he hospitals and bridges built, the infrastructure has developed always live and where thousands of former soldiers. 
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrender to the government, will be challenged longtime supporters in Anlong Veng. 
In April allowed a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum for the victims of the public confrontation with the people who have supported once the regime. 
In June, the government issued a school book, which for the first time children tells the story of former soldiers of the Khmer Rouge. 
And in July, a community of the UN tribunal and Cambodia, for the first time, a former member of the Khmer Rouge, than the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, sentenced to 35 years in prison. 
With each of these developments, the anxiety among the Khmer Rouge veteran Alnlong Vengs, complicated their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration into society in Cambodia. 
"There are still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Youk Chhang, head of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime. 
"For them was the life under the Khmer Rouge glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." 
"It divides even families." 
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, review or hunger. 
As the Vietnamese invaded in 1979 and the Pol Pot Ied government, fled the remnants of the regime and its military on the border of Cambodia to Thailand. 
They spread here until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered, unrest. 
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary the guerrilla war from its base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, nominal-wage Ta Mok took the next generation in Anlong Veng. 
But in the mid 1990s, when a peace agreement promoted by the UN in 1993 to the first democratic elections in the country, began nominal-wage large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, the government 체berzulaufen belonging to the nominal-wage Kapitulationen of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Khieu Samphan Nuan Chea and 1998. 
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not yielded, was arrested in 1999 by government forces in the Dangrek Mountains. 
He died in 2006, waited prison in Phnom Penh, where he found on the process. 
As their benefactors they no longer shielded, fled the majority of former Khmer Rouge fighters in the grinding poverty of rural Cambodia and many maintained the movement in nostalgic memory. 
Even if a few elite of Khmer Rouge officials when their local government posts reserved, because they set down their guns, ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants. 
"These people have only a few of the surrender benefits," said Sok Leang by the Center for justice and reconciliation, the throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng, holds public forums. 
"They are anchored in the super-fantastic agricultural ideology of the regime." 
"They grew up without any professional knowledge." 
Sor Lim, 55, who is in 1974 as a teenager of Rhmer Rouge supported, fought in the jungle to Anlang Veng before he retired in 1998, in order to hold a life as a poor rice farmer. 
"The life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said. 
"TA Mok everyone has something to eat." 
"But now is the life difficult, because we have to worry about ourselves." 
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns. 
At the beginning of next year, the court to try to Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to court. 
The mission of the court, the old leaders, and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities to condemn, but it is not said whether it will follow on these four cases further action. 
It has done little to assuage the fears in Anlong Veng. 
Current media speculation, on In Chaem, 64 years focused during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s district leader in the province Manteay Meanchey. 
In 2007, it had representatives of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia told they have the construction of a dam Trapeang Thma chair, a project with thousands of forced labour probably died. 
On a hot night came In Chaem of the work in the fields to their wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng. 
As the sun long shadow on the desiccated grass raised to discuss In Chaem rejected it, about their past during the Khmer Rouge. 
The court should call them, so they would refuse to go, they said. 
"Cambodia live in peace and stability," they said. 
"There was no more persecution, this would be war." 
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who in 1878 of the Khmer Rouge has fled, also has repeatedly warned that the situation is uncertain, would be the court more suspects on trial, although experts and historians discuss this. 
"Cambodia must dig a hole and the past buried," he said. 
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Youk Chhang from the Documentation Centre. 
"Reconciliation with the Khmer-Zeiten it means of broken pieces," he said. 
"It is our duty to this broken parts to put together so that everyone can understand." 
The centre created the first government-licensed school book about the Khmer Rouge, the 75 seitige 'history of the Democratic Cambodia. " 
It issued the book in June in Anlong Veng appended to the history books for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge. 
How often in Cambodia know young people in Anlong Veng little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime. 
Touch Valeak, 19 years, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book students helps to understand an important part of its history. 
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought home with the book to read. 
"My family rejected many parts of the book and the court," he said. 
"They are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court." 
Such a resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang. 
But the public forums, the school books and the court to gain influence, "he said. 
Still, the Khmer Rouge is a powerful attraction. 
High in the mountains Dangrek leads one of Strauch 체berwucherter and with plastic waste verdreckter path to a black soot Rechteck, covered with a rusty tin roof. 
Pol Pot's body had been burned here after his death in 1998 with a Reifenhaufen. 
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a mobile phone Verk채uferin on the roadside, said that she does not know had been burned a lot about the man, here. 
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here to take him to pray," they said. 
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later in the day they wanted to Pol Pot's final resting place, where they will get a bush ripe bananas - in the hope that it will bring their luck.
