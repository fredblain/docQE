Hidden in the middle 
In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband told Argentina's President Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy that their Beliebtheitsrate by 20 points over 50%. This is the highest level since its election in 2007. 
Whether their next year, but this is a re-election, depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández further compromises than their deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner. 
The signs are not clear. 
Néstor Kirchner, even after the election of his wife drove the economic policy, often budgets, which took into account the tax revenues, the economic growth and inflation is not fully. 
This allowed it to spend the presidential couple, the extra revenues on his own. 
On paper, lost the Fernández government last year, the majority in Congress. 
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further divisions. 
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten, behind Cristina Fernández. 
But after chaotic part-sessions (in which a inter-Parliamentary another face, and other government accused of bribery) failed to pass the Congress, the budget for 2011. 
"I am not to debate," according to the President. 
The 2010 budget applies now for the next year, allowing the President has even greater opportunity to spend money on his own. 
The economy is hot: It is likely to grow this year by up to 9%. 
The official inflation z.Z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - are pushing the value of almost 30%. 
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina has been beset by economic crises, said growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not the reduction of inflation. 
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed him the private sector and purging the National Institute for statistics and census schönte Indec, which followed the official inflation statistics. 
Can Fernández now moderating a path? 
It has called on the private economy and the trade union leaders for talks. 
And, according to official statements are to be limited wage increases in the next year to 18%. 
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy. 
But the inflation undermined the growth spurt by a large devaluation in 2002. 
Perhaps would like to add Cristina Fernández for this reason Argentina financial-political economic back to the rest of the world. 
Earlier this year, the government has an agreement with shareholders holding the previous restructuring had rejected the country in 2001. 
Fernández now appears on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to push it owes about $6.7 billion. 
The Kirchners always had rejected a review by the IMF, as usual, elsewhere. 
But in the last month, the economy Minister Amado Boudou known that the fund in creating a new national consumer price index "technical support". It looks as if this is the first step for the depollution of the INDEC. 
It is not known whether Fernández will be after the end of their term even without the support of her husband politically active. 
If so, it needs to get the support of the middle class, most of which has enough of Kirchnerism. 
If the Argentines in March from their summer holidays, will return to the wave of Sympatie, which has been shown to be largely fizzled. 
If they want to win another election, it must decide whether they lift many political decisions her husband quietly.
