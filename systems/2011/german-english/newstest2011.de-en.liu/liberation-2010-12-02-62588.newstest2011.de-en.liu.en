The vengeful hacker and inspired spies. 
The WikiLeaks business has a dual significance. 
On one side, she is as obvious scandal, turning a scandal, which only a scandal in Sinner hypocrisy is governed by the Beziehunge between states, the public and the press. 
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level of, and is a foretaste of the future dominated by regression. 
But we are going in the right order. 
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that everyone is made up of a secret service produced Act (of any nation) exclusively from newspaper Ausschnitten. 
The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits Berlusconi's charge nothing more than what one for months in any case in any old Journal --Taiwan was to read (except those whose owner Berlusconi is), and the terrifying Gaddafi's profile karikaturierte Kabarettkünstlern already offered for a long time material for their sketch. 
The rule, after which the secret dossiers only from already known news must insist, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century. 
If you go into a library, which esotherischen publications, you will see that every station (on the grail, the mystery of Rennes le Chateau, or the Templer Rosenkreuzler) exakte repeats what was written already in previous works. 
This is not alone, therefore, that the author occult texts no research (still wants to publish, therefore, that he did not know where news about the failure to find Existierende), but because those who are the Okkultismus, nothing other than what they already know have already learnt and confirmed what they are. 
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown. 
As the secret files. 
The informant is bad, and grow moldy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise whatever he could, for example, editor in Libération), which is just as true recognises what he considers. 
The Top Secret information about Mr Berlusconi, who is the American Embassy in Rome had sent the Staatsdezernat, were the same as those who had already published Newsweek with the week. 
So why was made such a fuss about the revelations of these files? 
On one side is this what any educated person already knows, and that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the heads of government can call each other or a plane, in order to meet for dinner -- have lost their diplomatic role and have turned, with the exception of some small representativity tasks in espionage centres. 
Any viewer of investigation movies knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that we should act to ignore this. 
Still, the fact that it violates public to repeat the task of hypocrisy and serves to send the American diplomacy in a bad light. 
In second place: The idea that a business-as-usual hacker the secret mysteries of the world's most powerful country can tap, carries a major blow to the prestige of Staatsdezernats. 
In addition, the scandal less the victims as the "executioners' in trouble. 
But we have to pay the profound nature of what happened. 
Former to Orwell's time, it was all power as a pool of Big Brother, who controlled every gesture of his subjects. 
Orwell's prophecy since then have a completely right, where you can highlight any movement, thanks to the phone can check each transaction made, visited the hotel, the elected motorway and so on; the people would be the total victim of the eye of the power. 
But if we would result in mind, which expires today that even the secret Krypta of power is no longer the control of a Hackers escape, so, the control by unilateral target-orientated and to be suspended zirkelförmig. 
The power controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker -- as one of the avenger by citizen - can bring the secrets of power in experience. 
How can a power that is not in a position to maintain its own secrets? 
It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be unveiled); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's basically free from a secret Geheimis is, as it does the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty-worded secrets, means to deprive them of any power. 
WikiLeaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wronged, but against Clinton and Obama. 
What are the consequences of this injury to be inflicted on such an enormous power? 
It is obvious that the states in future reserved for any more information will be online -- that would amount to a on the street corner angeklebt form. 
But it is also clear that with the current technologies in vain is to be hoped, confidential reports on telephone secret. 
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of state in a plane fortbewegt has contacted and one of his colleagues. 
How could be operated in future private and only for some ears certain relations? 
I know very well that my prediction at the moment for science fiction and romanhaft sounds, but I feel compelled to give me the present government agents in secret way inspired in uncontrollable Marschroute moving, its communications than anywhere else in the mere memory with leading, and beyond the few written information they received in the footwear (masked. 
The information would only copy in closed drawers stored: Basically had the espionage attempt by Watergate little success, as WikiLeaks. 
I had the opportunity to write that the technology today as a cancer progresses, namely backwards. 
A century after the wireless telecommunications Count had revolutionized communications, reconstructed the Internet with a Telegrafen (telephone) wire. 
The (analogue) video had the film scientists enables a film band for gang auszukundschaften by from behind forward spulen and all the secrets of Monday could drop, while the (numerical) CDs nothing other than today, from chapter to chapter to jump in Makroportionen. 
With the high-speed trains, we have been travelling within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this requires by plane, including of switching three-and-a-half hours. 
It is therefore not exceptional that policy and communications technology on car and horse. 
A final observation. 
In earlier times tried to understand what the press for secrets were forged between the messages. 
Currently there are the messages that confidential information demand of the press.
