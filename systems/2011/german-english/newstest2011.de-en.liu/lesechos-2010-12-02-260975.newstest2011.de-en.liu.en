The Berlusconi government is for cover in Italy. 
After a weekly start worrying for Italy has relaxed the situation yesterday with the decline of the Eckzinsen over 10 years. 
A return to the elusive silence. 
At the end of the meeting with the economy minister had the region chairmen Giulio Tremonti, the situation as' 'and unentzifferbar qualify him with a' 'unvorhersagbaren weekend expect to hear what the person was denied by immediately, however. 
On Tuesday, at any rate, would have the gap with the German interest rates his record of 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy raised per-kilometre on 263 points, what a certain Kopflosigkeit in Rome. 
Silvio Berlusconi had in his Council of Ministers pointed out that the discrepancy lies in Spain to the German interest rates by 400 basis points. 
His right hand, Gianni, but then had a "serious concern" from the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of infection from Ireland. 
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, not as Greece or Ireland." 
"The bad news is that, like Portugal, Italy," says Irwin Stelzer, Public host at the Hudson Institute. 
In other words, his problem is the Absenz of economic growth and the attendant, schwinds√ºchtig tax receipts, which the state in danger, it can no longer cover financing needs. 
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government. 
Future will be an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and by 1.4% in 2012... although the expected in the Senate is estimated to examine this budget with 1.3% and 2%. 
Under these conditions, as calculated the EU Commission, the budget deficit in the next year or 4.3% of GDP (contrary to the predicted by the governments of 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%). 
Hence the turmoil for a new budget collective that after the holidays could be used to a $7 billion euros. 
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn. 
On the hour Italy receives the support of international institutions. 
"The very foundations of Italy's economy is in order and his accounts are regulated, we have to do it again for a long time," assured Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, which at the IMF is entrusted with Italy. 
"In the moment, there are no problems, either in the short term, even in the long term, because of Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, or A. R.) lower than Stabilisationsfortschritte demanded by other countries," observed Pier Carlo, head of the farmer Padoan population of the OECD. 
The question remains after the political Unstetigkeit. 
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi is a censure motion of the Chamber of Deputies, face as a result of which the preferred elections could be organised at the end of March. 
It is therefore a less favourable term for a decision on a serious crisis before.
