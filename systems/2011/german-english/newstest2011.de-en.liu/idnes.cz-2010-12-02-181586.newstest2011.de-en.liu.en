More and more parents want to human Überwachungsgeräte, in order to have kids alone under control 
The fear for their children grow up and so consider more parents to monitor them via GPS. 
The system, which was originally to searching for cars was invented, can be as good people who travel in such cases would be helpful, as recently on the trail of disappearance of the nine-year Anicka Janatková. 
The device is currently about as large as a packet of cigarettes but soon it should not be greater than a wristwatch. 
Many people, the case of the missing Anicka in fear and so do to protect them after resources and at ways, their children better. 
For the price of a deterioration of their privacy. 
"We are trying to say that it is by no means Herumspionieren, but an effective means to lessen the likelihood that it is the tragedy," leads Petr from society Pilin Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market. 
"I admit that it is in the case of the abuse of such devices, for example, if anyone in the pocket, without knowing it, but we have had no such case." 
"Most customers buy it really for security reasons," adds Pilin added. 
His view is that the child but always know what the purpose of the "box" is and how they used in emergencies. 
The child psychologist Dana Bocková notes, however, that a child, if there is such a thing may not bear, let it be easy. 
"Even very small children show great creativity, when it comes to certain things deliberately to lose if they do not want to be controlled." 
"Closed the mobile phones initially checked with the parents of great expectations, but they can be just as easy to shut down, as this new monitoring equipment," says Ms Bocková. 
Your opinion is also controversial, whether such a body helps in the event of an attack. 
"In the planned kidnappings controlled the Kidnapper virtually always whether the child in any electronics, with which it could be located." 
"Today is the mobile phone." 
"If such monitoring equipment found wider use, they would seek this, too, because their sale sicher were accompanied by massive advertising." 
"In these cases are the criminals of the police one step ahead," says psychologist. 
It acknowledges that similar devices can be in a sudden attack by a paedophile extremely helpful. 
Roberta Cech from society RC monitoring, according to the tracking services for both cars, and people can offer the existence of such a device would help, if it is being destroyed immediately after the attack. 
"The device that can ensure that each position in certain intervals reports." 
"Although it immediately to be destroyed, at least, is the last position of the person involved." 
"In expensive equipment is even a Neigungsmesser integrated, that is, if you hinfällt and movement of charge breaks down, the device sends a warning immediately under indication of the position," claims Mr Cech. 
In his opinion, similar services could also intelligent mobile phones with radionavigation, one need only a specific einzuspielen software. 
The problem of the current positioning equipment is that it is either for appliances in size Streichholzschachtel that resemble supporters or smaller mobile phones. 
There is always the risk that you lose them. 
Mr Pilin Macro tests by the Weil, therefore, one in the present devices, which look like normal Digitaluhr. 
"That has the advantage that the attacker may not even realise that it is a monitoring or location device. 
"He realises that Oder only after some time, the police are a time lead," he adds. 
Regardless of the direction in which the development -- to arm bands or supporters, is always the same technology used, such as the vehicle positioning. 
The combination of positioning function through the GPS system (just as the situation in the car Navi) and the function of a mobile phone, which reports the current position.
