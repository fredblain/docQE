Second mandate: The Offenkundigkeit 
De Gaulle was really truncated. 
Mitterrand had to believe that he stutze. 
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac was not the slightest hesitation. 
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that. 
A mandate in the Elysée calls on the next. 
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012. 
But the Offenkundigkeit is the side of the mystery of the presidential function connotation, not good to face. 
We must therefore pretend that the doubt was henceforth. 
In a sense, as in the other. 
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac, a third mandate is not excluded, without even to believe in it. 
On 15 November assured to take Nicolas Sarkozy in serious tone, his decision "sometime in the fall of 2011." 
He on Tuesday evening in the Elysée before the UMP Parlamentariern the prospect of "two credentials" suggested, widespread, then, a few Fieberhaftigkeit. 
It was the official announcement of his candidacy? 
Far from it. 
The president could simply remind you that the constitutional obstacle of 2008, the number of five-year terms to just two. 
He made a statement that no announcement. 
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone. 
"You are still at worst seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009. 
On a new in May 2010: "Does not believe that I am not on the stage after nachdenke." 
His words of yesteryear not make it more as candidate than the previous day; but no less. 
They should cause comments, then from a double reason. 
The acceleration of the Wettlaufes candidacy with the PS on one side. 
But it is not the inclusion of the competition with Ségolène Royal, Nicolas Sarkozy, so desperate to reveal themselves. 
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidate in 2012, which many members of the early, admonishing the PS as an approved to challenge. 
The bad polls on the other side. 
For the first time the voters would the rights of a candidacy of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to a survey of the BVA 'Express) prefer. 
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP," responded immediately and cautious in the context of the Prime Minister. 
"If he was a defeat as possible, he would be no candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin shares with. 
"He will always believe to be able to win," corrected Alain Juppé, who has resigned with the Offenkundigkeit.
