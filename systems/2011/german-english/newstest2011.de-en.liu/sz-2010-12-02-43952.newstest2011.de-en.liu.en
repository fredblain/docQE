Love in times of war 
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer with the work on their still nameless stage debut has begun, there is anger. 
The script, she has written a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man. 
We know much more about not --- but even that is enough for unrest. 
Irreformably, the rumor that woman, a Muslim, Verliebe during the Yugoslavia war in their Serbian rapist. 
Bosnian women's bodies have been moved immediately protested in Sarajevo, and some planned Drehtag short-term after Hungary. 
Meanwhile, the film in Hungary and drying up in the post production, but it is still protested in Bosnia. 
Bakira Hasecic of the organisation of female victims of war wrote about the Office of aid-providing Sidmar UNHCR of Jolie and asked for a meeting with the actress, has a Bosnian newspaper reported now -- Jolie's ambassador to the United Nations Refugee Works Agency. 
Diplomatic, it is not -- it has the women from weeks before a meeting in Hungary, which offered Onbam but rejected. 
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, Hasecic. 
Love stories in Vergewaltigungscamps have not given, and Jolie attitude towards the victims betrays her enough about the script. 
Your organisation has recommended, according to the United Nations Refugee Relief, Jolie as ambassador to dismiss, The Guardian reported. 
But what, exactly, has written Jolie for scenes? 
The Bosnian culture ministry, which their script got to read, after some to-ing and fro-ing a hub of approval for Sarajevo granted -- it is not was not entirely clear why Jolie anyway. 
The young author even claimed that they have no political intentions with its film, with a lot of effort into the Yugoslavia conflict incorporated into the terrible consequences of war show and give all parties involved a voice. 
The content, however, remains vague. 
As a second Synopsis circulating on the film on the network, which then quite different sounds: The lovers forest-sector knew even before war broke out and meet again, as they, a Bosnian Muslim, abducted in a Serbian camp, where he works as a guard. 
What is considerably different sounds as the variant 'rape in verknallt Folterknecht. " 
That Jolie film actually even before the war begins -- that much is safe. 
The pressure on them, so Jolie, was "unfair and is based on misinformation." 
Now they can only be nor the hackers of Hollywood peace map: By putting the script, like so many before, illegal into the network.
