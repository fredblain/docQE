The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads in a forest in Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen his stone empire built. 
The 44 years, with old stones. 
He has bought in the demolition free in Stuttgart. 
"It would be a shame, they would Schotter gemahlen or in the landfill disappear," he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen, which was once a Wachhäuschen. 
And we have threatened him, as he tells in September in the newspapers was that he had bought the remains of the North Flügels from Abbruchunternehmer. 
But he has talked with the S-21-Gegnern days. 
And he has declared that he could yet nothing for the demolition. 
And if it is, so be it but the wisest thing would be reused if the stones. 
About 200 S-21-Gegner subsequently took an average of 80 kilos major-accident Quader with, piece of price 6.50 until 14 euros. 
As some memory, but also in the hope of him on a reconstruction to give back.

It shows on a bunch of: Red limestone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station. 
And further. 
"Beautiful Travertin."

Across the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the police headquarters in Stuttgart, rötlich granite from the cathedral, St. Blasien, Heilbronner Tuff from the hospital. 
The work of the effort to bring the sweat. 
If Rongen consider how the stones used by hand and fool with simple bottle trains and Ochsenkarre were moved, it will be very reverential. 
"It would be a scandal if something we move away from shredding." 
Empire, he is not become immensely rich, certainly not. 
But 14 people employed the stone dealer today, moreover, the top of the forest Steinmetz, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a farmer Glasbläser and a garden established.
