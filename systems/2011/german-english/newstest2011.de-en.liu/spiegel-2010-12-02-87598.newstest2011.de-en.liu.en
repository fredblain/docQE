To hell, warrior! 
Splatter fits the art cinema? 
The director Nicolas Refn winding lotet with his fighter epic poem "Valhalla over Rising" old Genre-Grenze new. 
The audience may be the Danish director Nicolas Refn winding have thought, as he has spun Valhalla over Rising "? 
A warrior Wikinger caught with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) rid itself of its tormentors and places with almost superhuman powers piles of his opponents in order -- sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody Action, precisely because our hero like surefire killing methods are used and his enemies to Gedärm from the alive, if he has a bad mood. 
On the other hand, says Einauge, as he is known, in fact, the entire film about a word, and the other characters make a maximum of cats--or to one or two sentences or a few painful Todesschrei. 
Otherwise silent and in the hill gruselig beautiful landscape of Scotland, which the world geschwelgt Wikinger offers from around a thousand years of the scene. 
Ideal for adult Cineasten with interest for Existentialismus and very calm cameraman journeys. 
Well, if a film several target groups, it is a shame if they are mutually exclusive. 
Director winding Refn, since his wild and gestylt Drogendealer Pusher trilogy " as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but refuses stoically, his works with a little more mainstream humour, or a little less brutality the Arthouse accessible. 
Most likely Kunstkino-Freunde feel let down by the round spritzend brain mass and the Gedärm. 
The Action-Fans no die from boredom if Einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons with a bunch of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and breaks an eternity in the doldrums and fog is trapped, before the team appears to be in America is quiet on and there. 
No wonder, then, that "Valhalla over Rising" in Germany has found no cinema lending is published and now only on DVD. 
This is particularly because of the magnificent images of a shame, but also because it behind the façade bluttriefend pretexts until a sometimes exciting piece of cinema hidden, one that deserves some attention. 
In this film is not about dialogues or a stringent act, it is all atmosphere, a film gewordener fever dream. 
And there is no escape for the viewer. 
Refn takes him barely a moment of detente and undertakes him with his icy images and the dark alterations drift Soundtrack very slowly the throat, but above all with the incredible hatred, which runs from the hearts of the characters. 
Only a small blond boy Einauge loyal to the side, retains something like innocence, everyone else is driven by the anger. 
The vast majority of the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but for enemies and temporary allies at some point to the warrior from hell, perhaps the ambassador of the devil himself. 
It means destruction, perhaps, but only for the Verdorbenen anyway. 
"Valhalla over Rising" is a mysterious film, which they hate and can admire the aggravation, excited and amazed. 
An experience.
