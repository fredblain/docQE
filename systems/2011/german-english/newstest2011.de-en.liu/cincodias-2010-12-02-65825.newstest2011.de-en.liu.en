The product Red Bull triumphs in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens 
The cars are being improved with a software in real time. 
Since 2004, the product Red Bull in the world of Formula 1 racing to infiltrate its history in this distinguished universe of the speed of surprises and successes. 
Initially, the newcomer nobody paid attention and despite his background rising sharply during the last Saisons continued in the final sprint last November, all on the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso. 
Without the skills of the German pilot and world Sebastian Vettel up or the performance of the strength of the engine of Renault to lower want is the "secret weapon" that the corporation Siemens in the hands of the product Red Bull, and thus a winning team created, has become a legend. 
In reality is a powerful software to simulate processes, which the German company 2007 purposes, which did not have to do with Autorennen on the market. 
This term as PLM technology programme was for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and precise instruments are used. 
The goal is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it really is built, in order to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs. 
PLM, the development of the cameras of Canon, which aircraft relieved by Sukhoi and the most famous commercial vehicles from Nissan. 
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial unit of Siemens, said that with the use of this software in Formula 1 - the product Red Bull factory "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes and improvements in the race and the tests, design and can carry out. 
Soot worm contends that racing houses in 1992 in the average ten technicians, who worked in a season were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements. 
In Red Bulls team are now 180 highly qualified young people employed. With highcapacity computer system they lead analyses and all possible changes to the racing car. 
The Siemens manager said that the PLM software is capable of all elements of the racing cars of the product Red Bull to analyse and to improve, with the exception of the engine, which explains Renault exclusively responsible. 
The materials, fuel, the Aero dynamics and Sicherheitselemente be changed. 
The changes, thanks to advanced production facilities and Hightech-Autoklaven in less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of the simulator in the reality. 
The only border, which is set this crazy technical perfect, $40 million, which may be a formula 1 - a 'race for his team in a season. 
The product Red Bull has its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of his racing cars in a 50 kilometres away from London ground. 
There are two buildings in which are fenced visits, particularly from journalists - strong. 
Everything that happens is Top Secret. 
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber. 
But Red Bulls true formula 1 - no doubt hero is the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell. 
Behind the enormous technological resources, which the Energy drink manufacturer in the services of his participation in the race tracks, hide is further protagonists, whose support invaluable and whose fame nil. 
The technological leader of the station, Steve Nevey, stressed that one in five years ago still could say that the progress in R & D for racing cars with 50% have helped the pilots and were responsible for the rest. 
Today, the share values changed. The technology is 85% of success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated at 15%. 
Nevey recognizes that Vettel and Webber never-fulfilled can be replaced by computer, because they are not "voraussagbare gladiators."
