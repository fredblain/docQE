2018-2022: The FIFA World Cup names the host country 
In a frenzy on corruption suspicions names the FIFA's executive committee on Thursday the host countries of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a highly political election, in which the Rangeln threaten to push for influence, as well as the lobbying the technical criteria in the background. 
One thing is certain: The 2018 edition of the King discipline of the FIFA is in Europe, their traditional stronghold, held (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands). 
The edition 2022 will then be somewhat exotic; the International Football Association hopes, after the premiere on the African continent in 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) for themselves to win, or its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to follow. 
The list of people who belong to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) is the degree of economic and political use of the World Cup. 
The machinations behind the scenes are threatening to hold until the last minute. 
Difficult otherwise, a hierarchy of candidates. 
Following the evaluation report by FIFA, offer the English, Spanish, Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts besseren arguments than those of its competitors. 
But these considerations will be of the 22 members of the era of the election Exekutifkommitees not so important. 
The Sunday Times, which in reaching the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii) at the start of the revelations, would have been equally good opportunities for their own country, cradle of football, can ruin that only one time the world championship was allowed to wear, namely in 1966. 
The BBC had the breedingground again on Monday, giving it a own broadcast, which had three influential members of the Kommitees, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under fire. 
Reason enough to upset the FIFA and the English leaders in embarrassment, which primarily had operated with David Cameron in the last few weeks, an intensive lobbying. 
The head of government hopes for a new edition of his predecessor, Tony Blair EU-OPS Schachzug, which had achieved a year in 2005 for the organization of the London Olympics in 2012. 
This intensive use would be enough to shore up the image of England before the Kommitee? 
Nothing is less safe, because the duo Spain, Portugal, there is no shortage of assets, with its already finished stadiums, his expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, the Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture. 
But the economic and financial downsides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions. 
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal, the chances of Russia, which, despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) on the weighty Outsider is rising. 
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to take the suggestion in the English press Bezichtigung of "an unfair competition in the run-up to the vote" on the part of the Kommitee denounced members. 
"One bewirft them with dirt, you try to compromise," Putin lashed out. 
For 2022 seem to be the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, the logical favorites. 
First economic world power, seat of the FIFA major sponsors, the country seems a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set separate a very nice project. 
But this new nominations seem premature for two countries, which the competitions co-organised kûdoka in 2002. 
Another threat: The FIFA long-awaited approval of the World Cup 2026 for China, which will allow the Asian opportunities to 2022 lapses. 
With Australia and Qatar, with the appearance futuristic stadiums, all had followed the FIFA its expansion into new areas, but these two countries a greater risk because certainty. 
Australia might as well as Japan and South Korea under the of the European countries akquittierten weakness of television rights (because of the time shift), the delicate sensitivities of the FIFA.
