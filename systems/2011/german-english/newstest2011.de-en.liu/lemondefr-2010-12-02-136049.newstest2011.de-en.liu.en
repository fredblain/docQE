Business Clotilde Reiss: The Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediating role for Syria 
In the space of more than six months, from July 2009 until May 2010, considered the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French, a researcher in Iran as "spy" was recorded, the French public in breath, placed the diplomacy in alert and accentuate the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran. 
All of this under the eyes of Sarvusz-Wolski diplomats from the United States. 
The by WikiLeaks and from the newspaper Le Monde looked at American documents give some background to this crisis. 
They describe how the Elysée Americans had declared his strategy, which went so far as this advice for dealing with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of Wanderer). 
They show how the French leaders tried to Washington to convince them that the liberation of the young French woman not the release of Majid Kakavand, one in France and held by the American justice because of trade with materials in the Iranian Nuklearprogrammes wanted Iranians to Gegeleistung. 
Finally, they are putting the way in which the French Bureauof the media to the end, has tried to manipulate the idea credible, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad have a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, played in a harsh light. 
In fact, he had done nothing in that respect. 
A on 12 August 2009 in Paris redigiertes diplomatic telegram entitled "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostage taking." 
François Richier, Elysée adviser -- with respect to be maintained in the company of Mr Paoli, director of the Quai d 'Orsay in North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone. 
They told her French method. 
They advised Americans to do everything in their own forcibly nationals, who were forcibly detained in Iran. 
"Power noise," she said, 'voice loud and clear, "without letting the words" Grundmenschenrechte, "" innocence, "" immediate release "in the media. 
This is necessary in order to the Iranian regime in embarrassment, which respects very sensitive to its image. 
"Glee running this all the more so, since you ask the Iranians, not to do '. 
Because "silence solves nothing," over the discussion about testing on inconspicuous way, the Iranians are "master in Ausweichmanövern." 
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners "a familiar, Iranian tactic": "Hostage-taking for political blackmail". 
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from the prison (which should be reached on August 16, on the day that they are in the French embassy retreats) called "the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians' (230 000 euros bail). 
And he state that the Elysée antizipiere further hijackings, a phenomenon that will exacerbate ". 
The Iranians could "in the near future, another of the approximately 1 800 French citizens arrest, living in Iran," he said. 
28 August 2009. 
Clotilde Reiss is 12 days has been released from prison, is being held, however, still in Iran. 
An information was floated: The Iranians Majid Kakavand, whose extradition to the United States because of illegal trade in sensitive electronics materials to Iran, has been released after decision of a judge in Paris from prison. 
The American message is, like many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence. 
For Washington, which the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the programme for the nuclear material, is the release of Majid Khakavand a bad news. 
France has a horse trading in purchasing? 
The liberation of the Iranians against the party of the French woman? 
During a meeting with retabling Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September François Richier assured that this was not the case. 
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the decision of the judges', but have also tried to aufzulehnen against it. 
"It has an active exchange between the French Bureau and the French Justice Minister Michèle Alliot-Marie given" (currently), but "the French government can make the judicial decision not to change," he says. 
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand still under " strict supervision of the French intelligence service. 
The Elysée adviser elects a telephone number, back, then informed the American diplomat, the Iranians' was currently chaired by the Iranian embassy buildings in Paris. " 
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran will encourage the Elysée his efforts, not through pronouncements and organized by the media "flight testing" believe that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential intermediary role." 
The Americans are watching this activity not without irony and noted that the fruit of manipulation, as several articles reflect the official French version. 
A telegram on 25 August 2009 datierendes invoked "the media lightning of the French authorities'. 
What is so many " expression of thanks to Mr Assad, wonders the Paris message. 
"Despite their statements of praise quasi-unanimity price give the French authorities privately that they have only a vague idea about what the Syrians have actually done." 
The document also deals with the reasons which led the Elysée to decline this fiction. 
The intensive communication efforts "aims to Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria to confirm," he analysed. 
A policy launched in 2008, which at the time "of numerous critic votes in France and abroad was perceived as a premature and undeserved." 
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" Paris "Syria is trying to remember what we can achieve laud by a constructive role in the region." 
The aim is also, "discord between Syria and Iran to sow." 
The American Embassy knows this good source. 
On 11 August François Richier entrusted to them: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians whatever." 
"But we have despite all thanks to them." 
"This should at least confusion among the Iranians' cause. 
Clotilde Reiss returns on 16 May 2010 after France. 
Nicolas Sarkozy receiving in the Elysée.
