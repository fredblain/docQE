Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and lost 9 PSC 
With the results of 28 November could the PP in the cities, Lérida Tarragona and play an important role in Barcelona. 
After the significant votes and Members' increase in the last regional elections, the PP their eye already on the parliamentary elections - or not. Your expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes, which this party achieved in this election, is usually twice as high as those in the elections in Catalonia. 
So, the Catalan People's Party 610,473 votes in the parliamentary election of 2008, during this paragraph, in the regional elections in 2006 only 316,222. 
Last Sunday, the PPC 384,091 votes. 
If this rising trend - a result of the diversion of vote share of the PSC and the capture of the electorate of the PP - should continue, analysts predict the PP that, in the parliamentary elections, the PPC from 8 to 12 members of Congress could rise, while also CiU four (it now has 10) and before the PSC at least 9 (25) would lose. 
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE. 
According to the analysis of the People's Party would lose a Member of the ERC - currently has three - while their ICV Papayannakis before could hold or a. 
The election calendar should be maintained, however, is the next date with the local elections in May 2011. Then, too, can the People's Party (PP), the sole to tip the balance in the socialist dominance to put a stop, in four provincial capitals, and with their majority in the City Council, an emblematic of the city councils with the biggest budget: 661 million euros for 2011. 
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC the towns of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists neither a majority to make their traditional allies and ICV (ERC) can count will lose. 
After the Republican debacle, it is not unreasonable that this party of their representation in the town councillor emblematic in which they should reach 5% of the votes, will lose. 
The PP recorded an increase in their share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could be the decisive force in Barcelona, and Lérida Tarragona. 
The nationalists are convinced that the main role to play in Tarragonas turnaround, where they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, along with the PP. 
Ispir Lérida lies the PP just 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times. 
In other important places, such as Castelldefels Reus Badalona, or to the People's Party a significant increase. 
At present, the PP in 34 municipalities of Catalonia, and aims to represent the formation of lists in so many places as possible.
