Sport and rule circumvention 
Tricks like Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show to circumvent the inventiveness, but not the will, a sanction. 
The alleged of two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) has instigated exclusion in the game of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League meant that much ink has been spilled about whether it is a unsporting act or not acted and whether any two players should be sanctioned by UEFA. 
It is widely known, lost the two players a couple of minutes to go (their team had already clearly won) time and played several foul, so that the referee showed them the second yellow card. 
In this way, and as the Real Madrid his group would be the two players the prescribed sanction at the next league match against Auxerre when it comes to meet and so without cards in the next stage of the game. 
After all, the Disziplinarkommitee of UEFA, the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different sums of money. 
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football. 
It is so widespread that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport followed rules. 
Part of the arisen debate about the case is presented to the fact that a team of the club Real Madrid (which in his anthem Edelmut and honour claims and on other occasions his players for similar incidents had punished) in the protagonist, and on the proportion by Mourinho, an episode has added more on his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician. 
In any case, the debate about whether this is not explicitly banned by the statutes behaviour is contrary to the principles of the sport, that is, whether this is a rule anti-gypsyism circumvention. In fact, this approach to the statutes of sport, but seem to circumvent its meaning. 
In this matter should be investigated the sport spirit ailment. 
The sporting spirit defends the physical integrity of the antagonists, an aspect of this action was not at risk, because it was not an aggressive game. 
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the perpetrators against players an unjustified benefit from the Gegenteam. That did not happen either. 
The paradox of the act of the players of the Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally under false game or rule bypass, bypassing the rule was not taken secretly in order to avoid sanctions, but it should be so long as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. 
The players waited and took the sanction happily. 
Another question is what kind of took advantage of the offenders from the deliberate foul. 
It should be stressed that the rival either in a worse position was still benefits for the game played erheischt, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue to play with few players. 
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not use these players. 
The benefit is evident in the fact that the players the next phase of the Champions League game without cards that their participation in a future game could threaten to start. 
But it is a long-term, up to a certain extent uncertain advantage, because the team eventually could leave. Moreover the players with this approach a sanction and go in the second cycle on cards in which they have left for Kartenanhäufung with a card less than in the first cycle. 
So it is not clear whether it really is an advantage. 
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sport, including strategic decisions, in order to learn the rules a maximum benefits. 
In this case, the players wanted no sanction to supervent (that is, in fact, a clear case of rule circumvention), they wanted more when they choose this. 
They made a strategic decision without a penalty to evade or flee before her. 
Although the border between inventiveness and regulatory environment blurred, I believe, is that it is a matter of a clear case of inventiveness. 
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: Because of two independent jams ginge rallies and because of the nature of the Regelübertragung provoked. 
The damage to the principles of sport by these actions have caused, is less ethical than aesthetic.
