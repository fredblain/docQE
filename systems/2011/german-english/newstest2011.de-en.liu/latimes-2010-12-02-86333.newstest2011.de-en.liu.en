Arsenic antibiotic-resistant microbe could new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere allow 
The discovery of a foreign variety of bacteria, which can live of arsenic, opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere. 
Although scientists this unusual bacterium discovered here on earth, it is their view, a sign that a life is also without the hitherto regarded as vital elements. 
"This body has two options." 
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." 
"That makes it quite exquisite, although it almost a sort of 'alien' way of life," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and CO2 author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online issue of the journal Science. 
So far, there have been six main elements - regarded as vital carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. 
But, as the scientists turned out, the bacterium grows in California mono Lake still further, if it replaced phosphorus by arsenic. 
"One wonders what else is possible," said the CO2 author of the report Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University. 
The discovery is an important step in the search for by extra-terrestrial life, as scientists and his life forms must recognise, Anbar. 
The study deals with Roben you that have been found on Earth. 
The announcement of a press conference in which no details on the discovery, has led to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could act of the discovery by extra-terrestrial life. 
This is not the case. 
The discovery "shows that in other organisms Planeten systems with the help of the other elements of biochemical processes can set in motion and that the " Standardelemente, which we believe are absolutely vital, not necessarily firmly stated," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. 
Cockel was not part of the Forschungsteam. 
"This work is a novelty, because it shows that in fundamental biochemical processes and structures an element can be replaced by a different," added Cockell added. 
This discovery was not accidental. 
Felisa Astrobiologischen Wolfe Simon from the Institute of NASA, which the study Gataev, chose the mono Lake because of the high arsenic content. 
As arsenic and phosphorus chemical balance, they took that microbes, both of which are exposed to replace possibly an element of the other. 
"The toxicity of the Arsens is based largely on the fact that it is chemically similar behave like phosphorus." 
"By the organisms, it is difficult to distinguish an element from the other." 
"But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It ends up in our life chemisches system, where almost all verschmiert," declared Anbar. 
The researchers suspended the bacterium GFAJ of a rising arsenic concentration. It is adjusted and grew. 
The microbe grows in phosphorus better, but also that they can survive in arsenic, shows that a arsenic life form of knowledge can happen, of course, is either on the earth or on a different planet or on the moon, arsenic. 
According to Jamie S. Foster, Dozentin for microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new, but so far there has been no functioning example. 
Arsenic came in the early years of the earth more frequently, it says, that is why the science assumed that early life forms have used it. 
"There is reason to believe that life may have developed different than in the early Erdzeitalter," Forster, which was not a member of Wolfe Simon's research team. 
The research were supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National health authorities.
