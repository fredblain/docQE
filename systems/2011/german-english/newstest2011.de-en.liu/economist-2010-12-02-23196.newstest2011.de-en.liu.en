Weak applause for China 
Taiwan's voters are nearing slowly closer connection to the mainland. 
What does Taiwan of its big brother beyond the Meerenge? 
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of eligible voters, in order to five counties in the city mayors and city councils to choose. This is seen as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou. 
By building a groundbreaking business relations, einschl. of a free trade agreement, Ma is even a figurehead for relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949. 
Ma has the test, but just barely. 
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) three of the five mayors, they received a majority of votes. 
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is a greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the vote, the KMT received 45%. 
In a presidential election would have meant that for Ma problems. 
Since his election two years ago, markedet is the voice of his party by around 8%. 
For the first time, the DPP even together with the KMT in the city councils. 
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as convoys of lorries with Wall, wearing a flag schwenkende mass Umz√ºge and rarely held dancers. 
There were even the compulsory, mysterious assassination attempt. 
Sean LIEN, the son of LIEN Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT held on the eve of the election of a speech to a KMT candidate. 
As a man in the crowd shot in the face. LIEN was killed and wounded a umstehend spectator. 
Bizarrer marker is not clear whether the shooter Lien wanted to kill or resolve a dispute with the candidate. 
Regardless of the attack, according to the credit rating Tsai Wen, the leader of the DPP, the election and affected the DPP in a bad light that the KMT has brought more votes. 
China was perhaps the biggest winner of the campaign. 
It was not addressed relations with the mainland. 
Instead, the candidates on plans to social housing and job creation. 
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat. 
For this reason, the KMT its relations with the government in Beijing does not like to the fore. 
But this time also avoided the DPP, which anti-Chinese feelings of stoking too much. 
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China. 
Ma, in turn, would like to confirm that the majority of the Taiwanese his China policy. 
The government in Beijing, will continue to attract his strategy, Taiwan, with economic incentives in the community. 
China immediately sent a negotiator in Taipei, in order to prepare for a summit on investment security and medical cooperation. 
Certainly it wants a political integration. But the most important thing first. 
It would prefer to wait until after the 2012 presidential election. 
The DPP has now invented new. 
Two years ago, she was greatly weakened: The former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat in jail for corruption. 
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was strongly for the absolute independence. 
But under reign Tais became a new generation of moderate politicians and the DPP is fighting the votes of the worker and youth. 
Tsai took place as a presidential candidate of the DPP huge agreement, like Su Chang Tseng under Chen. 
Your party is doing all now to show that they, too, is in a position to build close relations with Beijing. 
Tsai is planning a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China. This, however, requires open-minded discussion. 
Tsai stated publicly that their party is a "credible alternative" to offer Mas rash rapprochement with China. 
Chen appears on this change very frustrating. 
From his prison, he said, the candidates of the DPP would have done better to Taiwan's independence. 
He called for not abandoning the pragmatist Su, even on the presidential candidacy. 
Even without Chen's interference is to choose the DPP major-accident, its possible candidate. 
The KMT will own selfanalysis must undergo. 
Ma's values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT-Kandidaten wanted to lead their campaign without him. 
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor. 
According to a statement of KMT will occupy he transform his cabinet, as well as the local institutions. 
The strong performance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is in favour of a rapprochement constricted. 
While at the same time, the most Taiwanese economic cooperation with China as an inevitable. 
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already a point of no return."
