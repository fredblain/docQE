Cheshire appeal makes on Twitter Sarvusz-Wolski 
Half a dozen of them put my money in the riots in the courtroom. 
In every minute they issued on Twitter their reports on gruesome testimonies. 
In the end, the defence, there were more than 140,000 Twitter-Meldungen on the process for rape and beds gekettete children in a house that go up in smoke. 
On Thursday, the process closely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was indicted, three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, killed on an official end if the ruling on the death sentence, which gave the jury. 
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted applications to court, the grounds for an appeal and explain that the courts will look for years. 
One of the provozierendsten reasons is that it through the intensive coverage of the process, even by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - to a "circus atmosphere" and so widespread, immediately penetration inflammatory details, so that the jury had been influenced in an improper manner by the public outrage. 
This appeal the lat Appe Ion courts could lead to the question of whether the new technologies to make new rules in the courtroom. 
"As I have seen during this process, I believe that there is a real danger if the arrival of the new technologies in the courtroom every individual's right to a fair trial influence," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes Hauptverteidiger. 
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue from the Supreme Chamber Court last week, rejected the applications via a referendum succinctly when he said that the new media "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions. 
But it was certainly not the last word on the matter. 
For decades court Einsprüche noted that the rapporteurship injured on famous cases doubts about the fairness of the process. 
In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States, the ruling against Dr Sam Sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, which have killed his wife, lifted and said in his decision that, because of the new media a "Karneval atmosphere in the courtroom". 
Some people believe that based on the television series and the movie "The flight" on this crime. 
Some lawyers say court Einsprüche that Mr. Hayes veroordeling half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to channels of communication from the courtroom, which at the time of the case of Dr Sheppard were inconceivable to regulate. 
"There is a good reason, about the impact of the new media in trials of a broad public, to be concerned," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, the death penalty in Connecticut has investigated. His report that they arbitrarily imposed. 
Professor Donohue said that some of the lat Appe Ion courts could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction for immediate communications from the courtroom case--had may make the process fairer. 
The Twitter matter is just one of many of the lawyers of Mr. Hayes in order to discuss for years, and thus to delay a conviction. 
The defenders claim, for instance, that Mr. Hayes has already been these could be, as a judge Blue had not to allow them to test the reactions of potential judges, by showing them during the horrors of the ground Jurorenauswahl Athamna photos. 
Some of the judges said photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke Petit, 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17 years ago and Michaela, 11 years, they have met with disgust. 
The defenders say they are also the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution into question, and argue that the judge mistakenly a jury have exchanged a critic of the state prosecutor's office, and that he had been undue pressure on the ruling would have exercised when he had made the unusual decision to call the jury over the weekend. 
The judges were not isolated. 
But their arguments about the influence of the detailed reporting on the process is perhaps the greatest interest. 
In a judgment challenge, which they have submitted last month, it found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the US Senate of the candidates was discussed. 
They argued that the new media would have sparked continuing the flames of emotions on the case. 
"Such a daily surge of Medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," wrote the lawyers, "has been in New Haven, and perhaps even nationwide is not yet known." 
Your focus on the rapporteurship through Twitter is controversial. 
Some journalists said in interviews that the claim that this direct news reports, which are rabble-rousing but effective than slower are reimbursed, regards a look that is under the rapporteurship verarme on future processes. 
But some lawyers said lat Appe Ion courts would often with the argument, social and technological changes lagging Adaptation through the courts. 
Mr. Hayers lawyers reinforce this claim. 
In her appeal they were based on the decision by the Supreme Court in 1966, in which the condemnation of Dr Sheppard because of the rapporteurship was lifted and made it clear that the new media require new rules. 
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
