The army has so much powder that one in the Czech Republic umwickeln could keep you but only two years 
The Czech army has 445 kilometres involving powder, bought with explosive rates. 
In the year before had supplied the Ministry of Defence already 224 miles to the powder Armeelager. 
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have ausgesorgt for 225 years. 
The only problem is the preservability of powder - two, but no more than four years. 
The army bought the powder from the Company STV Group, including miserable affair for 40 million kroner. 
In his justification for the purchase of this huge amount of the General Staff Mapsuta find string MF Dnes, the soldiers would annually to the 60 kilometres use powder. 
The research of Armeepyrotechnikern MF Dnes according to point out, is for this indication that the entire army annual pyrotechnics an intensive training course should -- of all generals and officers of the army command, right up to the secretaries and Malayali cleanup. 
Defense Minister Vondra and army general Vlastimil Picek not excluded. 
But it could be the mean annual consumption of 60 kilometres Zündschnüren reasonably justified. 
This length to 25,000 blast. 
But also Frontext would this army stocks for more than ten years. 
But if the old rule of experts is that the training of any new professional soldier two metres powder enough, then, the army through this Neueinkauf -- even from the point of increased demand of the pioneer and special forces -- a reassuring supply for the already mentioned 225 years. 
The soldiers complained of rapid deployment Brigade recently at the Defence Minister Vondra, they would have almost no cartridges are restricted to hand guns more so because of the lack of funding Schiessübung strong. 
The Unterhosen want to say nothing. 
"Mir is also not why they buy such loads of powder." 
But that is the ultimate decision, they will already know that they need. " 
"For us the army is a good customer, which we want to come forward as traders as much as possible," says the marketing manager of STV Group Jan Decký. 
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometres string find the army had become so for at least ten years with this "ammunition" eingedeckt. 
Jan Decký of the STV Group, but only by a four-year duration of use of the powder and police and Armeepyrotechniker even only two years. 
"In perfect storage is arguably the four years mentioned possible," admits of them, but wants to remain unnamed, in order to become a soldier not of the criticism of the army. 
After the expiry of the duration of use any ammunition must be tested thoroughly, whether they are still at risk is reliable, and not the life of the soldiers. 
But these tests are not for nothing, but another cost money. 
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantitative rebate for the 445 kilometres powder. 
"You cost us 60% less than last year's supply of 244 miles," spokesman Pejsek tells us the position of the Department of Defense make with. 
Only for comparison, the annual consumption of example of Schnüren Pyrotechnikern of the police, the ammunition in the Second World War, or the Soviet army's brother, Kerviel exceeds several years barely 1,500 metres. 
And the police only ever ordered such quantities of ammunition, which they can use before the end of the duration of use. 
The safety of Pyrotechniker because they are also, so the possibility of flexible purchases of modern and therefore reliable open powder. 
The Ministry of Defence has already huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tonnes of munitions from the times of Warsaw Treaty, when viewed the Czechoslovak army zweihunderttausendköpfige people on their campaign on the Rhine. 
According to the Pyrotechnikern MF Dnes raised, expects the Czech armed forces in a few years, the same problem in the killing of hundreds of kilometres of old powder, which they today as "good" has purchased.
