Inspectors in the twilight zone 
The European Food Safety Authority EFSA is undermined by the with GM crops experimentierend industry. 
This accusation now formulated the expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent Institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology. 
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well documented," said Testbiotech boss Christoph then on Wednesday in Munich. 
The head of the EFSA Expertengruppe for genetically modified crops, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA per-kilometre expert for years in the lobby Association Ilsi under contract. 
The will of corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or paid Bayer. 
Kuiper was instrumental in Efsa-Prüfvorschriften for gene crops and helped to appear in a clear conflict of interest, then criticized. 
The sales per-kilometre Efsa-Vorschriften Solonic word for word with the position papers from the Ilsi and contributed to the imprint of the industry, which is to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma. 
It was the second time that Testbiotech bemängle a conflict of interest. 
It was a high-level EFSA Managerin recently without conditions or transitional period for the Swiss agricultural company Syngenta -- and have changed so that the sides. 
The middle Saxon-German radio (MDR) recently had personal links between EU authority to exercise and industry lobby reveals that has made the environment federal office as well as deconstitution dubbed. 
The EFSA, meanwhile, can see no conflict of interest. 
It is trying to all serious data, including those of the industry, as long as they are of high quality, it says in a statement. 
The experts who work for EFSA, you do not dispute that they have no contact with the industry. 
They would have to disclose this, however. 
Kuiper gives his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States. 
This calls himself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and policy -- including the risk assessment for biotechnology without EWL mandate. 
In fact criticise independent experts like Then that genetically modified plants currently without any feedingstuffs attempt in animals will not be allowed tested, and the reaction of GM crops on environmental impacts. 
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize on the field makes," says then. 
Current practice is only isolated proteins, but not the whole genetic plant test should talk no reliable results. 
"If you take the risks, how can we find it?" Asks then accusatory. 
It also provides for Angelika Hilbeck. 
The academic research since 1994 in the genetic engineering and is currently at the Technical University of Zurich. 
The industry is trying in this area, as in the United States now in Europe is becoming more critical scientists to influence or discredit. 
There are so few researchers, who are not intertwined with corporations. 
For companies critical studies were not published in the rule. 
"The industry controls the security research," claims Hilbeck.
