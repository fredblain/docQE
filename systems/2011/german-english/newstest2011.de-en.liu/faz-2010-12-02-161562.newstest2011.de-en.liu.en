"Free speech in the land of the free," told the Kurznachrichtendienst Enthüllungs-Aktivisten via Twitter on Wednesday (local time). 
Shortly before had shunned the Internet company Amazon the Wikileaks-Dokumente from its servers. 
The Internet-Aktivisten had during the publication of secret diplomatic diplomatic cables on the Amazon Web service (AWS) resorted to high levels of access to the documents. 
Via Twitter said WikiLeaks on the step further: 'Fine -- our dollars are spent to people in Europe. " 
If Amazon this problem with the freedom of speech, "they should stop to sell books." 
Amazon have the use of its servers by WikiLeaks reversed--to after staff of Senator Joe Lieberman investigations, told the TV station CNN in reference to the office Liebermans. 
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security, Amazon, with a boycott threat, told the British newspaper. 
"I would have liked that Amazon is taking this measure used in the face of the previous publications of classified information by WikiLeaks," said the senator.

The Internet activist, has described the investigations in Sweden as a set of his opponents. 
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats. 
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange." 
So rightly Assange fears for his safety, said Hrafnsson. 
The WikiLeaks founder, will therefore continue to hide. 
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America. 
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks-Enthüllungen indicted for treason and should be executed. 
In Canada said an aide to the head of government, Stephen Harper --- apparently ironic --- on television, "Assange should be killed" and "Obama could use a drone."

The spokesman for the US President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had requested, if it is for recently estimated espionage calls on diplomats responsible. 
"I am not sure why we are the opinion of types with a website care," Gibbs. 
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than a website." 
The American government is the protection of their databases full to the test. 
As a special envoy is the deputy director of the Centre for anti-terrorism measures, Russell Travers, has been appointed, told the White House. 
Travers was responsible for " structural reforms needed to develop, following the disclosure of the Irela per-kilometre Botschaftsberichte by WikiLeaks. 
The White House also wants to review the ways, such as the entire government information and spread to protect. 
The American government also announced for the safety of dissidents and Aktivste trying to make it through the WikiLeaks publication in danger. 
"We have done everything to come in contact with them," said Aussenamt spokesman Philip Crowley. 
"We stand ready to protect them, if it should be necessary."
