The secret of komplexgeschüttelten lifted Canada. 
The new American diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks spread, reveal the secret about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of the Canadians against the Americans regard; they place but with the same blow the feeling of superiority last known to Canada. 
Consequently, the American diplomats surprised that the Canadian voters at the ballot is not the Canadian American relations in the sense, and they believe that the visit by President Obama to impose the Conservative government would have helped to their budget of 2009. 
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which have been widespread public yesterday, still offer more juicy details as the very substantial content, which has the absence of one. 
A previous link on 22 September 2008, in other words, in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage in full swing was being reported on the point of the United Nations to the of their political leaders to discuss operations. 
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, used in Ottawa, American ambassador. 
Mr Wilkins offers different explanation of this situation. 
"One of the Canadians almost inherent inferiority complex prompted the Canadian Population-ageing possibly, political leaders are much more likely to do so, on domestic issues of life, as the United States in this election passing the buck (as in the 1988 campaign on the free trade)," he describes. 
The United Nations, so he concludes, is "the proverbial Goliath of this election: Omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk from him." 
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" even less, since the two countries have intense political and economic relations. 
"Logischer way," as he assessed, "if the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party to drive a kind of essential relationship, which the voters at the ballot box as a key factor in the sense." 
The other expression of this sense of importance in the reads on 22 January 2009 of Terry Breese, business winner in Ottawa, sent communication, which is to prepare President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa. 
"Your trip will help the continuation of the government in a vote of confidence on the federal budget in early February, in Canada, his first deficit after more than a decade, which will be known as a result of Belebungsprogrammes in the $30 to $40 billion has been created," Breese. 
He had nowhere mentioned that the government of the parliamentary session before Christmas had to be postponed, in order to prevent the parliament of the coalition were overthrown and Population-ageing as the continued existence of opposition parties on the quality of the proposed recovery plan would impact. 
Another, from January 2008 and on the part of the previous Ambasador draftsperson Wilkins agreed communication Washington of becoming increasingly negative image that the spread of CBC broadcast, dramatic sets of the United States. 
The ambassador is worried about broadcasts as Border, little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which a few subtle allusions to Maher Arar, which can see 'no-fly lists ruse "or contributions for the purpose of Muskelprotz carried out by the CIA interrogation. 
Yet another communication detailed how Hillary Clinton remarked in their French counterparts, Bernard Kouchner in their first bilateral meeting asked whether Europe is prepared to include certain prisoners from Guantanamo Bay. 
Mr Kounser Delinking the question to answer yes, but on the basis of an individual "case-by-case 'decision. 
Àm at the end of the meeting, as described, 'the Secretary of State, he has a paper in terms of Omar Khadr handed a 15-year Muslims Canadian origin. " 
"The Secretary of State has promised to the files retabling durchzusehen." 
Finally, we realise that heated passions on the WikiLeaks website. 
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close aide, cofinanced on CBC had declared that the person responsible for this massive Ixtoc " should be killed. 
He had told here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
