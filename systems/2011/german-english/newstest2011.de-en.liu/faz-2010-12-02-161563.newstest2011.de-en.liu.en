The ice university 
In the " be University in Bologna Eiskonditoren will be prepared for better times of the year. 
The three-day basic rate for future Gelatieri has the biggest gains and visitors from around the world. 
Where does the whole ice? 
The Gelatiere and the Gelataio. 
The Gelatiere on German somewhat archaic the Eiskonditor, the cream after all the rules of the Italian ice doer art. 
The Gelataio is catching up with a Spachtel the ice cream from the Kühltheke, it abolishes the Waffel and then selling them. 
In order to know that you must not after Anzola Dell 'Emilia in the province of Bologna. 
But who wants to know more about ice, will not be University in the " of the Italian company Carpigiani over. 
The ice University, the manufacturer of ice machines set up in 2003, so that the ice cream is from his machines everywhere the high Italian ideals. 
The three-day basic rate for future Gelatieri has the biggest gains and visitors from all over the world. 
But there are also several days Spezialkurs around the chocolate ice and internships in the domestic state-owned Eisdiele. 
Some in the Midlife-Crisis dreams of a new career, others simply dare cats--or on the treacherous ice their vague aspirations. 
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents -- from Brazil on Hungary to Saudi Arabia. 
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow Food movement and plans to offer in the country of industrial ICE Cream a future European quality product. 
Anke from Berlin is corporate adviser and wants eintüten after years in a neurological aufreibenden job gone. 
Two young Egyptians to open dream of a Eisdiele in Cairo. 
A man from Malta and one from Brazil, the quality of the ice cream in its bars -- and improve the Canadian housewife Julia, because their children love Italian ice cream. 
Gelatiere Maestro Luciano Ferrari declared the participants first the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream. 
Crucial--the is not only good taste, but also the seidig Geschmeidigkeit and the good consistency. 
Luciano forgets in his training but not the icing on the cake of the national and even südländisch superstructure: "Italian is simply be the good -- and there is still plenty of romanticism." 
The first step to manufacture seems very simple. 
Luciano dump the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a great mix device, with an electronic program at 85 degrees heated cools and then immediately on four degrees. 
Then he is a tap on the machine, and is a white civil-society-based case--had pasteurised cream, basis for all milk ice varieties. 
The lecturer will immediately bombarded with questions: You can only ice cream with natural substances without stabiliser? 
As you can leave their own Experimentierlust free course? 
Luciano to let warns against the spirit of the time to mislead consumers. 
Those of ice cream 'only from natural ingredients "speech, has probably still stabilisers, most used a natural product sub-generator Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne. 
Of course, one can hold without stabiliser, but it must then be sold within a day, otherwise it sackt in together, and the customer bite at sea ice grain. 
Some variations on the basis of the mass are allowed. 
There will be more exciting with the Flavourings. 
For the taste in the ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket. 
There are also gives powder and pasta. 
"The suppliers are all trying to foist onto you dozens of aromatized additions." 
"But you should simply cats--or experiment." 
Either in the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruit. 
Or just the ice cream from the white cause mass, which with eggs to yellow cream and with Kakaopulver to the basis for all possible Schokoladen-Verführungen. 
Now, the rate of participants in the ice machines. 
Luciano leaves they each four different types of vanilla, chocolate, and produce Mokka Haselnuss-Eis -- with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less Vanillearoma or other natural additions. 
The same experiment will be subject to the Fruchteissorten. 
More flavourings, more fruit mashed potato taste -- it will not necessarily be better. 
Hazelnut ice tastes not necessarily nussiger when it contains more hazelnuts. 
The most popular Kiwi ice, the working group, which uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser. 
First a balanced mix lifting the taste of a be right, says Luciano. 
Eisherstellung is a computing task: Will peach mashed potato with a lot of sugar, must be used to reduce the sugars in the basic recipe. 
For Zitroneneis is an extra dose of sugar. 
Luciano prefers a device, with which he sugar levels of certain (vine-growers Fruchtsort measure for the Oechsle in musts). 
Fortunately, facilitate the tables Rechnerei. 
Ice to make no longer requires so many physical use as before. 
Not only the automatic equipment for the manufacture of fundamental mass helps. 
There is also a machine, in which the finished ice mixture at the same time cremig heating and cooling is punched at minus temperatures. 
All automation remain despite the small glitches. 
The Brazilian Gustavo covered itself and its course colleagues from top to bottom with Fruchtpüree, as he puts the outsized Stabmixer out of control. 
"At any rate," says Maestro Luciano, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens."
