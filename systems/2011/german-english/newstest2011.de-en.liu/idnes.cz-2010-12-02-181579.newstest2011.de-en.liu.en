The right mattress and the right Bettenrost? Women have other than men Wënsch 
Not the fine bed framework, but the quality of the deck area -- mattress and make the rusteth good bed. 
However, they must be harmonious, adding to the wishes of the specific user. 
In the selection of many things to play a role -- the weight, the size, the state of health, not least the sex of Schläfer. 
Just as important is also the Interieur in which have distanced mattress and rusteth. 
Typical example? 
In a weekend house in which not regularly heated, are not Latexmatratzen good, because they need much longer, "hot". 
In addition, they are much more difficult than usual Polyurethan-Matratzen. 
And -- they should be turned on a regular basis. 
If it is not enough in the core Entlüftungskanälchen and will also have to make a plate, congestion increases in humidity, so it is not impossible that itself is under their tape. 
In the election, of course, also plays a role, which is used to it. 
Anyone who has been a long time abroad, where very high mattress with soft layer, will be hard to get used to a low mattress with hard surface. 
"Good all ice hockey players from the NHL returned, have complained to me that they are no longer able to sleep right." 
"For their abgeschundenen shoulders, closely and hip they need simply a soft layer of foam Visco (memory Foam -- a Formgedächtnis Polymer)." 
"This I recommend including diabetic people under a disorder of the nervous system, and so they are suffering from the" information "from the ligaments and skin can receive bad," says Sylva Hadamcziková, which specialised in padded furniture. 
That is why I have many years ago ice hockey players, but also other customers this mattress with foam Visco (memory Foam) worried. 
"Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattress, among other things, to offer the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico." 
And it is not necessarily a famous ice hockey player, in order to learn benefits of Visco Schaums value. 
This "miracle" actually works quite simple. 
The foam optimalisiert his toughness and form in accordance with the heat absorbed, in other words, he is downright schmiegt on warm body. 
Nowhere, put it in the night shifts around one does not like after a hard fight. 
You sleep easy much better. 
The foam viskoelastische also offers protection against Dekubitus (Wundbrand). 
In the choice of Matratzengrösse should be to body size still the length of the mature Fussohle, about 21 to 34 inches. 
Man as Mrs to 180 cm large, are in need of a 210 to 220 cm long bed. 
Each of the Schläfer should be at least 90 cm deck range available, so together 180 cm. 
In Einzelbett, for example, in single, are appropriate 120 to 140 cm. 
For the sake of comfort, and also for any visitors. 
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb for the ideal bed range: "If you on the back, should be enough room for the easy angewinkelt poor," advises credit rating. Helena, the champion of the guild Prokopová Polsterer and Raumausstatter, which for many years the issue of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture presents and devoted to this issue at colleges. 
In a double bed needs all its own rusteth and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattress are too high. 
Otherwise, there is nothing other than the rusteth in different tune assembling and that is not in any Bettrahmen possible. 
Foam Matratzen should at least 14 cm high, mattress with 15 cm skeleton pens, that should account for at least three centimeters in the form of class, and the fine cushion. 
"With the hand or sit down with it, the feathers in no case sense," warns Helen Prokopová. 
Each mattress makes a specific Rosttyp required. 
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document as Saeed Siyam zusammengewachst Zwillinge are in the bedroom nothing. 
This mattress cannot be met and the reference can wash it is not what we already commonplace. 
And since we are in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years of slow to a huge (and clogged sieve). 
That is also why reject experts believe sales patter, which in mattress promise a life of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee. 
Every cause has its ifs and buts. 
And that is why a practical advice from the dealers: In mattress of 120 or 140 cm band should be on the health of the salary abziehbaren waschbar, not shy, however, it is recommended, to use a Matratzenschoner that can deduct leave and wash 
Even if today in the rule with'aide Rundumreissverschluss Matratzen salaries, so that one after the opening two halves gets (immensely important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger-mesh mattress, above all, alone, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. 
They have in bed instead of a firm Rostes plate? 
Out of it. 
Or a maximum for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night. 
So, too, should they prefer the plate with ventilation holes tag (if any) are already in use and mattress with pen skeleton and 15 cm minimum level with the Taschenfederkern and Feinpolster. 
Polyurethan-Matratzen belong on such a basis. 
For not verstellbar Lattenrost with 14 to 18 Federleisten (Lamelle) are Latex or Sandwichmatratzen appropriate (possibly also combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay it rusteth with a greater number of bar, from 28 and more pen Leisten, with hurricane Lenden Lordosenstütze in the area and the ability to regulate the Lattenhärte. 
On verstellbar Lamellenroste does not include mattress with pen skeleton, because they do not respond to the ergonomische Verstellung. 
In addition to the attitude of the Steife Federleisten will also be specific flexible back Module. 
This is a special fortifications of Federleisten, which enables the Federleisten einzudrücken or even to verwinkeln that they will enable the conjunctural Einsinken of the back of the Schläfer. 
Role-call for men with broad shoulders an important thing. 
There are even Matratzen manufacturers, which have started to use in "soft" Herrenmatratzen zones for the shoulder area. 
Also in the ladies is thought - it takes them this soft Hüft zones in the area. 
For most demanding customers are certain punktelastische Flügelfedersysteme (Lattoflex) or rusteth with punktelastischen Kontakt-Pads with the Multitorsionsfederung. 
The pressure is reduced at several points, making the tension. 
But, given the right mattress and right rusteth a bad (too large and fülliges) Kopfkissen used, the majority of benefits lost again. 
Here, too, a rule of thumb: The Kopfkissen Delinking the head, its leaders should only up to the shoulders range in order to ease the back Muskeln. 
Ideal may seem a 50 x 60 cm big bed, as it is, for example, the Scandinavians. 
In the situation should back the Kopfkissen (along with the shoulder discharge zone in the rusteth or the soft zone in the mattress) the shoulder level. 
Some have our modern mattress, with the former (filled with hay) Strohsack but in common. 
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials, or at least their mixtures. 
Also in mattress means the new magic word "organic". 
Instead of oil raw materials to be used in the production of Polyurethanschäumen increasingly temperament oils -- for example Rizinus and soya oil. 
Soya- used well known by all manufacturers. 
"Organic mattress, which is to say their nuclear materials from pure natural origin is," says Petr Vasícek by the firm Tropico Plus. 
Natural materials, but also in the manufacture of Matratzen rates used -- one of the first was Aloe Vera. 
But one can also be micro-supervisory Kapseln needed to spread the sleeping fresh forest or Lavendelduft. 
Here, too, it makes a difference between men and women. 
While the men a "postwar air" plant extracts from Birkenblättern used, so that the Matratzen regard the heat and absorb the body can cool, the salary for women " wärmend effect. 
Extracts from Red impatient Paprikaschote blood circulation, the weaker sex is so sleeping malheur wohlig warm. 
And today's favorites? 
Mattress from Kaltschaum (he has greater pore with devastated cell structure and is therefore breathing radioactive than trade Polyurethan and many more flexible). 
The combination of various Steife (severity) by cold foams and create Visco-Schäumen added zone Matratzen who know exactly where TEN-E head, hip and closely. 
For a high-quality mattress has to be done but these 7000 kronor and more. 
Health Matratzen but are usually with lower VAT burden, because they are seen as a medical assistance. 
As the first Czech company was Gumotex this advantage. 
You see on the mattress and to save on rusteth is not so easy. 
And then there are special offers of manufacturers and dealers offering two for the price of a mattress. 
It offers the brand Magniflex the mattress Duofreeze with the relation verstepptem Visco foam memory for CZK 11,990. 
The second one free to do so. 
It was the Tempur material that launched the era of viskoelastischen sparkling materials with open cell structure and high density in almost cosmic pace. 
No wonder, but they were for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to the enormous excessive impositions taking off. 
Tempur in heat soft, cool environment entrenched in turn it. 
So it fits the human body perfect and distributed in the best possible way the body. 
It is therefore not only ideal for the prevention of Druckbrand but increased general sleep comfort. 
Viskoelastische sparkling materials, however, are not only in mattress, but also in other health products, such as for specific Fusspolstern used to make the legs and the 500 ml relief. 
Local manufacturers use, for example, the sparkling materials Eucatherm C Twinsaver or similar products.
