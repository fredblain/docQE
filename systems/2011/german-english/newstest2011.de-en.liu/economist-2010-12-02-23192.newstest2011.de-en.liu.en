The routine demokatrische 
The democracy movement in Latin America is growing, as the support of private companies. 
Crime is a bigger problem than the unemployment. 
In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil's larger than the United States. 
These results came the Latinobarómetro poll, which was conducted in 18 countries and exclusive published in The Economist. 
This survey is being carried out regularly since 1995 and shows the opinions in this region. 
Two facts in this year's survey, especially in September and October's eye. 
First, the good mood in Latin America 
And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions. 
In many countries in the South American Pacific coast has greatly increased the democratic movement (affair table 1). 
In Peru, for example, where the economy since 2002, is growing at an annual rate of around 6%, the number of democracy advocates of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. 
In Mexico, where the economy since the sharp fall in the past year recovers, is to see such a trend. 
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (affair graph 2). 
Around 44% of respondents said that with the democratic practice their country to be satisfied. These are much like last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3). 
Some 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values are those of the last year, but show a sharp increase from 2003 (17% and 24%). 
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined the efforts for more democracy. 
That this during the Great Depression lasted, is probably due to the fact that the Latin American countries experienced only a brief recession have recovered and fast. 
In addition, the poor absorbed by a stronger social network. 
(According to reports by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America from this week in 2009, the poverty rate rose only slightly in Latin America and is again this year by 32%.) 
But from country to country, there are strong mood differences (affair graph 4). 
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread progress thinking. 
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession mount, and violent crimes have increased, it is less the case. 
Only the second time since the beginning of poll see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country a bigger problem than in the graph affair unemployment (5). 
Some 31% say that they either themselves or a family member in the last year has been the victim of a crime, but to 38% last year, the values have fallen and reached its lowest level since 1995. 
The rising economic performance is reflected in the greater support for private and the market economy: Approximately 71% of respondents supraregional said that the private sector for the development is essential, in 2007, it was 56% (graph affair 6). 
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy in the country can bring progress, compared with 47% last year. 
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela maintain this view (and 80% are for a private sector), even though their nationalized left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, many private companies. 
Brazil has according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared with 11% last year). 
The respondents in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, can see in the US, the most influential country, with this role in the Dominican Republic of Venezuela and Nicaragua accepted.
