The association, which explains that their results "given the low number of samples analysed no statistical significant value, but the problem Illustrationscharakter treated under-sell", had between July and September, usually within four, from a ten-year-old child around on the meals food consumed plus a Zwischenmahlzeit in supermarkets in Oise and Paris bought. 
This typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day -- were like Nascherei of laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants studied.

" If in nearly all of the cases, the legal limits for each chemical substance taken individually, are not exceeded, so we remove this collection but very good that the reality in which consumers may be carcinogenic substances or substances with Endokrinin Störfaktor is suspended, is worrying, "said the association. 
Already at breakfast contain only the butter and the tea with milk is already more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three safe proven carcinogen, as well as more than twenty residues, which can affect the hormone system. 
The apple imported from Brazil, as Zwischenmahlzeit for the study, scheduled for traces of six chemicals, including a Fungizid banned in France. 
The same is true for the green beans from Kenya, in lunch included, in which the study has found traces of a strict insecticide banned in the EU.
