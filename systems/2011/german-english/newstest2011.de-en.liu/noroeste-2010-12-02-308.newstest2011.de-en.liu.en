NASA announces the discovery by extra-terrestrial life 
The North American Space Agency convened a press conference to a treasure vorzustelle tomorrow, which will affect the search for creatures in general. 
The National Air and Space Agency (NASA) of the United States tomorrow, Thursday, a well-known astrobiologische discovery, which could confirm the theory of the existence by extra-terrestrial life. 
The Fund will tomorrow at 1 p. M. at a press conference in NASA headquarters in Washington, by experts from the Karamanou Astrobiologie. This is a science, which examines the origin of the development, distribution and the future of life in the universe. 
In convening the press conference assured the NASA to "an causing Fund for the search for by extra-terrestrial life", which triggered speculation experts in other countries. 
The discovery could prove the theory that it is in hostile environments that it has been for unbwohnbar, human-like creatures can exist. It was the hypothesis that they were raised in intelligent creatures - as people - could turn if their improved living conditions. 
Apparently, it is a microbe, which at the bottom of the mono Lake in Yosemite Nationalpark, California, has been found. They live there in an environment that is too toxic for all possible forms of life was kept, because the sea is strong arsenhaltig. 
In any kind of the Mikrobie used the arsenic than survival resource. In this capacity increases the chances that it on other planets, which could not be on our protective atmosphere poor--lies similar life. 
If these organisms the arsenic verstoffwechseln, is in accordance with the Astrobiologen demonstrated that "it is actually a different way of life, a second life form, which is known to us." 
The space agency is tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference the actual reach their treasure known. 
In the conference stoning-to-death Geobiologin Pamela Conrad, which is the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, the Titan (the largest moon Saturns) under the question of whether his chemical composition of the earth is similar, studied.
