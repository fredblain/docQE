A bone House fascinated even after 100 years. If you look at the Interieure of Gaudi of 
The roof seems to be like the back of a defining historical Echse, the stairs as the vertebral column of a dinosaur and the balcony seat are on gerissene Fischmäuler. 
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. 
Of the local residents got the house with his organic forms nicknamed "bone home." 
Organic forms, wild colours, the unusual use of stone, and Kachelsplittern mosaic that just façades reminiscent of and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical characteristics for youth style of Antonio Gaudi. 
The facade of the House is playing with dream-like lines, zärtlich paints and Textur in nature and living creatures. 
First on closer inspection noted that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order. 
In the night, the whole façade even closer, more dramatic and the specific Anleuchtung reinforces the glamour of colours. 
The same faster valuable lines and tortuous forms also dominate the interior of the house. 
A wave shaped wood copied the window frames, Geländer, Zierelement of doors, even Guckloch and own trade. 
The House in the quarter Eixample Batlló on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No 43 was said by the reconstruction of a house from the year 1877, the architects Emilio Sala Cortese. 
The reconstruction took over two years and was detailed. 
The investor, the wealthy industrialists Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but in the end, he voted the idea Gaudís in an unusual and cheaper rebuilding. 
The Miet House Casa Batlló Antoni Gaudí noted, however, is not alone. 
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol together. 
At the drawing board, the mere decoration for the representative of the housing Realitäten owner and the use of mosaic of the façade was his idea. 
In the design of the facade, however, also worked many other Bildner and artists. 
The joint work on the drafts of the Casa Batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí. 
So Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá Güell in the park, which is also other works by Antoni Gaudí. 
Shortly after his completion, the home of the local inhabitants of his organic forms for the nickname, bone house '. 
Others called it the specific Fensteröffnungsmechanismus because of the "yawning home." 
It also says that the top of the building is portrayed the sword of the Holy Georg, the patron of Catalonia. 
But also further bildhauerische elements symbolize hidden religious motives. 
Gaudí noted for the House for the time unique central heating system with ventilation channels and typical chimneys. 
Rather bizarre is putting its 45 degrees of bias. 
In his creation Gaudí consistently ignored all then building regulations and could not be discouraged by this. 
Before the start of construction, although he lifted from the city of the corresponding construction permit a but the claims made by him on the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers two years later in the completion so horrified by the result was that they demanded redress. 
The Council lords, among other things, also found that the construction recently with its pillars, even in the public Bürgersteig. 
To change, however, there was no longer, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the neighbourhood, Josep Batlló a request for approval of the rental of two highly devolved floors of the House -- and it was granted him promptly. 
The House owner even drew in the lower reaches. 
In the gallery in the second floor was a Gesellschaftssalon, on the third floor were sleeping rooms and Privatraum of housing. 
The ground-floor level was leased to a Juwelier business. 
The whole sechsstöckig building is going through a set of stairs, right up to the roof Terrasse. 
By the fundamental elements of the reconstruction were all right corner and just lines removed and replaced by gebogen and waved walls. 
Gaudí but also worked with a modern approach to the mutual combination of spaces. 
The social part is explained by the opening of the Salon doors completely and connect as a larger society convenient plaudern without compromising vertraulicheren talks on a certain intimacy. 
The House received by Gaudís restructuring out of a new facade also an unusual roof and two other floors. 
Impressively is also Gaudís game with the light, as well as the blue and white glasiert Kachel with which the courtyard is in disguise and the courts of light. 
The game of these two colours gives all floors of the House, a high degree of light. 
He made it plain to the principle that White the light reflected better than dark colours, which the sunlight to absorb the opposite. 
The House Casa Batlló that 2005 in the list of UNESCO world heritage site has been included, can visit today everyone. 
In the first floor is made the most geräumig and most beautiful housing available to the public. 
The homeowners decided only in the year to this step and this to mark the 150th Geburtstags of the famous creator. 
As you stated that this is a very profitable business, retained the surveys in one, they extended to other common ground and the roof spaces, including the Dachterrasse. 
The price to visit the construction memorial, however, is no trifling matter, he stands at euro 16.50, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get 20% reduction. 
This amount exceeds the ticket prices to other Gaudí-Bauten in the city. 
Who the real atmosphere of the House with his breve Drachentürmchen wants to learn should try to friendship with one of the House residents to close and visit him at home.
