Bond for the takeover of eXcentris 
The government Quebecer, which the Société Angus, as well as the company was asked to put parallèle, financially to takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris, agreed with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive bond. 
The developer society Angus, as well as the company parallèle, which is a donation of seven million dollars from Kultusministerium for the adoption of the Daniel Langlois cinema complex eXcentris belonging to the tabloid Saint special pension had hoped to put them back its real cineastischen function to entrust sufficient--so had apparently not what they do. 
The government has accepted that, in this case, however, on their own terms. 
Instead of the expected donation offers the government Quebecer rather a bond in lower than the initial hoped-for level, which is a viable solution too favourable conditions could launch, at least according to the state from the scaremongers entnehmbaren sources. 
A first action plan, as well as a question after 12.8 million last spring from Quebec had already been rejected the request petitioners has fallen since the overall again. 
A proposal, along with an action plan have already been the President of the "Société de Développement of entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, Gastinger St Pierre, who chairs the files eXcentris. 
Several days ago he sent her a final technical report. 
The counter-proposal from the cabinet was sent to the SODEC, however, on Wednesday. 
Parallèle and Angus have now to answer until 31 December, at this time. 
In any case appears to be the premise of Staatsspende really was pushed to the side. 
We should remember that the owner Quebecer Community cinemas and cinema complexes against a direct state investment in support of the takeover of eXcentris had revolted by the argument made the Culture Minister did not provide financial aid for Immobilienprojekt there that he not other cinemas. 
Several other market participants in the segment, however, by contrast, substantial economic aid. 
Cinema leader Daniel Langlois, following the self-financed construction of the cinema over ten years under great difficulty the car reindeer cinema in the space of his Kinokomplexes presented by the exception could justify from the public purse. 
The lack of cinemas that independent films, is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clientele. 
The Société Angus, as well as the company parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, control, for its part, a privately financed Campagne, by which it is a total of $700 000 hoping to boost employment. 
Since the spring of 2009 continued only a single screen for continuing to show films in eXcentris: Le parallèle. 
The aim of the future purchasers, it is that three of the movie theatres on 27 February next year with a demonstration of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois' Des hommes et of dieux 'opening. 
Christian Yaccarini but has the newspaper Le Devoir "not removed, and it ignores what he and his group of the revised downwards proposals, which has been done to them.
