China keeps his targets to reduce the greenhouse gases retabling 
China's representative said at the COP16 that his country had enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces of effort and it would reduce its offer maintained until 2020 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases. 
China holds his offer the emission of greenhouse gases by 2020 by 40 to 45 per cent, assured us to reduce Su Wei, the representative of this country on the COP16. 
In his first public appearance on the 16th world Klimagipfel of the United Nations (COP16) assured Su Wei, his country would have made tremendous efforts to lower the carbon traces and convert his industry. 
He said that in the last four years of his country have invested $245 million for the emission of greenhouse gases. 
On the other hand, he declared that China would not change his goals, but would work together with the international community on this matter. 
He said that the Chinese strategy on climate change in four aspects of share: Dialogue, capacity building, institution-building and support of pilot programmes. 
In all aspects we have made progress, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which the targets for the reduction of emissions of gases meant, he said. 
On the other hand, he pointed out that, in China, the authorities of the states with those of the Central State and the communities working together to achieve the targets for energy saving, an efficient use of energy and the reduction of emissions. 
He also said, are already some multiannual plans in attack or have been closed both those who were funded by the Chinese government, as well as those who received money from other countries. 
For example, he was referring to the programme for efficient use of energy, which in the past five years had received was introduced and investment of the United Nations (UN), the government and private hands. 
It is also a project at provincial level on climate change, a long on the exchange of traditional incandescent light bulbs with energy-saving pear and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said. 
Martin Krol, scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that the efforts of China would be far greater than commonly thought. 
It showed that the per capita emissions level of greenhouse gases in China six tons per person betrage, while in the United States per-kilometre 100 tonnes. China is for a neunprozentig overall contribution to the pollution responsible. 
It also makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. The energy efficiency in the last five years by 20% by 2020, and a further comment should happen, he said.
