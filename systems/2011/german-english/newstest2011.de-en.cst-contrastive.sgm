<p>
<seg id="25"> Both Social Democrats also know, however, for whom the term voldemort lukáš plachý senses and even, where this figure is to be found, and also, what it means is that "in the konditorei to go." </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Not the tollste bettrahmen, but the quality of the liegefläche - so rost matratze and make the good bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, this must be in harmony, and with the wishes of the specific user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The choice to play a role on many issues - the weight, the size of the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is also just as important, in which interieur matratze and subordinate rost. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a wochenendhaus, in which no regular heated latexmatratzen, are not suitable for much longer, as they need to be "hot." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Moreover, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethan-matratzen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And - they should be turned on a regular basis. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If you do not have enough entlüftungskanälchen in essence and even on a firm plate, staut, humidity, so it is not excluded that under your schimmel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the election is, of course, also a role, in which it is used to. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Anyone who was long time abroad, where very high matratzen with weichschicht, will be difficult to a low matratze with hard surface can get used. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "All an ice-hockey player, which have come back from the nhl, have complained to me that you are not more right can sleep." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "for their abgeschundenen shoulders, closely and hüften need it simply a weichschicht from visco-schaum (memory foam - a formgedächtnis-polymer). ' </seg>
<seg id="15"> 'This, I recommend that, among other things, also zuckerkranken people under a disruption of the nervous system, so that they are suffering from the' information 'from the ligaments and skin can receive bad, "says Sylva hadamcziková on polstermöbel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> That is why I have many years ago, but also other customers eishockeyspielern these matratzen with visco-schaum (memory foam) concerned. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Today, this is no longer a problem, because such matratzen offer the manufacturers tempur, among other things, the Italian firm magniflex or the Czech manufacturers tropico." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And we must not necessarily be a famous an ice-hockey player, the benefits of the visco-schaums learn to appreciate. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" actually works quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The foam optimalisiert its rigour and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, it is downright schmiegt on warm body. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Nowhere is it, in the night shifts not around as after a serious fight. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It is sleeping easy much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The foam viskoelastische also offers protection against dekubitus (gangrene). </seg>

<seg id="26"> Each of the schläfer should at least 90 cm liegebreite available, together, therefore, 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In einzelbetten of, for example, singles are 120 to 140 cm appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The own comfort, and also for any visitors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise, the following rule of thumb for the ideal bettbreite: "If you on the back is, should still enough room for the easy angewinkelten poor," advises ing. Helena prokopová, the zunftmeisterin the polsterer and raumausstatter that for years the issue of healthy schlafes and good ergonomics of furniture and to put this question to colleges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> In a doppelbett everyone needs its own rost and his own matratze, but be careful when buying products, so that the matratzen also are high. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise, cannot do other than the roste in different level to fit and that is not in any bettrahmen possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> At least 14 cm schaummatratzen should be high, with matratzen federskelett 15 cm, should at least three centimeters on the formschicht and the feinpolster. </seg>
<seg id="33"> 'with the hand or the sit down the feathers in no case, warns Helena prokopová felt ." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Any matratze makes a specific rosttyp required. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Ganzgepolsterte beds with matratze and document as zusammengewachsene siamzwillinge have no place in the bedroom. </seg>
<seg id="36"> These matratzen cannot be and to reveal the reference you cannot wash today, which is already there. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And since it in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the matratze after five to seven years of slow to a huge (and congested sieve). </seg>
<seg id="38"> That is also why reject experts werbeslogans in matratzen a life span of up to 25 years ago, yes even lifelong guarantee promise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Has any matter it. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And is therefore a practical Council by traders: in matratzen of 120 or 140 cm broad should be the hygiene of waschbaren abziehbaren salary, not be afraid, nonetheless, it is recommended that a matratzenschoner, easy to use and laundering can withdraw. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even if today in the rule matratzenbezüge with rundumreißverschluss are produced, so one after the open up two halves gets (immensely important for the waschvorgang and the waschmaschinengröße!), the manipulation, with greater matratzen alone, above all, often carried out as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> Have you in the bed rather than a rostes a firm plate? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Get out of it. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or a maximum for a bed for undesirable guests and for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> So they should also prefer the plate with lüftungslöchern oversight (provided that there are already not) and matratzen with federskelett and 15 cm of minimum allocation with the so-called taschenfederkern and feinpolster use. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethan-matratzen belong in such a document not. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For not verstellbare lattenroste with 14 to 18 federleisten (lamellen) are suitable or latex- sandwichmatratzen (possibly also combinations of latex and kokos), always figures are roste with a larger lattenanzahl, from 28 and more federleisten from, with lordosenstütze in lendenwirbelbereich and the possibility to regulate the lattenhärte. </seg>
<seg id="48"> On verstellbare lamellenroste not include matratzen with federskelett, because it does not respond to the ergonomische verstellung. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> In addition to the attitude of the rigid the federleisten special flexible schultermodule will also be required. </seg>
<seg id="50"> This is a specific integration of the federleisten which allows the federleisten einzudrücken verwinkeln or even so that the specific einsinken the back of the schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Particularly for men with broad shoulders an important matter. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There are even matratzenhersteller which have started, in 'herrenmatratzen "weichzonen to use for the schulterbereich. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Also to the ladies is thought - you off these weichzonen in the hüftgegend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For ambitious customers are punktelastische flügelfedersysteme (lattoflex) or roste with punktelastischen kontakt-pads with so-called multitorsionsfederung. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure will be distributed on a number of points, which will reduce the tension. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But, if you at the right matratze and right rost a bad (to great and fülliges) kopfkissen, used the most benefits go back lost. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Here, too, a rule of thumb: the kopfkissen is supposed to be the head, its leaders should only up to the shoulders rich, so that the schultermuskeln can ease. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Ideal is therefore a 50 X 60 cm great kissen, as for example the Scandinavians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In the seitenlage should the kopfkissen (together with the schulterentlastungszone in rost or the weichzone in the matratze) the schulterhöhe in balance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Some have our modern matratzen have with the former (with hay EU-US) strohsäcken but in common. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern manufacturers use more and more natural materials or at least their mixtures. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Also in matratzen means the new magic word 'organic'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of erdölrohstoffen we used for the manufacture of polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturelle oils - for example rizinus- and sojaöl. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soya is used by all known manufacturers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> "organic matratzen, that is to say in their heart from materials purely of natural origin is," declared by the firm Petr vašíček tropico plus. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Naturstoffe but are also used in the production of matratzenbezügen - one of the first was aloe Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> One can but also mikrokapseln grant the sleep fresh forest or lavendelduft. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Here, too, there is a difference between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While the men a "kühlender" pflanzenextrakt from birkenblättern is used, so that the matratzenbezug the heat and cool can absorb the body, the salary for women 'wärmende "effect. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Extracts from red paprikaschoten stimulate the blutzirkulation, the weaker sex will the sleep so warm wohlig. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> And today's favourites? </seg>
<seg id="72"> From kaltschaum matratzen (he has greater poren with devastated zellstruktur and is therefore atmungsaktiver than handelsübliches polyurethan and also much more flexible). </seg>
<seg id="73"> Through the combination of the various stiff (rigour) by kaltschäumen and visco-schäumen mehr-zonen-matratzen arise, the know exactly where head, hip and closely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> For a high-quality matratze has, however, you 7 000 kroner and more to berappen. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Gesundheitsmatratzen but are usually with lower VAT, as they apply as medical aid. </seg>
<seg id="76"> The first Czech enterprises has been given gumotex this advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> We will see, in the matratze and on rost saving is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Now and again, there are special offers of manufacturers and traders, the two matratzen for the price of one. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The brand magniflex the matratze duofreeze with in relation verstepptem visco-schaum memory for 11.990 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="80"> The second will be free to do so. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the material tempur, that the era of viskoelastischen schaumstoffe with open zellstruktur and high density in almost kosmischem pace. </seg>

<seg id="3"> In the year before, the Defense Ministry already 224 kilometres to the armeelager powder. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is reassuring to know that the armed forces for 225 years have ausgesorgt. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The problem is only the shelf-life of zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years. </seg>

<seg id="7"> In his explanatory statement for the procurement of this huge amount of powder replied the General Staff mf dnes, the soldiers would in a year, the 60 kilometres powder use. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to the research of armeepyrotechnikern, the mf dnes point that came from this claim is that the whole army every year a very intensive pyrotechnic training should - of all the generals and officers of the armeekommandos, to the secretaries and Putzfrauen. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Defense minister Alexandr Vondra and army general picek vlastimil not excluded. </seg>

<seg id="20"> What is crucial is not only good taste, but also the seidige geschmeidigkeit and the good consistency. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Luciano forgets in its training but also not the icing on the cake of the national and even südländischen überbaus: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still plenty of romanticism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first step to manufacture seems quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Luciano dump the grundzutaten milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilisers in a major mixgerät, with an electronic programme everything to 85 degree inflamed passions and then immediately to four degrees are cooling. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Then he is of the machine a tap on, and out is a pasteurisierte White basiscreme, basis for all milcheissorten. </seg>

<seg id="26"> How can we allow the own experimentierlust free? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Luciano warns that spirit to be fooled. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Those of ice cream 'only from natural ingredients' speech, has probably still stabilisers used - usually a natural product, for example from the guarbohne guarkernmehl. </seg>
<seg id="29"> We cannot, of course, also without ice stabiliser, only it must then be sold within one day, otherwise it sackt in together, and the customer to bite eiskörnchen louder. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Certain variations in the grundmasse are allowed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It will be more exciting with the flavourings. </seg>
<seg id="32"> For the taste in the ice Maestro Luciano between the different ingredients, which you obst-abteilung or in the sweets of the supermarket are buying. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Moreover, there are powder and pasten. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "The suppliers are all try to foist onto you dozens of aromatised additions." </seg>
<seg id="35"> "But you should simply time to experiment." </seg>
<seg id="36"> Either in the fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruits. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Or just in the ice cream from the White grundmasse, the with eggs to yellow flower will and with kakaopulver on the basis for all possible schokoladen-verführungen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Now the kursteilnehmer to the eismaschinen. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano leaves they each four different types of vanille-, schokolade-, mokka- and produce haselnuss-eis - with or without eggs in the grundmasse, with more or less vanillearoma or other natural additives. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The same experiment will also be subject to the fruchteissorten. </seg>
<seg id="41"> More flavourings, more frucht-püree -; it will not necessarily be better. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Not necessarily nussiger haselnuss-eis tastes, if it contains more hazelnuts. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The most popular kiwi-eis, the working group, which used more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Only a balanced mix will highlight the taste of a gelato clear says Luciano. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Eisherstellung is a rechenaufgabe: will pfirsich-püree with much sugar used in the sugar grundrezept, must be reduced. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For zitroneneis is a extraportion sugar necessary. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano prefers a device, with which he the sugar content of the determined fruchtsorten (wine growers measure so that the oechsle in grape musts). </seg>
<seg id="48"> Fortunately, facilitate the rechnerei tables. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> To make ice requires not more so much physical use as before. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Not only the equipment for the automatic manufacture the grundmasse helps. </seg>
<seg id="51"> There is also a device, which at the same time the ready-made eis-mischung cremig beaten and on minustemperaturen kept cool. </seg>

<seg id="2"> The Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The country, but to take a view on this - nor is it controls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Against midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007 I at least four Israeli F-15 fighter planes a mysteriöses, würfelförmiges buildings in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is on the banks of the Tigris; the next major city, 30 kilometres away, is dair as-saur. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Your name comes up in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on when it comes to the reactor is that Syria supposedly with aid from North Korea in the quader has built, hidden in a valley, that of the electricity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing of the us-auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA by the end of April 2008 would be the also under the name of the middle town el-kibar normal reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes against the technology from the fifties hardly. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA has led a videopräsentation before with by means of fuzzy satellitenbildern. </seg>
<seg id="10"> By computeranimation blendete you a, where the components of the reactor before the destruction have been, of a fell copy of the North Korean model from the atomzentrum Yongbyon. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In addition, it presented photographs in the building, from the vicinity show or even the innenraum. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor is just before the beginning of the operation, it was said, but not yet with brennstäben have been drawn up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more than it was then, yes the mystery were in time, a greater. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The former US President George W. Bush has recently in his memoirs, reveals that the CIA before the attack in fairly sure was that Syria in el-kibar a reactor built, but little evidence that saw it in the country's nuclear weapons programme 'active'. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some intelligence officers in Europe there are rather more cautious, and yet only talk of a 'alleged reactor', even if the cia-präsentation for "plausible '. </seg>
<seg id="16"> They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Asked how sure he was a reactor, to have a high un-diplomat, replied in the summer, the IAEA have only flat "enough material to ask questions'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The rubble of the alleged "unused militärgebäudes" surpassed the Syrians are in a hurry to one side and planierten the terrain thoroughly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Nevertheless, took place in June 2008 a iaea-team under the former chief inspector Olli heinonen in el-kibar traces of uranium, which had been produced by people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, the IAEA on a Member State satellite pictures provide commercial operators from the period immediately after the attack, which should be more significant than that presented by the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="21"> These, however, are starting to get on the market, not because of the unknown contracting authorities - perhaps Israel - it has bought exclusively. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The IAEA can therefore verify their authenticity not independent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always claimed that never a secret nuclear program farms or a reactor to have built. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, declared Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But the, the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then refuses Damascus, debate on this - as well as on the satellite pictures provide. </seg>
<seg id="27"> It also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the rubble of zerbombten building. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But Israel remains silent pugnaciously. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We will comment on the never ', confirmed recently the at the time of the attack acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> So on the investigation of the case since June 2008 and fruitless "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority ', as a high Western diplomat in the seat of the IAEA in Vienna gives - after all, it is a serious breach of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area on which the IAEA watchdog. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA appear to be three more bodies, the "in functional link 'with the alleged reactor are should - and other than this still exist. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The inspectors have so far not disclosed, at which it is that is still what role they have or what they seem suspicious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to information edition of the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they will be in the IAEA internally as marj as-sultan masyaf iskandariayah described, and that, in turn, are derived from nearby towns. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent institute for science and international security in Washington (ISIS advises) has identified and that these places on satellitenbildern a gebäudekomplex in masyaf tracked down, which is probably one of the suspects objects. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It is probably in or directly, in addition to a military base - precisely with this explanatory statement Syria the IAEA are denied access to the three places. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In Vienna, it says the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA of the United States will vorgeschickt auszuspähen military equipment. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Because the nukleardetektive were by a piece of advice of the US intelligence services attention has been drawn to the institutions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos that between the three places and the quader on Euphrates material hertransportiert back and forth. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A high Western diplomat in Vienna has said, at least one of the installations could 'in connection with the brennstoffproduktion'. </seg>
<seg id="40"> There is, however, 'no indications of sensitive activities', in other words, uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes to the construction of nuclear weapons are necessary. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The type of reactor will be pursued with uranium, which is not supplemented. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But where the uranium would have should come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated, on these central issues there are at best plausible guesswork. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> It is also unclear whether debris, the valuable traces might bring, to the three places have been stored. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As if the hundreds of stands of disappeared from the face of the earth, no one wants to have any information as to where the rubble. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The only a few kilometres from el-kibar on the other side of the Tigris, salzmine al-tibni, the Syria 1998 to their suitability as camps for radioactive waste, the IAEA has investigated as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The former iaea-inspektor Robert kelley it had in a recent analysis of satellitenbildern for the renowned magazine Jane's intelligence review with the reactor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Starting from the orbit show, however, that Syria to the three suspects places erdarbeiten untouched and large container distant, after the IAEA access had requested. </seg>
<seg id="48"> This can hardly be a coincidence, but has helped to dispel the suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> It also means the IAEA in diplomats, have spent many months, a plan for inspections there, to develop the it Syria should allow any military secrets to real, the burden alone shows how great the interest of the inspectors. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Also, however, Damascus bügelte this proposal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Western diplomats in Vienna had a year ago have been allayed, the reactor was destroyed, therefore, the matter no high urgency, brings about US Ambassador Mr Davies for a couple of months ago so-called sonder-inspektionen into play, one of the strongest means that the Vienna atombehörde has to controls. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Iaea-chef yukiya Amano, of these inspections should propose, has already of "an option, for which I am open in the future ', but then it is dragging its feet. </seg>
<seg id="53"> There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it needs a majority in the Board of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented there are anything other than eager to an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other hand, as a diplomat to are concerns: "What if they find nothing in the end? ' </seg>

<seg id="2"> The democracy movement in Latin America will more, as the support of private companies. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Crime is a greater problem than the unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil larger than that of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This outcome was the latinobarómetro-umfrage in 18 countries and carried out exclusively in the economist has been published. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Since 1995, this survey is being carried out regularly and shows that the meinungswechsel in this region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two facts in the year's survey of September and October particularly in 's eye. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Firstly, the good mood in Latin America </seg>
<seg id="9"> And, secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In many countries of the South American pazifikküste has greatly increased the democratic movement (S. table 1). </seg>
<seg id="11"> In Peru, for example, where the economy since 2002 by around 6% is growing every year, the number of demokratiebefürworter of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In Mexico, where the economy since the strong collapse in the last year recovers, is such a trend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But only half of the people polled in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries of the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (S. graph 2). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Around 44% of the respondents said that you with the democratic practice of their country to be satisfied. That is as much as in the last year, however, 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3). </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some 34% trust the Congress of your country and 45% of their government. Both values are those of last year, but a sharp increase from 2003 (17% and 24%). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined the efforts to bring more democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The so during the Great Depression, thanks is probably that the countries of Latin America experienced only a brief recession, and a speedy recovery. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, the poor by a stronger sozialnetz instead. </seg>
<seg id="19">  (according to reports of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America from this week, 2009, the level of poverty in Latin America only slightly and is again this year by 32%.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But from country to country, there are strong stimmungsunterschiede (S. graph 4). </seg>
<seg id="21"> Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread fortschrittsdenken. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more tangible and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Only the second time since umfragebeginn see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country is a greater problem than in the unemployment (S. graph 5). </seg>
<seg id="24"> Some 31% say that either they or a family member in the last year have been victims of a crime, but to 38% in the last year are the values and thus achieve the lowest level since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The rising economic performance is reflected in the increase in support of the private and the market economy: around 71% of the respondents überregional stated that the private sector is essential for development, in 2007, it was 56% (S. graph 6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> Approximately 58% said that only the market economy their country can bring progress, compared with 47% in the last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela this view maintained (and 80% are for a private sector), even though its left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, many private companies nationalized. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil has according to 19% of the respondents (18% in the last year) the greatest emphasis in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% in the last year). </seg>
<seg id="29"> The people polled in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, and this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela will be accepted. </seg>

<seg id="3"> However, whether you do in the next year to a re-election provides, depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández compromise than their deceased husband, your predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The signs are not clear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Néstor Kirchner, even after the election of his wife the economic policy, was often budgets in the tax revenues, economic growth and inflation is not fully into account. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This allowed the präsidentenpaar, the extraeinnahmen spend as it sees fit. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On paper, the fernández-regierung last year the majority in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October has led to further divisions. </seg>

<seg id="12"> The 2010 budget applies now for the next year, which the President has an even greater opportunity to spend money as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy is hotly: probably will it this year by up to 9% increase. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official inflation rate is z.z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - are pushing the value to nearly 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner, the 2003 the took office as Argentina of economic crises ridden growth and poverty reduction, said to his primary objectives, and not the inflationssenkung. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The high prices for Argentina's agricultural products have been a strong boost to the economy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the burst of inflation undermined by a great devaluation in the year 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Perhaps for this reason Cristina Fernández would like to Argentina and back to the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="23"> At the beginning of this year, the government an agreement with shareholders holding the former debt restructuring of the country in the year 2001 had rejected. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not known whether Fernández after the end of its term of office, even without the support of their husband politically active will be. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which is largely by the kirchnerismus has enough. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the Argentines from their summer holiday in March, will return to the wave of sympatie, it was shown to be fizzled. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The discovery of a foreign bakterienart which, amongst other things of arsenic can live, opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on earth, and elsewhere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Although researchers this unusual bacillus here on earth, is it your view, a sign that a life without the hitherto regarded as vital elements is possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> 'This body has two options. " </seg>
<seg id="5"> "he needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "the power it to something very special, although it almost a form of 'foreign' way of life is', said Paul c.w. Davies of Arizona State University and co-autor of the report that on Thursday in the online-ausgabe the magazine Science. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> So far, six main elements have been regarded as a vital - carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, phosphorus and nitrogen and sulphur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> But, as the scientists herausfanden, increases the Bacillus in the Californian mono Lake still further, if it phosphorus by arsenic replaced. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="9"> "one wonders what else is still possible," said the co-autor of the report Ariel that Anbar of Arizona State University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is an important step in the search for außerirdischem life, as scientists life and its forms must recognise, so Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study deals with microbes that on earth were found. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The announcement of a press conference, in which no details to the discovery of were announced, was a cause for widespread speculation on the Internet, that the report of the discovery of außerirdischen life might be. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "shows that in other planetensystemen organisms, with the help of other elements biochemical processes can set in motion and that the 'standardelemente', which in our opinion are absolutely vital, not necessarily see given ', said Charles cockell, Professor on planetary and space sciences research institute of open university of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockel was not part of the research teams. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="18"> The wolfe-simon Felisa astrobiologischen Institute NASA, the study, chose the mono Lake because of the high arsengehalts. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="20"> "The, were aware of the arsens is based, in particular, that there is a chemically a similar situation as phosphorus." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "by the organisms, find it difficult to distinguish an element from the other." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "But the difference is so great that arsenic different acts as phosphorus. It has reached in our biochemisches system, where it almost everything," says verschmiert Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers, the Bacillus gfaj-1 a rising arsenkonzentration. It suited to and grew. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The microbe is growing phosphorus better, but that it also in arsenic can survive, shows that a arsen-basierte way of life, of course, can happen, either on the earth or another planet or on the moon, arsenic more often occurs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> According to Jamie S. foster, dozentin for Microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new. But so far there was still no functioning example. </seg>

<seg id="13"> According to a statement of ethik-experten contravened the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, the before the affaire were closely friend, against the so-called ban on the drehtür-lobbykratie. </seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> During the Justice Ministry officially rejected, the reasons for the decision in ensign-fall to announce, said Mr fire and other ethikanwälten, the Ministry notes in the very careful to political charges for a large number of defeats, of the media have been followed with great interest, including the decision last year, the case against the former Senator Ted Stevens due to mismanagement on the part of the public prosecutor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Prosecutors' are obviously schreckhaft, "said Melanie sloan, the chairman of the Association of 'citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington' (an organisation whose objective, the fight against corruption in parliamentary and governance of the United States is), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr Ensign has brought to justice. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "That means in principle that hochstehende government officials now be able to assume that the laws are not apply to you ', added it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Paul coggins, hauptverteidiger of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had a telephone call on Monday of a public prosecutor and received a further the next day, in which he has been told that the Ministry of any complaints against its clients will rise. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Mr. ensigns defenders had cooperated with the public prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator, as his office in a statement on Wednesday again repeated, 'in accordance with the law. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr. coggins refused, the legal arguments he put forward to the public prosecutors to explain in more detail. </seg>
<seg id="21"> 'I am not, in the gesprächsdetails between the justice ministry and me. Only so much is said, we believe that the right decision to have, "he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Last month, the bundeswahlkommission decided that the investigation because of a separate legal action by the Group on ethics, after a payment of $96,000 of Mr. ensigns parents to the hamptons against the bundeswahlgesetz have violated. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money something other than a gift. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> NV energy, a large company in Nevada, the long time the Senator supported, was one of the firms, in which Mr Hampton, thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyisten-arbeit took place. </seg>
<seg id="25"> An e-mail from December 2008 proves that, after the company Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist has promoted, Mr. ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a meeting with Mr Hampton had, in which he told him that he, in the Ministry of Interior, because of a cause "anklopfe." </seg>

<seg id="2"> Half a dozen of you tippten in the riots in the courtroom way. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the minutentakt verschickten you on Twitter their reports on grausige testimonies. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the end, so the defence, there have been more than 140, 000 twitter-meldungen on the process to rape and beds gekettete children in a House that go up in flames. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Thursday will be closely followed the process of Steven J. Hayes, was accused of, three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, killed, to have a formal end to find, if the verdict has been reached on the death sentence that the selection panel, has made. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But Mr Hayes lawyers have already tabled amendments in court, the reasons for appeal to explain and the courts in years to come. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> One of the provozierendsten reasons is that it by the intensive reporting on the process, even by the extensive use of Twitter by durchschnittsreporter - to a "zirkusatmosphäre 'and a as widespread, instant penetration aufrührerischer details have been, so that the jury illegally, influenced by the public indignation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This protest could persuade the appelationsgerichte to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules in the courtroom necessary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> 'as I have seen it during this process, I believe that it really is a danger, if the arrival of the new technologies in the courtroom every individual " s right to a fair trial influenced, "said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes hauptverteidiger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The presiding judge, Jon C. blue by the Supreme kammergericht, last week the applications by Decision back briefly and when he said that the new media "carefully controlled ', and that there would be no evidence that the jury of passions driven. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But that certainly was not the last word on this matter. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For decades gerichtseinsprüche stated that the reporting of famous cases doubts as to the fairness of a process gives rise. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In its historic decision of 1996, the Supreme Court of the United States the judgment against Dr Sam sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, of his wife is to have killed, lifted and said in its decision that, given the new media a "karnevalsatmosphäre in Court '. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some people believe that the television programme and the spielfilm "on the flight 'in this crime is based. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some lawyers say, gerichtseinsprüche what Mr. Hayes condemnation half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary, the channels of communication from the courtroom, the time of the if Dr sheppard were inconceivable to rules. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "There is a good reason, about the impact of the new media in processes of a broad public, are to be concerned," said John J. donohue III, professor at Stanford law school, of the death penalty in Connecticut has investigated. His report, will they arbitrarily imposed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor donohue said, some appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of instant communications from the courtroom could out the processes of fair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The twitter-angelegenheit is only one of many, the lawyers of Mr. Hayes explain in years to discuss, and therefore a condemnation to delay. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defenders claim, for example, that Mr Hayes these could already have been as judge blue you had not allowed the reactions of potential judges to test, by offering them during the jurorenauswahl grausige tatortfotos showed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some of the judges have said, photos of the victims, Jennifer hawke-petit, 48 years, and their tüchter, hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, they would have met with horror. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defenders say you were also the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution in question, and argue that the judge mistakenly have exchanged a jury, of a critic of the public prosecutor's office, and that he would have been unacceptable pressure on the verdict, as he would have exercised the unusual decision was made, the selection panel on the weekend freely. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The judges were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But their arguments on the influence of the detailed reporting on the process is perhaps the greatest interest. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In a urteilsanfechtung, which you have tabled last month, it notes that the case of the news in Connecticut had dominated and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American Senate has been discussed by the candidate countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They argued that the new media continually the flames of the emotions have reopened on the case. </seg>
<seg id="26"> 'such a daily crush of medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom, "wrote the lawyers," it has previously in new haven and perhaps even nationally, not yet. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Its focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In interviews said some journalists that the claim that these direct news are rabble-rousing but effective trade unionist, the more slowly than reports will be reimbursed, a technikfeindlicher view is that the report on future processes verarme. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> But some lawyers said, would appelationsgerichte often faced with the argument, social and technical changes requires the adaptation through the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr. hayers lawyers reinforce this assertion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In your objection they were based on the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, in which the condemnation of Dr sheppard because of the reporting has been lifted and made it clear that the new media require new rules. </seg>
<seg id="32"> 'this case, "wrote you,' represents sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century." </seg>

<seg id="5"> After all the accounts, it was neither a polite debate between two different sides still a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan punktesammelns. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meetings of the deficit Commission of the President on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences between the members continue to exist. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months can give a mutual respect, of the ideological divide that continue to the Members divides, hushed up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It is not enough to say that it was a new era of cooperation here. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Both sides are now in a test phase - in the one from the other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise, while claiming even tried to the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters for a renewed parteienkriegsführung arbitration. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This was why the meeting on Tuesday itself, and its assessment by the participants on a minimum requirements or accusations limited. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to be a rapid change the atmosphere in the last two years, which prevailed might expect. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Regardless of whether it with taxes, donations, health or benefits is that the two sides are miles away from each other. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Lastly, the novemberwahl Washington, at least for a short time bribed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> 'No question, the tone has changed, "said pete wehner, an official representatives of the Bush administration, the now for the' ethics and public policy center" works. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "that is after elections inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elections give partisan passions that die again. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And that is a good thing. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In some issues, particularly in those that are on the agenda of the "lame duck" session are Republicans and Democrats, have no other choice than to find a solution. " </seg>
<seg id="19"> Bush's tax cuts to an end at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way to receive some or all, whether it is temporarily or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Similarly, a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits to expect, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that people think that the recommendation that tax cuts for the rich, while they refuse to unemployed workers a support. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House is the optimism has risen, that it is in these issues during the "lame duck session 'some and also, at the same time, the New START Treaty, cannot ratify. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But William glaston of the Brookings insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of lame duck session 'does not necessarily to a lasting cooperation between the parties must lead, if the new 112. Congress in January will convene. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead, he says, is a phase of the nichtübereinstimmens more likely, perhaps even inevitable. </seg>

<seg id="27"> "I see much of what is happening today in by 2012, as vorkampf, or further shadow boxing, for the hauptereignis from 2012," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons for this have much with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House, and to do it with the teeparty-wählern who were instrumental in their education. </seg>
<seg id="29"> How worried about the Republican leaders also may be that they too high poker, you know that you have to try their promise to reduce the expenditure of the government and health-care reform, to be adhered to. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> These parteilinien are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the deficit Commission clear how a tax reform and the raising of certain taxes, as well as the raising of the retirement age and the lowering of government spending. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have adopted, in accordance with their own assessment, so very pressed the defizitfrage on the public agenda that these could no longer be ignored. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes to its plan to official recommendation and to make you fight very even in the vicinity of this number. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will lead to this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> Public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It has been proved that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties work together. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If confrontation leads to a dead end, as has happened in 1995, then both sides must carefully on the public reaction. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Whoever is condemned to lose, will change the course and the compromise must seek. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> This may in fact be an optimistic view. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Partiality and polarisation today are greater than in the middle of the 1990's, and they seem a more ideological divide between Obama and the kongress-republikanern than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a far wider choice of consistency 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> So it may be the courtesy, the this week for the display of many Americans, will be welcomed. </seg>
<seg id="45"> But it will on both sides very much more effort, require a common denominator in the questions, the two still separated. </seg>

<seg id="3"> The deal was in a common statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister, Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the sicherheitsgipfels made known. </seg>

<seg id="19"> "We use it solely for research purposes, that is all." </seg>

<seg id="20"> Belarus approached, however, a few months ago the United States when it interest in the meeting of an agreement anzeigte. </seg>

<seg id="24"> The US government pays for this effort $14 million, with a large part of the money in the Belarusian research with depleted uranium, which will not be used for nuclear weapons. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="28"> The relations between Belarus and the US for years been tense, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But the statement from Wednesday suggests a possible rapprochement. </seg>

<seg id="3"> The risk premia the euro-peripheriländer are increased dramatically and the shares of the European banks is more than 5%. </seg>
<seg id="4"> We should, however, the possibility that the ECB and the euro fooled can hardly points, which has led to the concern, not to be underestimated. </seg>

<seg id="6"> The institutional investors will not lose its fear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> A month ago, the European Central Bank has called on us to reverse our liquiditätmsaßnahmen, according to which the ECB tomorrow, for the fourth time in two years, and probably even many times in the future, taking a step backwards. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The Bundesbank, called for must of the plan for the purchase of government debt, as they are ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquiditätsmaßnahmen. It should only a einwöchiger permanent access be maintained. </seg>
<seg id="9"> After the irland-krise, we expect that the current liquiditätsmaßnahmen 'at least until March' extended and the quarterly invitations to tender with unbegrenztem access on quartalsende to ensure the liquidity at least until June to be maintained. </seg>
<seg id="10"> We also expect that the programme for the purchase of bonds continue and a stärkendes signal will be spent. </seg>
<seg id="11"> If the created expectations are not met, the excellent response of the markets of yesterday set back again and if halstarrig insistence that we withdraw our liquiditätsmaßnahmen, can only God help us! </seg>
<seg id="12"> Just as with the ezb-sitzung in May, in which the Bank reiterated, the purchase of staatschuldpapieren not to consider the markets and then collapsed, could this history repeat tomorrow. </seg>

<seg id="20"> Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after the problem with the stress tests in July had not recognised, the figures in the framework of the rescue plan, acceptable and help to reduce, the uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, the government on Tuesday the parliamentary assent to his new budget. As they still do not have the sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Angela Merkel has their discourse on the summit of Heads of State and of Government on 14 December moderate. There is political unity asked to show that together we play the same score. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries the Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. </seg>

<seg id="26"> The sabbatical year Zapatero and Mr Trichet, explains why the Spanish stock exchange by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In comparison with the February was the response of the government and the Spanish central bank quickly and convincing, and we will benefit from the surprise result. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Today there is a crucial auction a three-year bond, which might the benefits from trichet-effekt. That is why we will draw on a strong demand that all the doubts about our umschuldungsfähigkeit will remove. </seg>

<seg id="6"> "the greatest part is finished. It may be that we instead of siebzehen 13 or 14, but all the important processes are already completed. They have been from Banco de España, all transactions has strong support, controlled." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="7"> In a by the association of the directors and managers aragoniens (adea) organised breakfast led olavarrieta from that of the concentration process "as quickly as possible, has taken place and that we must be satisfied with the timescales set the end, in former times, not now, in the context of the business plans with Banco de España has been laid down," he emphasised. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Zapatero and the red line of Germany </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin has decided for keeping the euro but, at the same time, conditions for the whole of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tension on the markets have a dual response of the government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation measures presented, starting with reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of work agencies or the lifting of 426 euro support for the unemployed, the no unemployment benefit, to the privatisation of 49% of the management of airports, AENA Barajas and El Prat and 30% of state lottery. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, the Deputy Prime Minister who supported, Elena Salgado, with the aid of the former regierungspräsidenten Felipe González, the criticism of the Chancellor, Angela Merkel, as responsible that the current crisis have herausbeschwört. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How are these events to understand? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their public relations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it is about a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is Germany a fundamental new perspective to shape our future, the with the retention of the ancient traditions of much of its partners. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In view of the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis to spekuliern. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first: a strong euro, with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South would have to leave the euro area. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The second: the reintroduction of the German mark - although that currently, rather, for science fiction sounds -, supported by a large proportion of public opinion, around 50% of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The third: a transformation of the euro in accordance with German proposals, which means: more macroeconomic control; strict financial management; punishment of the countries which are invading the benchmarks; möglichereweise the default of some countries, and the extension of the costs of potential adaptation measures on the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is clear and is for some time already. That is why there is now no excuses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First, in 2009, as both the IMF, as well as the European Commission incentives for deficits created and the German Government drew up from a constitutional reform, in order to prevent it from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> That was the first signs of the polarisation between what Germany was thought necessary (strict steuerpläne and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second signal, a central European country, as Merkel the decision to rescue of Greece hinausschob painful. </seg>
<seg id="18"> At that time, it was the criticism, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion absolutely against a rescue of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally, Merkel in the last oktobertagen again with a clear position; it calls for a reform of the agreements of the European Union, in order to allow the saving of a country and, at the same time, the private lenders to commit to a part of the cost. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position has been interpreted as anti-European, because they are the irlandkrise and all the following through on. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But your proposal, if somewhat sweetened, was accepted in the next few months we will be on the reform of the European Union, which should allow these measures from 2013. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has a red line, not to exceed the it does. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It says all that - even if now unpopular measures have to be made - it from that date the old functioning of the euro will not be. </seg>
<seg id="24"> 2013 will the geburtsjahr of a new currency zone, in which the zuwiderhandelnden countries be severely punished, can be forced to declare itself bankrupt, and in this case the private sector must take a share of the costs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows us that we need to take a hard path of growth, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improve the productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The other alternative, the on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments is based, as was mentioned by Spain in boom times, simply will not be tolerated. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would be a bad thing to do to it not to understand. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not just a question of the general government deficit until the year 2013 to three per cent runterzufahren. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much tougher. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, is ourselves to cheat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the current turbulence in more calm. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And that we take the opportunities offered to us by the spring of 2013, make use of. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero has taken this so well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) points out that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, its own house in order, to create their way has been. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But the of Germany was not bold enough red line is there, and it does not seem that change. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Under the contemplating opportunities is that we the with little serious countries fully gestopften euro area, cannot be ruled out. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In this case, could Germany are still say that it have warned us. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> As the tricks of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will, a sanction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The supposedly of two players of the Real Madrid (xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) evidenced by the exclusion in the game of 23 November against the Ajax of the Champions League that caused much ink has been spilled on whether it is a unsportliche act or not and whether was possibly both players should be sanctioned by UEFA. </seg>
<seg id="4"> As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before spielende (your team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls, now so that the referee you the second yellow card. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way, and as the Real Madrid his group would, will be the two players in the next ligaspiel the prescribed sanction against the auxerre fulfil and so without cards in the next spielphase embarkation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Finally, the population of the UEFA disziplinarkommitee the coach of the clubs, José mourinho, with two play and the relevant players with different sums of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is so widespread that it forms part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in the sport - is our rules. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of the law debate about the case described, is due to the fact that a team of the club Real Madrid (which in its anthem edelmut and honour and on other occasions its players for similar incidents punished the major role played), and on the dramatisierung by mourinho, of an episode more to its long history as theatralischer and provocative technicians has added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case, is the debate about whether this does not expressly prohibited behaviour of the statutes is contrary to the principles of sport, that is to say whether these actions constitute a regelumgehung. Indeed, believes that this approach to the statutes of the sport, seem but whose sense. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this matter the damage caused to the sporting spirit should be investigated. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sporting spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that has been put at risk by these actions do not, because it was not a aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="13"> A further aspect of a clean game is to prevent the zuwiderhandelnden players an unjustified benefits from gegenteam. That did not happen either. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradox of the activity of players of the Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally under falschspiel or regelumgehung understand, because the circumvention of the rule was not taken place in secret, in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be so long as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players waited and took the sanction joyful. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is what kind of benefit the zuwiderhandelnden from the deliberate fouls. </seg>
<seg id="17"> It should be emphasised that the rival either in a disadvantageous position has brought benefits to the gespielte game were erheischt, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to play with less players. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because of the club does not then on these players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The advantage is that the players the next spielphase the Champions League without cards, which your participation in a future game, could threaten begin. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a long-term, up to a certain extent, uncertain advantage, because the team at some point could also retiring. Also receive the players with this approach a sanction and go in the second kartenzyklus on, in which you because kartenanhäufung with a card less than in the first cycle departure. </seg>
<seg id="21"> That means that it is not clear whether it is really a advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the sporting spirit, which also strategic decisions from the rules that will allow a maximum benefit. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case, wanted to circumvent the players are not a sanction (that is, indeed, a clear case of regelumgehung), they wanted more choice, when it is dealing with this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> You met a strategic decision, without a penalty or to flee to avoid before her. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Although the border between imagination and regelumgebung blurred is, I believe that this matter is a clear case of imagination. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because it was two selbstausschlüsse and because of the way the provoking regelübertragung. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The harm that the principles of sport has been done by these acts is less ethical rather than aesthetic nature. </seg>

<seg id="4"> After the expressed yesterday plan would the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes of (GT) of the result of the lighting of the earth cast, CFCs be avoided if the weißglühenden pears, which has a monopoly of 50 to 70% in the market, by fluoreszierende or, better still, by light-emitting diodes (led) were to be replaced. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This represents an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust emissions of world fleets. </seg>

<seg id="10"> With the kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, with the new LED bulbs reduced this energy demand once again in the double. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Keep the kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen, on average, between 6 000 by 10,000 hours. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The new LED bulbs, such as those of the manufacturers, Philips, this week has been put on the market - this society, incidentally, has participated in the UN - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a weißglühende pear, what a suggestion of the savings of the auswechselungsplanes, should be applied in 100 countries. </seg>

<seg id="16"> The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, not the kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal-fired power stations, the essential emit more mercury to of the weißglühenden pears wasted to generate electricity. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the United States alone, these are 25,000 tonnes of mercury from coal-fired power stations every year. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Rachsüchtige hackers and emsige spies </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The affaire Wikileaks has a twofold importance. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On one side, it has than obvious scandal arrangement, a scandal, the only a scandal in the sinner hypocrisy is the beziehunge between the States, the citizens and the press governed. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level, and gives us a taste of the future dominated by recession. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Let us get things in the right. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any of a secret service drafted acts (a mere nation) exclusively from zeitungsausschnitten. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary," American revelations about the sexual habits Berlusconi's are nothing more than what you in any case for months in any old Journal was to read (except for those whose owners Berlusconi is), and the frightening karikaturierte profile Gaddafi " s kabarettkünstlern already provided for a long time for their sketche substance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule that the secret dossiers only from already known news consist, is essential for the dynamism of the secret services, and not only this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go into a library, esotherischen publications, you will recognise that each work (on the grail, the mystery of rennes-le-chateau, the templer or the rosenkreuzler) exactly the repeated what was written already in previous works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This does not only, therefore, that the author occult texts to publish any research (yet, therefore, that he does not know where news about the nicht-existierende to), but because those who devote the okkultismus, to nothing other than the to believe what you already know and confirmed what you have already learned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the erfolgsmechanismus of Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Just as the secret files. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informer is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise what it could be, for example, editor in Libération), the only true considers what he recognises. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The top-secret information on Berlusconi, the American embassy in Rome, the staatsdezernat had sent, were the same as those who already Newsweek had published the week before. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> So why was such a fuss about the revelation of this dossier? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On one side is this what any educated person already know, that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the Heads of Government can call each other or a plane, to the dinner to meeting - have lost their diplomatic role, and, with the exception of some small repräsentationsaufgaben, have turned in spionagezentren. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Any old viewers of ermittlungsfilmen knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that acting to ignore this. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Nevertheless, the fact, to repeat it publicly violates the task of the hypocrisy and serves to American diplomacy in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In second place: the idea that a x-beliebiger hackers the geheimsten secrets of the most powerful country in the world can tap, brings with it the significant blow against the prestige of the staatsdezernats. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, the scandal less the victims, rather than the 'Executioner' is in trouble. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we have the profound nature of what has happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Formerly, to Orwell's time, it was all power as a big brother, the every gesture of his subjects controlled. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwell's prediction would have since then as absolutely right can highlight, where every movement thanks to the telephone calls can monitor any made transaction, the hotel, visited the elected motorway and so on; the citizens to the total victims would the eye of power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But if we, bearing in mind what is happening today, that even the secret krypten the power not more of the control of a hackers can escape the kontrollgang, it is said to be directed at, unilaterally and will zirkelförmig. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - acquired as vindicator of the citizen - can the secrets of power in experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> How can but a power that are no longer in a position to maintain their own secrets? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is true, Mr simmel has already said that a real secret an empty secret is (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's, in fact, a secret free of geheimis is, since it surrenders the public sphere; but, in the manner of WikiLeaks be disclosed that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to deprive them of any power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Wikileaks has neither Sarkozy still Merkel wrong, against it but Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What are the consequences of this violation, such a huge power has been done? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the States in future no reserved more online information - that would be a in the street corner angeklebten aushang. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is equally obvious that it with the current technologies in vain hope is, confidential reports on telephone able to keep secret. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a Head of State in a plane moved and one of his colleagues has contacted. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could in future private and only for certain ears certain relations are? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know very well that my forecast in the moment following science fiction and romanhaft sounds, but I am forced, me to present the regierungsagenten on secret way digging away to uncontrollable marschrouten moving, their communications than anywhere else in the mere memories tragend with it, and, moreover, the few written information, they have achieved, in the schuhabsatz verbergend. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information would be in one single copy in closed cannot be stored: in fact, had the spionageversuch of Watergate less success, as WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity to write that the technology today as a cancer is moving ahead, namely backwards. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A century after the wireless telegraf had revolutionized the communications, the Internet a telegrafen reconstructed with (telephone) wire. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Climate such as France his finanzversprechen amount: </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to compliance with the quickly resolved financing pledge (also 'almost start' or premature financing mentioned) to investigate the of the developing countries have been realised. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And are already the gross French vulnerable to blandishments exposed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries committed to $30 billion between 2010 and 2012. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The EU has EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France 1.26 billion promised (that is to say EUR 420 million per year). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On the occasion of the opening of the COP16 has the EU all its partners of the fact of their commitments regarding the fast-start-finanzierungen: detailgetreuer vorgehensbericht to convince the Member States to press conference, great nebenevents, broschürenverteilung. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The operation transparency is remarkable and extent of their actual value estimated: the developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries do the same for the same präzisionsniveau. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The EU, announced in the years 2010 to have released EUR 2.2 billion, what they are on the right road to respektbezollung their commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But if we look into the details, things are a little more complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should be according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new" and, in addition, in order to ensure that an additional use has been tabled, without, at the expense of public aid for development. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what 'new and additional' means. </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the European Commission had proposed a harmonisation, have certain Member States, including France, the procedure is being blocked. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today everyone chooses the benchmark that he considers as best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The European Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those of 2009: the international financing, for their attacks are maintained, and is within the framework of funding 'fast-start "150 million over three years. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries have similar indicative values, either as regards year or concerning conditions at the level of public development aid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> On the other hand, France was of the opinion that the financing 'of all new projects' of the year 2010 "are new, and in addition '. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In other words, there is no indicative values in the expenditure of the previous year or at a global level of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Specifically, the total amount of the French support of the developing countries remain stable (or decline) - France is, his commitment to the "new and additional 'funding. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is still no rule, and everyone chooses its rechenmodus. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, such as, for example, France, are 1 borrowed €as being equivalent to 1 donated €. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This is apparently only difficult acceptable that the effort is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loans for certain profitable investment (and often to the emissionseindämmung tied projects to be based actually technology) cannot be justified, it is illusory to present the euro, known as the equivalent of a donated euro captured... should also only the cost of the loan for the kapitalgeberland as a commitment to be counted (that is the equivalent of the interest rate). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France has nothing else in the sense as the following consideration: it 'respect' his commitment of EUR 420 million by 91,5% loans (389,8 million euro) and 8.5% donates) 36,1 million euro) - see the EU documents, in order to convince themselves. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only country in the EU that loans to a great extent. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany is calling for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands, or Slovakia (among other things) their commitments to 100% with donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In other words, if the vast majority of European Union 1 €to fulfil their obligations, France spends just 10 cents and understands including a comparable efforts. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Fine hocus-pocus! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> All in all, France in its fast-start-finanzierung operates with a double fraud: a part with a weiterentwicklkung of action over time, and, on the other part with the reality of the financial commitment. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France manage it, believe that it 420 million "new and additional" million in accordance with its promise has spent, and it saves it 36,1 million euro. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the Finance Ministry (as it appears that it was Bercy, of the arbitrage has carried out a double) could lead to negative effect; even internally (why the other Member States with the donations, but if there is enough to lend?), and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries is not completely misled... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter of the premature finance only a small issue in a relatively short time in comparison with the entirety of discussions on the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it could the drop of too much in the huge machinery of the UNFCCC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> We hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As it always was, it is essential to its lesson from this first year of premature funding to learn. </seg>
<seg id="36"> First and foremost, France could a change in its verbuchungsart for the years 2011 and 2012, and to do so in a spirit of respect for its commitments and of the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Above all, however, France could the discussions on the subject of a dispute of the long-term financing forward (another, decisive and now discussed subject): you can escape the question of the 'verrechenbarkeit' or the verbuchungsart its loans not. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could change its position as progressive as regards the issues to be, as it is for other things. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The hope is based, therefore, on the new environment minister Kosciusko-Morizet, the next week in Cancun will arrive. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A surprising announcement on the fast-start of France and its vision of the "verrechenbarkeit ', and of the use of loans would the international nature, to raise the necessary basis for further discussions. </seg>
