<seg id="1"> What it should do, the čssd? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither voldemort, nor the "konditorei." </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new ratsherren the capital from the ranks of the čssd will obviously certain barriers have to overcome their alt-neuen colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and the stadtvertretung able to understand at all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The newspaper aktuálně.cz, members of the new Council from the čssd time "a little abgeklopft," as the notorious slang dominate, which in the past few years has established, in which the current coalition partner in Prague were at the helm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The codierte wortschatz in the verflossenen era of Mayor Pavel bém political elite was introduced by the Prague is some of the best known players, situations and causae entlehnt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Surprisingly showed that the new councils in relation to these new concepts of something in the dark. </seg>
<seg id="6"> They say that at least. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Who is voldemort?" </seg>
<seg id="8"> "No idea." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am more of a neuling responded in the Prague Policy," lukáš kaucký, the new ratsherr on Culture, "to the test of the paten-wortschatzes." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But also the ratsherr Karel březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar way. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example to the concept of "golfloch." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "This is the only expression of which I present here that I use now and again." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Otherwise, I do not think much of slang." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> From the wortschatz the tageblatt aktuálně.cz in this year's June before the wahlkongress had published the ODS, pickte the redaktion out six terms, especially those who are notoriously with the Prague magistrat are linked. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Social Democrats, the concepts of "voldemort," "the greatest Prague golfloch," "in the konditorei go," "stiernacken," "define" and "verblechen" betrayal of the capital. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Three Prague ratsherren voted to the test, the fourth - Mr weinert, the future head of Prague schulwesens - promised first of its participation in the conversation, then took the but not the time hörer from. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The fifth ratsherr, Petr dolínek, rejected the test from the outset. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "These things are no matter to me and how the Civic Democrats to talk to each other, I do not make about it." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "What is important to me, as we understand within the framework of our programmes," he countered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> As has been suggested, would have lukáš kaucký allegedly in the abovementioned headline not recognised that entrepreneurs from the influential and friend of the ex-oberbürgermeisters bém, Roman janoušek is said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The term "voldemort" says kaucky nothing AND THE ONLY concept he correctly in the test erriet, was "the greatest Prague golfloch." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "This is the tunnel blanka," says kaucký, added to safety, but added: "But I know that more from the newspaper." </seg>
<seg id="23"> And jokingly: "I will be a sprachkurs must show." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The "golfloch" will then not only by matador Karel březina, but also by the ratsherrn on the environment lukáš plachý right as a tunnel blanka entziffert. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> But both Social Democrats know for whom the term voldemort, and is lukáš plachý even knows where to find this figure, and this is what it means," in the konditorei to go." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "I believe, that is to say, in any Prague gastronomiebetrieb to go," is plachý quite close to the rätsels solution, if you know that it is the seat of janoušeks firms is concerned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> In line with březina but he claimed to have this knowledge more as a result of the newspaper, as that him this wortschatz would be adopted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The testteilnehmern suggest that, it seems under the Social Democrats, in fact, no similar eingebürgerten slang to give in. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I have asked my colleagues, but obviously there is such a thing really not with us." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "We call on the name, from time to time we use words or spitznamen," says the chairman of the Prague čssd Petr hulínský - from his parteigenossen casual called "hulda." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "I was in the school bříza - birke - mentioned, but I do not know whether my colleagues call me," tells us Karel březina his spitznamen. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The newspaper deník aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see there, he works. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Ratsherr weinert is for the parteigenossen kind of "opa" or less kind of "old," the representative of Mirek poche before the elections by activity in the partei-sponsoring on pointed out, will "by some Members igráček '- known Czech lego-figur - mentioned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Spitznamen are so the only thing that the Social Democrats in whose allow use of language. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1"> The right matratze and the right bettenrost? women than men have other wish </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Not the tollste bettrahmen, but the quality of the liegefläche - matratze and rost make up the good bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This, however, must add harmoniously in order to live up to the wishes of the specific user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Many things play a role in the selection process, the weight of the size of the health and, not least, the sex of the schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Just as important is also the interieur in which matratze and rost to have. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a wochenendhaus, which will not be heated regularly are latexmatratzen not good, as they need much longer in order "to be warm." </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethan-matratzen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And, they should be changed regularly. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If they are not enough entlüftungskanälchen in essence and to lie on a firm plate, staut in moisture, so it is not excluded that is built on it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the election plays a role of course, to what it is used. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Anyone who has been in a long time abroad, where very high matratzen with weichschicht are common, will be difficult to a low matratze can be used with hard surface. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "Probably all eishockeyspieler from the nhl have returned, have complained to me that they cannot sleep more right here." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "for their abgeschundenen shoulders, fersen and hüften they just need a weichschicht from visco-schaum - memory foam - a formgedächtnis-polymer -." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I recommend that among other things, diabetics people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so they have the" information "from the gelenken and skin can receive a bad thing," says Sylva hadamcziková to polstermöbel specific. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> That is why I have been to many years ago eishockeyspielern, but also other customers this matratzen with visco-schaum - memory foam - worried. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Today, it is no longer a problem, because such matratzen offer including the manufacturers tempur, the Italian company magniflex or the Czech producers tropico." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And we must not necessarily be a famous eishockeyspieler to the benefits of the visco-schaums estimate to learn. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" works really quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The foam optimalisiert its severity and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, he schmiegt there is a real the warm body. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is nowhere in the night shifts are not around as after a major fight. </seg>
<seg id="22"> We sleep simply much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The viskoelastische foam also provides protection against dekubitus - wundbrand -. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In the election of the matratzengröße should still be at the height of the length of the fußsohlen hinzurechnen, about 21 cm to 34. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Man as Mrs, which are the 180 cm high, need a 210 to 220 cm long bed. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Each of the schläfer should at least 90 cm liegebreite available, together so 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In einzelbetten, for example, in singles, 120 to 140 cm are appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The komforts to be half and also for any visitors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise, the following faustregel lies on the backs of the bettbreite ideals," If you should still be enough room for the easy angewinkelten be poor," advises ing. helena prokopová, the zunftmeisterin the polsterer and raumausstatter, which has been for years the problems of common schlafes and the ergonomie devotes furniture and this issue was also at the university. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> In a doppelbett needs each with its own rost and his own matratze, but be careful the purchase, so that the matratzen are high in a moment. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise, do nothing other than the roste to fit in a different level and that is not a long time ago with each bettrahmen possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, matratzen with federskelett 15 cm, it should have at least three centimeters on the formschicht and the feinpolster disappear. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "With the hand or to sit down the feathers in no case can be felt," warns helena prokopová. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Any matratze makes a special rosttyp required. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Ganzgepolsterte beds with matratze and documents as zusammengewachsene siamzwillinge have no place in the bedroom. </seg>
<seg id="36"> This matratzen cannot to reveal and the relation cannot be washing what is already started today and were. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And as you in a single night between 0.2 and 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the matratze slowly after five to seven years to a huge - and congested colander -. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Are therefore experts werbeslogans from in matratzen a lifespan of up to 25 years, even life guarantee promise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Every thing has its if and but. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And that is why a practical advice from the dealers: in matratzen of 120 or 140 cm wide should be the hygiene of waschbaren, abziehbaren salary not shy away from, nonetheless, it is recommended that a matratzenschoner to use that you can easily withdraw and wash. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even if today in the rule matratzenbezüge with rundumreißverschluss are produced, so you get two halves after the open - immensely important for the waschvorgang and the waschmaschinengröße! - is the manipulation with greater matratzen alone said, in particular, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> They have in bed instead of a rostes a firm plate? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Out of it. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or at most for a bed for Cinderella guests and for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> So should they prefer the plate with lüftungslöchern oversight - if already are not in it - and matratzen with federskelett and 15 cm minimum allocation with sog. taschenfederkern and feinpolster use. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethan-matratzen do not belong to such a documents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For not verstellbare lattenroste with 14 to 18 federleisten - lamellen - are latex- or sandwichmatratzen suited - perhaps also combinations of latex and kokos - is always pay roste with a greater lattenanzahl, 28, and more federleisten, with lordosenstütze in lendenwirbelbereich, and the possibility of the lattenhärte to regulate. </seg>
<seg id="48"> On verstellbare lamellenroste are not matratzen with federskelett, because they do not respond to the ergonomische verstellung respond. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> In addition to the stiff attitude of the federleisten will also be specific flexible schultermodule required. </seg>
<seg id="50"> We are talking about a specific Gaza of the federleisten, which will make it possible to implement the federleisten einzudrücken or even to verwinkeln that the specific einsinken shoulder the schläfers possible. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Especially for men with broad shoulders of an important matter. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There is even matratzenhersteller which have started," herrenmatratzen "weichzonen for the schulterbereich to use. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Also is thought to the ladies - you gönnt you this weichzonen in the hüftgegend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For demanding customers are punktelastische flügelfedersysteme - lattoflex - or roste with punktelastischen kontakt-pads with sog. multitorsionsfederung determined. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure will be distributed on a number of points, which reduced the tension. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But, if you have the right matratze and right rost a bad - too much and fülliges - kopfkissen used to go again lost most of the benefits. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Here, too, faustregel: the kopfkissen should support the head of its leaders should only to the rich shoulders, so that the schultermuskeln can relax. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Ideal is therefore a 50 x 60 cm great kissen How, for example, it may be the Scandinavians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In the seitenlage should the kopfkissen - together with the schulterentlastungszone in rost or the weichzone in the matratze - the schulterhöhe balance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Have something our modern matratzen have with the former - with Hay so - strohsäcken but in common. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern producers increasingly use natural materials, or at least the mixtures. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Also in matratzen is the new magic formula "organic." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of erdölrohstoffen be used to produce polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturelle oils, for example, rizinus- and sojaöl. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soya is likely to be used by all known manufacturers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> "Organic means in matratzen that their core from materials is purely natural origin," said Petr vašíček of the company tropico plus. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Naturstoffe but also in the production of matratzenbezügen used, one of the first was in the process of aloe Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> But it can also mikrokapseln introduction of the sleep fresh wald- or lavendelduft spread. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Here, too, there is a difference between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="69"> During a "kühlender" in the men pflanzenextrakt from birkenblättern is used, so that the matratzenbezug can absorb the heat and cooling the body, the salary for women "wärmende" effect. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Extrakte from red paprikaschoten stimulate the blutzirkulation to the weaker sex, so the sleep wohlig warm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> And the favoriten today? </seg>
<seg id="72"> Matratzen from kaltschaum - he has more poren with devastated zellstruktur and is therefore atmungsaktiver as a standard polyurethan and much more flexible -. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Through the combination of various stiff - tough - of kaltschäumen and visco-schäumen arise mehr-zonen-matratzen who know exactly where head, hip and fersen are. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> For a quality matratze but it has 7000 kronor and more to berappen. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Gesundheitsmatratzen but usually are burdened with lower VAT, as they apply as medical tools. </seg>
<seg id="76"> The first Czech companies have been gumotex given this advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> You see in the matratze and on rost is not so easy to save. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Now and again, there are sonderangebote of producers and traders, the two matratzen offer for the price of one. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The magniflex brand offers the matratze duofreeze with in terms of verstepptem visco-schaum memory for 11.990 czk. </seg>
<seg id="80"> The second will be free to do so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the material tempur the era of the viskoelastischen schaumstoffe with open zellstruktur and high density in almost kosmischem launched pace. </seg>
<seg id="82"> No surprise, they were developed but for the NASA, because the astronauts are huge in the launch überbelastungen suspended. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83"> Tempur is soft, with heat in a cool setting it strengthens again. </seg>
<seg id="84"> So it is perfect to the human body, and distributed in the best possible manner körperdruck. </seg>
<seg id="85"> It is therefore not only ideal to prevent druckbrand, but generally increase the schlafkomfort. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86"> Viskoelastische schaumstoffe but not only in matratzen, but also in other gesundheitsprodukten, such as, for example, in particular fußpolstern used to give the legs and the gefäßen relief. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Local manufacturers use, for example, the schaumstoffe eucatherm C, twinsaver or similar products. </seg>

<seg id="2"> The Czech army has 445 kilometres zündschnüre shopped, with sprengsätze catch. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the year before, the Defense Ministry has already been 224 km zündschnur to the armeelager supplied. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is already reassuring to know that the Armed Forces for 225 years ausgesorgt. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The problem is only the span of zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The army bought the zündschnüre by the company stv group, a. s. for läppische 40 million kronor. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In his justification for the procurement of this huge amount zündschnur said the General Staff issued mf dnes, the soldiers would annually to the 60 kilometres zündschnur use. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The research of armeepyrotechnikern according to mf dnes raised point is clear from this indication that the whole army would have to be an extremely intense pyrotechnic training every year, of all the generals and officers of the armeekommandos, right up to the secretaries and putzfrauen. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Defense Minister alexandr Vondra and army general vlastimil picek not excluded. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Only in this way could be the significant annual consumption of 60 kilometres zündschnüren reasonably justified. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This length calls for 25,000 detonationen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> But this would armeebestände rich for more than 10 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But if the old rule of experts is that the training of each new military professionals two metres zündschnur quite sufficient, then the Army through the neueinkäufe, also from the point of view of the increased needs of the pionier- and special units - created a reassuring stock for the 225 years already mentioned. </seg>

<seg id="21"> "with perfect storage are probably the four years mentioned possible," one of them, but ungenannt wants to remain in order not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the end of the gebrauchsdauer any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But these tests are not in vain, but cost more money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Another argument of the defense department is the mengenrabatt for the 445 kilometres zündschnur. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "It cost us sixty percent less than the last year's supply of 244 kilometres," tells us spokesman pejšek the position of the einkäufer with the Defense Department. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Only for comparison, the annual consumption of zündschnüren of the police, the ammunition in the Second World War pyrotechnikern or withdraw the Soviet bruderarmee, exceeds hardly 1,500 metres for quite a few years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Appointed and the police are only such quantities of these weapons, which it before the end of the gebrauchsdauer can use. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The security of the pyrotechniker because of, there is also the possibility to flexible purchases more advanced and therefore reliable zündschnüre open. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The Defense Ministry has already huge problems in the liquidation tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw treaty, when the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak People's Army prepared to their campaign on the Rhine. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence on a secret nuclear programme in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But the country refuses to comment on that, nor does it controls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Against midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli f-15 I fighter planes a mysteriöses, würfelförmiges buildings in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is on the shores lie of the Euphrates; the next major city, 30 miles away, is dair as-saur. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Your name, in Documents to the International Atomic Energy Agency - IAEA - on Syria, when it comes to the reactor, allegedly with help from North Korea in the quader has built, hiding in a valley of the electricity does not have. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing by the us-auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA by the end of April 2008 would be under the name of the Middle ortschaft el-kibar geläufige reactor has been well suited to produce plutonium - from the left to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes, is hardly the technology from the fifties. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA conducted a videopräsentation before with unscharfen satellitenbildern. </seg>
<seg id="10"> By computeranimation blendete where they should have been before the destruction of the components of the reactor, which fell a copy of North Korean model from the atomzentrum yongbyon was. </seg>
<seg id="11"> They also presented photos, the show from the vicinity of the building or even the innenraum. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor had been just before the opening, it said, but not yet with brennstäben dispense have been. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more aware than at the time, the mystery has been increasing rather with time. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The former US President George W. Bush has recently in his memoirs, reveals that the CIA before the attack was quite sure that Syria is in el-kibar built a reactor, but hardly saw evidence that it was "an active's nuclear weapons programme" in the country. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some geheimdienstler in Europe are there to even more cautious and speak only of a "alleged reactor," even if the cia-präsentation keep for "plausible." </seg>
<seg id="16"> They lack of hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Asked how he is sure to have a reactor ahead, said a high un-diplomat only briefly in the summer, the IAEA have "enough material to questions to ask." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The rubble of the alleged "unused militärgebäudes created" the Syrians hastily to one side and planierten thoroughly the site. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, took place in June 2008 iaea-team under the former chief inspector Olli heinonen in el-kibar traces of uranium, which was made by people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Also received a Member State of the IAEA satellite commercial providers from the time immediately after the attack, which should be stronger than that presented by the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, not to get these recordings on the market, because of the unknown principals - perhaps Israel - exclusively bought it. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Therefore the IAEA can verify their authenticity is not independent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always claimed that never conducted a secret nuclear program or to have built a reactor. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium come by the Israeli weapons, said Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But the, the IAEA after the analysis of the particles as unlikely back. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it, as well as on the satellite. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the ashes of the zerbombten building. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But Israel is staunchly silent. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We will never comment on this," recently reaffirmed the official position of acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the time of the attack. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> So schleppt the investigation of the case since June 2008 without result out and "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority," such as allowing a high Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, after all, is a serious violation of the NPT in the room watching on the IAEA. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As the key to progress in the information, the IAEA apparently three more bodies, the "need to be in functional link" with the alleged reactor - and in a different way than this still exist. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In this context, the inspectors have so far not disclosed to the facilities it is, or what role they have or what they can appear suspicious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to information provided by the süddeutschen newspaper, they will be in the IAEA internally as marj as-sultan, masyaf and iskandariayah described, in turn, derived from nearby cities. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington - isis - has identified these places and on satellitenbildern a gebäudekomplex in masyaf located in which it is probably one of the suspicious objects. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It is probably in or directly, in addition to a base - just with this statement denied Syria the IAEA access to the three places. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians were a fishing expedition - that the IAEA by the United States vorgeschickt will to militäranlagen auszuspähen. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Because the nukleardetektive were by a tipp the us-geheimdienste become aware of the institutions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has evidence, including satellitenfotos that between the three places and the quader lie on the Euphrates material has been moved back. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the sites could "in connection with the brennstoffproduktion are." </seg>
<seg id="40"> But there is "no evidence of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes, which are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The reaktortyp will be operated with uranium, which is not enriched. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But where the uranium should have come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated, to this central issues, there are at most plausible suspicions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> What is also unclear is whether pieces of debris, the valuable traces mountains could have been stored in the three places. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As if the hundreds of lastwagenladungen disappeared from the ground, nobody wants to have information on where the rubble has remained. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Only a few kilometres from el-kibar, on the other hand, lie of the Euphrates, salzmine al-tibni that Syria has investigated their competence in 1998 as a camp for radioactive waste, the IAEA as is unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The former iaea-inspektor Robert kelley it had in a recent analysis of satellitenbildern for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review brought in connection with the reactor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Recordings from the orbit show, however, that Syria places in the three suspects erdarbeiten undertaking and remote large container after the IAEA had requested access. </seg>
<seg id="48"> This can be a coincidence, but has done little to dispel the suspicions. </seg>
<seg id="49"> It is also in diplomatenkreisen, the IAEA have spent many months to develop a plan for inspections there that should allow it to Syria any militärgeheimnisse to maintain - alone the tape shows how big is the interest of the inspectors. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte from this proposal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Western diplomats in Vienna had contained a year ago that the reactor is destroyed, so the matter does not have a high level of urgency, brings about us-botschafter Glyn Davies since a few months' sonder-inspektionen into play, one of the harshest means that the Vienna atombehörde to enforce controls. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Iaea-chef yukiya amano of these inspections should propose an option of "has already spoken for which I am open in the future," but he does. </seg>
<seg id="53"> There is a high risk in this way: on the one it needs for a majority in the gouverneursrat of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented there are eager to anything other than an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other hand, as a diplomat to are concerns: "What if they find nothing at the end?" </seg>

<seg id="2"> The democracy in Latin America will be stronger as the support of private companies. </seg>

<seg id="4"> In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="5"> These results, the latinobarómetro-umfrage carried out in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Fall two facts in this year's survey in September and October, particularly in's eye. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Firstly, the good mood in Latin America </seg>
<seg id="9"> And, secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In many countries of the South American pazifikküste has greatly increased the Democratic Movement - Table 1 - S.. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In Peru, for example, where the economy growing at about 6% every year since 2002, the number of demokratiebefürworter of 40% in the year 2005 to 61% this year. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In Mexico, where the economy recovered since the sharp fall in the last year, is such a trend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries of the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average - S. diagramm 2 -. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some 44% of the respondents said that they be satisfied with the democratic practice in their own country. These are much like last year, but 25% more than in the year 2001 - diagramm 3 -. </seg>
<seg id="15"> About 34% of their country's confidence of the Congress and 45% of their government. Both figures are those of last year, but a sharp increase from 2003 show - 17% and 24% -. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> A decade ago undermined Latin America's economic crisis the efforts to achieve more democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> That lasted this during the Great Depression, possibly because the countries of Latin America is only a brief rezessionsphase experienced and recover quickly. </seg>

<seg id="21"> Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread fortschrittsdenken. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more felt and heinous crimes have increased, this is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Only the second time since umfragebeginn see many asked in Latin America in the crime in their country to have a bigger problem than in the unemployment - S. diagramm 5 -. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Some 31% say that either they themselves or a family member last year have been victims of a crime. but dropped to 38% in the last year, the values and consequently achieve the lowest level since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The increase in economic performance is reflected in the Greater support of the private and the market economy: around 71% of the respondents überregional said that the private sector is vital for the development in the year 2007, there were 56% - S. diagramm 6 -. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Some 58% said that only can bring their country progress to the market economy, compared with 47% in the last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view - and 80% for a private sector -, even though their left President, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private companies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil has according to 19% of the respondents - 18% last year - the greatest weight in the region, followed by the United States - 9%, unchanged since last year - and Venezuela - 9% compared with 11% in the last year -. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The respondents in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, and this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua will be followed by Venezuela. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Arsen-resistente mikrobe could enable new forms of life on the Earth or elsewhere </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The discovery of a foreign bakterienart, including the arsenic can live opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on the Earth and elsewhere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Although scientists this unusual bakterium discovered here in the world, it is their view, a sign that a life without the elements deemed vital to date is possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "This body has two options." </seg>
<seg id="5"> "He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "This makes it to something very special, although it almost a kind of 'alien' is a way of life," said Paul c.w. Davies, based of Arizona State University and co-autor of the report, which appears on Thursday in online-ausgabe the magazine Science. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> So far, six main elements were regarded as vital - carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> But, as the researchers herausfanden, increasing the bakterium in California mono lake then even further, if It has replaced by arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "Because one cannot help but wonder what else is still possible," said the co-autor Ariel's report that anbar based of Arizona State University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is an important step in the search for außerirdischem life because scientists need to live and see its forms, anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study is concerned with microbes that were found on the earth. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The announcement in a press conference that no details were announced the discovery, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report by the discovery außerirdischen life could act. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "shows that in other planetensystemen organisms can set in motion with the help of other elements of biochemical processes, and that the 'standardelemente' which, in our opinion, are absolutely vital, are not necessarily firmly set," said Charles cockell, professor at the planetary and space sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockel was not part of the teams of researchers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "This work is something new, because it shows that an element in basic biochemical processes and structures can be replaced by another," added cockell added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> This discovery was not accidental. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Felisa wolfe-simon from astrobiologischen NASA Institute, who led the study, chose the mono lake because of the high arsengehalts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> As arsenic and phosphorus chemical same, they are exposed to that microbes that both may be able to replace an element by the other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "The giftigkeit of the arsens is above all to the fact that it is chemically similar as phosphorus." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "It is the organisms difficult to distinguish an element from the other." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "But the difference is so great that arsenic is different than phosphorus. It comes in the biochemisches system where it almost everything verschmiert," said anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers, the bakterium gfaj-1 a rising arsenkonzentration. It fit in and grew. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The mikrobe is growing phosphorus better, but that they can survive in the arsenic, shows that a arsen-basierte way of life, of course, can happen, either on the earth or on another planet or moon, on the arsenic happens more often. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> According to Jamie S. Foster, dozentin for mikrobiologie at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new. But so far, there was still no functioning example. </seg>

<seg id="5"> On Thursday will be the process closely followed by Steven J. hayes, was accused of three members of a family cheshire, connecticut, to have killed a formal end to find if the richterspruch falls on the death sentence, the jury has spoken,. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But Mr hayes lawyers have already submitted requests in court to explain the reasons for appeal and will employ the courts for years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> One of the provozierendsten reasons is that it by the intensive coverage of the process, by the extensive use of Twitter by durchschnittsreporter - a "zirkusatmosphäre" and a penetration to become so widespread aufrührerischer details had come, so that the jury had been influenced by the public indignation in an improper way. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This could appeal the appelationsgerichte lead to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules to be necessary in the court. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "As I have seen it during this process, I believe that it is really a threat if the entry of new technologies in the court, the right of each affected to a fair trial," said Thomas J. ullman, Mr hayes hauptverteidiger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The presiding judge, jon C. blue by the Supreme kammergericht, warned last week of the requests by entscheid back In summary, when he said that the new media "would be" carefully controlled, and that there is no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But that was certainly not the last word in this matter. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For decades, have gerichtseinsprüche noted that the reporting on famous cases can raise doubts about the fairness of a process. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In its historic decision of 1966, the verdict of the Supreme Court of the United States against Dr. Sam sheppard, a osteopathen from cleveland, is alleged to have killed his wife, lifted and said in his decision that it would have been a "karnevalsatmosphäre in the court" because of new media. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some people believe that the fernsehserie and the spielfilm "on the run" based on this crime. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "There is a good reason on the influence of the new media in trials, which will be followed by a wide public to be worried," said John J. donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School, who has investigated the death penalty in connecticut. According to his report, it will arbitrarily imposed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor donohue said, some appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction issued a prompt communication from the Court could make the fair trials. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The twitter-angelegenheit is only one of many of the lawyers of Mr hayes explain, in order to discuss for years and thus delaying a condemnation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defenders say, for example, that Mr hayes could have already been regarded with hostility under any circumstances, as Blue judges had not allowed them, the reactions of potential juroren to test by making them during the jurorenauswahl grausige tatortfotos showed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some of the juroren have said that photos of the victims, jennifer hawke-petit, 48 years, and their tüchter, hayley, 17 years, and michaela, 11 years, they should have met with disgust. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defenders say that they would verfassungsmäßigkeit Constitution of the death penalty in question, and argue that the judge mistakenly a juror have exchanged views, which would have been a critic of the prosecutor, and that it had improperly exerted pressure on the ruling when he had made the unusual decision to ask the jury of free over the weekend. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The juroren were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But their arguments on the influence of the extensive reporting on the process is perhaps the greatest interest. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In a urteilsanfechtung, they have submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in connecticut and during the election campaign for the post of governor and was discussed by the candidate for the US Senate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They argued that the new media constantly had reopened the flames of the emotions on the case. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "Such a daily andrang the medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the gerichtssaals," the lawyers wrote, "we previously has still not yet seen in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Its focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In interviews, some of the Journalists said that the claim that this direct news are aufwieglerischer as reports of the slow be reimbursed, a technikfeindlicher is a view that the reporting about future trials verarme. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> But some lawyers said that appelationsgerichte would often faced with the argument, social and technical change need the adaptation through the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr hayers lawyers reinforce this claim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Referred in their objection to the decision of the Supreme Court, 1966, in which the condemnation of Dr sheppard was lifted because of the reporting and made it clear that the New rules require new media. </seg>

<seg id="4"> The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress, no breakthrough in the big issues, with the one during the sog. "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a regierungsperiode, in which no more decisions are taken, had to employ. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After all what you hear, it was not a polite debate between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan punktesammelns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meeting of the defizitkommission of the President on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences between the members continue to exist. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months, can give a mutual respect of the ideological divide, which continue to separating the members of concealment. </seg>

<seg id="10"> Therefore the meeting on Tuesday were itself and its assessment limited to a minimum of demands or accusations by the participants. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to be a rapid change in the atmosphere, which has dominated in the last two years, could expect. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Regardless of whether it to donate taxes, health or anwartschaften is concerned, the two sides are miles away from each other. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Finally, the novemberwahl Washington at least for a short time voted mild. </seg>

<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way to receive some or all, whether it is now temporarily or permanently. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will lead to this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> The public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It has been proven that, despite the bias of the current election, the majority of Americans still wishes that the two parties to work together. </seg>

<seg id="40"> Who is always destined to lose, will have to change the course and seek the compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> In fact, it may be an optimistic view. </seg>

<seg id="43"> At the same time, the activists from both parties see 2010 as a prelude to consequence for a much wider choice in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> May be seen as the courtesy of this week to display will be welcomed by many Americans. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Belarus is in agreement with this, not further waffenfähiges uranium anzusammeln </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide, the Government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The deal was in a joint statement after a meeting of the Foreign Minister Hillary rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei martynov in an additional article of the sicherheitsgipfels made known. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The US government had tried for years to persuade Belarus, not more highly enriched uranium to collect and seemed to have achieved a hurdle last spring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But the US administration official told the Washington Post that in the last two months, two geheimabkommen with Belarus have been taken to 187 pounds waffenfähiges uranium from a Belarusian forschungsanstalt to remove. </seg>
<seg id="6"> That was the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material, according to an official staff, about 500 pounds to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The agreement is one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear sicherheitsgipfel Of the 47 nations" from April, the Belarus had ruled out. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And it was obvious good enough to the invitation of the former Soviet republic to ensure the next summit of 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I was really excited by the fact that they have a seat in the nuclear sicherheitsgipfel - from 2012 - like." </seg>
<seg id="10"> "This shows me that it works," said Ken luongo, President of the partnership of global security, a group for the promotion of nuclear safety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Clinton called the agreement "a very significant and important step" of Belarus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Obama promised in Prague in April 2009, within a period of four years to ensure all vulnerable nuclear material. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of their highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Belarus will be the seventh. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At the time of Obama's nuclear sicherheitsgipfel Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never abandon its uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "How to keep high enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos What is fundamentally waffenfähig, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "This is our resource... we will not make it dirty bombs and we will not sell it." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We use it exclusively for research purposes, that is all." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Belarus approached yet a few months ago the United States, as it a agreement's interest in the meeting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The first attempt to remove the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly difficult because the material easy contaminated by radiation was, official says. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It was in a spezialzug load, the more than 1,500 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, official says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the official by plane. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The US government pays $14 million for this effort, with a large part of the money in the Belarussian research flows with depleted uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "This coordinated and was extremely careful" to build confidence, that led to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew bieniawski, a representative of the energieministeriums that in the global gefahrenreduzierung works. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The Centre for the James Martin nichtweiterzugebende studies estimates that Belarus at least 88 pounds in this year waffenfähhigen uranium had and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Belarus wants to dissolve his camp by 2012, according to the common agreement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, first of all because of lukashenkos harsh abuse of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But the statement from Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> "Welcome the progress of this global security issues heißend, to give the United States of America and Belarus announced that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus is a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," it said. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Investors reacted strongly yesterday on the threat of the ECB President Trichet, warned that "the markets should our reaktionsvermögen not underestimate." </seg>
<seg id="3"> The risk premia of the euro-peripheriländer have increased dramatically and by more than 5% of the shares of European banks. </seg>
<seg id="4"> We should, however, can deceive the possibility that the ECB, the euro has appreciated in little points, not underestimate what led to concern. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, to the extent that he collapses in recovered again, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The institutional investors will not lose its fear for a long time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> A month ago today the European Central Bank asked us to our liquiditätmsaßnahmen to reverse that the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably has to make a number of times in the future, taking a step backwards. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The Bundesbank asked the beendung of the plan to buy sovereign debt, as they are ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquiditätsmaßnahmen. It should only be a einwöchiger permanent access should be maintained. </seg>
<seg id="9"> After the irland-krise, we expect that the current liquiditätsmaßnahmen "at least until March" extended and the quarterly contracts with unlimited access to the quartalsende to ensure liquidity be maintained until at least June. </seg>
<seg id="10"> We also expect that the programme to buy securities continued and a stärkendes signal will spend. </seg>

<seg id="12"> As well as in the ezb-sitzung in May, in which the bank confirmed, the purchase of staatschuldpapieren does not need to be considered and then collapsed the markets, it could repeat history tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The ECB must be credible and persistent. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In May, they showed the teeth and on Wednesday said they have already bought a lot, and they provoked a new collapse of the market. </seg>

<seg id="19"> The sum is to about 10, 000 million in the short term and possible further estimated 15 000. There is time to February to obtain private capital or these banks are nationalized. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Although Ireland has totally lost its credibility after it had not identified the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures are within the framework of the rettungsplans acceptable and help to reduce the uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, the government must receive the parliamentary approval of his new budget next Tuesday. as it is still does not have the sufficient support Ireland remains a source of uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Angela Merkel has its discourse with regard to the Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December designed moderate. There political unity is asked to show that we are together the same partitur play. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries of the ninth sinfonie Beethoven's. </seg>

<seg id="25"> Reform, transparency in the autonomous regions, such as in the financial institutions, reducing the deficit, liberalization, privatization and arbeitsbeschaffungsmaßnahmen. The measures in the ears of the investors such as vivaldis sound four seasons. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The doppeleffekt Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In comparison with the February was the reaction of the government and the Spanish Central Bank quickly and convincingly, and we will benefit from the überraschungseffekt. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Today there is a crucial auction of a three years staatsanleihe the benefits from the trichet-effekt will draw. Therefore, we are a strong demand, the doubts about all of our umschuldungsfähigkeit will eliminate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> For Spain would be the request for a hilfsplans a selbstaufopferung. </seg>
<seg id="30"> We would receive liquidity, which we do not need. The Treasury has available to 40 billion euros, three times as much as in March. The terminate interest rates are very expensive and would have access to the markets without any notice closed. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Zapatero and the red line of Germany </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin has for the beibehalt decided of the euro, but at the same time to set conditions for the whole of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tension in the markets have triggered a double response of the government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero presented new adaptation measures, starting with steuerermäßigungen for small and micro, the regulation of zeitarbeitsunternehmen or the lifting of the 426 euro support for the unemployed, take the no arbeitslosengeld, through to the privatisation of 49% of aena, the management of airports barajas and El prat and 30% of the state lottery. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, supports the Deputy regierungschefin, Mrs salgado, with the help of the former regierungspräsidenten Felipe González criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis herausbeschwört have. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How are these transactions to understand? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their relations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is Germany a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future, which is at odds with the maintenance of the old traditions of most of its partners. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In the face of opposition in Europe it begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis spekuliern. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro area. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The second: the reintroduction of the German mark, although this sounds currently more according to science fiction, supported by a majority of public opinion, around 50 percent of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The third: a transformation of the euro under German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict management; punishment of the countries that the cross targets; möglichereweise the zahlungseinstellung some countries and the extension of the costs of potential measures on the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is clear and is already on for some time. Therefore, there is no excuses now. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First in 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission incentives for deficits were a constitutional reform and the German government come up with, in order to prevent this from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It was the first signs of the auseinanderdriften between what Germany is necessary - Strict steuerpläne and stable public finances - and the practices of its European partners, including France. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second sign, the Central European country, as Merkel to rescue the decision of Greece painful hinausschob. </seg>
<seg id="18"> At the time it was heavily criticised. but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally, Merkel in the last oktobertagen with a clear position of the new. It calls for a reform of the agreement of the European Union, in order to facilitate the rescue of a country and at the same time, the private darlehensgeber to commit a bear part of the cost. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position has been interpreted as anti-European, since they irlandkrise and everything on the following. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But their proposal, if somewhat sweetened, has been approved. In the next few months, we will be in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures as of 2013, participate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has drawn a red line which does not to exceed it. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It says all that, even if now unpopular measures must be taken, as of this date, there will no longer be the old functioning of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In 2013, the geburtsjahr be a new currency zone, in which the zuwiderhandelnden countries be severely punished, can be forced to explain to go bankrupt and in this case the private sector must take a part of the cost. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows that we have a hard wachstumskurs need to take, with high savings and investitionsraten, moderation of consumption, improving the productivity and competitiveness, and positive external salden. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The other option on the debt and construction industry with huge löchern based in the balance of payments, as it was mentioned in boom times by Spain, simply will not be tolerated. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would do bad, not to understand it. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not just a question of the deficit to three percent by the year 2013 runterzufahren. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much tougher. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the worst of what we could do in these circumstances is ourselves to cheat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the current turmoil in move more calm. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And be given the opportunities, the US, that we will use by the spring of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero has understood this so well and the announcement of his double - the promised reforms last Saturday after the meeting with the companies and the announcement of new measures yesterday - points out that the hypothesis, despite the criticism of Merkel to create its own house in order, has caused their way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But the Red line drawn by Germany is there, and it is not so that it would change things. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Under the opportunities in the consideration is that we fully the countries with little serious gestopften euro area to leave, not be ruled out. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Sport and regelumgehung </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tricks like the alonso and Ramos in the game against the ajax show erfindungsgeist, but not the will to avoid a sanction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The supposedly of two players of Real Madrid - xabi alonso and Sergio Ramos - angezettelte exclusion in the game of 23 November against the ajax led to a lot of ink in the Champions League was spilled about whether it is a unsportliche Act was or not and whether any both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA. </seg>
<seg id="4"> As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before spielende - their team had already clearly won - time and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way, and as the Real Madrid would give his group, the two players of the mandatory sanction the next ligaspiel against the auxerre meet and embark on the next spielphase without cards. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Finally, the disziplinarkommitee the UEFA, the coach of the clubs, José mourinho, with two to play and the players involved with different amount of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow card is not a new practice in such or similar circumstances, it is more often found in the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport befolgten rules. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of that debate set forth in the case is back to that that a team of Real Madrid club - the anthem in his edelmut and honour and provides its players had punished for similar incidents in other occasions - and played the lead role, and on the dramatisierung by mourinho more of an episode of its long history as theatralischer and provozierender technician has added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case, is the debate about whether this not explicitly banned by the statutes behaviour is against the principles of sport, that is to say whether these actions represent a regelumgehung. Indeed, this approach to the Statute of the sport, but seem to avoid its meaning. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this matter should the sportsgeist damage caused to be studied. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sportsgeist defended the physical integrity of the counterpart, an aspect that was not endangered by these acts, because it was not an aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the zuwiderhandelnden players an unjustified use from the gegenteam draw. This did not happen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradox of the Act of Real Madrid players is that it does not coincide with what we usually under falschspiel or regelumgehung understand because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly taken to avoid a penalty, but it should be as striking as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players waited, and happily took the sanction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> A different question is what kind of benefit of the zuwiderhandelnden from the deliberate fouls Drew. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This should be stressed that the rival has not been brought in a less favourable position still benefits for the gespielte game erheischt were because the obvious result of this action was that continue to play their own team with fewer players. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is also no useful strategy for the next game because the club has not then on these players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The advantage is obviously that the players of the next round of the Champions League spielphase without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game, begin. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a long, uncertain Advantage to a certain extent, as the team could eventually retirement. the players also received a sanction with this approach and go on in the second kartenzyklus, in which it because of kartenanhäufung retiring with a card of less than in the first cycle. </seg>
<seg id="21"> So that it is not clear whether it really is an advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Eventually put such procedures are not against the sportsgeist, which also includes strategic decisions, in order to benefit from the provisions of a maximum. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case the players wanted to avoid no sanction - this would really be a clear case of regelumgehung -, they wanted more to choose when they undergo this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They took a strategic decision to avoid without a penalty or to flee before her. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Although the Border between imagination and regelumgebung blurred is, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because it by two selbstausschlüsse was and because of the nature of the unprovoked regelübertragung. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The damage that was done by these acts of the principles of sport is less ethical than rather aesthetic. </seg>

<seg id="3"> A return to a deceptive silence. </seg>
<seg id="4"> At the end of the meeting with the economy minister had the regionsvorsitzenden Giulio Tremonti qualify as "unentzifferbar" to the situation and have it with a weekend of "unvorhersagbaren" expect to hear what the person concerned, however, immediately,. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On Tuesday, the gap with the German interest rates would have achieved its record of 210 basispunkten, and the prices of the Treaties to meet the konkursrisikos had risen to 263 points, what a certain kopflosigkeit had caused in Rome. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Silvio Berlusconi had in his Council of Ministers pointed out that the discrepancy of Spain to the German interest rates in 400 basispunkten lies. </seg>
<seg id="7"> His right hand, gianni letta, but had as "seriously concerned" by the "market turbulence" and said a possible danger from the direction of Ireland. </seg>

<seg id="9"> "The bad news is that Italy is such as Portugal," said Irwin stelzer, volkswirt at the Hudson Institute. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In plain language may be the problem is the absenz of economic growth and the attendant, schwindsüchtigen steuereingänge, put in danger, the state will no longer be able to cover its financing needs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The last of Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and expected of 1.4% in the year 2012... although the has been submitted to the Senate for consideration haushaltsbudget counts with 1.3% and 2%. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Under these conditions, it is calculated the EU Commission, will represent the budget deficit in the next year or 4.3% of GDP - contrary to the governments of the projected 3.9% - and - instead of 2.7% - 3.5% in the year 2012. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Therefore the turmoil for a new haushaltskollektiv that after the feiertagen could be used to a sum of 7 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "If necessary, new tightening measures need to be taken," says Auditors Olli Rehn. </seg>
<seg id="16"> On the hour, Italy is the support of international institutions. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "The very foundations of Italy's economy is in order and its accounts are settled, we have repeated that for a long time," assured arrigo sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF is charged with Italy. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "At the moment, there are no problems in the short term, nor in the long term, because of Italy Despite its high debt - 119,2% of GDP in 2011, A. D. R. - lower stabilisationsfortschritte as demanded by other countries," observed Pier Carlo padoan, chef-volkswirt the OECD. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Remains the question of the political unstetigkeit. </seg>
<seg id="20"> On 14 December Silvio Berlusconi will have to face a motion of censure the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of the preferred elections could already be organized at the end of March. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The affaire WikiLeaks has a dual importance. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On one side, it is emerging as an obvious scandal, a scandal, just a scandal in the sinner hypocrisy is that the beziehunge ruled between the states, the people and the press. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand, it is of profound changes on the international level, and is a taste of the future dominated by recession. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But we are in the series. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file prepared by a Secret Service - a old nation - exclusively from zeitungsausschnitten made. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary," American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi's throw from nothing more than what it for months, did anyway to read in every old journal - except those whose owners is Berlusconi - and the shocking karikaturierte profile gaddafis offered kabarettkünstlern already substance since a long time for their sketche. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule that the secret files should be known only from already news is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go in a library, the esotherischen publications on, they will see that each work - about the grail, the mystery of rennes-le-chateau, the templer or the rosenkreuzler - exactly a repetition of what has already been written in previous works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is not alone, therefore, that the author okkulter texts do not want to publish research - yet, therefore, that he does not know where news on the nicht-existierende would be to find -, but because those who, the okkultismus to believe in nothing other than that of what you already know and confirmed what they have learned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the erfolgsmechanismus by Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> As the geheimakten. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informer is lazy, and lazy - or limited spirit - is also the head of the Secret Service - otherwise he could be as always, for example, Editor in libération - the only considered as true, what he recognizes. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The top-secret information about Berlusconi had sent by the American Embassy in Rome of the staatsdezernat were the same as those of the newsweek already had published the week before. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> So why was such a fuss made the revelations of this dossier? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On one side is this what every educated person already knows, and that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the government can call each other or can take a plane to take the Dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small repräsentationsaufgaben, have turned in spionagezentren. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Any old viewers of ermittlungsfilmen know this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that we do so to ignore that. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Nevertheless, the fact that it violates publicly to repeat the task of hypocrisy and serves to the American diplomacy to put in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In second place: the idea that a x-beliebiger hackers the geheimsten secrets can tap the most powerful country in the world, carries the significant blow against the prestige of the staatsdezernats. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The scandal also brings, rather than the victims, the "scharfrichter" in trouble. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we are giving the profound nature of what has happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Former to Orwell's times, one could combine all power as a Big Brother, which controlled every gesture of his subjects. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Climate: as France, its finanzversprechen schönredet </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A year after the Copenhagen treaty, it is time the observance of the dissolved quickly finanzierungsversprechen - also "Almost start called" or premature Finance - to investigate, which were implemented by the developing countries. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And already are the gross French schönredereien exposed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With the Treaty of Copenhagen, the developing countries have committed to allocate 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France - i.e. 420 million a year - 1.26 billion euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> At the opening of the cop16, the EU has drawn all register their level of commitment to its partners of the fact with regard to the fast-start-finanzierungen to convince: detailgetreuer vorgehensbericht of its Member States, the press conference, great nebenevents, broschürenverteilung. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The operation of transparency is remarkable and extent of its real value estimated: the developing countries and the civil society would like it if all developed countries of the same on the same präzisionsniveau made. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The EU announced, in 2010 2.2 billion euros to have released what they on the right way to respektbezollung brings its commitment of 7.2 billion in the year 2012. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If one looks into detail but things are a little more complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should be "new and additional" according to the Treaty of Copenhagen, to ensure that an additional use has been tabled, without to be to the detriment of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means. </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the EU Commission had proposed a harmonisation certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today everyone chooses the benchmark he considered as the best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The EU Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those of the year 2009 for: the international funding will be maintained, and is within the framework of the funding "fast-start" 150 million over three years to do so. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries have similar benchmarks, either on year or about conditions at the level of the elected public development aid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In return to France was of the opinion that the funding "of all new projects" are "new and additional" of the year 2010. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In other words, there is no benchmarks in the spending of the previous year, or at the global level of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Specifically, the total of the French support for the developing countries can remain stable - or decline - is - France, its commitment with regard to the "new and additional" comply with funding. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another key element is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> About there is no rule, and everyone elects its rechenmodus. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, such as France, are 1 lend _ _ donated as the equivalent of 1. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This is apparently difficult unacceptable: is not comparable to the effort. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loans for certain profitable investment - often to the emissionseindämmung linked projects, based on technologies effektivster - can be justified, it is misleading to present the euro, which we captured as equivalent to a donated euro... there should only be the cost of loan for the kapitalgeberland to be counted as a commitment - that is to say the equivalent of an interest rate -. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France has nothing different in the sense as the following thought of it, '"respects its commitment of 420 million euros by 91,5% loans - 389,8 million euro - includes accorded and 8.5% - 36,1 million euro - - see the EU documents in order to convince themselves. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only country of the EU that loans up to a large extent. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or the Slovakia - among other things - their commitments to investigate 100% with donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union 1 _ spends to fulfil their commitments, France is just 10 cents and understands including a similar use. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Fine hokuspokus! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> All in all, operates France in its fast-start-finanzierung with a double fraud: a part with a weiterentwicklkung the action on the time, and the other part with the reality of the financial contributions. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France will be able to let it believe that 420 million "new and additional" has spent millions in accordance with its promises and saves in 36,1 million euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the Treasury - as it seems to be that it bercy was to have carried out the arbitrage - could lead to a double negative effect; even eu-intern - Why are continuing with the other Member States of the donations made, but if there is enough to lend? - and then in the negotiations because the developing countries is not completely to deceive... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter of premature finance only a small question in a relatively short period in comparison to the whole of discussions on the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it could be too much of the drop in the huge machine of the unfccc. </seg>
<seg id="34"> We hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As it always was, it is vital to its lesson from this first year verfrühter funding to learn. </seg>
<seg id="36"> First and foremost, France could announce a change in his verbuchungsart for the years 2011 and 2012, and in the spirit of respect for its commitments and the compensation justice with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> But above all, France could bring the discussions on the funding of the term streitgegenstand forward - another crucial and currently discussed subject -: you escapes the question of "verrechenbarkeit" or the verbuchungsart not of its loans. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could change its position, to be as advanced in terms of the disputes, as it is for other things. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> So the hope is based on the new Environment Minister kosciusko-morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A surprising announcement on the fast-start of France and his vision of "verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loans would raise the international vertrauensbasis from nature, which is necessary for further discussions. </seg>
