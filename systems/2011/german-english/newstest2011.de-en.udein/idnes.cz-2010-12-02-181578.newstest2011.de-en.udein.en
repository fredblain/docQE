A bone House fascinates even after 100 years, you look at the Interieure of Gaudi 
The roof is like the backs of a prehistoric Echse, the stairs as the spinal column of Dinosauriers and Balkone are aufgerissene Fischmäuler. 
That is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. 
The house of the local inhabitants received its organic forms the nickname "bone House." 
Organic forms, wild colours, the unusual use of stone and mosaic Kachelsplittern in scales façades remotely and ubiquitous soft lines, all of these are typical features of youth style of Antonio Gaudi. 
The façade of the House plays with dream liability lines zärtlichen paints and Texturen, reminding of nature and living creatures. 
It was only on closer inspection we noted that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful. 
During the night the whole façade even plastic acts, dramatic and the specific Anleuchtung stepped up the glamour of the colours. 
The same momentum full lines and tortuous forms dominate even the interior of the house. 
Creates ripple effects-formed wooden copied the window frames, support, Zierelemente of doors, even Gucklöcher and beverages. 
The house Batlló in quarter Eixample in the busy shopping streets Passeig de Grácia No 43 by the transformation of the house, which dates from 1877, the architects of Emilio Sala Cortese said. 
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906. 
The investor, the wealthy industrialists Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a new building, but in the end, he agreed to the idea Gaudís to an unusual and even cheaper reconstruction. 
The rental house Casa Batlló devised, Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone. 
He cooperated with the architect Josep Maria Jujol. 
Now on the drawing board that originated Dekorationen for representative of Realitätenbesitzers housing and also the use of Mosaiken in the facade was his idea. 
In the shaping of the facade also numerous other Bildner and artists with worked, however. 
The joint work on drafting the Casa Batlló the start of a fruitful collaboration of Jujola and Gaudí was. 
So Jujol participated in the construction of the house in Casa Gaudís Milá Park Güell in which other plants are located by Antoni Gaudí. 
Shortly after his completion of the House received by the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the nickname "bone House." 
Others called it of specific Fensteröffnungsmechanismus due to the "yawning House." 
They say, at the top of the buildings the sword of holy Georg, the existence was presented of Catalonia. 
But also other elements bildhauerische symbolize hidden religious motives. 
Gaudí for the House devised a unique time for the former central heating system with Entlüftungskanälen Kaminen and typical. 
Something bizarre their 45 ° C tendency is already. 
In its creation Gaudí diminished then consistently ignored all building regulations and did not in any way out of this. 
Before the start of construction - he a "by the city of the appropriate planning permission but the claims made by him on the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers two years later, with the finalisation were so horrified by the outcome that they demanded. 
Members of the Council were, among other things, that the construction of its pillars, even intervened in the public sidewalk. 
To make changes, however, there was no longer quite the opposite - only 15 days after the call the urban community Josep Batlló issued a request for approval of the rental of two highly pertinent floors of the House - and it has been given him promptly. 
The homeowners themselves drew in the lower floors. 
In the gallery on the second floor of a Gesellschaftssalon was on the third floor of the bedroom and private rooms of the flat were. 
The ground floor has been leased to a Juweliergeschäft. 
The whole sechsstöckige building undergoes a staircase up upwards to Dachterrasse. 
Through the fundamental elements of the placements all right corner and straight lines have been removed and replaced through bent and geschwungene walls. 
Gaudí worked but also with a modern approach to mutual connection of spaces. 
The social part can be combined with the opening of the completely Salontüren and so a larger society could comfortably chatting, without having to give up during vertraulicheren talks at a certain amount of intimacy. 
The house received by Gaudís conversion except a new façade, a fairly unusual roof and a further two floors. 
Gaudís game impressively with the light, as well as the blue and white glasierten Kacheln facing the courtyard is disguised and light courts. 
The game of these two colours gives all the floors of the House a maximum amount of light. 
He was simply exploiting the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colours, the sunlight on the contrary, to absorb. 
The house Casa Batlló, in 2005, the World Heritage List of Unesco was included, can visit today, everyone. 
In the first floors geräumigste prächtigste housing and that the public is made available. 
The homeowners decided only in the years to this step and this on the occasion of the Creator 150.Geburtstags of the famous. 
When you said that this is a very profitable business, it maintained the surveys, and we extended it to other joint and Dachgeschossräume from including Dachterrasse. 
The price to visit the Baudenkmals, however, is no trifling matter, he amounts to EUR 16,50, students, retired people, groups and owner of tourist cards get 20% reduction. 
This sum exceeds the entry price to other Gaudí's buildings in the city. 
Who would like to get to know the real atmosphere of the House with his Drachentürmchen, should try to make friends with one of the residents of the house and visit him at home.
