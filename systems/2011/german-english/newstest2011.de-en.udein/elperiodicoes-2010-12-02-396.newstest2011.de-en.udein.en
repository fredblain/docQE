Puigcercós addiction with a nod to the Carod close to peace in the ERC 
The Republican leaders allowed the party a secret vote on its survival in office. 
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the General Assembly of principle. 
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to make the umpteenth time of internal turmoil in the ranks of the the loss of 11 members and half of the voters in the direction of unemployment ERC from the path. 
The party chairman is well aware that his threat of resignation is not enough to close the former party leader, Josep Lluís Carod the Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is now so weakened as her mentor, and he will not deliver the same headaches, as other former tendencies. 
So the leader of, Esquerra tried to win with a nod to the new critics, which secure its position until the next local elections. 
For the outset yesterday announced that the more than 200 regional Council members from ERC could stay in office beyond its secret.

He was five, two of which are in the forefront. 
First, the "restructuring" of the board of directors, so that at least 90% of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carods environment. 
The second could be the big news. 
Huguet proposes, ERC should abandon the principle of full assembly than functioning at last. 
He verfechtet a reform of the statutes, which will make it possible to hold the meetings with elected delegates. 
By the end of the full assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - the team that fought back to the latter two conferences is Puigcercós' obsessively. 
In fact, the party leadership was in the Assembly by 2008 bebenden entrusted with the review of the General Assembly on one principle, Congress that should be dealing with the reform of the statutes. 
This deadline is still out, because the internal infogle aufruhe of recent years has not been able to tackle this issue. 
Now, without the critical sectors are on the lookout, the time may have come back to address this matter and for ever.
