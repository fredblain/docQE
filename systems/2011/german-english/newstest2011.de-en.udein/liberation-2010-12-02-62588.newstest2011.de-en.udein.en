Rachsüchtige hackers and emsige spies 
WikiLeaks the affair has a twofold significance. 
On one side, they turned out to be a very obvious scandal, a scandal that is simply a scandal the Sinner hypocrisy which the Beziehunge between states, the public and the press run. 
On the other hand, it announces radical changes at international level, and is a foretaste of the regression dominated by the future. 
But we go after the series. 
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any of a secret service produced acts (any nation is composed) exclusively from newspaper cuttings. 
The "extraordinary," American revelations about the sexual habits Berlusconi's throw nothing more than what we got through months anyway to read in any other journal (except those whose owner Berlusconi is), and the frightening karikaturierte profile Kabarettkünstlern Gaddafi's has provided for a very long time for their Sketche fuel. 
The rule, according to the secret dossier must comprise merely known news, is essential for the dynamism of the secret services, and not only in this century. 
If you go into a library dedicated esotherischen publications, you will see that every station (on the grail, the mystery of Rennes' le's Chateau to Templer or Rosenkreuzler repeatedly) exactly what was written in previous works. 
This is not only so that the author wishes to occult texts not publish research (or that he did not know where news about) would find it not exist, but because those who devote themselves to the Okkultismus to think of anything other than what they already know and confirmed what they have already learnt. 
Mechanism this is also the success of Dan Brown. 
As the secret files. 
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited intellect) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he would be whatever, editor of Libération, for example), which considers only be true, which he acknowledges. 
The Top Secret information about Berlusconi, the US Embassy in Rome sent the Staatsdezernat had, were the same as those that Newsweek had already published the week before. 
Why such a fuss about the revelations of this dossier was therefore made? 
On one side of this effect what any educated person knows already and the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and, since then, too, may be able to call for the Government to each other or an aircraft companies have been able to take at the dinner - have lost their diplomatic functions and turns, with the exception of a small representation tasks in espionage centres. 
Any spectators of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not happening from hypocrisy that people act to ignore it. 
Yet: The fact that we are repeating it public, violated the duty of the hypocrisy and serves to put the American diplomacy in a bad light. 
In the second place, the idea that a yet any hackers to tap into secret mysteries of the most powerful country in the world, there is a significant blow to the prestige of Staatsdezernats. 
Moreover, the scandal brings fewer victims than the "executioner" in trouble. 
But we devote ourselves the profound nature of what has happened. 
Formerly, to Orwell's times, we have been able to concentrate all power as a Big Brother, who controlled every gesture of his subjects. 
Orwell's prophecy would be able to turn out ever since as absolutely right, where they can control every movement, thanks to the phone, making any transaction, it was hotel, the elected motorway, and so on; the citizen would the total victim to the eye of the power. 
If you have, but what is happening today, even the secret Krypten of power no longer can escape the scrutiny of Hackers, the Kontrollgang ceases to be unilaterally and will circle shaped. 
Power controlled every citizen, but each citizen, or at least of the hacker - chosen as the avenger by the citizen - that the secrets of power can bring in experience. 
But how a power can keep, which is no longer able to protect its own secrets? 
True, Georg Simmel said that a real mystery is an open secret (and a hollow secret can never be exposed); it is also true that whatever knowledge about the nature of Mr Berlusconi or Merkel's, in fact, is a mystery without Geheimis, because it exposes the public sphere; but disclosed by WikiLeaks style that the secrets were empty secrets by Hillary Clinton means depriving them of any power. 
WikiLeaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama. 
What will be the consequences of this snub caused to such a great power? 
It is obvious that the state would be in the future, no reserved more information would be put online - the one on the street corner angeklebten displaying. 
But it is to be hoped is equally obvious that it is with the latest technologies in vain to keep confidential reports of telephone secret. 
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of state in a aircraft move and one of his colleagues has contacted. 
How could be maintained in the future private and only for certain ears some relations? 
I know very well that my prediction sounds, at the moment, according to science fiction and Roman prison, but I find myself having to imagine the government agents in secret manner assiduous on uncontrollable march routes moving, their communications have nowhere else than on mere memory in order and also the few written information they get, in the shoe (verbergend. 
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: Basically of espionage attempt of Watergate had been less success, as WikiLeaks. 
I had the opportunity to write, that the technology is advancing today, like a cancer - backwards. 
A century after the wireless telecommunications Graf had revolutionised the communications, the Internet, with a reconstructed Telegrafen (telephone) wire. 
(Analogue) video tapes had the film allows them a film auszukundschaften band for broadband by the (in numerical) CDs enable spulen from behind, you could forward and reveal all the secrets of installation, while today, nothing else than to jump from chapter to chapter, at macro chickens. 
With high speed trains, one travelling within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this means of switching by plane, including three and a half hours. 
It is not therefore exceptionally that return policy and communication technology in cars and horse. 
A final observation. 
In earlier times what have been forged for secrets between the messages tried to understand the press. 
At present there are the messages ask for confidential information by the press.
