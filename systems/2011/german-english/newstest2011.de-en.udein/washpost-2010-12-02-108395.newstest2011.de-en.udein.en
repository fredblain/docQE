Belarus is in agreement, not weapons grade uranium accumulate 
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure worldwide nuclear material has announced the government of Belarus on Wednesday that it will gain no longer highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. 
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, in an additional articles of the security summit. 
The US government had been trying for years, know to convince Russia, no more highly enriched uranium and to collect last spring seemed to have achieved a hurdle. 
But the US administration officials told the Washington Post that two secret agreements have been in the last two months, with Belarus to remove weapons grade uranium, 187 pounds from a Belarusian Research Institute. 
It was the scene for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material, according to a official staff, who will remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the subject, about £500. 
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear security summit of 47 nations" to be in April, which had excluded White Russia. 
And it was apparently good enough to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet republic at the next summit in 2012. 
"I was really impressed by the fact that they want a seat in Nuklearen Security Summit () by 2012." 
"Which shows me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the partnership with Global Security, a group to promote nuclear safety. 
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant and important step" from Belarus. 
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, in the space of four years to secure all vulnerable nuclear material. 
Since then, the US government six countries has helped to get rid of its highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus will be the seventh. 
A dozen countries have done, under the administration of George W. Bush. 
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit of the White Russian President Alexander Lukashenko has said that the nation will never give up their uranium. 
"As enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is radically weapons capable, and less highly enriched uranium reserve," Lukashenka said at the time. 
"This is our commodity... We will not make it a dirty bomb and we will sell it to anyone." 
"We use it solely for research purposes, that is all." 
Belarus in approached yet a few months ago, the United States, as it signaled interest in the meeting of an agreement. 
The first attempt, the uranium Belarus in October to remove, was particularly complicated, because the material easily verstrahlt was, say officials. 
It was loaded into a Spezialzug, of the more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, say officials. 
The second attempt was decided on Monday and has been carried out by air, according to the officials. 
The US government pays $14 million for this effort, with a large part of the money goes to the Belorussian research with depleted uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons. 
"This was extremely careful coordinated and voted to build confidence," to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton led, Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, which is working on the Global risk reduction said. 
The James Martin Center for estimates Nichtweiterzugebende studies that Belarus had this year at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus wants to dissolve the joint agreements be camp until 2012. 
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, primarily because Lukashenko's contempt for human rights to be harsh. 
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement. 
"The progress of this global security issues welcome heißend, the United States of America and Russia knows that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in the improvement in bilateral relations, and it is essential to the development of the country and its citizens," they said.
