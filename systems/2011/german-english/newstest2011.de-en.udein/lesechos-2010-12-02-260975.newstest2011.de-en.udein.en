The Berlusconi government in Italy is in 
For Italy following a worrying weeks earlier the situation has calmed down yesterday, with the decline the Eckzinsen to 10 years a little. 
A return to the deceitful silence. 
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of the region before seated Giulio Tremonti had described the situation as "unentzifferbar" and expect to hear him have a 'unvorhersagbaren "weekend, which they denied, however, immediately. 
Tuesday, at least, the gap could have been achieved with the German interest rates its record from 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk, have risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain Kopflosigkeit in Rome. 
Silvio Berlusconi in his Ministers pointed out that the discrepancy of Spain is due to the German interest rates by 400 basis points. 
His right hand, Gianni Letta, however, had expressed as "seriously concerned" by the "market turbulence" and the possible contagion from the direction of Ireland. 
"The good news is that in Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland." 
"The bad news is that Italy is, like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute. 
In plain text short, his problem is the part of economic growth and the attendant, schwinds√ºchtigen tax receipts that put the state in danger, to be able to meet its funding needs. 
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government. 
In the future, is an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 2012 of 1.4% in the Senate, although the expected... examining budget with 1.3% and 2% is calculated. 
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimated that the budget deficit in the next year will amount to 4.3% of GDP (as opposed to the government's projected 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%. 
Hence the collective turmoil at a new budget, which could be used after the holidays to a sum of EUR 7 billion. 
"If necessary, to new austerity measures are taken," auditors says Olli Rehn. 
The hour Italy will receive the support of international institutions. 
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, the repeat, we already have for a long time," Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, which is entrusted to the IMF with Italy assured. 
"At the moment, there are no problems in either the short or long term, because of Italy despite its high debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011, that A. R.) lower Stabilisationsfortschritte be called for, as in other countries," observed Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD. 
Remains the question of political Unstetigkeit. 
On 14 December Silvio Berlusconi will face a censure of the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the preferred elections at the end of March, could be organised. 
There is therefore a little good session for a decision in relation to a serious crisis.
