Métro Grand Paris: First financial vignettes 
Since the debate is to modernise the transport industry, on the Ile de France in full swing, it is raining billion. 
At least in the discussions. 
We call here, especially in the 23 billion for the underground Grand Paris in memory, which is intended by the Société du Grand Paris be built. 
To launch at the start of construction - the SGP in the way that the state has declared a Kapitaldotation of 4 billion euros. 
In the theoretical framework that is the amount of money that would enable the SGP then to give the markets some of the financial sum to their Zweifachen. 
Today it is, after all, to initial projections. 
The supplementary budget by 2010, seeing this morning by the Finance Commission of the National Assembly, that contains the proposed measures to raise the first part of that money. 
There are two measures: The creation of a special tax to Erschließund and higher taxation of the offices on the Ile de France. 
The former, so remove one Article 15 of the bill, is "in favor of the public service channel Société du Grand Paris." 
This is estimated that "the product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year." 
Zweitere an overhaul of existing corporate taxation is: 'To modernise them, in order to increase the price of their product, and to transfer this increase of Société du Grand Paris ." 
How much would make it? 
A mystery. 
This sum is not quantified in the text. 
Of the 4 billion it is far away. 
"It is being said that the fiscal resources are added to the 4 billion euro of Kapitaldotation, which will be paid by the state and the Société du Grand Paris be done gradually to the project," as suggested in the explanatory statement. 
In the SGP is this system does not take place at all offensive. 
"Since the moment in which we (entered revenue the two taxes, or R.), you can meet the study over three years, and then draw from the 4 billion," it is claimed. 
"That will be taken in the budget and diverted after and after '. 
The SGP estimated that in 2013, will be launched, the 4 billion for the budget in 2014 to take note of. 
This measure, whose 4 promised billions of people will be able to look for a long time, is in danger of a very eventful, causing parliamentary discussion. 
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
