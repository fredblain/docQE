Sabadell wants to steal his rivals in three years ago, a million customers' 
The caretaker board member from Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola is more optimistic than some other managers; he believes that 2001 will be a tough year for banks, but first discounting a new liquidity crisis, predicted debt and the end of the war. 
Nevertheless, he anticipates a drop in interest rate spreads, the banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and the price of loans. 
Sabadell expected to recover in three years ago, a million private customers - one still existing specialist. 
Sabadell has found a way to make the next three years, and so, in a very difficult economic environment to survive. 
The bank will introduce a new Dreijahresleitplan 2011. 
The goal is not just to survive, without the public support from the FROB, but also to increase the share of the market for a million private customers - 700 000, if you exclude the customers who will lose the bank - and this is the great challenge facing the bank is, because until now it has given to its business customers more attention than their private customers. 
This year, it did get 250,000 private customers and 50 000 companies. 
Its market share in retail is 3.5%, while the business customers make up more than 10 percent. 
Another principle of the business plan in 2011 to 2013 is the increase in productivity, austerity, cost reduction, and the challenges which the Bank in order, will they, together with annual accounts report present. 
Few banks dare define and publish targets in these difficult times, as all of the plans of the banks by the financial crisis in the world are in disarray. 
Sabadell will complete this year, in its four years ago established master plan Optima. This was initially interpreted to three years, but because of the market situation, it has been extended by a year. 
Customers, who will be leaving the savings banks, are the main target of the Bank. 
In a dated APIE organized breakfast said Guardiola, 2011, would be a "difficult" year "with a great deal of scope." 
The manager assumes, Spain, it would be only "slow" out of the crisis. 
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to build in two or three years' work '- is essential for the survival of the bank. 
Even if he assumes that war will abate about liabilities - punishing interest rate margins - that risk premia, the banks and building societies pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity need to be transferred as compensation for the dwindling profit margins already on the price of credit. 
"The issues of liquidity and funding are a structural nature, and they will put pressure on the credit." 
"We have not off the tap, but the Zinsdifferenziale are very high," admitted Guardiola. 
Banesto spent on Thursday already ordering their Filialnetz to restrict the procurement of long term loans and the increase (cf. Zinsdifferenziale Cinco Díaz of 22 and 27 November. 
Managers acknowledged, too, the banks followed Stategie at the moment "to increase the fees," but "within a competitive framework." 
Sabadells master plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group, however, does not exclude corporate business. 
It is not for nothing that he assured that larger companies are in Spain "necessary." 
"In the next year, everything will change," he assured. 
He stressed that the need to increase capital at present "enormous" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions will fall in red figures. 
He is of the opinion that the FROB Kaptitalaufstockungen could in the money market. 
After he assured that Sabadell even a temporary closure of the markets can survive, he refuted the argument of some bankers who predict a new liquidity crisis. 
He stresses that it can get nothing in circulation, but in contrast to the events in June, you can get short term financing through Repogeschäfte and intercept with the crisis.
