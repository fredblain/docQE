A long finger than ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer 
Men, whose finger is long, as the ring finger, are obviously exposed to a lower risk of prostate cancer. 
Is the surprising result of a study, which was published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer. 
This is to do with the levels of the male hormone testosterone. 
"Our results show that the relative length of finger, can be used as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer and this is particularly among men by 60," which the study, said Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick. 
The fingers could help to determine to what men should undergo necessarily a prostate cancer test, particularly genetic risks or other risk factors are, if available, such as health problems, added Mrs added family Eeles. 
During the period from 1994 to 2009 with their counterparts in Britain had more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men. 
With more than half of the participants in the study of the finger of the right hand was shorter than ring fingers. 
For these men had the same likelihood of prostate cancer, and for 19% of those men whose vaccination and finger were equally long. 
In men, whose finger was longer than the ring fingers, however, this risk has fallen by 33 per cent, in men by 60 even at 87 percent. 
The ratio of the length of the two aforementioned fingers, which are already in the prenatal age, apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones, which the child was exposed to in the womb. 
Less testosterone is a long finger. 
Previous research found that it is precisely this testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer. 
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticists and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that he was aware of this study, however, he does not think that the relationship between the length of finger, and the risk of cancer, so far, shown for "completely."
