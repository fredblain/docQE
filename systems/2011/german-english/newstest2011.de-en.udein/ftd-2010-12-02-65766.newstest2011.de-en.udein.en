Obama new drilling stop 
Off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be in the next few years, no new oil drilling. 
Such a ban enacted by the government in Washington, and revoke its previous plans for good. 
Even before the Atlantic coast remains prohibited new drilling for the time being. 
This told the Interior Ken Salazar on Wednesday. 
The trigger for this strict ban, which is at least for the next five years, is the explosion of Bohrplattform "Deepwater Horizon" in April. 
Before the accident that claimed the lives of 11 workers and the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama has signaled to pressure from the opposition and the industry is its willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico. 
Advocates want to reduce the dependence of the United States from oil supplies from abroad. 
Who bears responsibility for the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf, has not yet been resolved. 
At the heart of the criticism of the British energy company BP, is facing billions of demands. 
An inquiry on behalf of Obama's is to come up with in the course of 2008 its results. 
In October Interior Minister Ken Salazar had lifted the following the explosion Bohrstopp imposed. 
Following various oil companies had put applications for new Bohrvorhaben immediately. 
With tighter control and stricter safety regulations Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new disaster. 
Currently, the competent authority is concerned, which was reeling after numerous corruption charges brought into disrepute, will radically reformed. 
At the same time, Obama has announced plans to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and Gaskonzerne. 
The industry warns would now publicly warning that the output fall in the Gulf by a stricter regulation, much smaller than in the past. 
"The government's plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a recent industry survey by the consultancy BDO - before Bohrverbot by Wednesday. 
The American Energy Alliance complains and the uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows what is precisely the regulatory change." 
Investment in new projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
