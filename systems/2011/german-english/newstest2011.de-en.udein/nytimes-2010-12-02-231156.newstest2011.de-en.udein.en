Cheshire's appointment makes attention on Twitter 
Half a dozen of them away tippten in the riots in the courtroom. 
They verschickten tact in the minutes on Twitter their reports about grey of testimonies. 
At the end, so the defence, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the process, about rape and to beds gekettete children in a house which go up in flames. 
On Thursday, will be closely followed the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, to have killed, an official end to find, if the verdict on the death sentence, that the jury has spoken, falls. 
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted requests in court to explain the reasons for an appeal and will concern the courts for years. 
One of the most provocative of the reasons is that it was due to the intense coverage of the process, even through extensive use of Twitter by average reporters, to a "circus atmosphere" and such a widespread, swift penetration rebel details so that the jury had been influenced in an improper manner by the public outrage. 
This objection could induce Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules to be in the courtroom. 
"As I have seen during this process, I believe that there is a real danger that if the basins of the new technologies in the courtroom this influenced each individual's right to a fair trial, Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes said," main defenders. 
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Chamber Court, rejected last week's requests, via referendum succinctly when he said that the new media "would be monitored carefully," and that there is no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions. 
But that was certainly not the last word on this matter. 
Court for decades a Proverbs have found that the reporting on notorious cases casts doubt on the fairness of the process. 
In its historic decision taken in 1966 the Supreme Court of the United States has overturned the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, osteopaths from Cleveland to have killed his wife, and said in its decision that it would have been because of the New Media "Karnevalsatmosphäre in a courtroom." 
Some believes that the television series and the movie based "on the flight" to this crime. 
Some lawyers say courts a Proverbs, which consider sentencing Mr. Hayes half a century later, might follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication channels from the courtroom, who were at the time of the case, Dr Sheppard still inconceivable. 
"There is a good reason, on the impact of new media in processes which will be followed by a broader public, to be concerned," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School, who has studied the use of the death penalty in Connecticut, according to his report is it arbitrarily imposed. 
Professor Donohue said some Appelationsgerichte might be fascinated by the idea that restricting an immediate communications make the courtroom, it could be the process fair. 
The Twitter case is just one of many that make the lawyers of Mr. Hayes to discuss in years and thereby prolong a condemnation. 
The defenders claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes might have been already guard, as Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reaction of potential Juroren by showed them during the grey Jurorenauswahl cent scene photos. 
Some Juroren said that photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke's Petit, 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years, they have been met with revulsion. 
The defenders say, they would also make the constitutionality of the death penalty, called into question, and argue that the judge wrongly have exchanged a jury, who was a critic of the public prosecutor's office, and that he had improperly exerted pressure on the ruling, as it had taken the unusual decision to ask the jury over the weekend. 
The Juroren were not isolated. 
But their arguments about the impact of the extensive reporting on the process may drag the greatest interest. 
In a judgment ruling, which they submitted last month, have made it clear that the case of the intelligence in Connecticut had dominated and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American Senate of the candidates have been discussed. 
They argued that the new media have constantly fanning the flames of the emotions on the case. 
"Such a daily crush of Medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom wrote," the lawyers, "it has never before seen in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally." 
Its focus on reporting by Twitter is controversial. 
In interviews some journalists said that the claim that this direct messages were a rabble-rousing but reports that are reimbursed more slowly, is a hostile view of technology, of the report on future processes verarme. 
But some lawyers said Appelationsgerichte were often confronted with the argument, social and technical changes need the Adaptation by the courts. 
Mr. Hayers lawyers step up this assertion. 
In its objection, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court, from 1966, in the conviction of Dr Sheppard was lifted due to the reporting and made it clear that the new media require new rules. 
"This case," they wrote, "represented Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
