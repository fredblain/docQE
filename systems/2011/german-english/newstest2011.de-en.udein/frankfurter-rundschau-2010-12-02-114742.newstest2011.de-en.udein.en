In the twilight zone controllers 
The European Food Safety Authority of Efsa is infiltrated with experimental Genpflanzen industry. 
This accusation now put the expert group test Biotech, which sees itself as independent Institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology. 
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said test biotech boss Christoph Then Wednesday in Munich. 
Efsa the head of the group's experts for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper and another expert, Efsa were for years now the lobbyists' association Ilsi under contract. 
Will be paid for by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer. 
Kuiper have contributed significantly to the extension to Genpflanzen Efsa's and am in a clear conflict of interest, criticised Then. 
Efsa regulations that are selling fashion word equal with position papers of Ilsi and deceive so that the imprint of the industry, which is expected to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma. 
It is the second time that test Biotech share your criticism of a conflict of interest. 
So was an senior Efsa's Managerin recently without conditions or transitional period the Swiss agricultural company Syngenta, and the sides have changed. 
Also the Central German radio (MDR) had recently revealed personal links between kontrollierender EU authority and industry lobby what that environmental federal office has made, as well as EU parliamentarians sit up and take notice. 
Efsa, however, which can see no conflict of interest. 
We will repeat every serious data back, even to those of the industry, as long as they are of a high technical quality, it said in a statement. 
Of the experts working for Efsa, they do not demand that they have no links with the industry. 
But they would have to disclose. 
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States. 
This for experts in science, industry and politics described himself as a neutral forum, among other things, the risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying contract. 
In the matter of independent experts as Then criticise that genetically modified crops are currently authorised without any attempt to feed animals, and the response of Genpflanzen will not be tested on environmental influences. 
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn is on the field," said Then. 
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole Genpflanze what should talk briefly about no reliable results. 
"If you do not, the risk of addiction, how should we then find it? 'Asks pointed Then. 
Angelika Hilbeck also sees it. 
The scientist research since 1994 in the genetic engineering and is currently at the Technical University of Zurich. 
The industry is trying in this area, as in the US, now to influence or to discredit in Europe ever more critical scientists. 
There was therefore hardly even researchers, which are intertwined with corporations. 
For companies critical studies were not published in the rule. 
"Industry controls the security research," claimed Hilbeck.
