The trail of stones 
Uli Gsell has concerned itself which, in total, approximately 400 kg. 
On Monday evening it was Stuttgart power station, the Tuba on the back. 
Demo it was. 
It was snowing. 
History is well known: In September the dredging were angerückt and had started to cut a big piece of the north wing. 
Stuttgart the world was no longer the same, thousands demonstrated against S21, the billions Tieferlegung of the railway station. 
When it came to a settlement freeze, a large part of the wing was in ruins. 
Shattered in 6,000 to 7,000 pieces. 
Crailsheimer produce a soft rough stone, mortgaged between 1914 and in 1920. 
Gsell is sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old. 
He has secured a couple of scraps. 
"These stones are Reliquien." 
"They must not be allowed to disappear." 
He schwärmt: "A cheaper and of poor brick, simply and earth." 
As he aufsägte one that smelled after Zigarettenqualm. 
What he will do with the slice, he does not yet know. 
Stones have time. 
Uli Gsell also. 
The trail of Stuttgart stones leads in a forest in Tübingen in a former Munitionsdepot the French army where Manuel Rongen has built his stone empire. 
Is the 44 people with old stones. 
He has bought all, which fell on the demolition in Stuttgart. 
"It would be a disgrace, it would to Schotter gemahlen or the landfill disappear," he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen, which was once an Wachhäuschen. 
Insulted and threatened you have him, he tells, as in September in the newspapers that he had purchased the leftovers of the north wing of the demolition business. 
But he has talked with the S � 21 opponents, for several days. 
And he has told them that he but now nothing could for the demolition. 
And if it is, then it would be the most sensible, if the stones reused. 
Around 200 S 21 opponents with subsequently took, on average, one of the 80 kilograms heavy Quader, piece price 6,50 to 14 euros. 
As a memory, but also some in the hope of being able to return to him in a reconstruction. 
500 tonnes had bought Rongen, 25 large lorry loads. 
Half still being stored in the forest, the rest is sold for a long time. 
Garden owners, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer. 
They were coming from everywhere and weggeschleppt would have to bear as boot and supporters. 
The Stuttgart stones of contention have turned themselves into "Mäuerle" or limits of Kräuterbeeten. 
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen. 
"Would not be the political component." 
He is rising in his SUV, a Tour by 20 hectares of great empire. 
Jura he has studied and broken, later biology, then he has taken an interest in computers and is now finally stone dealer. 
And rock lovers. 
40000 tonnes of bricks store it. 
From across Germany he together karrt its treasures. 
He says that he is the greatest Altsteinhändler of the Republic. 
He is slowing down. 
The snow art full behauene sand stones lie. 
"They once belonged to Dresden Marienbrücke," he told them. 
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he schwärmt. 
"My Lieblingsstein." 
It is the way high through the forest. 
He shows on a bunch: Red limestone, previously part of the Karlsruhe railway station. 
And further. 
"Beautiful Travertin." 
Once Quader belonged to the gallery of the Stuttgart Neckarstadions. 
Throughout the snow bricks and stories Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart police Bureau rötlicher stone is complemented with from the Dom St Blasien, Tuff from Heilbronner hospital. 
What work, the effort, the sweat. 
If Rongen to think about how the stones were moved earlier and hands hacked with simple bottle features horse and cart, he will most reverential. 
"It would be a scandal if they so schreddern something." 
Reich, he has not become rich alone. 
Employs 14 people, but the stone dealer today, moreover Steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a Glasbläser and horticulturalists have established at the top of the forest. 
"We work hard, but it is satisfying" Resteverwerter says. 
Soon he must after Cologne. 
There, too, there are obstacles to save.
