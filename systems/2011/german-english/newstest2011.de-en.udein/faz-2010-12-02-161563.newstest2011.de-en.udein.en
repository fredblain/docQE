The ice University 
The "Gelato University in Bologna Eiskonditoren on better seasons to be prepared. 
The three days of basic rate for future Gelatieri has the biggest feeder and visitors from around the world. 
Where, in fact, the entire ice? 
By Gelatiere Gelataio and from. 
The Gelatiere, in German something old-fashioned the Eiskonditor, establishes the cream, following all the rules of Italian ice art master. 
The Gelataio pulls with a Spachtel the ice cream from Kühltheke, it deletes the Waffel and sold them. 
Order to know this, you need not travel after Anzola dell 'Emilia in the province of Bologna. 
But who would like to know more about the ice, the past is not of the "the Gelato University" the Italian firm Carpigiani. 
The ice University has set up, the manufacturers of Eismaschinen in 2003, so that the ice cream from their machines everywhere will be the senior Italian ideals. 
The three days of basic rate for future Gelatieri has the biggest feeder and visitors from around the world. 
But there are also more day Spezialkurse Schokoladeneis around lost and internships Eisdiele in the house of their own. 
Some dreams in the mid 'Crisis of a new career, others venture just the treacherous ice of their vague aspirations. 
This time there are 40 players from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil via Hungary to Saudi Arabia. 
Jacky, art teachers from California, loves the Slow food movement and want to offer in the country's industrial Ice Cream in the future, a European quality product. 
Anke from Berlin is enterprise adviser and wants eintüten after years in an irritating job gone. 
Two young Egyptians dream to open in Cairo a Eisdiele. 
A man from Malta and a from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in its bars - and the Canadian House, Mrs Julia, because their children Italian love ice cream. 
Maestro � Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari says the participants initially the ideal qualities of perfect ice cream. 
Essential good taste is not only, but also the consistency seidige fluidity and the good. 
Luciano forgets during his training but also not the icing on the cake of the national and even südländischen On construction: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is plenty of is romanticism." 
The first step to manufacturing seems quite simple. 
Luciano dump the basic ingredients of the milk, cream, milk powder, sugar, and stabilizers in a big Mixgerät, with an electronic programme all heated to 85 degrees and then immediately to four degrees are cooling. 
Then it is the machine a Hahn, and out comes a pasteurised white Basiscreme, basis Milcheissorten for all. 
Immediately the lecturer will almost bombarded with questions: Can we create ice cream only with natural substances without stabilising influence? 
How can we ignore the own Experimentierlust free rein? 
Luciano warns to lead from the spirit of the time. 
Who of ice cream "just from natural ingredients' talk, has spent perhaps yet stabilisers - usually a natural product such Guarkernmehl from Guarbohne. 
Of course, one can produce without ice, stabiliser, only then it must be sold within a day, otherwise it together sackt in, and the customer to louder Eiskörnchen bites. 
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed. 
Exciting it will with the flavourings. 
For the flavour in ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients which you buy in the fruit's department or by the sweets of the supermarket. 
In addition, there are are powder and Pasten. 
"The suppliers will try all they try to foist onto you dozens of aromatic additives." 
"But you should simply experimenting." 
Either the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruits. 
Or on the ice cream out of the white primary mass, with eggs to yellow cream and cocoa powder on the basis of all kinds of chocolate for the temptations offered. 
Now the course participants must Eismaschinen. 
Luciano can establish they each have four different kinds of Vanille-, Schokolade-, Mokka- and hazelnuts would / ice, with or without egg in basic mass, with more or less Vanillearoma or other natural additives. 
The same experiment also undergo the Fruchteissorten. 
Added flavourings, more fruit geschmacklich mashed potato - that is not necessarily better. 
Hazelnuts would / ice not necessarily more tastes nut if it contains more hazelnuts. 
The most popular and the kiwi fruit ice provides the working group which used more fruits, less water and less. 
Only a balanced mixture highlight the taste a Gelato correctly, Luciano says. 
Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: Used peach and mashed potato with a lot of sugar, the sugar in the basic recipe to be reduced. 
For Zitroneneis is an extra dose of sugar needed. 
Luciano, it draws a device with which he intended the sugar content of the fruit varieties (growers) judge the Oechsle in grape must. 
Fortunately tables facilitate the calculation. 
To make ice no longer require so much physical use as before. 
Not only the equipment for the automatic restoration of basic mass helps. 
There is also a device, in which the final mixture of ice and at the same time, and is beaten cremig cooling to minus temperatures. 
Despite all automation from not remain small mishaps. 
Brazilian Gustavo and his colleagues of course covered itself from top to bottom with Fruchtpüree than getting him the colossal hand blenders out of control. 
"At any rate," Maestro Luciano says that "it is only a matter of time before something happened."
