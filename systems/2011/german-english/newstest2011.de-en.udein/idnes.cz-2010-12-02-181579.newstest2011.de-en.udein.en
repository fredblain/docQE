The right mattress and proper beds rust? Women have other aspirations than men 
Not tollste bed frame, but the quality of the surface area lies - so, mattress and rust are the good bed. 
These must complement but harmonious to meet the wishes of the specific user. 
In selecting many things play a role - the weight, the size of the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of Schläfers. 
Just as important the Interieur in which mattress and rust are subordinate is. 
Typical example? 
In a heated Wochenendhaus, not regularly, will be suited Latexmatratzen are not good, since they need much longer "warm to be." 
In addition, they are much more difficult than usual a polyurethane mattresses. 
And - they should be changed on a regular basis. 
If they have not actually enough Entlüftungskanälchen in essence and are on a strong record, moisture in congestion increases, so it is not impossible that is under their Schimmel. 
In the election also have a role to play, of course, what we are used to. 
Who has been a long time in a foreign country, where very high with mattresses soft layer usual, will be able to get used to the difficult low mattress with hard surface. 
"All Eishockeyspieler who have returned from the NHL, have complained to me that they are not able to sleep more right." 
Abgeschundenen "on their shoulders and waists, they simply need a soft layer from Visco's sparkling (Memory Foam - a form of memory's Polymer)." 
"I commend them including sugar sick people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the 'information' from ligaments and skin badly," declared Hadamcziková Sylva, specialising in padded furniture. 
I have therefore concerned many Eishockeyspielern years ago, but also other customers that mattresses with Visco's sparkling (Memory Foam). 
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses provide the Tempur manufacturers and others, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer of Tropico." 
And we need not necessarily be a famous Eishockeyspieler to learn to appreciate the advantages of Visco's foam. 
This "miracle" actually works quite simple. 
The sparkling optimalisiert said its severity and absorbierten form in the heat, in other words, it is downright schmiegt on warm body. 
Anywhere it pinches in the middle of the night are not rolling around like after a major fight. 
It simply sleep much better. 
The sparkling viskoelastische also offers protection against Dekubitus (gangrene). 
In the election of Matratzengröße should be the body size still include the length of Fußsohlen, i.e. around 21 to 34 cm. 
Man and woman are to the 180 cm high, need as a 210 to 220 cm long bed. 
Each Schläfer should at least stand 90 cm is widely available, so together 180 cm. 
In Einzelbetten, for example, on singles, 120 to 140 cm are appropriate. 
The comfort, and also for any visitors. 
Otherwise the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed broad: "If one is on the backs, nor should be enough room for the easy angewinkelten poor," advises of mine tells. Helen Prokopová who Zunftmeisterin the Polsterer and Raumausstatter dedicated for years the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and this issue also on technical schools. 
In a double bed, everyone needs a rust and their own mattress, but be careful with the shopping, the mattresses are too high. 
Otherwise, nothing else is left to install than Roste in different levels and it is not long on each bed frame possible. 
Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with pen skeletal 15 cm, three centimetres to form class and the fine buffer should at least. 
"With obvious or Hinsetzen one must feel the feathers, in any case," Helena Prokopová warns. 
Every mattress makes a specific Rosttyp required. 
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document as together evolved Siamzwillinge have to seek out in the bedroom. 
These mattresses will not reveal itself and the reference you cannot wash, which today is already common practice and there is. 
And as you lose in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat, it is clear that the mattress) after five to seven years ago, becoming a huge (and congested sieve. 
That is also why experts advertising slogans reject who promise in mattresses a life span of up to 25 years ago, even a lifetime guarantee. 
Any thing has its ifs and buts. 
And that is why a more practical advice of dealers: Mattresses of 120 or 140 cm breadth, we should not be afraid of the hygiene waschbaren, abziehbaren salary, but it is recommended to use a Matratzenschoner that we can withdraw and wash easily. 
Even if Matratzenbezüge today usually produced with Rundumreißverschluss, so that you get after the opening two halves (immensely important for Waschvorgang and washing machines sizes!), the kind of manipulation with larger mattresses is, above all, on their own, often, like the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. 
They have in bed instead of a Rostes a solid record? 
Get out! 
Or no more than a bed for unloved guests and for a single night. 
So they should provide the record, rather, with ventilation holes (if not content) and mattresses are used with the skeletal and 15 cm minimum level with so pen pockets nuclear and fine buffer. 
A polyurethane mattresses not belong on such a basis. 
For not verstellbare from Lattenroste with 14 to 18 play pen (Lamellen) Latex- Sandwichmatratzen (or is perhaps also appropriate combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay Roste with greater Lattenanzahl, from 28 and greater stroke do to regulate with Lordosenstütze in Lendenwirbelbereich and possibility which Lattenhärte. 
On verstellbare Lamellenroste no mattresses belong with the skeleton, because they do not respond to the ergonomische disguise --. 
Alongside the recruitment of Steife the pen make specific flexible shoulder modules will also be needed. 
This is a specific fastening the pen, make it possible to make the stroke einzudrücken or verwinkeln so that they can provide the specific Einsinken Schläfers the back of. 
Especially men with broad shoulders for an important cause. 
There are even Matratzenhersteller who have started in 'Herrenmatratzen "soft areas to use the shoulder area. 
Also the honourable is intended - they takes these soft zone in Hüftgegend. 
For most customers are systems (Lattoflex punktelastische wing stroke) or Roste certainly burden with points of contact " Pads Multitorsionsfederung with calls. 
Pressure will be distributed to a number of points, thereby reducing the tensions. 
But, if you are on the right mattress and correct rust used a bad (too big and pillow fülliges) that most benefits are lost. 
Here, too, as a rule of thumb: The pillow is to buttress its head, its leaders should only up to the shoulders rich, so the shoulder muscles to relax. 
Ideal a 50 is therefore x 60 cm big cushions as it may be, for example, the Scandinavians. 
Within the pages of this pillow should (with the side discharge zone in rust or soft zone in the mattress) offset the shoulder height. 
Something have our modern mattresses with the former (with hay) Strohsäcken fat but common. 
Modern manufacturer using ever more frequent natural materials or at least whose mixtures. 
In mattresses the new magic word "bio means." 
Will oil raw materials used in the production of natural oils Polyurethanschäumen increasingly figures - for example Rizinus- and soya oil. 
Soya is used well by all known manufacturers. 
"Bio means in mattresses, which is its core from materials purely natural origin," says Petr Vašíček Tropico Plus by the company. 
Natural substances are used, but also in the manufacture of Matratzenbezügen - one of the first was Aloe Vera. 
One can allow themselves but also micro capsules, the spread in sleeping or Lavendelduft fresh woodland. 
Here, too, it makes a difference between men and women. 
While the men 'kühlender "Pflanzenextrakt is used from Birkenblättern so that Matratzenbezug can absorb the heat and cool the body, have the salary for women" wärmende "effect. 
Extracts from red Paprikaschoten suggest the blood circulation, the weaker sex is in sleeping wohlig so warm. 
And the current favorite? 
Foam mattresses from cold (he has greater Poren Zellstruktur with ruins and is therefore more active than breathing standard polyurethane foams, and also much more flexible). 
Through the combination of various Steife (severity) by Kaltschäumen and Visco's foaming does occur more zones occur 'mattresses who know exactly where we are head, hip and at your heels. 
For a quality mattress, however, has to be made to fork out over 7000 kronor and more. 
Gesundheitsmatratzen are burdened but usually with lower VAT because they qualify as medical assistance. 
The first Czech companies was Gumotex this advantage. 
One looks to save on the mattress and the rust is not so easy. 
Sometimes there are special offers from manufacturers and traders who offer two mattresses for the price of one.

No surprise, but they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts face enormous excess burdens at the start. 
Tempur in heat soft, cool environment it will take root again. 
So there is adapting the human body perfect and distributed in an optimal manner the physical pressure. 
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent pressure fire, but generally the sleep increased comfort. 
Viskoelastische sparkling materials are not only used in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as when special Fußpolstern, which will make the legs and Gefäßen relief. 
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, the sparkling materials Eucatherm C Twinsaver or similar products.
