To hell, warriors! 
Splatter fits the art of cinema? 
The director Nicolas Winding Refn is testing with his fighters' epic poem "Rising Walhalla" old genre's borders. 
To what audience of the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn may have thought, as he "spun Walhalla Rising"? 
A captured Vikings' warriors with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) liberated from its Peinigern and places with almost superhuman forces, piles his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action just because, like our hero used thuggish killing methods, and his foes just usurping the Gedärme from the vibrant body, if he has a bad mood. 
Einauge, on the other hand, as he is called, in fact, says that the whole of the film about a word, and the other characters can stoop to more than just one or two sentences or a few agonizing death scream. 
Otherwise, remains silent and feasted upon the gruselig beautiful hill landscape of Scotland the Wikingerwelt of around a thousand years ago, provides the backdrop. 
Ideal rather adult Cineasten for Existentialismus with interest and very quiet camera for journeys. 
Fine, if a film has several target groups, it is a shame, if they are not mutually exclusive. 
Director Winding Refn applies since his wild and gestylten drug dealers / trilogy "Pusher" as a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, stoically refuses, however, to make his plants with a little more humor the mainstream or slightly less brutality the Arthouse accessible. 
Most arts cinema's friends should themselves from around the Gedärmen spritzenden brain mass and deter. 
The action fans die, then, at the latest before boredom if Einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons way with the force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and an eternity in doldrums and fog is caught before the team is obviously in America and where further remains silent. 
No wonder that Walhalla Rising "in Germany has" found no cinema's lending and now seemed only on DVD. 
This is particularly because of the magnificent images of a shame, but also behind the façade has until prätentiösen bluttriefenden, because hiding a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention. 
In this film, it is not a question of dialogue or a stringent action, it is anything atmosphere, a film as a fever dream. 
And for which there is no escape for the viewers. 
Refn hardly takes him a moment of relaxation and to pack him with its icy and dark images blossom and style very slowly (Sound track each other's throats, but especially with the incomprehensible hatred which badge him from the heart of the players. 
Only a small blonder boy Einauge is faithful to the side, maintained something as innocence, all others are driven by rage. 
Einäugige most of all the hero, whose motives are never explained, but enemies temporary allies and eventually for warriors from the hell will, perhaps to the Ambassador of the devil himself. 
He means destruction, but perhaps for only the already Verdorbenen. 
"Rising Walhalla" is one of the more puzzling film, one can admire and hate, Ärgern, Aufregen and astonished. 
An experience.
