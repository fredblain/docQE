Pilsner soil Fund - detention of the police in a public tender 
In the building of the soil fund set up in Pilsen the anticorruption police made arrests in recent days. 
The European media entrepreneurs and property traders Luboš G. was led away by Detektiven in handcuffs. 
This had allegedly tried to manipulate public competition to take place for a just settlement of Restitutionsansprüchen so that the land in competition offered zufielen a specific bidder. 
Luboš G. for this is to have half a million. 
"At this moment I can only confirm that the police listened to a person because of the offence of fraudulent practices in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Public Prosecutor of Pilsner newspaper Právo, "further details they could not in terms of the ongoing investigations. 
24 hours later of the 46 year old businessman from the police has been released again. 
At how he was able to manipulate the public competition, we can speculate, given the paucity of official information. 
The Fund Lubomír Černá Speaker of the ground led to the question from Právo, the police have made in the Pilsner antenna of soil fund actually arrests and this during a public competition. 
"It was a client, and not one of our employees," it explicit. 
The public competition was held, according to Mrs Černá the correct description 'call for tenders by requirements on the transfer of land, in accordance with the law "and in cases in which a number of applicants offered bezeigen interest in the land. 
"In the context of these persons offer call a higher value of their by the transfer to begleichenden Restitutionsansprüche, as proclaimed land value." 
"According to the claims offered the sequence of the potential acquirer will be established, then the land fund the land transfer to the person with the highest offer," said the spokeswoman of the fund. 
Luboš G. were obvious information available to anyone who had registered on the request, and as it was a legitimate person because he had bought a number of Restitutionsansprüchen, he offered a land interests that he is withdrawing from the competition. 
Clearly against a big compensation. 
It would also be a satisfactory explanation as to why he had to arrest him such a large amount of money. 
Luboš G. had in the past, too good contacts, the Pilsner land fund. 
So he played in the issue of the former head of the Soil Fund Václav Sankota a role that was prosecuted because he issued in Ersatzrestitutionen land on which location decisions on projects have already been taken. 
Then Luboš G. acquired by the soil, for example, property funds, which were intended for the construction of public roads, to be precise, planned on the site of the construction of the commercial area pole Zufahrtsmagistrale Borské was. 
Later, he continued these very favourably with the government against a house directly in the historic centre of the city, that the value of land far exceeded. 
The town hall had to then small mixing heavy heart to jeopardise the construction not through the blocking of the land.
