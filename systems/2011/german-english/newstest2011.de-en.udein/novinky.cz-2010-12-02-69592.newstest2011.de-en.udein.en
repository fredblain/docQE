American soldiers have a new 'smart weapon. " 
American troops are deployed in Afghanistan for the first time, a new "smart" weapon, which has so far only under its code name XM 25 known. 
The generals hope that these new automatic weapon affected the conflict with the Taliban, and the balance of power shifts in their favor. 
The new weapon is such a thing as a super accurate walnut. 
Their projectiles are channelled namely by laser with an accuracy of just a few metres into the goal. 
The particular missiles from bore 25 mm, which have been developed for this gun and high explosive bomb contained, function practically as small grenades. 
The shells can be programmed, so that they can't just explode on impact on the target but at any given point of their ballistic path. 
That means that we can use it against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle - a wall or the trench. 
From above, it is not normally protected, the murderous steel cluster rain from above can put it so easy, apart from the battle. 
Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM / 25, the new battle rifle is the first infantry weapon, the "intelligent" technologies to harness power. 
"The soldier is basically as before: He reshape the goal in and sends a beam from the distance, so he gains a precise target point, after which the increase corner corrected, then he needs only abzudrücken. 
"We say, they have measured 543 metres." 
"If you abdrückt on invites the weapon and are shooting the Geschoss on distance 543 metres plus or minus one, two or three metres.
