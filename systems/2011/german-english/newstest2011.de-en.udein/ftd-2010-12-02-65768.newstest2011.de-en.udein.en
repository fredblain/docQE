Ogoniland is torched 
The water in the rivers has ölbraun, it looks like at the pump: Ausgelaufenes billion litres of crude oil have destroyed the natural in Ogoniland in Nigeria. 
The people live by theft, corruption and illegal Ölkochen. 
Celestine Akpobari thinks it well. 
"Haunts you are not," reassured the eco activist the journalists: "You will still get enough oily slime before the lens." 
Nigerians of 37 years has followed the trial, until the chest in water watenden boys with the surrounding Schlieren abzulichten: Where regenbogenfarbenen water glamour the scene almost looks pretty. 
That brown Rohölschwaden floating beneath the surface, is not to be seen. 
Previously they have gathered here bin way shrimps, Esther Badom on the shores of the Bodo's Jetty tells river. 
In the meantime, the lazy river water was completely dead. 
Five years ago from a hurled geborstenen vast quantities of crude oil pipeline in the vast wetland. 
Fischer from the nearby city Bodo must row now six hours to reach fish containing waters: That in the heart of the Niger delta, Ogoniland is regarded as one of the worst regions verpesteten the world. 
On the journey from the river basins Mangrovensümpfe criss-crossed the full extent of the devastation becomes apparent. 
Rather than shedding bright water, the motor boat on wühlt brown brew was who appears his hand into the water, is drawing ölige fingers. 
The roots of Mangrovenbäumchen ends as black Lakritzstangen out of the ground, occasionally palm trees are sad alienation from the Wedel. 
Vogelschwärme, as they are in wetlands normally meted out: Once the External Border remains silent, is spreading in the as a petrol station riechenden former paradise gespenstische calm. 
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari gloomy: "We live in constant danger to the health '. 
The war analogy is appropriate. 
The municipal area of the Ogoni is a disputed battlefield for decades: The first one from Europe Explorateure burst more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance here had to the Shell company organised adapt in the 1980s, later executed with the writer Ken Saro Wiwa in 1993, his production because it was too dangerous for its oil workers. 
Still today is the company return Ogoniland denied: While from the whole of the delta region of three times the size of Switzerland, with over 5,000 Bohrquellen and seven thousand kilometres of pipelines every day, more than two million barrels of the black gold being pumped, are the oil fields in Ogoniland fallow to unstable is the corporation the situation. 
All ends few hundred metres of steel Gestelle as fanciful sculptures from the water: "Christbäumchen" are called the heads of the boreholes too zärtlich. 
They are up to 50 years old, most korrodiert to its core. 
Always such a Bohrkopf breche apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream rinne crude oil into the water. 
More than two billion litres spilled in 50 years, according to estimates by experts into the ecosystem of the delta: Year after year, the amount of oil, as at the time of the shipwreck of the super tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the sea off Alaska became - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind. 
Who is to blame for the persistent organic MCA responsible, it is argued. 
While the Shell Power corporate sabotage and the organised Öldiebstahl for more than 90 percent of the pollution responsible, environmentalists berstende Bohrköpfe lecke pipelines and see as the main culprit. 
Shell in Nigeria to attach much lower safety standards as elsewhere in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner accused the company in 2008: The rate of defects of the lines was "much higher than elsewhere." 
In a place that looks from a distance as an abandoned, ölverschmierte workshop outdoors are appearing from the mangroves figures: They are cluster naked and ölverschmiert up to its neck. 
Under one of the many cellars, which are partly connected with tubes to locate dispersed sometimes arbitrarily on the site, a fire flackert: An illegal refinery. 
In the barrels of the crude oil on the fire will several hours long inflamed passions, explains Michael, the head of the group. 
First petrol through the pipes into Auffangtopf, later headed kerosene and diesel, spits out in the end. 
So Michael and four staff on a daily basis, up to four barrels produce diesel à 300 litres, "which brings us 34,000 Naira" - around 22 dollars. 
The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state of black Africa. 
Nigeria have only a single refinery. 
Those with barely 40 euro cents per litre of ridiculously low price of diesel can undercut the illegal Kocher: Because of their commodity they get for nothing. 
It comes from "Bunkerern" that the pipeline network to tap across Ogoniland: In this way, will be lost to the country as a whole, according to experts in the Niger Delta every day at least 16 million litres of crude oil. 
Only a tiny part of the provisional fashioned methods between raw material being stored illegally, however: The bulk fill organised criminal networks which politicians and senior military officials are to also include, in tankers and dispose him on the world market. 
The debate on whether the environmental disaster is due to the activities of the people or the lax production, believes that the activist Akpobari for purely academic. 
The oil companies "would not be perceived as invaders and they had destroyed the livelihoods of fishermen not as thoroughly, there were neither sabotage or theft and illegal mills." 
Now the ratio of the Ogoni was would destroy Shell but, above all, to the extent that a withdrawal of the company calling only: "Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese turn out to be better." 
Since Michael nervous. 
"High time that it disappears," says the muskulöse Ölmann. 
Can come "every minute the soldiers." 
Illegal Ölveredler of the special forces are caught, they are no arrest, but a painful bribes. 
Also the north come mainly from the country want - as soldiers all Nigerians - benefit from the raw material. 
"This damn stuff has brought our country in every respect to the dog," Akpobari says.
