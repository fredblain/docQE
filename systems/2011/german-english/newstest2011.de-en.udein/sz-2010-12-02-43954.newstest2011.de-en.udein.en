Until 2015 they expect even 200,000 immigrants. 
This small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants for a heavy loss.

After a decade of the boom, which has brought great prosperity for the Irish, now us once again is gaining ground. 
Uncertainty the economic crisis, in particular the young, well educated people of Ireland, for whom it was previously, only uphill. 
Jobverlust and social decline seemed in the boom years of absurd. 
Everyone was needed, money was there in abundance. 
Now, but three out of ten men and women under 30 are without work. 
In the Irish Times, there are countless reader letters of young immigrants, who complain: "Everything is going down the drain in Ireland." 
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and our country will lose a whole generation '. 
"The last person is then ask the light."

How it feels to build elsewhere, Seán O 'Donovan knows for half a year. 
Because it had to do so for the 29 years of engineering in Ireland, and nothing more, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues at the construction in Germany. 
They high draw in Gelsenkirchen took just a fashion house. 
In January, it is further to Hanover or Berlin, on to the next project. 
His country sees O 'Donovan now only rarely, since he makes extra classes to the credit for abbezahlen his house at home. 
"The situation is a little bit crazy," he says, as it comes after a long time, for the first time, on the eve of his home. 
"I earn money in Germany on a house in Ireland where I am as good as never more." 
He laughs rather move and goes through ausgekühlte spaces. 
The little house is on a fine with leafy residential front gardens, park in Einfahrten big, expensive cars. 
Together with a sister O 'Donovan has bought the house for four years for 380 000 euros - credit funded 100%. 
"There were crazy times, there was easy money, without a lot of questions," he says. 
He is afraid that it could go wrong with the credit? 
O thought Donovan for a while, to pour hot tea and says: "I have no children that I feed must and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch." 
The structural engineering may not the complaints, which he listens often at the moment. 
"No one should starve our situation is, but not nearly as dramatic as in previous times here on the island," he says. 
"A while working abroad, this is not the worst thing that could happen - maybe we feel it only as Irish." 
He laughs and then told by his father, who has moved in the last great economic crisis, to England. 
"After seven years ago, he was back, and life went in Ireland, quite simple." 
Cian Tanner like this idea. 
Leaving the future and look just as it is with the living elsewhere.

But there is one thing that worries him, posing in those days: The ceremony on his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin. 
He fears that it could in a goodbye party get out. 
"Just a lot of emotion, not to say," he and drink a great Schluck from his beer. 
"Goodbye, it sounds scary." 
"We loosely call it a rather Weggehparty, quite, with a few friends, a few drinks, a couple of games."
