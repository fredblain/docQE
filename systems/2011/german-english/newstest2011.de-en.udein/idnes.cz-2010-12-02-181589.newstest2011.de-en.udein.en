The army has so many Zündschnüre that we could quite umwickeln the Czech Republic you think but only two years 
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometres Zündschnüre, detonated with bombs. 
In the year before, the Ministry of Defence had already made 224 miles powder to the army camp. 
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have ausgesorgt for 225 years. 
The only problem is the durability of Zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years. 
The Army bought the Zündschnüre of the company STV Group, for example, come to a mere 40 million kronor. 
In its explanatory statement, the purchase of the huge quantity of powder replied the General Staff for MF consume Dnes, the soldiers would annually to 60 kilometres of powder. 
According to the research of Armeepyrotechnikern, the MF accosted Dnes that emerges from this indication that the whole of the army would have to go through an intensive year pyrotechnic training - of all of the generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaners. 
Defense minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded. 
Only the remarkable annual consumption of 60 kilometres Zündschnüren reasonably can be justified. 
This length is also actually 25,000 Detonationen. 
But even so this army stocks would be sufficient for more than ten years. 
But if the old set of experts is that two metres powder enough for the training of every new professional soldiers completely, then the army through this Neueinkäufe has been, even under the terms of the increased needs of the pioneering special forces - a reassuring stockpile created for the already mentioned, 225 years. 
Soldiers in the process of rapid deployment Brigade recently complained the defence minister, Vondra, they had almost no cartridges for small arms, so profound are limited due to lack of funds. 
The under trousers shortage to say nothing. 
"I do not go well, why do they buy such vast quantities Zündschnüre of us." 
But it is ultimately their decision, they will know to what they need them. " 
"For us, the army is like a good customer, we come as traders largely look," the marketing manager of STV Group Jan Děcký says. 
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of powder so that, the army would have been so at least eingedeckt for ten years with this "ammunition." 
Jan Děcký of the STV Group, but only for a period of four years of use Zündschnüre Armeepyrotechniker and police, and only two years ago. 
"In perfect storage also are probably four years, mentioned possible," admits of them, but I want to be accused as a soldier not criticism of the army. 
After the expiry of the duration of use must be tested thoroughly any munitions, whether it is reliable, and not the life of soldiers at risk. 
These tests are not in vain, but will cost more money. 
Another argument of the Defense Department is the quantities rebate for 445 kilometres powder. 
"They cost us 60 per cent less than last year's supply of 244 miles', tells us the viewpoint of buyers Pejšek spokesman of the Ministry of Defence. 
Only by way of comparison, the annual consumption Pyrotechnikern Zündschnüren by the police, the disposing of ammunition from the second world war, the Soviet army or brother, 1,500 metres more than a few years. 
And the police only ever ordered such quantities of these munitions, which can consume it before the end of the use of the long term. 
The safety of Pyrotechniker because, in addition, it holds open up the possibility of flexible shopping more modern and reliable Zündschnüre. 
The Ministry of Defence already has huge problems in the winding up of tens of thousands of tonnes of munitions from the times of the Warsaw Treaty when the Czechoslovak zweihunderttausendköpfige People's army was preparing for her campaign on the Rhine. 
The Pyrotechnikern, the MF Dnes accosted, the Czech armed forces expected in a couple of years ago, the same problem in the elimination of hundreds of kilometres of old Zündschnüre she has bought today as "good."
