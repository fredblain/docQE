Arsenic � resistant microbe could new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere permit 
The discovery of a foreign variety of bacteria that can live and others, of arsenic, opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere. 
Even though scientists this unusual bacterium discovered here on Earth, it is their view, a sign that a life is also without the vital elements saw as possible. 
"This body has two options." 
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." 
"That makes it a very particular reason, although it is almost a kind of 'alien' way of life," said C.W. Paul Davies of Arizona State University and fellow author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science. 
So far, six key elements have been viewed as vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur. 
However, as the researchers found, the bacterium in Californian mono Lake continues to grow even when it replaced phosphorus by arsenic. 
'One wonders what else is still possible, "the fellow author of the report, said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University. 
The discovery is an important step in the search for living außerirdischem, since scientists recognize life and its forms must, Anbar. 
The study concerned with microbes that have been found on the planet. 
Announcing a press conference in which no details were given to the discovery known, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report of the discovery could act außerirdischen life. 
This is not the case. 
The discovery "shows that other planet systems organisms with the help of other elements include biochemical processes can set in motion, and that the 'standard elements', which in our opinion that are absolutely vital, not necessarily clear Charles Cockell, a professor at the Research Institute Planetary and Space Sciences open university of Milton said," Keynes in the United Kingdom. 
Cockel was not part of the research teams. 
"This work is a first, because it shows that one element in fundamental biochemical processes and structures to be replaced by another," Cockell added. 
This discovery was not accidental. 
Felisa Wolfe Astrobiologischen Institute's Simon from NASA, which led the study chose the mono Lake because of the high level of arsenic content. 
As arsenic and phosphorus chemically identical, they took that microbes, who are both suspended, may be an element that can be replaced by another. 
"The toxicity of Arsens is based mainly on the fact that it is chemically similar to phosphate." 
"That the organisms would find it hard to distinguish one element from the other." 
"But the difference is so large that arsenic works unlike phosphorus. It enters our biochemisches system, where it covered almost everything," said Anbar. 
Researchers from the bacterium GFAJ 1 increased arsenic concentration. It to contain itself and grew. 
The microbe grows in phosphorus better, but that it can also survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic occur based life form could happen, of course, either to earth or to another planet or moon, where arsenic more often. 
According to Jamie S. Foster, Dozentin for Microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that white phosphorous can be replaced by arsenic, not new, but so far there was no functioning example. 
Arsenic above came in the early Erdjahren more often, she says, so the science is on the assumption that early life forms have used it. 
"This is reason to believe that life may have evolved, unlike in early Erdzeitalter," Forster, who was not a member in Wolfe's Simon's research team. 
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National health authorities.
