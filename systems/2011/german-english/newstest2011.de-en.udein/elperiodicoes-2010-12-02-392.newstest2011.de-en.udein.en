On the hunting after WikiLeaks head 
Obama appoints a heavy responsibility for the fight against terrorism, to prevent new revelations. 
Interpol from is a red alert to the persecution and discover by Assange has. 
Everything with WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange has to do, is a complicated maze, in which the facts to enlighten only difficult. 
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red alert" to "discover and persecution" by Assange has. 
However, it is not a traditional order the arrest. 
In addition, it is not new, it comes on 20 November. 
It has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse, which the Australians must meet in Sweden. 
Also the lawyer assured the founder of WikiLeaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they could make contact with Mr Assange has." 
On 20, the international police agency based in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden issued the warrant, but it has been given until yesterday after receiving the power by the Swedish authorities do not know. 
As things stand. The 188 Interpol countries depend to identify and track down Assange has "provisionally arrest and extradite him." 
Although Interpol cannot impose the arrest of an individual involved a red warning, many member countries consider according to the organisation the red warning as a licence for an Arrestierung - the needs of the national police will be carried out, particularly if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as it is in the case of Sweden and the United Kingdom, when Assange has is probably. 
Action causing Assanges lawyers gesten published a letter in which they informed about the 39 years of the founders of Wikileaks is prepared to answer the questions by video conference, the Swedish authorities. 
They also recall that Assange has applied for exit from Sweden, and from the state lawyer, which is being compared with the Pavlovich sagenumwobenen Lavrentiy Beria, security chief of Stalin, who received such approval. 
"This is like a hunt, not as a legal persecution," is accused in the letter. 
While the world is looking for him and his mother - claimed by Australia from the innocence of her son - thinks Assange has not at an unknown location on, but in silence. 
Monday he was the head of the magazine Time via Skype from an unspecified location in an interview; the conversation, he asked for the resignation of the Secretary of State of the USA, Hillary Clinton. 
"If it can be shown that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats, the United Nations, in order to spy on and has violated international agreement signed by the US, they would have to resign," he said. 
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, that the request to resign as a "ridiculous and absurd." 
"I am not sure why we should care about the opinion of a type with a Web site," he told CNN. 
Obama himself has asked a heavy responsibility for the fight against terrorism - Rusell Travers, with the prevention of new documents of revelations. 
The attempt by the spokesperson of Pr√§sidenden Barack Obama, Assange has to pay less attention, is contrary to the opinions, proclaiming the conservative politicians and commentators in these days. 
Congressman Peter King, will lead from January chaired the National Security COM Mitee of the House of Representatives, has asked the state department to investigate the possibility of WikiLeaks to the list of terrorist organisations to send to "seize their money and everyone who supported you or contributing to pursue." 
Tom Flanagan, adviser to the Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to his statement, Assange has had to "revoke be murdered." 
"Obama should transform it into a target and use a plane not bemanntes or so what." 
Who have not apologized, was Mike Huckabee, baptistischer Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and of possible presidential candidate. 
"Anyone who was there, the leaked information in the government, he is guilty of treason and everything is not an execution is eiine too lenient sentence," he told the station, Fox.
