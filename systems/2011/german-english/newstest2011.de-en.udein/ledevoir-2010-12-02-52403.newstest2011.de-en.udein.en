Secret of Canada lifted komplexgeschüttelten 
The new, American diplomatic cables that were disseminated by WikiLeaks to reveal the secret about what the United Nations consider under the inferiority complex of the Canadians with the Americans; they openly show but with the same blow the superiority the latter towards Canada. 
Consequently, American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters on the ballot has not the Canadian / American relations in the spirit, and they believe that the visit by President Obama would have helped the Conservative government to impose its budget from 2009. 
The four new communications between the US embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were prevalent yesterday publicly pikante provide more details as the very substantial content, in which it has knabbern too. 
A carved on 22 September 2008, that is, the period in which the federal Wahlkampage was in full swing, as reported, the point at which the United Nations no longer participate in the operations of its political leaders are discussing. 
To the great surprise from David Wilkins, in Ottawa used, American ambassador. 
Mr Wilkins statement offers different ways in this situation. 
"The Canadians led a near economic inferiority complex, possibly Canadian, political leaders are much more likely to talk about the internal disputes of everyday life to blame than the United States in this election the buck) (such as 1988 during the campaign about the free trade," he says. 
Concludes the United Nations, he is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: Omnipresent, but potentially to menacing to talk about him." 
The ambassador understands the "deafening silence" the less, because the two countries have a strong political and economic relations. 
"Logically," he judged that "should be the ability of a candidate, a party and a lot more of a Party chiefs to drive such a crucial relationship, which has of voters at the ballot box as a key factor in the end." 
The other expression of this sense of importance is in the on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business sources in Ottawa, communication, to prepare President Barack Obama on his first visit in Ottawa correspondence. 
"Their journey will help to ensure the continuation of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, when Canada its first deficit after more than a decade will be known, this has come about because of a recovery program of $30 to $40 billion," Breese describes. 
Anywhere would have to be postponed, he had said that the government had the parliamentary meeting before Christmas to prevent Parliament plunged by the coalition and would this conditional continuation of the opposition parties on the quality of the proposed recovery plan. 
Another, in January 2008, and carved by the ambassador Wilkins wrote communication released Washington came from the increasingly negative image that broadcast on CBC, dramatic serial spread from the United States. 
The Ambassador is worried about mailings as Border, little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can see little more subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no fly list" or contributions for the purpose of interrogation Muskelprotze administered by the CIA. 
Yet another announcement reported extensively, as Hillary Clinton remarked in its French counterpart Bernard Kouchner have asked for her first bilateral meeting on whether Europe should be willing to accept some of the prisoners from Guantanamo Bay. 
Mr Kouchner will have answered the question, yes, but on the basis of an individual 'case to case, "decision. 
Àm end of the meeting, described as "of the Secretary of State, he has issued a paper on Omar Khadr, a 15 year olds Muslims Canadian origin." 
"The Secretary of State has promised, by the acts again." 
We note, finally, that people are getting on the Web site WikiLeaks. 
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper set very close advisers, declared on CBC that the people responsible for this massive leak "should be killed." 
He had talked on Mike Huckabee from the United States.
