Secretly in the middle 
In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband of Argentina's President, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, the driving their popularity rate by 20 points at about 50% upwards learned; this is the highest value since its election in 2007. 
Its but that in the next year into a reelection, depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández is entertain a compromise than her late husband that her predecessor and political partners, Néstor Kirchner. 
The signs are not clear. 
Néstor Kirchner, who drew even after the election of his wife, the economic policy, made often budgets, which take into account the tax revenue, economic growth and inflation, not full. 
This allowed the President some to spend the extra revenue as it pleases. 
On paper, the Fernández government lost in the last year, the majority in Congress. 
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October, leading to further divisions. 
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten rally behind Cristina Fernández. 
But after chaotic meetings (where an parliamentarian another in the face and other government of bribery accused) managed the Congress, not to approve the budget for 2011. 
"I am not going to discuss it," the President. 
The 2010 budget is now for the next year, allowing the President has more opportunity to spend money as they see fit. 
The economy is hot: They probably will grow this year by up to 9%. 
The official inflation z.Z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and salary demands of the trade unions - pushing up the value to nearly 30%. 
Kirchner, who has been beset it took office in 2003, when Argentina from economic crises, said growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not lowering inflation. 
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, the private sector and has singled out for bullying as his säuberte the National Institute for Statistics and census Indec, subsequently schönte the official inflation statistics. 
Mr Fernández now we can take? 
It has called on the private economy and trade union leaders to talks. 
According to official statements and wage increases are to be limited in the next year to 18%. 
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy. 
But the inflation undermined the growth spurt by a big devaluation in 2002. 
Cristina Fernández would possibly why Argentina join financial economically to the rest of the world. 
Earlier this year, the Government made an agreement with shareholders who had rejected the previous restructuring of the country in 2001. 
Fernández now appears on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club to urge, which it owes about $6.7 billion. 
The Kirchners had rejected a review by the IMF, as is the custom elsewhere, always. 
But in the last month, the economy minister, Amado Boudou announced that the fund will be in the process of drafting a new national consumer price index "technical assistance." It seems that the first step would be to the cleansing of Indec. 
It is not known whether Mr Fernández will be after the end of its term, even without the support of her husband is politically active. 
If so, they need to get the support of the middle class, which has largely Kirchnerism enough. 
If the Argentines return in March from their summer holidays, the wave of Sympatie, which was shown to her, will be largely fizzled. 
If they want to win another election, it must decide whether to lift many political decisions quietly to her husband.
