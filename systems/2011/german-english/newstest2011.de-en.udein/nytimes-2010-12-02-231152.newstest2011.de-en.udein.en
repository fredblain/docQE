Police operations in China will be smooth 
As a training officer stepped in Tang Shenbin on an urban space, reviewed its jittery subordinates and issued with military authority voice and more muted orders. 
He wanted to that its female members of the Chengguan - China's robust riche impress the urban planning, feared and despised for their random raids and their tendency to violence - the viewer. 
"Just are!" 
"Look ahead!" 
"He shows them," it is to them, "as beautiful girls are so!" 
Four girls, barely grow out the teenager's age, with white gloves and identical olivegrünen jackets and trousers were blind. 
Four pairs of black pumps were in gerader series. 
Four proper hats were perfect on the with blue and white ribbons gestreiften hair held. 
"For me, they are, on average,," Mr Tang said. 
"Models are pretty." 
Several governments have already tried to revamp the image of China's city inspectors.

Since 2003, 13 women increase urban police patrols. They were specific because of their appearance, selected its good character and their youth. 
They are supposed to make the crude police a softer, femininen aspect. 
Unfortunately, however, it would also be a Scarlett Johan Son little to improve the bad image that the Chinese command of this city. 
Right, so the critics. 
Unlike the police these officials should assert the city laws only through fines or other administrative penalties. 
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture. 
In January 2008, officers in the province of Hubei beat a bystander to death, when he filmed them with his mobile phone, as it nullified a protest action against a dustbin. 
Last year a training manual of Beijing officials have been stolen and published on the Internet, such as criminals without bloodshed can be beaten.

"Chengguan the government fear power" lamentierte national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy about the tactics. 
The newspaper called a "truly thorough cleansing." 
Skeptics are the current approach is clearly inadequate. 
The Distrik sought in October via display eight female recruits, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News, the question of whether the women had intended to serve real tasks or only as optical distraction. 
Probably both. 
According to make display women were looking at the age of 18 to 22 with a good figure and "harmonious face trains." 
They should be large - on average 1,5m or 5 feet, 2 1 / 2 inches. 
The employment relationship ends with achievement of the 26th year of life. 
According to the officials of the activity for women over 25 is physically too demanding. 
"The most important is their image," a district official unbenannter stated in quasi ruling Rednet.com website. 
"Whether the candidates will get the job depends first of their appearance, such as size, weight, face, etc." 
Then temperament and "inner qualities come." 
Chengguan put "women are like," he said and added, "but they also have other responsibilities." 
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the city government of the southern, this description would not endorse 
Admitted, though, that sizes in advertisements for both sex are not unusual in China. 
The same is true for uniform face to face. 
Whether it is the same thing as good design, is a controversial issue in China. 
But people with disabilities or physical changes need not apply. 
"We can here, unfortunately not blind or Buckligen use," Mr Zheng. 
"Their image would not be a good thing." 
Liu Yi, patroliert Baoguang Square at the close of one monastery, is 22, has a well geformten Apfelbäckchen and mouth. 
Empfindetes not put them as sexist that so great value on their appearance. 
"Find you, I see in these uniforms sexy?" She wonders with ironischem glance. 
Their colleague with Grübchen who commented on 21 years of Xu Yang, said, "We have a duty to represent the image of the city."

Every morning the Streife deals with approximately 12 street traders try which, on foot or on bicycle to sell as many as possible and rolls Tofugerichte before they are further being hunted. 
"Mr Wang, disappear you here please." 
"We have already told you so often!" Declares Frl. Xu a trader who fled on foot and was his on a Fahrradkarre befestigten Nudelküche temporarily abandoned. 
According to the officials, the activity is rather monotonous than demanding. 
"It is almost the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, 20, in the leisure distribution system studied. 
Everything "routine." 
One reason is that the female servants must not the goods of the traders, as their male colleagues have. 
They can criminals only threatening to notify it of her male superiors. 
This is to protect them from public hostility to which officials in China are often exposed. 
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rioted after the rumor told, Chengguan's officials had killed a dealer. 
More than a dozen police officers and the Chenguan officials were injured in the night of the incident, 14 government vehicles were being undermined or set on fire. 
Xindu remained insulated from such violent incidents so far. 
But unrest cannot be ruled out. 
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square in which the female servants patroulierten this morning, about 50 people gathered at a street corner. 
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, which was repaired in contravention of the rules on the sidewalk instead of a workshop. 
The owners cried a hue and cry.

Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male Streife, remained, but he turned around his white names shield to remain anonymous. 
As their colleagues play the coordinators - men over 40 - a purely supporting role. 
But they have not been trained to present a clean image. 
Verbally "sometimes we go." 
"Sometimes but also physically," says Mr Li calmly. 
"Most of the time to catch people with the dispute."
