Love in times of war, 
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer has started to work on her first appearance, still nameless auspices, there is trouble. 
The script they have written themselves, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man. 
We do not know much more about it, but that is enough to cause trouble. 
Stubbornly the rumour is that the woman, a Muslim, verliebe during the Yugoslavian war in her Serb rapist. 
Bosnian women's organisations have protested immediately, after which some people in Sarajevo planned Drehtage were transferred to Hungary in the short term. 
Now the film is off in Hungary and in the post production, but there are still protesting in Bosnia. 
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN's refugee agency UNHCR on Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper reported Jolie - is itself now Ambassador to the United Nations refugee agency. 
Diplomatically it is not - it has offered the women before weeks ago at a meeting in Hungary, which rejected it. 
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, Hasecic. 
Love stories in rape camps have not been there, and Jolie attitude towards the victims her not enough about the script. 
Their organisation has recommended to the UN refugee agency, to dismiss Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reported. 
But what exactly has written Jolie for scenes? 
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read your script, has granted after some ups and downs a Drehgenehmigung for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie was not then anyway. 
The young author even claims to have no political intentions with their film, have worked with a great deal of effort in the Yugoslav conflict, the terrible consequences of war, wanted to show and give all the parties involved have a voice. 
The content of it, however, remains vague. 
So a second Synopsis a film circulating on the web, then, sounds quite different: The lovers knew it even before war and will meet again, as it will, a Bosnian Muslim, trafficked into a Serbian camp, where he works as a guard. 
What is considerably different sounds when the variant "rape victims verknallt in torturer." 
That Jolie film actually begins even before the war - that much is certain. 
The pressure on them, as Jolie, was "unfair and is based on misinformation." 
Can now provide their well only hackers by Hollywood peace: By providing the script, as so many before, illegally into the grid.
