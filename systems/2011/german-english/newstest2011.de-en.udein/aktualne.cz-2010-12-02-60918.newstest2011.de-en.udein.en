What they should do which ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague are familiar neither with Voldemort, nor the 'Konditorei. " 
The new Office of the gentlemen of the capital, from the ranks of ČSSD obviously certain language barriers need to be overcome, in order to be able to understand their old and new members from the ODS in Prague advice and representation at all in the town. 
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has members of the new Council from ČSSD cut off times a little ," as they have control the notorious slang that has become popular in recent years, in which the present coalition partners, in Prague at the helm. 
The encoded vocabulary, which was introduced in the mattered era of Mayor Pavel Bém of the Prague political elite, is borrowed from some of the most prominent actors and Causae situations. 
Surprisingly, showed that the new councils fall in relation to these new notions something in the dark. 
The claim they, at least. 
Voldemort "who is?" 
"No idea." 
"I am more a newcomer in the Prague policy ', Lukáš Kaucký, the new Office of the Commissioner for Culture responded to the test of" godfather's words. " 
But also the Office of the Commissioner Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar manner. 
For example, to the concept of "golf hole." 
"The is the only expression of those who put me here that I would use and again." 
"I think that not a lot of slang." 
From the vocabulary, the daily newspaper Aktuálně.cz had published in June this year, before the election, Congress of the ODS, the editorial editors pickte six terms, particularly those which are notoriously linked with the Prague government. 
The Socialists should the terms' Voldemort, "" most Prague golf hole, "" in the Konditorei go "and" bull neck ,"" betrayal of the capital, "and" verblechen "define. 
Prague Office three gentlemen agreed to the test, the fourth - Mr Weinert, the future head of the Prague education system promised - firstly of its participation in the talks, was declining but then not even the phone. 
The fifth council Mr, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test in the first place. 
"I don't care about these things are, as the Civic Democrats to talk to each other, and I am not passing judgement." 
"I think it is important, as we understand ourselves in the framework of our programmes," he responded. 
As has been suggested, would have realised Lukáš Kaucký in the abovementioned headline supposedly not that Bém mayor, Roman Janoušek is the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former. 
The term 'Voldemort "says Kaucky absolutely nothing and that the only word he erriet the test correctly," was the greatest Prague golf hole. " 
"It is the tunnel Blanka 'says Kaucký, added to security but still," but I know this more from the newspapers. " 
And in jest: "I will probably show a language course." 
The "Gulf hole" will then not only of matador Karel Březina, but also the Office of the Commissioner for the Environment Lukáš Plachý right as Blanka entziffert tunnel. 
Both Social Democrats also know, however, for whom the term stands and Voldemort Lukáš Plachý even knows where is this figure and in that way, what does it mean to be "to be moving in the Konditorei." 
"I believe, in other words, to go to any old Prague restaurant works' Plachý is fairly close to solving the puzzle, when we know that this is the headquarters of Janoušeks firms. 
Březina he asserts, in line with, but this knowledge could have achieved more from the newspapers than this vocabulary own him. 
Judging by the test participants after, it seems, under the Social Democrats, in fact, to be no similar eingebürgerten slang. 
"I have asked my colleagues, but it appears that there is no such thing as us." 
"We would call on us by name, and then we also use words or nickname," the Chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský says - loosely from his party "Hulda." 
"I was at school (Bříza Birke named), but I do not know whether my colleagues mention as" us tells Karel Březina his nickname. 
Deník Aktuálně.cz the newspaper has tried out the names and see as - he works. 
Mr Weinert Office is for the party of the kind of "one's grandfather" or less friendly to the "Old" the representative Miroslav Poche that made before the election by the party machinations Sponsorship attention is being called by some colleagues' Igráček " (famous Czech Lego's figure). 
Nickname are the only thing that allowed the social democrats, in whose use of language. 
Hulínský it may supposedly if it is called 'Hulda "but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman. 
Be Spitzname "Doctor the rubber truncheons' rights' has to do so, allegedly, that Petr Hulínský has earned his title Doctor juris Bratislaver to the police academy.
