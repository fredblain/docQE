Prosecutor will Senator Ensign will not denounce 
Prosecutors the Ministry of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the accusations levelled after his affair with a former Wahlhelferin and his attempt to make her husband, a lobbying against him, the lawyers of the senator announced on Wednesday. 
This decision will put an end to the worst piece of junk against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which caused headlines nationwide and his career was a drubbing he was seen as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. 
As Senator Ensigns office announced that he was about the judgment, after a year of investigation "delighted." 
The ethics committee of the Senate, could still impose an Disziplarstrafe. 
According to the Ensigns lawyers they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were halted, and that no further prosecutions in this matter. 
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case. 
The judgment was for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice a surprise, in their view, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign has flouted the lobbying ban. 
Interviews, emails and other documents, which have been shown for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times, gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of its election agents helped to lucrative contracts, in order to buy his silence about an affair with Hamptons wife Cynthia. 
Cynthia Hampton was during an election campaign Ensigns as treasurer. 
Ensign took contact with a few political friends to give Hampton work, according to the documents and interrogations, he took it for the next recruitment Hamptons lobbying. 
Since Hampton was recently in Ensigns election team, it was, he had a year no lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate. 
According to ethics experts this unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who had before the affair was chummy against the ban on the revolving door 'Lobbykratie. 
In accordance with the published evidence "is apparently a consultation and the violation of the revolving door 'statutes," Stanley fire, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defense of clients, which are in the sights of the government. 
While the Ministry of Justice it officially rejected, the reasons for the decision to give in the case of Ensign, Mr. Fire and other ethics lawyers, the Department seem very cautious in fuelled political prosecutions said after a multitude of failures, which have been followed with great interest by the media, including the decision of last year falling charges against former Senator Ted Stevens because of misconduct on the part of the public prosecutor. 
Prosecutors "are apparently fearful detention," Melanie Sloan said that the chairman of the association, "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organisation whose aim is the fight against corruption in political and government circles in the United States), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr. Ensign brought to court. 
"Which essentially means that high government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added. 
Paul Coggins, main defenders of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call on Monday, a public prosecutor, and another the next day, in which he was informed that the department will not levy charges against his clients. 
Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with prosecutors, in order to convince them that the Senator, acted as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, in accordance with the law ." 
Mr Coggins refused to explain the legal arguments which he had presented to the public prosecutors, more precisely. 
"I am not satisfied, to go into the details of talks between the Ministry of Justice, and I am, just as much has to be said, we believe that we have made the right decision," he said. 
Last month, the Federal Election Commission has decided to discontinue the investigation because of a separate action by the group, after the payment of $96,000 of breach Mr. Ensigns parents to the Hamptons to the federal electoral law. 
The Election Commission said that it had not been enough evidence that the money had been anything other than a gift. 
NV Energy, a major company in Nevada, which for a long time, supported the senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyists work. 
An electronic mail of December 2008 shows that, after the company Mr. Hampton has moved as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a conversation with Mr. Hampton, where he told him that he anklopfe at the Ministry of Interior on a thing. " 
Mr. Ensign was also agreed with Mr. Hampton and other customers for Nevada, and Allegiant Air, to lunch and asked the Transport Minister, to arrange a meeting in the name of the airline, after it had stopped Mr. Hampton to lobbying. 
Than last year for the first time, information burst on this affair to the public, to apologize to Mr. Ensign in his electorate and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been in the order of precedence of Republicans in fourth place. 
After he was struck many months no more, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he would like to see a third term in the Senate. 
In announcing that Mr. Ensign no longer the target of police inquiries, its press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper said the senator hope that the ethics committee very quickly follow the example of the Justice Department and his investigations once figures. 
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada," she said.
