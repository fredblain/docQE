Unexplained Erdarbeiten 
The Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria. 
The country, however, refuses to comment on that - there to be controls. 
Against midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli F / 15 I fighter aircraft are attacking a mysteriöses, würfelförmiges building in Syria. 
It is on the banks of the Euphrates, but the next major city, 30 kilometres away is as the Saur Dair. 
Their name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, which Syria has allegedly being built with help from North Korea in which Quader, hidden in a valley, which departs from the electricity. 
According to a briefing of the US abroad CIA secret service by the end of April 2008, were also under the name of the nearest town of Al Kibar reactor's expression was in a good position to produce plutonium - were from building nuclear weapons. 
For other purposes, however, is the technology from their fifties. 
The CIA conducted a video presentation above with fuzzy satellite images. 
Per Computeranimation they ignored, where what components of the reactor should have been before the destruction, a copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center had fell. 
They also presented photographs that show the buildings, from near or even the Home Area. 
The reactor was stood on the eve of the operation, it was said to have been drawn up but even with fuel. 
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more aware than it was then, of course, the mystery was in time rather greater. 
Former US President George W. Bush, recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was above the offensive is fairly sure that Syria's Al Kibar in building a reactor, but very little evidence was that it was in the country, "an active nuclear weapons programme." 
Some intelligence officers in Europe rather more cautious, and there are still only talk of an "alleged reactor," even if the CIA to keep the presentation of "plausible." 
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. 
Asked how sure he was to have been a reactor, a senior UN diplomat replied only in the summer, neatly, the IAEA has "to provide enough material for questions." 
The rubble of the alleged 'unused military building "surpassed the Syrians may hurry and planierten the site thoroughly. 
Nevertheless, an IAEA team under former chief inspector Olli Heinonen was in June 2008, in el the Kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people. 
In addition, the IAEA received a Member State commercial providers of satellite images from the period immediately after the attack, which is likely to be stronger than the one presented by the CIA. 
However, these recordings are not to get on the market, because of the unknown purchasers - perhaps Israel has - they bought the exclusive. 
, the IAEA therefore cannot verify their authenticity. 
Syria has always claimed, never run a secret nuclear programme or built a reactor. 
The uranium has come from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus. 
But the dismissed the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely. 
Since then Damascus refuses to discuss the issue - just as on the satellite images. 
It also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el the Kibar and access to the ruins of bombed-out building. 
But also Israel remains silent. 
"We will comment on this never," most recently at the time of the attack by acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert reiterated the official position. 
So the investigation of the case has been dragging on since June 2008 in vain and "Authority is becoming a serious credibility problem for," as one senior Western diplomat gives at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna, finally, a grave violation of the NPT in the room is, the watchdog, the IAEA. 
As key to making progress in the investigation the IAEA apparently sees three other institutions that are "functional link" with the alleged reactor, and unlike this still exist. 
The inspectors have neither disclosed which assets are, nor what role do they have or what they does seem suspicious. 
According to the German newspaper they are called internally with the IAEA than Marj as Sultan, the Masyaf Iskandariayah and, in turn, derived from nearby towns. 
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and made on satellite images to find a building complex Masyaf, which is one of the most likely suspect objects. 
It is probably in or just next to a military base - exactly this statement denied Syria, the IAEA access to the three locations. 
In Vienna it is, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will vorgeschickt by the US, auszuspähen at military installations. 
Because the nuclear detectives had become by a typing of the US secret services at the facilities. 
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, and was being transported between the three locations Quader on the Euphrates and the material. 
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could "in connection with the production of fuel." 
Although there were "no indications on sensitive activities" uranium enrichment and reprocessing, and processes that are needed for the construction of nuclear weapons. 
The type of reactor is operated with uranium, which is enriched. 
But where the uranium would have to come from, and where it later, the plutonium should be separated for the bomb, to these central issues there are at most plausible assumptions. 
Unclear whether debris that could offer valuable trace, were stored in three places. 
As disappeared were the hundreds of lorry loads from the face of the earth, no one wants to have information about where the rubble remains. 
The only a few kilometres from el the Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, salt mine al / Tibni, which Syria has investigated in 1998 on their suitability as the storage of radioactive waste, and the IAEA is unlikely. 
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had it in a recent analysis of satellite images on the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review brought in contact with the reactor. 
Admissions from the orbit show but that Syria carried out on three suspect places Erdarbeiten and large container remote after the IAEA has asked for access. 
This may be a coincidence, but has contributed little to dispel the suspicion. 
Moreover, it is said in diplomatic circles to the IAEA have spent many months on a plan for inspections there shows to develop, it should allow Syria to respect any military secrets - the effort alone how much is in the interest of the inspectors. 
However, Damascus is bügelte even this proposal. 
Western diplomats were allayed in Vienna a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, so the matter have no great urgency, is approximately US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a couple of months' special through inspections, one of the harshest means that the Vienna nuclear authority, at the controls. 
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would propose these inspections, has already "a option, for which I am in the future 'spoken, but he hesitates. 
There is a high risk in this way: On the one hand, it needs to ensure a majority of the board of governors of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented are eager to do anything else than an escalation. 
On the other hand, as a diplomat, to bear in mind are: "What if they get in the end nothing?"
