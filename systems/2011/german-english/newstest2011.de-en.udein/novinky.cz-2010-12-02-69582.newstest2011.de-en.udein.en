Czech children to get drunk with Fernet and rum, beer is out - it is simply too slow 
Fernet, rum and vodka, for once, even a good whisky, which has stolen the father from Hausbar. 
These are the drinks, after benefiting drunken Czech teenager be notbehandelt under fifteen most frequently. 
No exception are children who repeatedly ausschlafen their hangover in hospital. 
This is apparent from the experiences of doctors, who will be faced with similar cases in the inclusion of children's departments in hospitals. 
"Beer or wine simply because it takes too long before it is drunk are totally out of fashion." 
"Of today's trend is clearly of hard alcohol 'Luděk Pelikán, the chief doctor of the children's unit in the appropriations Hořovice Právo Bohemian clinic said. 
"Whisky, if we manage to deprive the father from Hausbar a bottle, and, if not, then at least Fernet or vodka. 
"Vodka does not have the advantage that they can mix it with the juice, then smell he so strong," said the chief doctor. 
The Speaker of the school hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him right. 
"Most common concerns Fernet or rum." 
"This is today's alcohol trend, particularly in primary schools." 
"Anecdotal it was also about slivovice, one walks away from home," which led Mrs Jurinová. 
Chief doctor Pelikán, three or four of the ten year olds drinkers in the hospital admission have long been no exception. 
Before the clinic in Hořovice, in which he has been working for this year, he spent ten years in the hospital's ward Pädiatrie Motol, where ambulances ablieferten angetrunkene pupils from Middle and distance selling. 
"A girl had to be allergic four times." 
"Their career began with 12 years ago, when she was hospitalised for the first time, 3.5 per mille with alcohol in the blood, and in combination with" Extase "the doctor described," a particularly severe case. 
"It was in the exhibition site in Holešovice in any dance party." 
"The interesting thing was that there was no mention of their mother at all strange that their daughter was not 48 hours after the home," the chief doctor wondered. 
It is precisely the lack of interest by parents or whose incredible tolerance infringed with the own Sprösslingen is regarded as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children. 
A genuine addiction in the true sense of the word, it is not, according to the experts, in children. 
"Of alcoholism a longstanding chronic dependency is to be understood by the alcohol, and all related phenomenon, and this is not the case for these children." 
Among those who repeatedly drink enjoy mostly a negative the family's social background, is typical, "chief doctor Pelikán declared. 
Motol the spokesperson for the hospital, Mrs Jurinová, approximately 40 drunken children in the European medical department for children and young people were admitted by the middle of November. 
However, only the cases with serious alcohol poisoning that made a hospital stay, a move in the statistics. 
Drunk children, who are taken to ambulatory care by parents or, if necessary, by the police, not to be registered. 
Except for cases where children austrinken only times as a bottle of spirits in a school desk, there is, in the opinion of Mr Pelikán Amplituden three year period, to the 100% reliance Walpurgisnacht is: That New Year's Eve, and the end of the school year. 
"The latter for two reasons - either from distress because of the bad certificate or for pleasure on vacation." 
"I have already experienced Walpurgisnacht seven drink children at once in the opening," Doctor Pelikán stressed. 
A betrunkenes child spend the night under medical supervision, is paradoxically, better off than a child who has to contend only the next day with a nasty hangover. 
The headaches in the morning, on arising from Dehydration and the glucose deficiency, can sell it in hospital with an flüssigkeitsspendenden Infusion with glucose and nutrients that are absent the organism. 
"They are clearly better off, because after the 'beautiful' experience in the evening, to raise them with good humour, without anything that hurts somewhere." 
"They are just a little confused about where they are," Doctor Pelikán acknowledges, it is polluting the patients at least it sometimes good humour, he will be listed in them the costs, the cost of treatment. 
Because of transport with the ambulances and the night in an acute bed come good and to a few tens of thousand kronor. 
"I sometimes have used this as an educational tool, if I have calculated directly to the children at the time of the visit, which has cost her drunkenness, and that it may well be that they have to work for the whole vacation on to earn the money for a single such Fete," Doctor Pelikán added. 
His opinion, however, the health insurance companies are not after Regressverfahren, the demand in order to cure the necessary costs trunkenen children from parents.
