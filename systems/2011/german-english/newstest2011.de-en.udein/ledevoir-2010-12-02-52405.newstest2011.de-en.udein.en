Global plan for renewal of the lighting 
The UN has proposed a plan yesterday in Cancun, on the renewal of the lighting from households, commerce and industry in 100 countries, with a view to achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (CFCs), which is almost a third of the additional reduction that needs to be done to stabilize the earth's climate by 2020. 
This ambitious plan is its position in the concrete steps, large projects, which hopes to implement the UN in Cancun to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments from industrialised countries. 
After yesterday's plan the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (GT) of the earth because of lighting on CFCs cast would be avoided if the White ardent pears, which are as yet a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, through fluoreszierende or better still), by emitting diodes etc (LED would be replaced. 
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. 
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet. 
In Copenhagen last year undertook major Abgasemittenten as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada was to voluntary reduction plans, the global CFCs should emissions by 53 GT downsized to 49 GT. 
Of this balance, however, we should withdraw 5 GT to stabilize from now until 2020 climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius to avoid that this out of control. 
In the White ardent pears 95% of the energy in the form of heat escape, and the remaining 5% of produce the light. 
With Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs we reduced these energy needs, again twice that. 
Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen believe that, on average, between 6,000 and 10,000 hours. 
The new LED bulbs, such as those that brought this week the producer Philips to the market - that society has, in fact, part of the UN study - a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a White ardent pear, which is to give an indication of the potential savings Auswechselungsplanes, which can be used in 100 countries. 
In addition to the fact that issue iese completely new light bulbs very little heat, they will also be able to work with a regulatory resistance. 
And they do not contain any mercury. 
Several specialists showed that Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen have reserves, because they contain mercury, and that is why as they dispose of hazardous waste has to, which is not in the developing countries always possible, but the producers are an adoption centre available. 
The major source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, is not the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but the coal power stations that emit far more mercury to produce the electricity wasted White ardent pears. 
In the United States alone this coal power stations emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually. 
The report gives a detailed account of the gains, which would each country, thanks to the international programme. 
Indonesia would, for example, a $1 billion per year in buying electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2 saved, this means an equivalent of 3.5 coal power stations, whose spiritual Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
