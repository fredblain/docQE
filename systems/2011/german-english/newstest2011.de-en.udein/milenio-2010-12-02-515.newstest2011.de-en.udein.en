With literature the nettle lay 
The second round of 'The taste in the language' was a walk, in which the participants sought to narrative much 
"That the sex in the language I do understand, but ... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?"

The finger on the wound... "brings us into trouble," the Argentine spuckte Schriftstellein sweet the audience, which is mainly from young people did, at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) met, at this of Marisol Shultz moderierten round table remain where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero attended. 
Luisa Valenzuela read a text before they Gonzalo Celorio devoted, and Shultz afterwards as a great narrative marked. Luisa told in the first person, and the originator is that looking is to know what a "wound" and from doctor to doctor, of which it is not the answer, but references to the guidance of its narrative. 
The Infektologen they leave convinced: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound." 
At the end, after a frustrating rapprochement with the trauma theorists, raubte her in the middle of the track, and is her stated but that wound was not a scientific term Psychoanalytiker enthült the secret: "The wound that really open, the symbolic is the scar." 
The main character narrative sighs of relief and concludes that they "of the wound received only that this was really open, and does not exist '. But she is confident that the mood in the language and its pitfalls mingle. 
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both. 
Nicaraguans of Sergio Ramírez presented a entzückende narrative, which he called 'praise of invention', and the finger being mentioned in the wound but discovered. 
With allusions to the magical realism he tells of a famous who brought back the clouds touched far gereiste men or by a girl lost virtue restored; the narrative made a turnaround and reported by America, the great novel, it was not from the beginning of his own doctors and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticised the abundance of the Eroberen told stories.

The Kubanerin Puertorikanerin devoted and their contribution to the large wound of social violence affects their country - such as the whole of Latin America - as a result of the fighting the drugs trade. 
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, not deliberate dedication," she said after she had emphasised that literature is communication and engagement that build up between the author and the readers, like in a "chemical reaction." 
The evening chose the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also hevorhob "the finger of dedicated writer in the wound of the writer." 
He said that, in a rapidly changing world, the intellectual habits and controlling consciousness will turn into dogmatism, and forget that "a small no behind every confirmation and behind every denial, a small favour." 
"In order to be in possession of the idea and the reality of the situation, we must qualify: Like often meant to put the finger on the wound and harass those who feel a lot happier if they think in terms of caricatures, in black and white, prefabricated ideas without nuance, and harass the powerful who prefer, a division of the world in black and white and said he invited to rediscover the spirit of the letter.
