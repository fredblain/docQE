WikiLeaks founder Assange has is supposedly in England. 
The disclosure platform WikiLeaks machine in the United States increasingly under fire. 
Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now seeking an Internet home in Europe. 
The prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman called on, other countries and companies to boycott by WikiLeaks. 
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has, is on the wanted lists of Interpol, after a newspaper report to stay in Britain. 
"Wikileaks by Amazon server squeezed out." 
"Free speech in the land of the free," with shared the Enth√ºllungs activists via messaging service Twitter on Wednesday (local time). 
Shortly before the Internet company Amazon had banished the WikiLeaks documents from its servers. 
Internet activists had used for the publication of the secret diplomatic diplomatic cables to the Amazon Web services (AWS), in order to be able to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents. 
WikiLeaks via Twitter to the step further declared: 'Fine - our dollar spent now to employ people in Europe. " 
If Amazon have such problem with the freedom of speech, "they should stop trying to sell books." 
Amazon have stopped using its servers by WikiLeaks after staff from Senator Joe Lieberman had made enquiries, the television channel CNN reported, citing the Office Liebermans. 
The Chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Amazon had threatened with a boycott, the British "Guardian reported." 
"I would have liked to see Amazon is taking this action in the light of previous publications earlier classified information by WikiLeaks," the senator said. 
Lieberman called, meanwhile, to deny the platform in other countries the use of servers. 
"WikiLeaks' illegal, hideous and thuggery puts our national security at risk and threatened lives around the globe," it was analysed in a communication of the French party senator. 
"No responsible companies, whether American or foreign, should assist WikiLeaks in its efforts to disseminate stolen material."

The Internet activist has described the investigation in Sweden as intrigue of his opponents. 
Kristinn Hrafnsson WikiLeaks spokesman said in London, there have been threats. 
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange has." 
Assange has rightly therefore fear for his safety, said Hrafnsson. 
The WikiLeaks founder will therefore continue to keep themselves hidden. 
Hrafnsson responded to statements from North America. 
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee had demanded that the person responsible should be prosecuted for the WikiLeaks disclosures because of treason and executed. 
In Canada, an adviser to the head of government, Stephen Harper, said - apparently ironic - on television, Assange has "should be killed" and Obama could "use a drone." 
Between the White House and Assange has a dispute arose in the meantime. 
The Speaker of the US President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange has called for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, if she is for newly reported spying 'calls on diplomats responsible. 
"I am not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a type with a website," as Gibbs. 
"Our foreign policy, and the interests of this country are far more important than his a website." 
The American Government now protect their data banks fully to the test. 
As a special envoy of the deputy director of the Centre for measures to combat terrorism to Russell Travers, was appointed, told the White House. 
Travers is responsible "to develop the necessary structural reforms," which had become the message after the disclosure reports by WikiLeaks. 
The White House should also examine ways, such as the entire government to exchange information and protects. 
The US Government also announced, to ensure the safety of dissident and most active, should they fall by the Wikileaks' publication in danger. 
"We have done everything possible to come in contact with them," foreign office spokesman Philip Crowley said. 
"We are ready, they should protect, if that will be needed."
