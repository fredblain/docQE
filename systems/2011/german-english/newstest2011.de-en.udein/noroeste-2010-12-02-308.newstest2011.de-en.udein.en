NASA to cancel the Fund außerirdischen life 
The American Space Agency has called a press conference for tomorrow vorzustelle a Fund, which will have implications for the search for life in space. 
National air and Space Administration (NASA) in the United States is, tomorrow, Thursday, known a astrobiologische discovery, which confirm the theory of the existence außerirdischen life could. 
The Fund will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference on NASA headquarters in Washington by experts of Astrobiologie. It is a science that examines the provenance, development, distribution, and future of life in the universe. 
In convening the NASA press conference, said that it would "take a supervisory high außerirdischem Fund for the search for life," which triggered speculation by experts in other countries. 
The discovery might prove the theory that it was held in hostile environments, the one before for unbwohnbar, human, similar creatures can exist, it has been brought up the hypothesis that this could turn into the intelligent creatures - as human - if their living conditions are improved. 
Ostensibly is a microbe, which was found at the bottom of the mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California, and they live in an environment that was too toxic for all possible ways of life, because the sea is strong arsenhaltig. 
The Mikrobie in any way used the arsenic than survival resource. Taking account of these capacity increases the chances that it might have on other planets, the atmosphere is not about our protective, similar giving life. 
If these organisms verstoffwechseln the arsenic, according the Astrobiologen is evidence that there is "real, a different way of life, a second way of life, which is very different from the familiar to us." 
The space agency known is tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference the real scope of their funds. 
The Conference the Geobiologin Pamela Conrad take part, the study of the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, the titanium (the largest moon Saturns) under the question of whether its chemical composition similar to that of the Earth, read.
