Government bond for the takeover of eXcentris 
The Quebecer government, which has been asked by the Société Angus and the undertakings parallèle to participate financially in the takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris, declared itself with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive loan. 
Developers company Angus parallèle, as well as the company, which had hoped a donation of seven million dollars by the Ministry of Culture for the adoption of which Daniel Langlois cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint Laurent, to bring them back to its real cineastischen function apparently not receiving what they have demanded. 
The government has accepted, to involve itself in this matter, however, on their own terms. 
Instead of the expected donation the Quebecer government offers a bond in lower than initially expected, which could be a viable solution to create favourable conditions in life, at least in the opinion of the state from the rumours entnehmbaren sources. 
A first action plan, as well as a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, which was rectified Bittgesuch since the sum again moderately down. 
A proposal along with an action plan has already been sent by the president "Société de développement of entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, Minister St / Pierre, who is in charge of the Act eXcentris. 
Several days ago, he had sent her a last technical report. 
Against the proposal from the cabinet was the SODEC sent, however, on Wednesday.

Several other participants in the market segment of a charged, however, in contrast, substantial economic aid. 
Cinema leader Daniel Langlois was funded after the ownership structure of the cinema over ten years presented with great difficulty that authors cinema in the premises of its cinema complex, which could justify the exceptional treatment by the Treasury. 
The shortage of cinema, which shows independent films, it is more than obvious in Montreal, and his clientele eXcentris knew to keep on board. 
Société Angus, as well as the companies with Christian Yaccarini parallèle at the top, in turn steer a privately financed Campagne, from which they expect a total of $700, 000 to boost the purchase. 
Since the spring of 2009, only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris: Le parallèle. 
Goal of future purchasers is there that the three cinemas on 27 February of next year, with the exhibition to open up the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux '. 
Christian Yaccarini but did not recall the newspaper Le Devoir "and ignoring what he and his group of the downward revaluation of proposals, which it has made them.
