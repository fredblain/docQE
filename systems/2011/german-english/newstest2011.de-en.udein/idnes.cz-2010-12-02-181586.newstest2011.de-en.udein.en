Ever more parents want to have people monitoring equipment for the kids under control 
The fear for their own children is growing and as more and more parents consider it by GPS to monitor. 
The system, which was invented initially to the tracing of cars, can monitor human as well, which would be useful in such cases, such as the trace recently unemployed Anička Janatková disappearance of nine years. 
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette packet but soon, there will not be greater than a Armbanduhr. 
Many people has enabled the case of missing Anička in fear and terror and so they are looking for ways to protect their children better. 
For the price of a deterioration of their privacy. 
"We are trying to say to everyone that there is no way around this by pioneers, but an effective way to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy," Petr Pilin by society Macro Weil says, is one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices to the Czech market. 
"I admit that it can come in the case of the abuse of such equipment, for example, if there is someone in the pockets, not that he is aware of them, but we have had so far, no such case." 
"Most customers buy it really for security reasons," Pilin adds. 
His opinion, the child should know but, increasingly, what purpose does the "box" and how you use them in an emergency. 
The Kinderpsychologin Dana Bočková, however, points out that a child, if such a thing may not take it its easy to discard. 
"Even very small children are showing great creativity when it comes to certain things deliberately lose if they do not want to be controlled." 
"The phones initially among parents awoke great expectations, but they can be shut down just as easily as to how these new surveillance equipment," Bočková thinks woman. 
Their opinion is also debatable whether such a body in the event of an attack helps. 
"On planned kidnappings monitored the kidnappers virtually always, whether the child has any electronics in itself, it could be located." 
Today, it is the mobile phone. " 
"If such monitoring equipment were wider use, they would find these also because their sales certainly would be accompanied by massive advertising." 
"In these cases, the police, the criminals are always a step ahead," the psychologist says. 
It acknowledges, however, that similar devices can in a sudden attack by a paedophile well be helpful. 
Roberta Čech RC monitoring by society, according to the tracking services for both cars, as well as for offering people, can help, the existence of such an appliance, even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack. 
"The machine can adapt so that it asks each position in certain intervals." 
"Even if it were to be destroyed immediately, at least the final position of the person concerned is available." 
"On more expensive equipment, a bent knife has even incorporated, this means that if you are wrong and hinfällt movement is still sending out, the machine an immediate warning of position," claims Mr Čech. 
His opinion could perform similar services including smart phones with navigation, one needs only einzuspielen a special software. 
The problem of the current positioning equipment, is that it is either to equipment in a matchbox's size, the supporters are similar or smaller mobile phones. 
There is always the danger that you lose them. 
Mr Pilin by the Macro Weil says that testing thus present devices, which look like normal digital watches. 
"This has the advantage that the possible aggressor must not realise that there is a surveillance or positioning device. 
"Or he realises that only after a certain period, which the police are a time advantage," he adds. 
No matter which way the trend is towards Armbändern - or supporters, always used the same technology, such as the vehicle tracking. 
So the combination of positioning function system (as in Ms in the car), and the function of a mobile phone, which reports the current position with the help of GPS.
