Khmer Rouge veterans to confrontation with the past forced 
In a poorly lit class room with dirty and abbl채tternden walls betonierten, the director of High School Anlong Veng reminiscent of the man who built it, to the future, the Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok. 
"Ta Mok everyone here loves." 
"He was a good leader, and he has taken care of its people," Kor Sreng Ma, 42 years has said. 
Known for its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule as "the butchers', the commander, remains popular in this outlying former Khmer Rouge stronghold in the north west of Cambodia, where he has built hospitals and bridges, developing the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers are still living. 
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, longstanding supporters in Anlong Veng will be challenged. 
In April a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims of public confrontation with the people who have supported once the regime. 
In June the government circulated a textbooks that told, for the first time, children of former soldiers in the history of the Khmer Rouge. 
And a Community tribunal in July, the UN and Cambodia's convicted for the first time, a former member of the Khmer Rouge, as it condemned the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison. 
With each of these developments, the fear among the Khmer Rouge grew veterans Alnlong Vengs, hindered their efforts to bring about reconciliation and reintegration into society in Cambodia. 
"There is still disagreement and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Youk Chhang, head of the Documentation Centre said of Cambodia, an independent organisation which the regime. 
It was "for life under the Khmer Rouge glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." 
"It divides even families." 
During the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of diseases, revision or from hunger. 
When the Vietnamese invaded and 1979 the Pol Pot's IED government overthrew, the remnants of the regime and its military have fled to the border after Cambodia, Thailand. 
Here they widespread until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered, unrest. 
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary have led a guerrilla war from its base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok the next generation in Anlong Veng took. 
But in the middle of the 1990s, as a result of the United Nations sponsored peace agreement in 1993 led to the first democratic elections in the country, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to cross on the government, which has led to the Kapitulationen of Ieng Sary in 1996 and 1998, Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan. 
Pol Pot died in 1998, of natural causes, and Ta Mok, who had not given ground, was arrested in 1999 by government forces in the Dangrek Mountain. 
2006 he died in prison in Phnom Penh, where he was waiting for his trial. 
As their patrons, they no longer protected, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters who fled from grinding poverty of rural Cambodia and many of the movement won in nostalgia. 
Even if a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge won their local government posts, because they put down their arms, the ordinary soldiers poor, uneducated farmers were. 
"These people have benefited very little by the capitulation," Sok Leang by the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, said throughout Cambodia, in Anlong Veng, public forums keeps 
"Enshrined in the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime." 
"They grew without any professional know." 
Sor Lim, 55, who had joined in 1974 as a teenager the Rhmer Rouge, fought in the jungle about anlang Veng before he was defeated in 1998 to lead a life than poor rice farmers. 
'Life under the Khmer Rouge was a good thing, "he said. 
"TA Mok has given everyone something to eat." 
"But now, the life is difficult, because we need to look at ourselves." 
The current, the Khmer Rouge Tribunal has caused concern here. 
The beginning of next year, will seek the Court, Nuon Chea president Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to court. 
The request of the court, it is that the old leaders, and those who are mostly responsible for the atrocities to condemn, but it has not said whether it will follow up on these four cases further action. 
It has done little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng. 
Current media speculation has concentrated on In Chaem, 64 years, that was during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's district Manteay Meanchey leader in the province. 
2007 had they told Representative of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, they have led to the construction of a dam Trapeang Thma, a project in which thousands died from forced workers probably. 
On a hot night outside of Anlong Veng In Chaem came back from work in the fields of their wooden house on a dirty street. 
When the sun cast long shadows over the desiccated grass In Chaem refused to talk about their past with the Khmer Rouge. 
The court should call them, would, they refuse to go, she said. 
"Cambodia live in peace and stability," she said. 
"There would be no prosecutions more, would be this war." 
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has fled in 1878 of the Khmer Rouge, has also repeatedly warned that the situation is uncertain, the court would accuse more suspects, while experts and historians to discuss this. 
"Cambodia needs to dig a hole and buried the past," he said. 
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia must do in order to be able to go forward, said Youk Chhang the documentation centre. 
"Reconciliation with the Khmer's times means to bring together the broken pieces," he said. 
"It is our duty to set the broken parts together, so that like everything to understand." 
The centre has created the first of the government approved textbooks on the Khmer Rouge who 75seitige "history of Democratic Kampuchea." 
The book it circulated in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history books for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which is less than four sides contains about the Khmer Rouge. 
How often young people in Cambodia in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, in spite of the links of the city, to the regime. 
Touch Valeak, 19 years, a student in Anlong Veng High School, said that the new textbooks helps the students to understand a significant part of their history. 
But his parents have reacted skeptically, as he brought the book home, to read about it. 
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said. 
"They are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people are being sentenced by the courts." 
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said. 
But the public forums, the textbooks and the court gradually influence, "he said. 
Still the Khmer Rouge has a powerful appeal. 
High in the Dangrek mountains of Str채uchern 체berwucherter and with plastic waste verdreckter path to Rechteck of black soot leading to covered with a pair of rusty Blechdach. 
Pol Pot's body had been burned after his death, in 1998, on a pile of tyres. 
Sothea Nuom, 31 years a Handyverk채uferin at the roadside, said that they do not know much about the man who had been burned. 
"But he has a very strong spirit, and many people here to pray for him," she said. 
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later in the day they wanted to go to Pol Pot's final resting place, where they will take a more mature bush bananas - in the hope that he will bring her luck.
