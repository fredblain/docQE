Red Bull prevails in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens 
The car be improved with a software in real time. 
Since Red Bull in 2004 moved into the world of Formula 1, its history is marked in this splendid universe of speed of surprises and successes. 
Nobody initially gave the newcomer of attention and, despite their sharply rising will fare during the last seasons all on victory for the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso began the final spurt last November. 
Without wishing to diminish the ability of the German pilots and champion Sebastian Vettel or the current strength of the engine by Renault, the "secret weapon," the laid the Multi Siemens Red Bull in the hands, and thus created a winning team, become a legend. 
In reality, is a powerful software to simulation of processes, the 2007 German companies for purposes that have nothing to do with the auto racing, on the market. 
This as PLM called computer programme was used for the development of the assembly chains in factories in the world, power stations and highly precise tools. 
Is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process will, before this will actually be built to avoid such errors and unnecessary costs. 
PLM has the development of cameras by Canon, the aircraft of Sukhoi and of the most famous vehicles from Nissan easier. 
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial department of Siemens, said that the use of this software in the Formula 1 - Red Bull factory "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements which can be found on the race, and on the testing, design and implement. 
Russwurm from leads, in 1992, in the view that, on average, ten engineers worked, in a season which could introduce a maximum of three or four improvements. 
In Red Bulls team today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed. With powerful computer equipment they conduct analyses and all kinds of changes to the cars. 
The Siemens managers explained the PLM software is said to be able to analyse all parts of cars between Red Bull and to improve, with the exception of GM for, only Renault responsible. 
The materials, fuel, Aerodynamik and safety elements to be changed. 
The changes can be, thanks to advanced production facilities and high tech Autoklaven in less than 24 hours, transfer from the virtual reality of Simulators into reality. 
The only border, which is set this crazy technical perfect are the 40 million dollars that a Formula 1 - team must spend his race in a season. 
Red Bull has built its high tech factory for the development and production of its cars in a 50 km away from London. 
There are two buildings, where visits are limited - especially by journalists - strong. 
What is happening there, is Top Secret. 
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber. 
Red Bulls but real Formula 1 - hero is the latest doubt rid world champion Sebastian Vetell. 
Behind the enormous technological resources that makes the energy drink producers in the service of his attendance at the race tracks, further protagonists, whose help inestimably and whose fame is zero. 
The Technologichef the station, Steve Nevey, stressed that it was five years ago, say that the progress made in the area of R & D for cars contributed with 50 per cent for victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest. 
Today the share values have changed. The technology accounts for 85 per cent of success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15%. 
Nevey recognises that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by a computer, because they "are not voraussagbare gladiators."
