World Cup 2018 / 2022: FIFA appoints the Ausrichterland 
In a state of great excitement on corruption suspicions the executive committee of FIFA on Thursday which appoints Ausrichterländer the World Cup 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice, in that order, as well as the lobbying Rangeln influence threaten to push the technical criteria in the background. 
One thing is certain: The issuing 2018 the king discipline FIFA will) in Europe, its traditional stronghold, the 4 candidates (take place: England, Russia, Spain and Portugal, the Netherlands and Belgium. 
Issuing 2022 will be then something exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be the first on the African continent by 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) to win, or its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to pursue further. 
The list of persons) belonging to the Delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch leader, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff provides the level of economic and political use a World Cup. 
The machinations behind the scenes so threatens to stop until the last minute. 
Difficult otherwise, a hierarchy of the candidates set. 
After the evaluation report to FIFA, the English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts offer bessseren arguments than those of their competitors. 
But these considerations for the 22 members of Exekutifkommitees the time of the election is not so important. 
The Sunday Times that with the finding of the suspension of two members was Exekutifkommitees (Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii) at the beginning of the revelations, might as well have had the chance to have their own country, ruining cradle of football, which have only once the World Cup: In 1966. 
The BBC had given the ground again on Monday, when it had an own broadcast, which takes three influential members of Kommitees, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under fire. 
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and to bring the English authorities in embarrassment that had operated primarily with David Cameron in recent weeks of an intensive lobbying. 
The head of government is hoping for a repeat of his predecessor, Tony Blair successful chess train in 2005 for London had made the organisation of the Olympic Games in 2012. 
Meet would enhance this intensive use, for the image of England before Kommitee again? 
Nothing is less certain, as the duo of Spain and Portugal, there are plenty of assets with its already finished stadiums, his expertise (World Cup in Spain 82, 92 Olympic Games in Barcelona, during Euro 2004 in Portugal) and the football culture. 
But the economic and financial black sides of the two countries may dampen their ambitions. 
The possible reprisals against the English, and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal put the chance of Russia, which has become, despite its shortcomings in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport), to the compelling outsider, to rise. 
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has, however, decided, at the suggestion of the stating Bezichtigungen the English press denounced "an unfair competition in preparation for the vote 'by Kommiteemitglieder. 
"We bewirft it with dirt, we tried to compromise them," Putin wetterte. 
For 2022 the United States strengthened by the experience of 1994, appears to be the logical favorite. 
First economic world power, the FIFA seat main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages compared with Japan and South Korea, which have established a very good project separately. 
But these new nominations seem premature for two countries who co-organised competitions in 2002. 
Another threat: The FIFA World Cup very granting of 2026 for China, which will make the Asian opportunity on 2022 lapses. 
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn with an appearance futuristischer stadiums all registers, FIFA has pursued its expansion into new areas, however, these two countries are a greater risk, because certainty. 
Australia might, as well as Japan and South Korea among the European countries akquittierten weakness of television rights (because of the time shift) have to suffer, the sensitive nerve FIFA.
