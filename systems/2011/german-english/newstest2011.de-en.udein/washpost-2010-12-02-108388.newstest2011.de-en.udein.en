Durchgesickertes US document Moscow portrayed as a port of corruption 
Control of the city is in the hands of "kleptocracy," and it is a part of the bribes and the protection money they einsammelt, to the Kremlin, and the American Embassy in Russia reported in February, in a memo. 
Blackmail both police and the state security service high protection money so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, so it is said. 
They collect money not only from legitimate transactions, but also by criminal gangs. 
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has described as "vertical line of power" - takes its share of the money, the relocating the ladder. 
The memo, which was sent out under the name John Beyrle's ambassador to Washington, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on its website. 
The memo is based on sources, whose names have been edited. 
It was written, while still of Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov was, and it accused him of corruption. 
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is little evidence that has been cleared up in the meantime. 
Luzhkov, and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction company, have rejected accusations of corruption over the years, and he has won a number of libel against such allegations. 
In September, he said, a Russian television station, when he was asked after a documentary, which suggests that he was corrupt: "It is crazy, it is a bad way that it is dirty." 
Office An unbelievably large numbers of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, the surveys have shown. 
But it is unusual that individuals are, as has been done in the report of the ambassador, and it is unheard of that happening with a diplomat of a foreign country. 
"The direct link to the government of Moscow with the criminality that has led some to describe it as a" disturbed "and come to the conclusion that the government is more like a Kleptokrat as a government," according to the memo. 
"Criminal elements) enjoy 'kryshna" (a phrase from the world of criminals / the mafia, which literally means' umbrella 'or protection which extends over the police, the State Security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the office of the public prosecutor, as well as by all of the Moscow government bureaucracy. 
Experts have discovered a dreilagige structure within the criminal world from Moscow. 
"Luzhkov is at the top." 
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage." 
"Least the ordin√§ren criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the bottom." 
Inkompetentes "this is a system in which criminal groups to fill a gap in some areas, because the city is offering any assistance." 
The report goes on to say that the FSB collects money from the largest firms, the police and the small businessmen arrested. 
Means a source, so, "declared that Moscow's business owners (to understand that it is best to get protection by the MVD and FSB and not) by organised crime, not only because they have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law." 
"Why the protection by criminal gangs is no longer so asked how sooner." 
The memo noted that, while the collection of the funds is comprehensive to be the protection even very modest, no; even those who pay, are sometimes arrested. 
Those who do not pay to find their business closed very quickly - on the basis of one or other of the pretext. 
Medvedev has spoken several times about how to combat corruption, but at the same time, has said that he has made little progress. 
The message the memo contains descriptions of men who go with with suitcases, which were presumably full of money, in the Kremlin. 
"In his fight against corruption Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of said By voting, a Moscow think tank, in a recent interview. 
"But he is part of that bureaucracy." 
"It is not part of the political class, because there is a political class in Russia no longer exists." 
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, as he says that corruption is inevitable. 
Nationwide, estimates as By declaring that Russia's corruption is costing more than $300 billion per year. 
The country ranks 154 a recent study on global perceptions of corruption through the nongovernmental organisation Transparence International (countries are of "the least corrupt," "most corrupt"). 
The disclosure of the memos, the American Embassy what happened after dusk Moscow time, will certainly claim cause displeasure within the Russian government, though, given that Luzhkov can be blamed for the errors of Moscow, it is in the Kremlin also be a possibility that they solve the problems. 
In an interview with Larry King on CNN, Putin said that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and responded cited furious at the revelation that American diplomats Medvedev him Batman and Robin. 
"The truth is that it is a matter of our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said. 
"But to be honest, we would not have expected that this would happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and to so unethical way, you know."
