China maintains its targets to reduce greenhouse gases continue 
The representative of China declared at COP16, his country has made tremendous efforts to reduce carbon footprints, and it would maintain its offer to reduce by 2020, 40 to 45 per cent of its greenhouse gases. 
China considers his offer the emission of greenhouse gases by 2020, to reduce by 40 to 45%, Su Wei, the representative of this country covered at COP16. 
During his first public appearance on the 16th world of the United Nations (climate change summit COP16), Su Wei, has assured his country have made huge efforts to lower carbon footprints and to the conversion of his industry. 
He has said that his country was in the last four years, 245 million dollars invested to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. 
On the other hand, he said that China would work not change its objectives, but it would, together with the international community on this matter. 
He said that the Chinese strategy on climate change under share in four aspects: Dialogue, capacity building, building of institutions and support pilot programmes. 
In all aspects, we have made progress, including the adoption of a new energy law in the last year, which meant the objectives in terms of reducing the emissions of gases, he said. 
On the other hand, he pointed out that the authorities in the states would have in China with those of the central state and local authorities worked together to achieve the goals to save energy, an efficient use of energy and the reduction of emissions. 
In addition, he has said, some years plans have already been addressed, or completed, both those who were funded by the Chinese government, as well as those receiving the money from other countries. 
For example, he has referred to the programme to Wirksamen use of energy, which has been introduced in the last five years and had received investment by the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands. 
It also runs a project at provincial level to change, another exchange of traditional incandescent light bulbs with energy saving pears and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said. 
Martin Krol, scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, said that the efforts of China are far greater than is commonly believed would be adopted. 
He showed that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China there was six tonnes per person, while they were in the United States 100 tonnes. China is on a 9% overall contribution to environmental pollution. 
It also making unprecedented progress in the area of energy use, energy efficiency has increased in the last five years, by 20% by the year 2020, and another is to happen, he said.
