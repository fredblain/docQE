Clotilde Reiss affair: The Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediating role for Syria 
Internally more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010 was the destiny of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "spying," the French public in breath, terrified the diplomacy in alert and akzentuierte the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran. 
All of this under the close scrutiny of the diplomats of the United States. 
By WikiLeaks and obtained by the newspaper Le Monde through American documents - some of the background to this crisis. 
They describe how the Elysée had told the Americans of his strategy that went as far as to give this advice to deal with its own crisis of "hostage" in Iran (a small group of Wanderern). 
It to show how the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of a young French woman have not the release of Majid Kakavand, a France and held prisoner by the American justice because of trade with material in favor of the Iranian nuclear programme Iranian Gegeleistung wanted to. 
They are, after all, is the way in which the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media to make this credible idea, the Syrian President Bashar Al Assad have played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss, in a harsh light. 
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard. 
A on 12 August 2009 in Paris redigiertes diplomatic telegram is entitled "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with the hostage taking." 
François Richier, Elysée advisers in strategy issues, had been in the company of Mr Paoli, Director of the Quai d 'Orsay in North Africa and the Middle East with the US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone. 
They declared it the French way. 
The advised the Americans to do everything possible, sending their own nationals who were forcibly detained in Iran. 
"Power noise," they were saying "loudly and clearly articulated and endlessly" the words' fundamental human rights ,"" innocence "and" immediate release "in the media. 
This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime in a predicament that respects very sensitive to its image. 
"Is all the more to do as you ask Iranians, that does not." 
Because 'silence solves nothing ," the debate over experiments on at unauffälligem ways, the Iranians are" master in Ausweichmanövern. " 
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreign nationals is a "normal, Iranian tactics": "Of hostages for political blackmail." 
He announces,) the release of Clotilde Reiss from jail (which should come on 16 August, on the day when they) takes refuge in the French Embassy, the payment of a large amount of money to demand that the Iranians' " (230,000 euros bail. 
And he does state that the Elysée antizipiere further hostage taking, a phenomenon that will "tighten up." 
Iranians could "in the near future, another of the approximately 1,800 French citizen arrested who live in Iran," he said. 
28 August 2009. 
Clotilde Reiss 12 days has been released from prison, however, is still being held in Iran. 
An information was circulated: The Iranians, Majid Kakavand, whose extradition request, the United States, due to illegal trade with empfindlichem electronics materials to Iran, has been released after a ruling by a judge in Paris. 
The American embassy, like many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence. 
In Washington, which followed the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material provided for the nuclear programme represents the release of Majid Khakavand a bad news. 
France has taken a horse trading in buying? 
The release of the Iranian opposition to those of the French? 
At a further meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September François Richier assured that this was not the case. 
The Elysée, he says, was not only "quite surprised by the decision of the judge," but have also tried to revolt against it. 
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French minister of justice" (currently, Michèle Alliot / Marie), but 'the French government is unable to change the judicial decision, "he says. 
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under "stringent" supervision of the French secret service. 
The Elysée advisers, a telephone number, to places, then informed the American diplomat, the Iranians were "currently in the chair of the Iranian embassy buildings in Paris." 
Respects during the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran the Elysée his efforts not to think of the media, through statements and organised "flight tests," the Syrian President Bashar Al Assad is playing an "important" and "influential intermediary role." 
Americans do not observe this activity without irony and conclude that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as a number of press articles reflect the official French version. 
One of 25 August 2009 datierendes telegram rebellion evokes "the media bolt the French authorities." 
As much "you can towards is based as" Mr Assad, the Paris Embassy wonders. 
Despite their declarations Lobpreis "with the French authorities to give in secret that they have only a vague idea about what the Syrians did indeed." 
The document deals then to indulge themselves with the reasons that have brought the Elysée to these fiction. 
The intense communication efforts "aims, Sarkozy's policy to confirm the opening to Syria," he examined. 
2008, launched a policy which was then perceived 'by numerous critics vote in France and abroad than premature and unverdient. " 
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" Paris "Syria in mind is trying to lead what laud you can reach by playing a constructive role in the region." 
Aim is also "to sow discord between Syria and Iran." 
The American Embassy know this from a good source. 
On 11 August François Richier had entrusted her: ," of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done whatever." 
"But we are grateful to them, in spite of all of us." 
"This should at least cause confusion on the part of the Iranians." 
Clotilde Reiss returns on 16 May 2010 after France. 
Nicolas Sarkozy, receives in the Elysée. 
In a communiqué it the President of Brazil, of Senegal and Syria, for thanks its "active role in support of the release of our compatriot."
