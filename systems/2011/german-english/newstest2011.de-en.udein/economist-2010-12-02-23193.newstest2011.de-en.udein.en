A electoral defeat 
Nobody had expected that the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect. 
But the facts in some cases exceeded the fears of election workers who rushed to the aid of the beleaguered country, by far. 
Overcrowded polling box repeatedly votes cast, ballot papers in Rinnstein, destroyed local elections and intimidation were the only part of the problems. 
With polling stations opened hours of long delay. 
Many Haitians, many of which by the earthquake had become homeless in January, walked off with around in search of a choice. 
Some tasks after all, quite. 
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged leader, demanded as a result of an alleged fraud, the abolition of the election results. 
Across the country, there was sometimes violent protests. 
Nevertheless called Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, the election "as fairly well in many respects." 
According to a cautious statement from observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "these irregularities may be so seriously they not make the process necessarily unlawful." 
, in other words, the show goes on. 
The electoral authority, which is ostensibly the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jew Célestin, committed, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December. 
The expected runoff is scheduled for January. 
There is still hope in the election. 
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity complaint. 
If Jewish Célestin, with voters little or no support, declares the Wahlberhörde the winner of the runoff, this could lead to problems. 
Because of the cholera epidemic, and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims are still living in tents, was feared a low turnout. 
On election day, many Haitians have been prevented by a lack of organisation of the vote. 
Shortly before election beginning 250,000 cards, which are needed for election were not around, distributed yet. 
There is a great deal at stake. 
Donors consider a legitimate, government, which is recognised as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti. 
Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
