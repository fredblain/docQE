The old nursing home confirmed that the deaths not on "lack of action" are due 
The owner of the old home, in Olot does not preclude that killed their carers on 11 elderly 
The leaders of the old nursing home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which they saw the damage which the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the carers who had during his work killed at least eleven of old people, for which he was responsible, had - to the establishment. 
The director of the elderly home, Joan Sala, was accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced that "La Caritat would like to the people responsible (for the deaths) accuse ', but' the right and forcing our liability us accept the process and civil liability." 
The establishment must accept not only a social prestige lost, because they had not discovered the criminal acts of Pflegers in time, but is now paying a high compensation sum, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the victims. 
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime goes back to August 2009, and that he had since been murdered. 
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - Former patients of the old nursing home - because it suspected that no doctor had examined the mortal remains personally, but the formalities have been phased out because of their age and disease, by telephone. 
The director of La Caritat verneinte flatly this point and said that could "lack of action any time have been the cause of the incident." 
The lawyer of La Caritat added that there was "no evidence in the legal dispute for negligent acts a person other than the accused." 
Already as "death angel" Getaufte 11 murders confessed to the other day and said that the first of the crimes perpetrated on 29 August 2009, and one and a half months later, the second old lady to have murdered. 
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first crime, where he was administered a mix of various sedatives. 
The director of La Caritat said the access of the staff to the drug is difficult to control. 
The insulin injections and tranquilizers cocktail 'of carers in six of nine crimes committed to rid the patient with the death of their suffering. 
But the results of laboratory research will highlight, whether Vila is lying and his first victims actually chose a less cruel death or whether he ausbrannte this from the inside, by them Bleichlauge insist, as he had done, according to the confession when three women he murdered between 12 and 17 October. 
In La Caritat Pflegers listens to the testimony of no faith, not even as far as the number of murders gestandenen, which might well be more; that attitude it justified that Vila had made very different statements in court, and that it makes no sense, his approach after eight successful murder suddenly to change. 
They say that they turned it for this reason, and to clarify the scope of these incidents of the judiciary.
