Weak applause for China 
Taiwan's voters are approaching slowly closer link to the mainland. 
Which considers Taiwan by its big brother across the Straits? 
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, which are 70% of eligible voters turned out to vote in the five city mayors and city councils, and this is being seen as a broad assessment of the President Ma Ying jeou Party. 
Through the development of revolutionary business relations einschl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma is itself a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland, its policy has changed the relationship between the Chinese native country for the first time since 1949. 
Ma has passed the test, but only barely. 
Despite his Kuomintang Party (KMT) of three makes the five mayors, they did not receive a majority of votes. 
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater autonomy of Taiwan, nearly 50% of the votes, the KMT has received 45%. 
In a presidential election this would have meant for Ma's problems. 
Since his election two years ago, the share of the vote, his party has fallen by around 8%. 
For the first time drew even a the DPP, coupled with the KMT in the city councils. 
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as convoys of lorries with from convenience / shift end mass parades and dancers broke only sparingly. 
There were even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt. 
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT held on the eve of the election in a speech in a KMT candidate 
Schoß him as a man from the crowd face. Umstehender Lien has been injured and a spectator killed. 
Bizarre wiser is not clear whether the shooter kill Lien or resolve a dispute with the candidate wanted. 
Regardless of the attack has put Tsai of mine, and who, according to the leader of the DPP, the election undermined and the DPP in a bad light, which has brought the KMT more votes. 
China was perhaps the biggest winner of the campaign. 
Remarkably, the relationship has not been raised on the mainland. 
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and the creation of jobs. 
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat. 
For this reason, the KMT does not put their relations with the government in Beijing to the fore. 
But this time, the DPP also avoided stoking the anti's Chinese feelings too much. 
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy without China can not survive. 
Ma, for its part, would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese support its China policy. 
The government in Beijing, will continue to pursue his strategy zurückzulocken Taiwan with economic incentives in the community. 
China immediately sent a negotiators after Taipei to prepare for a summit about investment security and medical collaboration. 
It also wants a political integration, but the most important thing first. 
It would prefer to wait until after the presidential elections in 2012. 
The DPP has now reinvented itself. 
Two years ago, it has been greatly weakened, the former party leader Chen Shin's bian sat in prison for corruption. 
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was strongly for the complete independence. 
But under Tais gemässigter reign of a new generation of politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the professionals and the young. 
Tsai was a presidential candidate, the DPP big approval, such as Su Tseng and chang under Chen. 
Their party is doing everything, to show that they, too, is in a position to build close ties to Beijing. 
Tsai is planning a Ideenschmiede as a point of contact between the DPP and China, this presupposes prejudice free discussions. 
Tsai stated publicly that their party "a trustworthy alternative" offer to Mas vorschneller rapprochement with China. 
Chen seems very angry about this change. 
His cell from, he said, the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence. 
He urged the pragmatists Su even to forego the presidential candidacy. 
Chen's without interference of the DPP is difficult to choose their potential candidates. 
The KMT will have to undergo its own analysis. 
MAS values are bad, in spite of rapid economic growth, and the KMT candidate wanted to lead their campaign without him. 
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor. 
KMT, according to a spokesman, he will transform his cabinet and the local institutions. 
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan supports a rapprochement only restricted. 
At the same time, most Taiwanese see the economic cooperation with China is inevitable. 
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no return."
