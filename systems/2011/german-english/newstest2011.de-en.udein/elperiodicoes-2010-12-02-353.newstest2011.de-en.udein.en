Zapatero and the red line of Germany 
Berlin has chosen the keeping of the euro, but at the same time, conditions for the entire European Union. 
The tensions in the markets triggered a dual response from the government. 
Hand José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has submitted new adaptation measures, from tax reductions for small and micro enterprises, regulating by temporary employment agencies or the lifting of the 426 euro support for unemployed people who receive no unemployment benefits, and the privatisation of 49% from AENA, the management of the airports Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery. 
On the other hand, the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former government of President Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel, as the person responsible, which was pounding out of the current crisis. 
Are to understand how these events? 
It is anticipated, that Merkel's position is no mistake of their public relations. 
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro. 
While Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective about the shape of our future that is at odds with the preservation of the old traditions of a large section of its partners. 
Given the resistance in Europe, beginning in Germany too spekuliern on three possible ways out of the crisis. 
The first: A strong euro, with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries in the south, would have to leave the euro area. 
The second point: The reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - although it now sounds more like science fiction - supported by a large part of the public opinion, around 50% of the population. 
Third: A review of the euro under German proposals, which means that greater macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of the countries that the targets being broken; möglichereweise the default of a number of countries, as well as the extension of the costs of potential adjustments to the private sector. 
Germany's position is clear and has been for some time, and that is why there are now no excuses. 
First in 2009, when both of the IMF and the European Commission that created incentives for deficits and the German government drew up a constitutional reform from the sleeves to prevent it from 2016. 
It was the first sign of this divergence between what Germany is considered necessary (strict fiscal plans and stable public finances) and the practice of its European partners, including France. 
The second signal suspended the Central European country, as Merkel delayed the decision to bail out Greece's painful. 
At the time, which has been severely criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion were totally opposed to a bailout of Greece. 
Merkel has, after all, in the days of last October again with a clear position, and it is calling for a reform of the agreement of the European Union to allow the bailout of a country and to commit at the same time, the private lenders to bear some of the costs. 
This position has been interpreted as anti - European as they propelled the Irish crisis and everything as follows. 
But its proposal, though sweetened somewhat, was adopted, and in the coming months, we will be able to participate in the reform of the European Union, which is to allow these measures from 2013. 
Germany has drawn a red line that it intends not to go. 
It says all that it is - even though now unpopular measures need to be taken - as of this date the old operation of the euro. 
2013 the birth year of a new currency area will be the countries in which the offender to be severely punished, can be forced to declare themselves bankrupt and in this case, the private sector must take a share of the costs. 
Germany shows us that we take a hard path of growth, with high savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improve the productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive foreign trade balances. 
The other option, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as they led by Spain in boom times, is simply unacceptable. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would do badly to understand it is not. 
It is not just a question of the government deficit runterzufahren until 2013 to three percent. 
The requirements are much harder. 
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, is to deceive ourselves. 
I hope that the current turbulence in more calm. 
And that we take advantage of the opportunities afforded us, by the spring of 2013. 
It seems that Zapatero has understood this, and its twin announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that the hypothesis has, despite the criticism of Merkel, to create order in its own house, paved their way. 
But the Germany called red line is there, and it is not so, that this would change anything. 
Among the in contemplating the possibility is that we would not have to leave with little serious countries fully gestopften euro area, exclude. 
In this case Germany could still tell us that there have warned us.
