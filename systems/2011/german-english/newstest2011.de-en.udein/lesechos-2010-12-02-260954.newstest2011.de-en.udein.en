Second mandate: The Offenkundigkeit 
De Gaulle was being scaled down. 
Mitterrand had to believe that he stutze. 
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not the slightest hesitation. 
Nicolas Sarkozy and even less than that. 
Calls a mandate in the Elysée to the next. 
The current head of state will be the other candidate in 2012. 
But the Offenkundigkeit Mysteriums is not the side of the presidential function, well to face. 
So we must act as if the doubts would be henceforth. 
In one, as well as in the other direction. 
2006, gave supporters of Jacques Chirac, a third mandate was not excluded, without believing itself out. 
On November 15 Nicolas Sarkozy assured in any serious Tone, his decision 'at some point in the autumn of 2011 "to take. 
That he on Tuesday evening in the Elysée to the UMP parliamentarians the prospect of 'two mandates "would let slip, was disseminated Fieberhaftigkeit, therefore, a little. 
This was the official announcement of his candidacy? 
Far lacking. 
The President has only recall that the constitution in 2008 to limit the number of five years of office to just two. 
He made a statement, no announcement. 
It is not the first time that he mentioned the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone. 
"Their seven and a half years with me still have at worst, or at best," he told them in July 2009. 
On a new in May 2010, "does not believe that I do not think about the stage after that." 
His words from the day before yesterday, make it more about the candidate than the previous day, but also no less. 
They should provoke comments, then from a double reason. 
Accelerating the Wettlaufes the candidature of the PS on one side. 
But it is not the start of competition, with Ségolène Royal, the Nicolas Sarkozy is pushing to to unfold. 
On the contrary, it is his apparent candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS early warning as to the challenge. 
Bad polls, on the other side. 
For the first time the electorate's rights would a candidacy by François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to the survey of the BVA / L Express) prefer. 
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP," reacted immediately and careful the context of the prime minister. 
"If he would find a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," with shares Mr Raffarin. 
"He will always believe that we can prevail," Alain Juppé, who has resigned with Offenkundigkeit corrected.
