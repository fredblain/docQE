Courtesy can combine what divides us? 
After a campaign of epithets and negativity this week broke out little civility in Washington. 
It is the sign of a genuine two parties cooperate or a moment of delusion before we revert quickly back to the struggle of the political parties in the capital? 
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress produced no breakthrough in the big issues that we had to look at what has been called the "lame duck session," the session at the end of a period of government, no more decisions to be taken. 
After everything we hear, was there to govern either a polite discussion between two sides or an account of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partisan collection points. 
The public meetings of the president's deficit commission was similarly civilized on Wednesday, in spite of the political differences between the members. 
It seems clear that there is a strong interaction will create over a period of months, a mutual respect that the ideological gulf that separates the members from each other. 
This is hardly enough to claim that it is thus a new era of cooperation. 
Both sides are in a test phase, in which the one demands of the other signs of cooperation and a willingness to compromise, while they do not even attempt to balance the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a new party warfare. 
So the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment were limited by the participants at a minimum requirements or allegations. 
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep, as you could see a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, expected. 
Whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or pension, the two sides are miles apart. 
Last but not least the November election has, at least for a short time, Washington voted mild. 
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representatives of the Bush administration, is now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center." 
"After elections that is inevitable. 
Elections give partisan passions, the die again. 
And that is a good thing. " 
In some issues, particularly on those who are on the agenda of the "lame duck session," Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. " 
Bush's tax cuts to end at the end of the year, and no one in favour of it. 
Both sides want to find a way to get some, or even all, either temporarily or permanently. 
Likewise, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that, it believes, who favors tax cuts for the rich, while unemployed workers refuse assistance is to be expected a compromise regarding the increased unemployment benefits. 
After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House of the optimism has risen that we can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and ratify at the same time, the New START treaty. 
But William Glaston the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent questions of the lame duck session "not necessarily to a lasting cooperation between the parties must lead if the new 112. Congress will convene in January. 
Instead, he says, for a period of not more than once immensely is more likely, perhaps even inevitable. 
"After the things that must be done, is done will turn, these short psychology in confrontation," he said. 
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many, is the courtesy to real cooperation. 
"I see a lot of what is happening from now until 2012, as Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event from 2012," he said. 
The reasons have a great deal to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Teeparty voters, who were instrumental to their education. 
How concerned the Republican leaders also may be that they vie too high, they know that they need to try to reduce their commitment to the government and to set aside the health reform. 
This party lines are already in the first reaction on the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include a tax reform and the raising of some taxes and raising the retirement age and reduce the government spending. 
The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, according to their own assessment, so very pushed to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored. 
But they need within the Commission, 14 of the 18 votes to get its plan for formal recommendation and they are fighting hard to get even in the vicinity of this figure. 
The biggest resistance in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial issues, today at least, little leeway or little sympathy for compromises. 
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress. 
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party clashes if challenging Republicans Obama in terms of the state budget, taxes and the health care system, to be followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation. 
What will lead to this change? 
The public opinion. 
It is proved that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans wants still that the two parties are working together. 
If confrontation in an impasse, as has happened in 1995, then both parties need to be careful with the public reaction. 
Who will always doomed to lose, will have to change tack and seek a compromise. 
This may indeed be an optimistic view. 
Partiality and polarisation today are greater than in the middle of the 1990s, and they appear to be a wider ideological gulf between Obama and the Republican Congress than at the time, between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. 
At the same time, the defenders of the two parties in 2010 as a mere prelude to see a much wider choice of 2012. 
Seen as the courtesy, which will be taken this week display may be welcomed by many Americans. 
But it will require both sides much more of an effort to find common ground on the issues that divide the two remain separate.
