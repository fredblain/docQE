This consortium, named 'Énergie gérance', was in 2004, as a corollary of the decision by hydro and Quebec, the private sector, their responsibility to pass this important, hydroelectric project to the tune of a figure of $5 billion. 
Early 2005 ergatterte the consortium "Énergie gérance" of the lucrative contract without a public tender. 
On the Parti Québécois is resorting to business consortia a serious ethical problem that evokes Wettbewerbsverdrändung and the risk of a price increase.

"That means carrying out instead of conventional games rather than secret way now in an open format," Sylvain Simard yesterday, a Member of the PQ said at the press conference. 
Simard early in the morning, raised the issue in front of the National Assembly, because it seems to be difficult for him to understand, as the interests of the public in this way it can be used.

The model of the consortium is standard practice in the world. 
It is usually in order to pool a time such temporary alliance that it will allow two or more companies, their expertise on a requirement in a tendering a complex project. 
The project "East Main" has a high level of complexity in terms of his work from level. 
The construction techniques is under way and is expected to be drawn up until 2012. 
However, the treaty has been awarded without competition was held that one; it had already been in negotiations.

As the newspaper Le Devoir "last week, noted that in the area of climate Bauingenieur- and advisory system applied model of the consortium is the subject of government investigations. 
A short overflying the Quebecer companies register allowed to appoint more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be of a more consistent life. 
In this way the firm in Dessau in partnership with the majority of their key rivals, Cima +, Génivar, SNC Lavalin Party or Roche and Tecsult count works, for example. 
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, at one and the same legal entity lead back, namely at Dessau. 
With the consortium "Énergie gérance," Minister Normandeau has stressed that the territory of the Baie James' is subject to a specific labour dynamics and that hydro's Quebec pays this fact since the 1970s, in a special way '. 
Laporte Réal, the major employers' énergie d of Société de la) Baie James (SEBJ that the Treaty was approved following agreement on the project management has issued a statement that leave the nose on this fact has fill. 
"If you make a tender and there are few candidates to your prices soar." 
"You have two options: Either you do the people who are on this Mart and say to you: We will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price." 
"The idea, however, is that it is not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," said Laporte. 
This the consortium "Énergie gérance" approved contract is part of a long list of agreements on more than 50,000 by the Parti Québécois dollar received. 
The contracts have been approved by either the US or the Québec hydro SEBJ for the project to East Main Sarcelle 1-a Party's Rupert.

SNC Lavalin gerafft Party had 22 treaties, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without their participation in this' Énergie gérance "mitzurechnen. 
All these agreements have been negotiated. 
They amount in total of 449 783 344 $, including the treaty with "Énergie gérance" at 295 131 564 $. 
Simard Sylvain indicated that the four firms that constitute the consortium are known (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and the Axor) 'the Parti libéral du Quebec well ." 
Minister Normandeau had let slip the PQ was also linked with the firms that financed them '"before she clarified that this is about their leaders.
