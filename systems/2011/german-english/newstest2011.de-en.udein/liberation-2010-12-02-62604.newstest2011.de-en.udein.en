Climate: As France, its financial promises of talking 
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty is there to investigate time referred to the observance of the funding promises quickly resolved (even 'fast start' or premature funding), which have been implemented by the developing countries. 
And the rough French vulnerable to blandishments are discovered. 
With the Copenhagen Treaty the developing countries have pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012. 
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France) 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year. 
At the opening of the COP16 the EU has pulled out all the stops to prevent their partners from the fact of its commitment regarding the 'fast start' financing to persuade: Detailgetreuer action report of its Member States, press conference, as well as large events, brochures distribution. 
Operation transparency is estimated remarkable and precisely for its real value: The developing countries and civil society would like to see all the developed countries did the same at the same accuracy level. 
The EU declared, to have a release of EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, as it is on the right path towards Respektbezollung their commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012. 
If you look into the details, however, things are slightly more complicated. 
This money should be according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new and additional," in order to ensure that an additional use was introduced to be without, to the detriment of public development aid. 
Unfortunately, there is no consensus, what "means new and additional." 
While the EU Commission proposed a harmonisation, have a certain number of members states, including France, to block the procedure. 
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark, which he deems best. 
The EU Commission, has chosen as a benchmark for example those of 2009: The international funding to be maintained, and that is in the context of funding 'fast start' 150 million over three years. 
Other countries have similar guidelines, either elected in annual or concerning conditions at the level of public development aid. 
By contrast, France was the view that the funding "of all new projects" of 2010 are "new and additional." 
In other words, there are no guidelines for spending of the previous year, or at a global level of public development aid. 
Specifically said may be the sum total of the French support for developing countries is stable (or decrease) - France is to meet its commitment to the "new and additional" funding. 
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. 
There is no rule, and everyone chooses its Rechenmodus. 
Some, such as France, are borrowed €1 as being equivalent to €1 donated. 
Obviously this is acceptable only difficult: The trouble is not comparable. 
If the use of loans can be for some profitable investment (often justified to the emission control linked projects) are based on the most effective technology, it is captured deceptive to present the Euro to be donated as equivalent for a euro... moreover, only the cost of the loan should be counted for capital donor country than commitment, in other words, the equivalent of an interest rate. 
France has nothing but respect different in spirit than the following observation: '"Accorded its obligation of 420 million euros, by embracing 91.5% loans (389,8 million) and of 8.5%)) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document, to see for yourselves. 
France is the only land the EU, that loans to a great extent. 
Germany is calling for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands, or Slovakia (including) perform their obligations to be 100% of donations. 
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to meet their commitments, that France is barely 10 cents and understands, including a similar commitment. 
Beautiful Hokuspokus! 
All in all France operates in his fast start financing with a double fraud: A part with a Weiterentwicklkung the action over time, and partly with the reality of the financial commitment. 
France will be able to give the impression that it has used 420 million "new and additional" million, in line with his promise, and it saves 36.1 million euros. 
The manipulation of the Treasury (since it seems likely that there was Bercy, which has conducted the arbitrage) one could draw to borrow twice negative effect, once EU internal (why the other members states are continuing with the donations, if enough?), and then in the negotiations, the developing countries will not be fooled completely... 
The chapter of Premature finance only a small matter in a relatively short time compared to the entirety of discussions on the climate. 
But it may be too much of the drop in the vast machinery of the UNFCCC. 
We hope that this will not be the case. 
As it always was, it is vital to learn the lesson from this first year of premature funding. 
Primarily France could be a change in its accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, and to do so in a spirit of respect for his obligations and compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union. 
But above all France could lead the discussions on the dispute are the subject of long term funding forward (another key topic, and at the moment: You cannot escape the question of 'Verrechenbarkeit "or the recording nature of its loans. 
France could alter its position, in order to be as progressive in terms of the contentious issues, as it is the other things. 
The hope is based on the new environment minister, Kosciusko / Morizet who will arrive next week in Cancun. 
A surprising announcement on the 'fast start of France and his vision of' Verrechenbarkeit ," as well as the use of loans would increase inherently international trust, the need for further discussion.
