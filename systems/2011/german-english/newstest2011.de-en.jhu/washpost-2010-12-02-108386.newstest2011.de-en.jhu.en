Courtesy can connect the divisive? 
After a campaign to schimpfwörtern and negativität is little courtesy of erupted in Washington this week. 
It is the sign of a real zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion, before we quickly return to the struggle of the parties in the capital? 
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress, no breakthrough in the big issues, with the one during the sog. "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a regierungsperiode, in which no more decisions are taken, had to employ. 
After all what you hear, it was not a polite debate between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan punktesammelns. 
The public meeting of the defizitkommission of the President on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences between the members continue to exist. 
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months, can give a mutual respect of the ideological divide, which continue to separating the members of concealment. 
This is hardly enough to say that there is a new era of cooperation here. 
Both sides are now in a test phase - in of one of the other sign of cooperation and calls for compromise as they even tried to the borders of the public opinion and the patience of voters after a new parteienkriegsführung arbitration. 
Therefore the meeting on Tuesday were itself and its assessment limited to a minimum of demands or accusations by the participants. 
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to be a rapid change in the atmosphere, which has dominated in the last two years, could expect. 
Regardless of whether it to donate taxes, health or anwartschaften is concerned, the two sides are miles away from each other. 
Finally, the novemberwahl Washington at least for a short time voted mild. 
"No question, that is the tone, a tone has changed," said pete wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, which now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center." 
"This is inevitable after elections. 
Elections give parteiliche passion, which die once again. 
And that is a good thing." 
In some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the "lame duck session" are, Republicans and Democrats have no other choice than to find a solution. " 
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports the. 
Both sides want to find a way to receive some or all, whether it is now temporarily or permanently. 
Also is a compromise on the increased arbeitslosengelder expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that it believes that the recommendation that tax cuts for the rich, while they refuse A SUPPORT OF unemployed workers. 
After the meeting in the White House on Tuesday, the increased optimism that we in these issues during the "lame duck session" Some and at the same time can ratify the Treaty of New START. 
But William glaston of the Brookings insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation between the parties must, if the new 112. Congress is convened in January. 
Instead, he says, is a phase of the nichtübereinstimmens likely, perhaps even inevitable. 
Are done "after the things that need to be done, will turn this short psychology in confrontation," he said. 
Wehner is also skeptical, and this skepticism is shared by many, the courtesy leads to true cooperation. 
"I see much of what happens from now on to 2012 as vorkampf, or schattenboxen, for the hauptereignis by 2012," he said. 
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the teeparty-wählern, were benefit their education. 
How concerned the Republican leaders may also be that they too high pokern, you know that they have to try their promises to reduce the expenditure of the Government and the gesundheitsreform except to put into force, to be respected. 
This parteilinien are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the defizitkommission clearly what a tax reform and the raising of some taxes and to increase the retirement age and include the reduction of government spending. 
Alan Simpson and the deputy chairman erskine Bowles have taken one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, so much insisted that the defizitfrage on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored. 
But they need within the Commission, 14 of the 18 vote in order to make their plan to official recommendation and fight them very, in order to come only in the vicinity of this number. 
The biggest opposition will take place in the elected representatives of the body because financial education, at least today, is little room or little sympathy for compromise. 
Galston says two stages in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress ahead. 
The first fight next year will be in the form of parteizusammenstößen take place if the Republicans Obama in the staatshaushalts, challenging the taxes and the health system, then followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation. 
What will lead to this change? 
The public opinion. 
It has been proven that, despite the bias of the current election, the majority of Americans still wishes that the two parties to work together. 
If Confrontation leads to a dead end, as it happened in 1995, then both parties must carefully to ensure the public reaction. 
Who is always destined to lose, will have to change the course and seek the compromise. 
In fact, it may be an optimistic view. 
Partisanship and polarization is now greater than in the middle of the 1990's, and they seem a greater ideological divide between Obama and the kongress-republikanern to be between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans than at the time. 
At the same time, the activists from both parties see 2010 as a prelude to consequence for a much wider choice in 2012. 
May be seen as the courtesy of this week to display will be welcomed by many Americans. 
But it will require a lot more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the issues that separate the two still.
