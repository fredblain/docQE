Second mandate: the offenkundigkeit 
De Gaulle had really gestutzt. 
Mitterrand had to believe that he stutze. 
Mr Giscard d 'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation. 
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that. 
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next existence. 
The current head of state will be so candidate in 2012. 
But the offenkundigkeit is the side of the mysteriums the präsidentschaftsfunktion connotation, and not good to face. 
So we must do so, as if the doubts would be to take. 
In one, as well as in the other way. 
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac, a third mandate is not excluded, without even to believe that. 
On 15 November Nicolas Sarkozy assured in ernstem tone "his decision to take" At some point in the autumn of the year 2011. 
On that he dienstagabend in the Elysée before the ump-parlamentariern would let the prospect of "two mandates" full capacity, therefore had a little fieberhaftigkeit spread. 
This was the official announcement of his candidacy? 
Far from it. 
The President was just to remind that the amendments to the Constitution by 2008, the number of five years of all terms to just two. 
He made a statement, no announcement. 
It is not the first time that he mentioned at such meeting in a humorous tone of the presidential election. 
"You have, at worst, seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009. 
On a new in May 2010: "does not believe that I do not reflecting on the stage after that." 
His words of the day before yesterday does not make him more on the candidate than the previous day, but no less. 
They should cause comments, then from a double reason. 
The acceleration of wettlaufes about the candidacy with the PS on one side. 
But it is not the inclusion of competition with Ségolène Royal, Nicolas Sarkozy this is to reveal. 
On the contrary, it is its obvious candidacy in 2012, the many Members of the PS early call to challenge than anticipated. 
The poor surveys on the other side. 
Together for the first time would the voters of the right a candidacy of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy - 46% against 44%, according to the poll, bva-l 'express - prefer. 
"We have a candidate, and there are with the ump no discussions about this," responded immediately and careful the environment of the Prime Minister. 
"If he would find a defeat as possible, he would not candidate," Mr Raffarin with shares. 
"He will always believe to be able to win," corrected Alain juppé with the offenkundigkeit has resigned.
