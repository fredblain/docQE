Drohgebärden of the European Central Bank - ECB - 
Investors reacted strongly yesterday on the threat of the ECB President Trichet, warned that "the markets should our reaktionsvermögen not underestimate." 
The risk premia of the euro-peripheriländer have increased dramatically and by more than 5% of the shares of European banks. 
We should, however, can deceive the possibility that the ECB, the euro has appreciated in little points, not underestimate what led to concern. 
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, to the extent that he collapses in recovered again, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions. 
The institutional investors will not lose its fear for a long time. 
A month ago today the European Central Bank asked us to our liquiditätmsaßnahmen to reverse that the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably has to make a number of times in the future, taking a step backwards. 
The Bundesbank asked the beendung of the plan to buy sovereign debt, as they are ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquiditätsmaßnahmen. It should only be a einwöchiger permanent access should be maintained. 
After the irland-krise, we expect that the current liquiditätsmaßnahmen "at least until March" extended and the quarterly contracts with unlimited access to the quartalsende to ensure liquidity be maintained until at least June. 
We also expect that the programme to buy securities continued and a stärkendes signal will spend. 
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of the markets of yesterday back and if halstarrig insisted that we will liquiditätsmaßnahmen withdraw, Only God can help us. 
As well as in the ezb-sitzung in May, in which the bank confirmed, the purchase of staatschuldpapieren does not need to be considered and then collapsed the markets, it could repeat history tomorrow. 
The ECB must be credible and persistent. 
In May, they showed the teeth and on Wednesday said they have already bought a lot, and they provoked a new collapse of the market. 
Yesterday was the auction of a year staatstiteln rather weak in Portugal. 
The state. Asset Management was only 500 million to 5,28% from to 750 million 4,81% in the previous auction. 
However, the interest rates in Portugal by 30 basis points in the whole of the curve and exhaust so that a wahrnehmungsveränderung reflect the markets after the words of Trichet's. 
In Ireland, the figures of the schuldenlochs of allied published and Bank of Ireland. 
The sum is to about 10, 000 million in the short term and possible further estimated 15 000. There is time to February to obtain private capital or these banks are nationalized. 
Although Ireland has totally lost its credibility after it had not identified the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures are within the framework of the rettungsplans acceptable and help to reduce the uncertainty. 
However, the government must receive the parliamentary approval of his new budget next Tuesday. as it is still does not have the sufficient support Ireland remains a source of uncertainty. 
Angela Merkel has its discourse with regard to the Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December designed moderate. There political unity is asked to show that we are together the same partitur play. 
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries of the ninth sinfonie Beethoven's. 
The Spanish regierungspräsident asked yesterday the plan of action, which is to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday. 
Reform, transparency in the autonomous regions, such as in the financial institutions, reducing the deficit, liberalization, privatization and arbeitsbeschaffungsmaßnahmen. The measures in the ears of the investors such as vivaldis sound four seasons. 
The doppeleffekt Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges. 
In comparison with the February was the reaction of the government and the Spanish Central Bank quickly and convincingly, and we will benefit from the überraschungseffekt. 
Today there is a crucial auction of a three years staatsanleihe the benefits from the trichet-effekt will draw. Therefore, we are a strong demand, the doubts about all of our umschuldungsfähigkeit will eliminate. 
For Spain would be the request for a hilfsplans a selbstaufopferung. 
We would receive liquidity, which we do not need. The Treasury has available to 40 billion euros, three times as much as in March. The terminate interest rates are very expensive and would have access to the markets without any notice closed. 
Nevertheless, our strategy should comply with the motto of women cäsars: "Now is not only that, but also the appearance." 
Only courage, we create.
