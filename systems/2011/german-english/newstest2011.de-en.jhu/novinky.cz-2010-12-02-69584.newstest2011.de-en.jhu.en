A longer divided as ringfinger means a lower risk of contracting cancer 
Men, whose divided is long, as the ringfinger are obviously a lower risk of developing prostate cancer. 
This is the surprise result of a study, which was published by the British Journal of cancer on Wednesday. 
This is connected with the mirror of the male hormone testosteron. 
"Our results show that the length of the relative finger can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer and notably in men to 60," said the mitautorin the study, ros eeles, Professor at krebsforschungsinstitut at the university in warwick. 
The finger could help to determine what men at a prostatakrebs-test should undergo, especially if there is genetic risks or any other risk factors, such as the family health burden, Mrs added eeles added. 
In the period from 1994-2009 followed them with their colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time, 3,000 healthy men. 
In more than half of the participants of the study was the divided the right hand shorter than the ringfinger. 
For these men was the same likelihood of prostate cancer, as for 19 percent of those men, whose ring- and were divided equally long. 
In men whose divided longer than the ringfinger was this risk, however, fell by 33 percent in men and 60 even by 87 percent. 
The relationship of the length of the two mentioned finger, which are already in prenatal age, clearly reflected the different mirror of geschlechtshormonen, which the child was exposed in the womb. 
Less testosteron corresponds to a longer divided. 
Earlier research showed that the testosteron accelerate the growth of prostate cancer. 
Vaclav pačes, leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said čtk that he is aware of this study fleeting, yet he is the relationship between the fingerlänge and the cancer has not been completely proven "for."
