Zapatero and the red line of Germany 
Berlin has for the beibehalt decided of the euro, but at the same time to set conditions for the whole of the European Union. 
The tension in the markets have triggered a double response of the government. 
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero presented new adaptation measures, starting with steuerermäßigungen for small and micro, the regulation of zeitarbeitsunternehmen or the lifting of the 426 euro support for the unemployed, take the no arbeitslosengeld, through to the privatisation of 49% of aena, the management of airports barajas and El prat and 30% of the state lottery. 
On the other hand, supports the Deputy regierungschefin, Mrs salgado, with the help of the former regierungspräsidenten Felipe González criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis herausbeschwört have. 
How are these transactions to understand? 
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their relations. 
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro. 
It is Germany a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future, which is at odds with the maintenance of the old traditions of most of its partners. 
In the face of opposition in Europe it begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis spekuliern. 
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro area. 
The second: the reintroduction of the German mark, although this sounds currently more according to science fiction, supported by a majority of public opinion, around 50 percent of the population. 
The third: a transformation of the euro under German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict management; punishment of the countries that the cross targets; möglichereweise the zahlungseinstellung some countries and the extension of the costs of potential measures on the private sector. 
The German position is clear and is already on for some time. Therefore, there is no excuses now. 
First in 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission incentives for deficits were a constitutional reform and the German government come up with, in order to prevent this from 2016. 
It was the first signs of the auseinanderdriften between what Germany is necessary - Strict steuerpläne and stable public finances - and the practices of its European partners, including France. 
The second sign, the Central European country, as Merkel to rescue the decision of Greece painful hinausschob. 
At the time it was heavily criticised. but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece. 
Finally, Merkel in the last oktobertagen with a clear position of the new. It calls for a reform of the agreement of the European Union, in order to facilitate the rescue of a country and at the same time, the private darlehensgeber to commit a bear part of the cost. 
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, since they irlandkrise and everything on the following. 
But their proposal, if somewhat sweetened, has been approved. In the next few months, we will be in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures as of 2013, participate. 
Germany has drawn a red line which does not to exceed it. 
It says all that, even if now unpopular measures must be taken, as of this date, there will no longer be the old functioning of the euro. 
In 2013, the geburtsjahr be a new currency zone, in which the zuwiderhandelnden countries be severely punished, can be forced to explain to go bankrupt and in this case the private sector must take a part of the cost. 
Germany shows that we have a hard wachstumskurs need to take, with high savings and investitionsraten, moderation of consumption, improving the productivity and competitiveness, and positive external salden. 
The other option on the debt and construction industry with huge löchern based in the balance of payments, as it was mentioned in boom times by Spain, simply will not be tolerated. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would do bad, not to understand it. 
It is not just a question of the deficit to three percent by the year 2013 runterzufahren. 
The demands are much tougher. 
And the worst of what we could do in these circumstances is ourselves to cheat. 
I hope that the current turmoil in move more calm. 
And be given the opportunities, the US, that we will use by the spring of 2013. 
It seems that Zapatero has understood this so well and the announcement of his double - the promised reforms last Saturday after the meeting with the companies and the announcement of new measures yesterday - points out that the hypothesis, despite the criticism of Merkel to create its own house in order, has caused their way. 
But the Red line drawn by Germany is there, and it is not so that it would change things. 
Under the opportunities in the consideration is that we fully the countries with little serious gestopften euro area to leave, not be ruled out. 
In this case, Germany could still tell us we have warned us.
