Gesta prd, PT, convergencia and patrón form an opposition bloc 
With the reform of the organgesetzes on the congress will the zweiparteiensystem introduced, they complain. 
The 60th parliamentary term had just begun and already installed an opposition bloc led by the members of the prd, PT, convergencia and Jesús Manuel patrón montalvo, presented as an independent. The four were in the following question: the entry of 'zweiparteiensystems' in the Chamber. 
Before the start of the einführungssitzung Legislature in the 60th wetterten Felipe manzanarez Rodríguez of convergencia, ezequiel reynoso esparza by the PT, Javier corvera quevedo by the prd and patrón montalvo against the reform of the organgesetzes because they would be excluded. 
With this reform, they repeated, would a 'zweiparteiensystem' introduced because now it would be two people, the same number as the parties controlled the Congress. 
These four members, together with gloria margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the prd, were the only against that of the panisten Salvador lópez brito and Luis Antonio cárdenas fonseca quoted in his capacity as deputy chairman voted Bureau. 
Corvera quevedo parties said that the PRI and pan with these institutional reforms of its political randstellung had introduced. 
He said that in the next few days with the representatives of pan and PRI would speak to change the pattern. However, they derem political will and if they did not have, they would again subjugated by both parties, and the oppositionskoalition would put an end to it. 
"To come here I - the oppositionskoalition - this is what I see, because we will be excluded from all decisions, which are not even to rücksichte to take into account the opinion of the other." 
Felipe manzanarez Rodríguez of convergencia declared that there was common ground with prd, Pt and patrón and that is why a pluralistic group would be formed. 
It cannot be allowed, he went on, that the Congress after he was monopolistic, should now be "duopolistisch." 
"It is not the spirit of the gesetzesreform that in Congress, an eternal zweiparteiensystem should prevail." 
"For the beginning begins with five members of this group and they talk with other colleagues, so that they will be more," said the convergencia-mitglied. 
Ezequiel reynoso esparza led by the PT in reference to the PAN and PRI from that the Congress currently have turned in a 'prey' for two. 
"Before, it was only a party, now they share these two parties." 
Patrón montalvo requested them to respect the Members and their place in the verhandlungstischen allocate. 
"It must not because of spitzenentscheidungen five, which will probably be nine members outside vorgelassen. The five, who are currently seen as disintegrated in different groups, have decided to unite in order to take our place at the negotiating table, because he reform, which was carried out by the other and agreed, we have remained outside and we do not agree with this reform."
