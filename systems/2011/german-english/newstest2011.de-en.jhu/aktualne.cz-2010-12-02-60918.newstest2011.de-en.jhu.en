What it should do, the čssd? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither voldemort, nor the "konditorei." 
The new ratsherren the capital from the ranks of the čssd will obviously certain barriers have to overcome their alt-neuen colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and the stadtvertretung able to understand at all. 
The newspaper aktuálně.cz, members of the new Council from the čssd time "a little abgeklopft," as the notorious slang dominate, which in the past few years has established, in which the current coalition partner in Prague were at the helm. 
The codierte wortschatz in the verflossenen era of Mayor Pavel bém political elite was introduced by the Prague is some of the best known players, situations and causae entlehnt. 
Surprisingly showed that the new councils in relation to these new concepts of something in the dark. 
They say that at least. 
"Who is voldemort?" 
"No idea." 
"I am more of a neuling responded in the Prague Policy," lukáš kaucký, the new ratsherr on Culture, "to the test of the paten-wortschatzes." 
But also the ratsherr Karel březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar way. 
For example to the concept of "golfloch." 
"This is the only expression of which I present here that I use now and again." 
"Otherwise, I do not think much of slang." 
From the wortschatz the tageblatt aktuálně.cz in this year's June before the wahlkongress had published the ODS, pickte the redaktion out six terms, especially those who are notoriously with the Prague magistrat are linked. 
The Social Democrats, the concepts of "voldemort," "the greatest Prague golfloch," "in the konditorei go," "stiernacken," "define" and "verblechen" betrayal of the capital. 
Three Prague ratsherren voted to the test, the fourth - Mr weinert, the future head of Prague schulwesens - promised first of its participation in the conversation, then took the but not the time hörer from. 
The fifth ratsherr, Petr dolínek, rejected the test from the outset. 
"These things are no matter to me and how the Civic Democrats to talk to each other, I do not make about it." 
"What is important to me, as we understand within the framework of our programmes," he countered. 
As has been suggested, would have lukáš kaucký allegedly in the abovementioned headline not recognised that entrepreneurs from the influential and friend of the ex-oberbürgermeisters bém, Roman janoušek is said. 
The term "voldemort" says kaucky nothing AND THE ONLY concept he correctly in the test erriet, was "the greatest Prague golfloch." 
"This is the tunnel blanka," says kaucký, added to safety, but added: "But I know that more from the newspaper." 
And jokingly: "I will be a sprachkurs must show." 
The "golfloch" will then not only by matador Karel březina, but also by the ratsherrn on the environment lukáš plachý right as a tunnel blanka entziffert. 
But both Social Democrats know for whom the term voldemort, and is lukáš plachý even knows where to find this figure, and this is what it means," in the konditorei to go." 
"I believe, that is to say, in any Prague gastronomiebetrieb to go," is plachý quite close to the rätsels solution, if you know that it is the seat of janoušeks firms is concerned. 
In line with březina but he claimed to have this knowledge more as a result of the newspaper, as that him this wortschatz would be adopted. 
The testteilnehmern suggest that, it seems under the Social Democrats, in fact, no similar eingebürgerten slang to give in. 
"I have asked my colleagues, but obviously there is such a thing really not with us." 
"We call on the name, from time to time we use words or spitznamen," says the chairman of the Prague čssd Petr hulínský - from his parteigenossen casual called "hulda." 
"I was in the school bříza - birke - mentioned, but I do not know whether my colleagues call me," tells us Karel březina his spitznamen. 
The newspaper deník aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see there, he works. 
Ratsherr weinert is for the parteigenossen kind of "opa" or less kind of "old," the representative of Mirek poche before the elections by activity in the partei-sponsoring on pointed out, will "by some Members igráček '- known Czech lego-figur - mentioned. 
Spitznamen are so the only thing that the Social Democrats in whose allow use of language. 
Hulínský supposedly, it may not if it is called "hulda," but deník aktuálně.cz registered another spitznamen the chairman of Prague. 
Be spitzname "Dr of gummiknüppel-rechte" was supposed to do that Petr hulínský his title doctor Juris in the bratislaver Police College has acquired.
