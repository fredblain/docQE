Controllers in the zwielicht 
The European Food Safety Authority EFSA was the with genpflanzen experimentierenden undermined industry. 
These accusations formulated now the group testbiotech as independent Institute for understands the impact assessment of biotechnology. 
"It sounds like a verschwörungstheorie, but we have it well documented," said testbiotech-chef Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich. 
The head of the efsa-expertengruppe on genetically modified crops, Harry kuiper and another efsa-experte are for years and the lobbyistenverband ilsi under the Treaty. 
The will of groups such as Monsanto, nestle or Bayer paid. 
Kuiper was instrumental in the efsa-prüfvorschriften contributed for genpflanzen and am so then criticized in a clear conflict of interest. 
The efsa-vorschriften are absatzweise wortgleich with positionspapieren the ilsi and to deceive the mark of the industry, which is to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma. 
It is already the second time that testbiotech a interessenskollision bemängle. 
Was a senior efsa-managerin recently without restrictions or transitional period on the Swiss agrarkonzern syngenta - and I have to ensure that the sides. 
The mitteldeutsche radio - mdr - had recently human links between kontrollierender EU agency and industry lobby revealing what the umweltbundesamt as well as eu-parlamentarier has made suspicious. 
However the EFSA can see no conflict of interest. 
We will take back to every serious data, also on such industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, it said in a statement. 
The experts working for EFSA, we do not demand that they have no contacts with the industry. 
But they should disclose them. 
Kuiper gives his work for the International Life Sciences Institute - ilsi - in the United States. 
This described itself as a neutral forum for science, industry and politics, among other things, experts from the risikoabschätzung for biotechnology without lobbyauftrag. 
Criticised in the matter of independent experts as then that genetically modified crops is currently without any fütterungsversuch be permitted in animals and the reaction of genpflanzen shall not tested on the environmental impact. 
"We want to know what, for example of genetically modified maize in the acker power," says then. 
Current practice is only isolated proteins, but not the whole genpflanze to test what no reliable results liefere. 
"If you do not seek the risks, how can we find it then?" asks then anklagend. 
This is also Angelika hilbeck so. 
The research scientist in the genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently in the Technical University of Zurich direct action. 
Attempts in this area as the industry in the United States now in Europe is becoming more critical to influence or discredit scientists. 
There is so little more researchers, not with groups are interlinked. 
Critical studies for companies would not published in the rule. 
"The industry controls the research," said hilbeck.
