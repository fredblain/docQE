Weak applause for China 
Taiwan's voters are coming to slow a closer link to the mainland. 
What is Taiwan across the Strait by his Big Brother? 
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of voters, in order to be in the five Kardzhali mayors and to elect councillors. This is as a broad assessment of the President Ma ying-jeou interpreted. 
By the groundbreaking construction business ties, einschl. a partial free trade agreement, ma itself is a symbolfigur has its policy for the relations with the mainland. the relationship to the Chinese mainland for the first time since 1949 lasting changes. 
Ma has passed the examination, but only just. 
Though his kuomintang-partei - KMT - three of the five mayor is, they received no majority of votes. 
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party - DPP -, which supports a greater independence of Taiwan, almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%. 
In a presidential election would have this means for Ma problems. 
Since his election two years ago, the support of his party fell by about 8%. 
For the first time, the DPP even drew together with the KMT in the councillors. 
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as lastwagenkonvois with krawallmachern, flaggen-schwenkende massenumzüge and A only scantily clad tänzerinnen. 
There were even the compulsory, mysterious mordversuch. 
Sean lien, the son of lien Chan and the KMT ehrenvorsitzender held on the eve of the election of a speech to a kmt-kandidaten, 
As him a man from the amount of sitting in the face. lien was wounded and a umstehender spectators killed. 
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter lien kill or wanted to settle a dispute with the candidates. 
Regardless of the attack, according to tsai ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the election affected put in a bad light and the DPP, which has brought more votes to the KMT. 
It may be that China was the biggest winner of the campaign. 
Remarkably, was not addressed the relations with the mainland. 
Instead, the candidates under debate on plans to housing and the creation of jobs. 
The Taiwanese people love their de facto independence, and China's militärbedrohung from. 
For this reason, the KMT their relations with the government in Beijing does not want to be in the forefront. 
But this time also avoided the DPP, the anti-chinesischen feelings to stir up too much. 
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy without China cannot survive. 
Ma, I would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese supported its policy towards China. 
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy, Taiwan with economic incentives in the Community zurückzulocken. 
China immediately sent a negotiators to Taipei, in order to prepare for a summit to investment and health cooperation. 
Certainly it wants a political integration. But the most important thing first. 
It is prefer it until after the presidential elections in 2012. 
The DPP has reinvented now. 
Two years ago it was severely weakened, the former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat in prison for corruption. 
During his presidency from 2000 until 2008, he strongly for the complete independence. 
But under tais regentschaft developed a new generation gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of working and the youth. 
Tsai took place as the DPP präsidentschaftskandidatin great support, as Su tseng-chang under Chen. 
Her party is now doing everything to show that they, too, is in a position to build close relations with Beijing. 
Tsai is planning a ideenschmiede as kontaktpunkt between the DPP and China. But this is vorurteilsfreie discussions ahead. 
Tsai declared publicly that their party to offer a "trustworthy alternative" Ma's vorschneller rapprochement with China. 
Chen seems very angry about this change. 
From his cell, he said the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence. 
He urged the pragmatists su even to the präsidentschaftskandidatur to abandon. 
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is difficult to choose their potential candidates. 
The KMT will own a selbstanalyse must undergo. 
Ma's values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth, the kmt-kandidaten wanted to lead their campaign without him. 
The main reasons for his unbeliebtheit unemployment and the always seem to be further gap between rich and poor. 
According to a kmt-sprechers he will transform his cabinet, as well as the local institutions. 
A strong voice for the DPP suggests that Taiwan a rapprochement, if only limited support. 
At the same time, see most of the Taiwanese as inevitable economic cooperation with China. 
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent kolumnisten," there is no more back already."
