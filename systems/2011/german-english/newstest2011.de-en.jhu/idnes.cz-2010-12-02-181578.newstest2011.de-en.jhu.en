A knochenhaus fascinated even after 100 years. look at the interieure of gaudi to 
The roof is how to the back of a prähistorischen echse, the steps, such as the vertebral column of dinosauriers and the balkone are aufgerissene fischmäuler. 
This is the Casa batlló of Catalan architect Antonio gaudi in Barcelona. 
Of the local inhabitants got the house with its organic forms the spitznamen "knochenhaus." 
Organic forms, wild colours, the unusual use of stone, kachelsplittern and mosaiks in just erinnernde fassaden and ubiquitous soft lines, all of this is a common feature for the jugendstil by Antonio gaudi. 
The facade of the house is playing with beautiful lines, zärtlichen paints and texturen in nature and remind creatures. 
Only on closer inspection, they noted that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order. 
In the night, the whole front or plastic, dramatic and the special anleuchtung enhances the glamour of the colours. 
The same schwungvollen lines and tortuous forms dominate the home of the House. 
Wellenartig geformtes wood copied the fensterrahmen, geländer, zierelemente of doors, even gucklöcher and afford. 
The House batlló in the eixample quarter in the crowded einkaufsstraße passeig de grácia No 43 was created by the reconstruction of a house from the years 1877, the architects emilio sala cortese said. 
Use of the reconstruction, two years and was 1906 concluded. 
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep batlló was originally in the abriss of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately it voted the idea gaudís on an unusual and cheaper to reconstruction. 
The mietshaus Casa batlló outlined antoni gaudí, however, not alone. 
He worked with the architects Josep Maria jujol together. 
Just on its reißbrett created the dekorationen representative for the home of the realitätenbesitzers and the use of mosaiken part of the facade was his idea. 
Working on the design of the facade, but also many other bildner and artists. 
The joint work on the drafts for the Casa batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation of jujola and gaudí. 
So is involved jujol the construction of gaudís House Casa milá in the güell Park, in which other works of antoni gaudí are. 
Already shortly after its completion, the house of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the spitznamen "knochenhaus." 
Others called it the specific fensteröffnungsmechanismus yawning due to the "house." 
It also says that the sword is at the top of the building of the Saint George, the patrons presented by Catalonia. 
But other bildhauerische elements symbolise hidden religious motives. 
Gaudí outlined for the house of a unique for that time zentralheizungssystem with entlüftungskanälen and typical kaminen. 
Something seems bizarre their 45-grad-neigung already. 
During his create ignored gaudí consistent all then bauvorschriften and did not be led astray by this. 
Before baubeginn "he from the town of the relevant baugenehmigung but the claims made by him on the planned reconstruction was so vague that the stadtväter two years later in the completion of so that they demanded a remedy were horrified by the outcome. 
The ratsherren met with, among other things, that the building with its pillars, even in the public pavement intervention. 
To change, but not more, quite the contrary, only fifteen days after the request in this regard, the stadtviertels, Josep batlló a request for approval of the vermietung of the two höchstgelegenen stockwerke of the House, and it has been granted him promptly. 
The Homeowners themselves, in the lower floors. 
In the gallery in the second floor was a gesellschaftssalon, on the third floor were the bedroom and the home privaträume. 
The erdgeschoss has been sent to a juweliergeschäft verpachtet. 
The whole sechsstöckige buildings is going through a steps by up to dachterrasse. 
By the main elements of the umbaus all right corner and on lines were removed and by gebogene and geschwungene replaced walls. 
Gaudí worked but also with a modern approach for mutual link of spaces. 
The social part is by the opening of the salontüren completely link and a larger society was convenient plaudern without in vertraulicheren have to abandon talks on a certain amount intimität. 
The House received by gaudís reconstruction out of a new front a very unusual roof and two other stockwerke. 
A is also gaudís game with the light and the blue and white glasierten kacheln with which the courtyard is dressed and the lichthöfe. 
The game of these two colours gives all floors of the house a maximum of light. 
This made it is the principle to take that knows better reflect the light, as dark colours, the sunlight on the contrary to absorb. 
The House of Casa batlló that 2005 was included in the UNESCO welterbe-liste can visit today everybody. 
In the first floor of the geräumigste and prächtigste home made available to the public. 
The Homeowners determined only in years to take this step and this on the occasion of the 150.geburtstags of the famous creator. 
When it said that this is a very profitable business, it maintained the besichtigungen in, yes you are extended to other common and the dachgeschossräume, including the dachterrasse. 
The price to besichtigung of baudenkmals, however, is not a pittance, he is 16,50 euro, students, pensioners, groups and holders of touristenausweisen get 20 percent reduction. 
This amount exceeds the eintrittspreise to other gaudí-bauten in the city. 
Who is the real atmosphere of the house with its drachentürmchen would like to learn about friendship should try with one of the hausbewohner to close and visit him at home.
