Rachsüchtige hackers and emsige spies 
The affaire WikiLeaks has a dual importance. 
On one side, it is emerging as an obvious scandal, a scandal, just a scandal in the sinner hypocrisy is that the beziehunge ruled between the states, the people and the press. 
On the other hand, it is of profound changes on the international level, and is a taste of the future dominated by recession. 
But we are in the series. 
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file prepared by a Secret Service - a old nation - exclusively from zeitungsausschnitten made. 
The "extraordinary," American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi's throw from nothing more than what it for months, did anyway to read in every old journal - except those whose owners is Berlusconi - and the shocking karikaturierte profile gaddafis offered kabarettkünstlern already substance since a long time for their sketche. 
The rule that the secret files should be known only from already news is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century. 
If you go in a library, the esotherischen publications on, they will see that each work - about the grail, the mystery of rennes-le-chateau, the templer or the rosenkreuzler - exactly a repetition of what has already been written in previous works. 
This is not alone, therefore, that the author okkulter texts do not want to publish research - yet, therefore, that he does not know where news on the nicht-existierende would be to find -, but because those who, the okkultismus to believe in nothing other than that of what you already know and confirmed what they have learned. 
This is also the erfolgsmechanismus by Dan Brown. 
As the geheimakten. 
The informer is lazy, and lazy - or limited spirit - is also the head of the Secret Service - otherwise he could be as always, for example, Editor in libération - the only considered as true, what he recognizes. 
The top-secret information about Berlusconi had sent by the American Embassy in Rome of the staatsdezernat were the same as those of the newsweek already had published the week before. 
So why was such a fuss made the revelations of this dossier? 
On one side is this what every educated person already knows, and that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the government can call each other or can take a plane to take the Dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small repräsentationsaufgaben, have turned in spionagezentren. 
Any old viewers of ermittlungsfilmen know this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that we do so to ignore that. 
Nevertheless, the fact that it violates publicly to repeat the task of hypocrisy and serves to the American diplomacy to put in a bad light. 
In second place: the idea that a x-beliebiger hackers the geheimsten secrets can tap the most powerful country in the world, carries the significant blow against the prestige of the staatsdezernats. 
The scandal also brings, rather than the victims, the "scharfrichter" in trouble. 
But we are giving the profound nature of what has happened. 
Former to Orwell's times, one could combine all power as a Big Brother, which controlled every gesture of his subjects. 
Orwell's prediction would have since then can turn out to be absolutely right where you can control any movement through the telephone, each transaction, which made hotel, the elected motorway and so on; the citizens visited the total would be victims of the power auges. 
But if we in mind is what is happening today that even the secret krypten of power is no longer the control of a hackers can escape, so, the kontrollgang to be directed to unilaterally, and will zirkelförmig. 
The power of control of all citizens, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - erwählt as vindicator of the citizen - can get the SECRETS OF THE power in experience. 
But how can keep a power, which is no longer able to maintain their own secrets? 
It is true that George simmel have already said that a real secret is an empty secret - and an empty secret can never be exposed -; it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's, in fact, a secret free of geheimis is as it reveal the public sphere, but in the styles of WikiLeaks disclose that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, is to deprive them of power. 
WikiLeaks neither Sarkozy nor Merkel has done wrong, against but Obama and Clinton. 
What will be the consequences of this violation, which was inflicted on such a huge power? 
It is obvious that the States will ask no information reserved in the future more Online - that would be one on the street corner angeklebten aushang to. 
But it is also clear that it is with the current technologies in vain to hope to be able to keep confidential reports on secret telephone. 
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a Head of State has contacted moved in a plane and one of his colleagues. 
How could in future, private and only for certain ears certain relations? 
I know very well that my prediction at the moment to science fiction and romanhaft sounds, but I am compelled me the regierungsagenten present, in a secret way diligent on uncontrollable marschrouten moving, nowhere else than the mere memory with their communications written order, and also the few of the information they have to get in the schuhabsatz verbergend. 
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed existence: in fact, the spionageversuch as WikiLeaks made less success of Watergate. 
I had the opportunity to write that, today, the technology is like a cancer, namely backwards. 
A century after the wireless telegraf had revolutionised the communication, reconstructed the Internet a telegrafen with - Telephone - draht. 
The - analogue - videokassetten had the filmforschern allows a film bond for band auszukundschaften forward by one of the spulen and all the secrets of the montage could drop, while the - numerical - CDs today allow nothing more than to jump chapter by chapter, that is, in makroportionen. 
With the fast trains will be within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this by plane, including the umsteigens requires three and a half hours. 
It is therefore not extraordinary return to car and horse that policy and communication technologies. 
A final observation. 
In previous times tried to understand what the press for secrets between the messages were forged. 
Currently, it is the messages demanding the confidential information to the press.
