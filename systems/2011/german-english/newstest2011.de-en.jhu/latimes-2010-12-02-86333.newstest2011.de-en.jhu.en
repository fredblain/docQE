Arsen-resistente mikrobe could enable new forms of life on the Earth or elsewhere 
The discovery of a foreign bakterienart, including the arsenic can live opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on the Earth and elsewhere. 
Although scientists this unusual bakterium discovered here in the world, it is their view, a sign that a life without the elements deemed vital to date is possible. 
"This body has two options." 
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." 
"This makes it to something very special, although it almost a kind of 'alien' is a way of life," said Paul c.w. Davies, based of Arizona State University and co-autor of the report, which appears on Thursday in online-ausgabe the magazine Science. 
So far, six main elements were regarded as vital - carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur. 
But, as the researchers herausfanden, increasing the bakterium in California mono lake then even further, if It has replaced by arsenic. 
"Because one cannot help but wonder what else is still possible," said the co-autor Ariel's report that anbar based of Arizona State University. 
The discovery is an important step in the search for außerirdischem life because scientists need to live and see its forms, anbar. 
The study is concerned with microbes that were found on the earth. 
The announcement in a press conference that no details were announced the discovery, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report by the discovery außerirdischen life could act. 
This is not the case. 
The discovery "shows that in other planetensystemen organisms can set in motion with the help of other elements of biochemical processes, and that the 'standardelemente' which, in our opinion, are absolutely vital, are not necessarily firmly set," said Charles cockell, professor at the planetary and space sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. 
Cockel was not part of the teams of researchers. 
"This work is something new, because it shows that an element in basic biochemical processes and structures can be replaced by another," added cockell added. 
This discovery was not accidental. 
Felisa wolfe-simon from astrobiologischen NASA Institute, who led the study, chose the mono lake because of the high arsengehalts. 
As arsenic and phosphorus chemical same, they are exposed to that microbes that both may be able to replace an element by the other. 
"The giftigkeit of the arsens is above all to the fact that it is chemically similar as phosphorus." 
"It is the organisms difficult to distinguish an element from the other." 
"But the difference is so great that arsenic is different than phosphorus. It comes in the biochemisches system where it almost everything verschmiert," said anbar. 
The researchers, the bakterium gfaj-1 a rising arsenkonzentration. It fit in and grew. 
The mikrobe is growing phosphorus better, but that they can survive in the arsenic, shows that a arsen-basierte way of life, of course, can happen, either on the earth or on another planet or moon, on the arsenic happens more often. 
According to Jamie S. Foster, dozentin for mikrobiologie at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new. But so far, there was still no functioning example. 
Arsenic came in the early erdjahren more frequently, she says, That is why the science expected that early life have used it. 
"That is reason to believe that life can have developed differently than in the early erdzeitalter," forster, which is not a member in wolfe-simons forschungsteam was. 
The research was supported by NASA, the energieministerium and the national health authorities.
