More and more parents want to menschen-überwachungsgeräte, in order to have the kids under control 
The growing fear for their own children and consider more and more parents to monitor them by GPs. 
The system, which originally to fahndung was invented for cars can as well people places, which would be helpful in such cases, as recently as the spurlosen disappearance of the neunjährigen anička janatková. 
The machine is currently about as big as a zigarettenschachtel but soon it should not be greater than a armbanduhr. 
Many people, the case of the missing anička puts in fear and terror and you keep looking for means and ways to better protect their children. 
Also for the price of a lower their privacy. 
"We try to say to all of us, that it is not in any way herumspionieren, it is an effective means to reduce the likelihood that the tragedy is," leads Petr pilin by the society macro because of one of the suppliers of gps-ortungsgeräten on the Czech market. 
"I accept that it can come to the abuse of such equipment in individual cases, for example, if there is someone in the pocket without that he knows it, but so far we have had no such case has been made." 
"Most of the customers buy it really for security reasons," adds pilin added. 
In his opinion, but the child should always know what purpose the "kind would" serves and as they are used in an emergency. 
The kinderpsychologin dana bočková but points out that a child, if it may not bear such a thing, it got rid of his simply. 
"very small children show great creativity, when it comes to certain things deliberately to lose if they do not want to be controlled." 
"The mobile phones set initially at the parents of great expectations, but you can just as easily switch off as these new überwachungsgeräte," says woman bočková. 
In your opinion is also controversial whether such an institution in the event of an attack really helps. 
"in planned kidnappings controlled the kidnapper virtually always whether any electronics of the child, with which it could be located." 
"Today it is the mobile phone." 
"If such überwachungsgeräte for broader use, they would also seek them because their sale would be certainly accompanied by massive advertising." 
"in these cases are always a step ahead of the criminals of the police," says the psychologist. 
But it gives a that similar equipment in a sudden attack by a paedophile well can be helpful. 
Roberta čech monitoring of the RC society, according to the ortungsdienstleistungen both for cars and for offering people, can the existence of such a gerätes will also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack. 
"The machine is actually stop so that the respective positions in certain intervals reports it." 
"Even if it would immediately destroyed, is at least the last position at the disposal of the concerned person." 
"in more expensive equipment is even a neigungsmesser integrated, that is, if you hinfällt and bewegungslos are remains a warning immediately, sends the machine under the claim of the position," said Mr čech. 
In his opinion, similar services could also Do Smart mobile phones with navigation, you only have a special software einzuspielen. 
The problem of the current ortungsgeräte is that it is either about equipment in streichholzschachtel-größe is like the supporters or smaller mobile phones. 
There is always the risk that we lose it. 
Mr pilin by the macro because according to testing equipment that we therefore in the present as normal digitaluhren look like. 
"The attacker has the advantage that the possible at all must not see that it is a monitoring or ortungsgerät is. 
"Or he can see that only after a certain time, what the police a zeitvorsprung are added," he adds. 
No matter in the direction of the development - towards armbändern or supporters, always will be the same technology is used, as with the fahrzeugortung. 
So for the combination of ortungsfunktion with the gps-systems - as well as the navi in the car - and the role of a mobile phone for the current position of the reports.
