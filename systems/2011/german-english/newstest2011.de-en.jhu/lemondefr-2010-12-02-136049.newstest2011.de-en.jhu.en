In more than six months, from July 2009 by May 2010, was the fate of clotilde reiss, a young French forscherin, which was held for "espionage" in Iran, the French public in breath, left the diplomacy in alarmbereitschaft and akzentuierte the deterioration of relations between Tehran and Paris. 
All of this look under the attentive the diplomats of the United States. 
The WikiLeaks received and the newspaper "Le Monde" durchgesehenen American documents be some price behind this crisis. 
They describe as the Elysée had declared his strategy of the Americans, which went so far this advice on dealing with their own 'taking of hostages' crisis in Iran - a small group of wanderern - to give in. 
They show on, as the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young französin not the release of Majid kakavand, a held prisoner in France and as a result of trade with material by the American justice system in favour of the Iranian nuklearprogrammes sought iraners to gegeleistung have. 
They finally set the way with which the French Bureau has tried to manipulate the media to the purposes, this is the idea to make credible, the Syrian president bachar al-Assad have a central role in the liberation of clotilde reiss played in a harsh light. 
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard. 
A on 12 August 2009 in Paris redigiertes diplomatentelegramm is entitled "Iran: French comments about the way of dealing with the taking of hostages." 
François richier, elysée-berater in strategiefragen, had accompanied by patrice paoli, Director of the Quai d orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomatin kathleen allegrone. 
They said the method of the French. 
The advised the Americans to do all we can to their own nationals rückzuführen, which would forcibly held in Iran. 
"power of noise," they said, 'articulated loudly and clearly and without unterlass "the words" grundmenschenrechte, "" innocence, "" immediate release "in the media. 
This is necessary in order to bring the Iranian regime in embarrassment, respects the very sensitive to his image. 
"This is all the more so because you ask the Iranians not to do that." 
Because "silence solves nothing," over the diskussionsversuche on on unauffälligem ways, the Iranians are "champion in ausweichmanövern." 
Mr richier adds that the detention of foreigners' geläufige that Iranian tactics "was:" taking hostages for the purposes of political blackmail." 
He is on the release of clotilde reiss from the prison - which should be reached on August 16, in the days, in the refuge in the French Embassy - "Want the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians' - 230,000 euro bail -. 
And he is known, the Elysée antizipiere other hostages taken, a phenomenon that "will become even more acute." 
The Iranians could "in the near future a different of the roughly 1,800 arrest French nationals living in Iran," he said. 
28 August 2009. 
Clotilde reiss is 12 days ago has been released from the prison, but is still held in Iran. 
Information was put into circulation: the Iranians Majid kakavand, whose extradition to the United States because of illegal trade in empfindlichem elektronikmaterial call to Iran is to entscheid a judge in Paris has been released from detention. 
The American message is, like many other observers, questions about this disturbing koinzidenz. 
For Washington, which the illegal Iranian networks of the purchases of the material planned for the nuclear programme is followed the release of Majid khakavand bad news. 
France has taken a horse trading in purchase? 
The liberation of the iraners against one of the französin? 
At a new meeting with kathleen allegrone assured on 4 September François richier that this was not the case. 
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised" by the decision of the judge, but have also tried to prevent it aufzulehnen. 
"It has been a rain of exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" - currently michèle alliot-marie - but the French Government "cannot change the judicial decision," he said. 
Mr richier would also like to point out that Majid kakavand remain under supervision of the French intelligence service is "strict." 
The elysée-berater chooses a telephone number, sets back on, then informed the American diplomatin, the Iranians "would currently in the buildings led by the Iranian Embassy in Paris." 
During the gewahrsams of clotilde reiss in Iran care not to use his efforts of the Elysée statements given and organised by the media to make "fluchtversuche" Believe that the Syrian president bachar al-Assad games an "important" and "influential mittlerrolle." 
The Americans are watching this activity is not without irony and say that the manipulation bears fruit, as several articles reflect the official French version. 
One of 25 August 2009 datierendes telegramm calls "the medienblitz the French authorities" inevitable. 
What is so much "dankesbezeugung" with Mr Assad asks the message in Paris. 
"Despite their statements full of lobpreis be secretly to the French authorities that they have only a vague idea of what the syrier have actually done." 
The document is also concerned with the reasons that have led the Elysée fall of this fiction. 
The intensive kommunikationsbemühungen "aims to Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria to confirm," he analysed. 
A policy launched in 2008," at the time by many kritikerstimmen in France and abroad as premature and unverdient was felt." 
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" attempts to engage in Paris' Syria in mind, what belobigung we can achieve it by playing a constructive role in the region. " 
The aim is also "to sow discord between Syria and Iran." 
The American message knows this from a good source. 
On August 11, François had richier entrusted to it: "Of course, we do not know whether the syrier which also have always done." 
"But we have, in spite of everything, thanks to you." 
"This should at least cause confusion in the Iranians."
