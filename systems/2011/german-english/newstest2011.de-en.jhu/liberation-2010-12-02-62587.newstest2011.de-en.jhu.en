Métro grand Paris: first financial skizzen 
Since the debate about the modernization of the transport industry on the ile-de-france is in full swing, it rains billion. 
At least in the discussions. 
You call this the 23 billion for the grand Paris underground in memory, in particular the Société du grand Paris is to be built. 
To the baubeginn the sgp in the ways to implement the state has declared a kapitaldotation of 4 billion euros. 
In the theoretical consideration, this is the sum of the sgp would then allow on the markets is a part of the finanzsumme to give their double. 
Today, it is, after all, first hochrechnungen come. 
The ergänzungshaushalt by 2010, studied this morning by the finanzkommission of the National Assembly, contains the proposed measures to raise the first part of that money. 
It is two measures: the creation of a special tariff on erschließund and a higher tax of the offices on the ile-de France. 
The former, remove the article 15 of the gesetzesentwurfes, is "in favor of Société du grand Paris' public service center. 
Quantified these is: "is the product of this tax to 117 million euros per year." 
Zweitere is a renewal of existing tax: "In order to modernize this, in order to increase the product resulting from it and the increase of the Société du Grand Paris to überantworten." 
How much would bring this? 
A mystery. 
This sum is not quantified in the text. 
Of the 4 billion it is far away. 
"It is said that the fiscal resources of the 4 billion euros in the kapitaldotation be added to be paid by the state and the Grand Société du Paris to be done for the project and after," is to come from the explanatory outline. 
In the sgp this system will be not offensive. 
"Since the moment in which they scored the Revenue - The two taxes, D. R. -, you can projektierung on for three years, and only then draw from the 4 billion," will be declared. 
"This is listed in the budget and after and after deducted." 
The sgp estimated that will be started in 2013 to note the 4 billion for the budget in 2014. 
This measure, whose 4 promised billions we will be able to seek still long, is in danger of had a right to provoke parliamentary debate. 
The first public meeting will take place on December 7.
