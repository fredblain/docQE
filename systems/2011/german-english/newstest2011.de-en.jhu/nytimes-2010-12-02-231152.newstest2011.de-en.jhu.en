He wanted to that his female members of the chengguan - China's robust wächtern feared the urban order and contempt for their arbitrary raids that and their propensity for violence - Impress the spectators. 
"Are!" 
"Look in front." 
"Just goes to show you," flüsterte it to them, "are as beautiful girls!" 
Four girls, hardly the teenager-alter grow out, with white handschuhen and identical olivegrünen jacken and trousers were closed. 
Four few black pumps were in gerader series.

Wuhan in mittel-china violence replaced by niederstarren: 2009 umkreisten reportedly 50 officials a set of not properly imbisswagen and starrten operators in this after half an hour to einpackte and left the place. 
Xindu, a stadtbezirk in chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants, would fundamentally change the image. 
Since 2003, 13 women reinforce the urban polizeistreifen. They were special because of their aussehens selected their good figure, and their youth. 
They are the grobschlächtigen police a weicheren, femininen give aspect. 
But unfortunately there would also be scarlett johansson hardly succeed the bad image of the Chinese of these stadtkommandos have to improve. 
With the right, so the critics. 
Different from the police these officials must enforce the urban laws only with the help of fines or other administrative penalties. 
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture. 
In January 2008 beat officials in the province hubei a spectator to death, when this with his mobile phone filming it, as a protest against a dustbin niederschlugen. 
In the last year, a schulungshandbuch stolen the officials in Beijing and published on the Internet. it described as criminals can be beaten without bloodshed. 
This year suffered a Shanghai wassermelonenhändler after a handgemenge with five officials gehirnverletzungen.

"chengguan makes the fear of the government," lamentierte the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy about the tactics. 
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough cleansing." 
Skeptics are the current approach is clearly inadequate. 
As the distrik in October was sought by display eight female recruits, an editorial in the Beijing evening news the question of whether the women had real tasks or will only serve as optical distraction. 
Probably both. 
According to stellenanzeige were women between the ages of 18 to 22 with good figure and "harmonious gesichtszügen sought." 
They should be stronger than average size - on 1,5m or 5 feet 2 1/2 customs. 
The job ends with achievement of 26 lebensjahres. 
According to the officials, the work for women over 25 physically uncomfortable. 
"The most important thing is their image," was a unbenannter distriktbeamter in the almost regierungs-webseite rednet.com. 
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first of its external phenomenon, such as size, weight, gesichtszüge, and so on." 
Then come temperament and "internal qualities." 
"Female chengguan are like blumenvasen," he said and added, "but they also have other duties." 
Zheng lihua, deputy head of the municipal council of the distrikts, would not agree with this description, 
But were to that in China größenvorgaben in stellenanzeigen for both sex are not unusual. 
The same is true for steady gesichtszüge. 
Whether this is synonymous with look good, is controversial in China. 
But people with disabilities or physical detects corruption need not to apply. 
"Here we can unfortunately, no lahmen or buckligen use," Mr Zheng. 
"would not be good to their image." 
Liu Yi on the baoguang-platz close to a monastery patroliert, 22, has apfelbäckchen and a well geformten mouths. 
They empfindetes not as a sexist that placed great importance on their appearance. 
"You find, I see in this uniform sexy?" asks them with a view ironischem. 
Their colleague with the grübchen, the 21-jährige Xu Yang, noted," We have the responsibility to represent the image of the city." 
According to her, the brief attitude does not regret it, because it is more ambitious karrierepläne had than simply traders by the gassen to scheuchen to it on geschäftemachen to prevent. 
Every morning deals, the streife with some 12 straßenhändler trying to as many as possible on foot or on the bicycle bread roll and tofugerichte to sell before they fortgejagt. 
"Mr Wang, they disappear ask here." 
"We have told them that has often said." frl. Xu was a trader that fled on foot and in his on a fahrradkarre befestigten nudelküche had temporarily left in the lurch. 
According to the women officials is the work is more repeating monotonously as troublesome. 
"It is almost every day is the same," said Huang jing, 20, studied in the leisure vertriebswesen. 
"All routine." 
One reason for this is that the dealers were not the female officials, as their male colleagues, can confiscate. 
They can only be criminals to threaten them to report their male superiors. 
This is to protect them from public hostility, which are often exposed to officials in China. 
This year, rioted outside hundreds of inhabitants of kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, after the rumour kursierte, chengguan-beamte had killed a trader. 
More than a dozen police officers and chenguan-beamte were injured in the night of the incident, 14 regierungsfahrzeuge have been undermined or set on fire.

But unrest are not carried out.

Officials had a use them confiscated, contrary to the rules on the pavement instead of in a werkstatt was repaired.

Li xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male streife, remained behind. He was in his white namensschild, in order to remain anonymous. 
Play as their colleagues of the coordinators - men over 40 - purely a supporting role. 
But they have not been trained to present a clean image. 
"Sometimes we go verbally before." 
"Sometimes but physically," said Mr Li austere. 
"Most of the time to catch people with the dispute."
