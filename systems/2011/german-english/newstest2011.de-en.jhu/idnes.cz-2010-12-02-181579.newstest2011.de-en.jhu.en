The right matratze and the right bettenrost? women than men have other wish 
Not the tollste bettrahmen, but the quality of the liegefläche - matratze and rost make up the good bed. 
This, however, must add harmoniously in order to live up to the wishes of the specific user. 
Many things play a role in the selection process, the weight of the size of the health and, not least, the sex of the schläfers. 
Just as important is also the interieur in which matratze and rost to have. 
Typical example? 
In a wochenendhaus, which will not be heated regularly are latexmatratzen not good, as they need much longer in order "to be warm." 
In addition, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethan-matratzen. 
And, they should be changed regularly. 
If they are not enough entlüftungskanälchen in essence and to lie on a firm plate, staut in moisture, so it is not excluded that is built on it. 
In the election plays a role of course, to what it is used. 
Anyone who has been in a long time abroad, where very high matratzen with weichschicht are common, will be difficult to a low matratze can be used with hard surface. 
"Probably all eishockeyspieler from the nhl have returned, have complained to me that they cannot sleep more right here." 
"for their abgeschundenen shoulders, fersen and hüften they just need a weichschicht from visco-schaum - memory foam - a formgedächtnis-polymer -." 
"I recommend that among other things, diabetics people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so they have the" information "from the gelenken and skin can receive a bad thing," says Sylva hadamcziková to polstermöbel specific. 
That is why I have been to many years ago eishockeyspielern, but also other customers this matratzen with visco-schaum - memory foam - worried. 
"Today, it is no longer a problem, because such matratzen offer including the manufacturers tempur, the Italian company magniflex or the Czech producers tropico." 
And we must not necessarily be a famous eishockeyspieler to the benefits of the visco-schaums estimate to learn. 
This "miracle" works really quite simple. 
The foam optimalisiert its severity and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, he schmiegt there is a real the warm body. 
It is nowhere in the night shifts are not around as after a major fight. 
We sleep simply much better. 
The viskoelastische foam also provides protection against dekubitus - wundbrand -. 
In the election of the matratzengröße should still be at the height of the length of the fußsohlen hinzurechnen, about 21 cm to 34. 
Man as Mrs, which are the 180 cm high, need a 210 to 220 cm long bed. 
Each of the schläfer should at least 90 cm liegebreite available, together so 180 cm. 
In einzelbetten, for example, in singles, 120 to 140 cm are appropriate. 
The komforts to be half and also for any visitors. 
Otherwise, the following faustregel lies on the backs of the bettbreite ideals," If you should still be enough room for the easy angewinkelten be poor," advises ing. helena prokopová, the zunftmeisterin the polsterer and raumausstatter, which has been for years the problems of common schlafes and the ergonomie devotes furniture and this issue was also at the university. 
In a doppelbett needs each with its own rost and his own matratze, but be careful the purchase, so that the matratzen are high in a moment. 
Otherwise, do nothing other than the roste to fit in a different level and that is not a long time ago with each bettrahmen possible. 
Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, matratzen with federskelett 15 cm, it should have at least three centimeters on the formschicht and the feinpolster disappear. 
"With the hand or to sit down the feathers in no case can be felt," warns helena prokopová. 
Any matratze makes a special rosttyp required. 
Ganzgepolsterte beds with matratze and documents as zusammengewachsene siamzwillinge have no place in the bedroom. 
This matratzen cannot to reveal and the relation cannot be washing what is already started today and were. 
And as you in a single night between 0.2 and 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the matratze slowly after five to seven years to a huge - and congested colander -. 
Are therefore experts werbeslogans from in matratzen a lifespan of up to 25 years, even life guarantee promise. 
Every thing has its if and but. 
And that is why a practical advice from the dealers: in matratzen of 120 or 140 cm wide should be the hygiene of waschbaren, abziehbaren salary not shy away from, nonetheless, it is recommended that a matratzenschoner to use that you can easily withdraw and wash. 
Even if today in the rule matratzenbezüge with rundumreißverschluss are produced, so you get two halves after the open - immensely important for the waschvorgang and the waschmaschinengröße! - is the manipulation with greater matratzen alone said, in particular, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. 
They have in bed instead of a rostes a firm plate? 
Out of it. 
Or at most for a bed for Cinderella guests and for a single night. 
So should they prefer the plate with lüftungslöchern oversight - if already are not in it - and matratzen with federskelett and 15 cm minimum allocation with sog. taschenfederkern and feinpolster use. 
Polyurethan-matratzen do not belong to such a documents. 
For not verstellbare lattenroste with 14 to 18 federleisten - lamellen - are latex- or sandwichmatratzen suited - perhaps also combinations of latex and kokos - is always pay roste with a greater lattenanzahl, 28, and more federleisten, with lordosenstütze in lendenwirbelbereich, and the possibility of the lattenhärte to regulate. 
On verstellbare lamellenroste are not matratzen with federskelett, because they do not respond to the ergonomische verstellung respond. 
In addition to the stiff attitude of the federleisten will also be specific flexible schultermodule required. 
We are talking about a specific Gaza of the federleisten, which will make it possible to implement the federleisten einzudrücken or even to verwinkeln that the specific einsinken shoulder the schläfers possible. 
Especially for men with broad shoulders of an important matter. 
There is even matratzenhersteller which have started," herrenmatratzen "weichzonen for the schulterbereich to use. 
Also is thought to the ladies - you gönnt you this weichzonen in the hüftgegend. 
For demanding customers are punktelastische flügelfedersysteme - lattoflex - or roste with punktelastischen kontakt-pads with sog. multitorsionsfederung determined. 
The pressure will be distributed on a number of points, which reduced the tension. 
But, if you have the right matratze and right rost a bad - too much and fülliges - kopfkissen used to go again lost most of the benefits. 
Here, too, faustregel: the kopfkissen should support the head of its leaders should only to the rich shoulders, so that the schultermuskeln can relax. 
Ideal is therefore a 50 x 60 cm great kissen How, for example, it may be the Scandinavians. 
In the seitenlage should the kopfkissen - together with the schulterentlastungszone in rost or the weichzone in the matratze - the schulterhöhe balance. 
Have something our modern matratzen have with the former - with Hay so - strohsäcken but in common. 
Modern producers increasingly use natural materials, or at least the mixtures. 
Also in matratzen is the new magic formula "organic." 
Instead of erdölrohstoffen be used to produce polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturelle oils, for example, rizinus- and sojaöl. 
Soya is likely to be used by all known manufacturers. 
"Organic means in matratzen that their core from materials is purely natural origin," said Petr vašíček of the company tropico plus. 
Naturstoffe but also in the production of matratzenbezügen used, one of the first was in the process of aloe Vera. 
But it can also mikrokapseln introduction of the sleep fresh wald- or lavendelduft spread. 
Here, too, there is a difference between men and women. 
During a "kühlender" in the men pflanzenextrakt from birkenblättern is used, so that the matratzenbezug can absorb the heat and cooling the body, the salary for women "wärmende" effect. 
Extrakte from red paprikaschoten stimulate the blutzirkulation to the weaker sex, so the sleep wohlig warm. 
And the favoriten today? 
Matratzen from kaltschaum - he has more poren with devastated zellstruktur and is therefore atmungsaktiver as a standard polyurethan and much more flexible -. 
Through the combination of various stiff - tough - of kaltschäumen and visco-schäumen arise mehr-zonen-matratzen who know exactly where head, hip and fersen are. 
For a quality matratze but it has 7000 kronor and more to berappen. 
Gesundheitsmatratzen but usually are burdened with lower VAT, as they apply as medical tools. 
The first Czech companies have been gumotex given this advantage. 
You see in the matratze and on rost is not so easy to save. 
Now and again, there are sonderangebote of producers and traders, the two matratzen offer for the price of one. 
The magniflex brand offers the matratze duofreeze with in terms of verstepptem visco-schaum memory for 11.990 czk. 
The second will be free to do so. 
It was the material tempur the era of the viskoelastischen schaumstoffe with open zellstruktur and high density in almost kosmischem launched pace. 
No surprise, they were developed but for the NASA, because the astronauts are huge in the launch überbelastungen suspended. 
Tempur is soft, with heat in a cool setting it strengthens again. 
So it is perfect to the human body, and distributed in the best possible manner körperdruck. 
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent druckbrand, but generally increase the schlafkomfort. 
Viskoelastische schaumstoffe but not only in matratzen, but also in other gesundheitsprodukten, such as, for example, in particular fußpolstern used to give the legs and the gefäßen relief. 
Local manufacturers use, for example, the schaumstoffe eucatherm C, twinsaver or similar products.
