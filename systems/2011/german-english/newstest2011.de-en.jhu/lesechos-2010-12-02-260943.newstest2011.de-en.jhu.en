World Cup 2018-2022: the FIFA will appoint the ausrichterland 
In bright excitement because of korruptionsverdacht will appoint the exekutivkomitee the FIFA on Thursday ausrichterländer of World Cup 2018 and 2022, a highly political election, in which the rangeln for influence, and it was lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria in the background. 
But one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of the FIFA königsdisziplin will take place in Europe, their traditional hochburg, - the 4 candidates: England, Russia, spanien-portugal, niederlande-belgien -. 
The edition 2022 will then be exotic something; the International Football Federation hopes new territories after the first on the African continent in the year 2010 - Qatar, Australia - can win for themselves, or its branch in the United States or in the Far East - Japan, South Korea - to pursue further. 
The list of people who belong to the delegation - David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch leader, Zidane, beckham, cruyff - is the degree of economic and political use of a World Cup. 
The actions behind the scenes are therefore encourage until the last minute. 
Difficult otherwise to draw up a hierarchy of candidates. 
In the aftermath of the FIFA evaluationsbericht, provide the English, spanisch-portugiesische - 2018 - and us - 2022 - acts bessseren arguments than its competitors. 
But these considerations for the 22 members of the exekutifkommitees not be so strong on the hour of the election. 
The Sunday Times, which provoke the suspension of two members of the exekutifkommitees - reynald temarii and Amos Adamu - was the beginning of the revelations, if the opportunities for their own country as well, can ruin the cradle of football, was allowed to fight the World Cup only once, in 1966. 
The BBC had given the breeding ground renewed on Monday by a dokumentarbericht had broadcast of the three senior members of the kommitees, Ricardo teixeira, Nicolas leoz and issa hayatou is under attack. 
Reason enough to anger the FIFA and the English leaders to bring in embarrassment, in the first place, with David Cameron in these last few weeks, an intensive was lobbying had operated. 
The Head of Government hopes for a resumption of the of his predecessor Tony Blair successful schachzuges, which in 2005 had reached the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games to London. 
This intensive use would be sufficient to the image of England before the kommitee enhance again? 
Nothing is less safe because the duo spanien-portugal there is no shortage of trümpfen, with its already ready stages, his expertise - 82 World Cup in Spain, 92 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal - and his fußballkultur. 
But the economic and financial downside of the two countries could dampen their ambitions. 
The possible reprisals against the English, and the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal make the opportunities of Russia which, despite its gaps in the dossier - stadiums, hotels, transport - The important outsider has become rise. 
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided that the unumwundenen suggestion to the bezichtigungen the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" on the part of the kommiteemitglieder denounced. 
"You bewirft them with dirt, you try to compromise," lashed out Putin. 
For 2022 seem strengthened by the experience of the United States in 1994, the logical favoriten. 
First economic world power, seat of the country fifa-hauptsponsoren seems a long list of yielded benefits to Japan and South Korea, which have set a very good project separately. 
But these new nominations seem premature for two countries, the competitions in 2002 mitorganisiert had. 
A different threat: the hotly desired by the FIFA approval for the World Cup 2026 for China to let the lapse of the Asian opportunities to 2022. 
With Australia and Qatar, with the aufwartung futuristischer stages had drawn all register, the FIFA has its expansion in the direction of new areas, but these two countries constitute a greater risk because certainty. 
Australia could as well as Japan and South Korea under the weakness of the European countries akquittierten of television rights - because of the zeitverschiebung - have to suffer the sensitive nerve of the FIFA.
