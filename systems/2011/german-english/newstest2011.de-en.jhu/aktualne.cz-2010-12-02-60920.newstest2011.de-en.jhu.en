A tenant of bakala: he fuels in the foot - still pay higher miete 
An older untersetzter man leaves just the klientenzentrum society rpg byty of "kohlebarons" zdeněk bakala, the largest privatbesitzers of mietwohnungen in the Czech Republic. 
Under the arm of a mappe with three new mietverträgen on three homes, for its own and the homes of his daughters and his son, just a sentence. 
All three have been within the framework of the sog. "deregulation" is the miete increased. 
Instead of 3 500 kronor monatsmiete is the son of the next year for a 2-zimmer-wohnung with kitchen of the second category 4100 kronor berappen. 
"And there is not a time in the home of hot water and heating must be in a simple kohleofen," for he is angry with the finger on the new mietvertrag of the Son, to which he signed a power. 
"But what - property I signed," he says annoys half and half resignedly. 
's citizens' association bytyokd.cz, the new mietbedingungen referred to as "immoral" by and advises the mietern, is simply not to sign new contracts and to wait until the seventh of December, in which it intends to publish a guidance as to how to take action against such contracts. 
But only from the man to win. 
"A says, that" the other, this makes it a finsteres face. 
The region ostrava will go to a large "deregulierungslabor." 
After neujahr this deregulation is the most mietwohnungen before in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not marktgerechte miete figures. 
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" personally. 
The rpg-warteraum in havířov is one of four in the region ostrava and already nine a.m. in this Tuesday brechend full. 
Start in addition to the door, the bodyguards a sicherheitsagentur and with it a aufrufgerät. 
"miete in 2011," is a special tastfeld on the touchscreen. 
Briefly angetippt and already spuckt the machine, a nummernzettel. 
We have hardly the number "157" entziffert and already piepst it on display at the ceiling of the great warteraums. 
Half a second later, one in the series. 
A little later enters an older married couple the warteraum to after the miete to questions, but the arrival of the warteraum is obviously not the new miete. 
Most of the people are here to solve the usual problems, reparaturanträge, versicherungsangelegenheiten and so on. 
As of the middle of November flattern in the region ostrava the kuverts with the new mietverträgen most of the mietern out of a total of 44.000 homes of the portfolios of the rpg in the scenario. 
The rpg byty proposes them in the letter, a mieterhöhung of around 15 to 38 percent. 
The Special counters for the new rent in the klientenzentrum has opened since 18 November. 
"The action is something about a week, that is, this is only the beginning," answers the ladies behind the counter at hesitate after a moment, when the "client" emerging as a journalist. 
The deregulation and bakalas former bergarbeiterwohnungen are a sensitive issue. 
Before the elections, the from ostrava originating deputy speaker he lubomír zaorálek by the čssd addressed this issue quite loudly, it is no wonder that today, the newspapers are full of them. 
"Twenty years I want a new floor of them." 
"Not even ne besch. wc-brille they could auswechseln" Air makes the man mentioned at the beginning. 
Until now, according to the working, especially the switch of pensioners, in order to see whether they the promised mietermäßigung really that they have rpg promises if they spezialangebot sign on time. 
In the benefit of a reduced to half februarmiete come to the other tenants, the new mietvertrag sign until 15 December. 
Until now," deregulierungsschalter "in havířov but everything other than overloaded by demand. 
"Yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the miete in 2011 because here," We appreciate very much the schalterbeamtinnen. 
Rpg it offers both on their websites and wandtafeln individual mietvereinbarungen, where it seems necessary. 
Should the mietparteien but not agree on the new miete, they will set by an independent court. 
"This is not a threat, but as information on the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach to understand," said rpg on its Web sites. 
"No one goes to court in this area," says one of the working of rpg byty and a man in the street before the klientenzentrum gives it at least partly right. 
"I have 13 - SEK - Pension, of which remain me 5,000 to eating left where I should find the money for a gerichtsstreit," he says. 
Then the employees but is uncertain. 
"See time." 
"Mr zaorálek tells them about the media, they are not sign and so the people still wait from," is to consider it. 
The regulated miete ends in the largest part of Czech neujahr 2011 and rpg byty is, according to the mieterhöhung an economic necessity. 
"The existing level of the rent is not enough time to the maintenance of the wohnfonds from," argued Pavel klimeš, the director of the wohnungs-portfolios society rpg byty and - particularly the exasperated mietern criticised neglect of wohnungsfonds is, in the opinion of homeowners, the main reason for the mieterhöhung. 
During rpg rent in the years between 2005 and 2010 collected from the four billion could invest in the homes, in the four years from 2011 until 2014, there should be 5.2 billion. 
On the großformatigen lcd-display to the ceiling to the polstersesseln in warteraum of havířov, then again and again a few red shining on information. 
"The mieterhöhungen by 15% in 2011 and less concern 31 200 homes, that is more than 90% of the homes of rpg." 
"Always This means no more than 7,50 czk per square metre and month," is on the lcd-monitor to read. 
Only 400 homes in from the portfolio of rpg increased the miete at 38 percent. 
"In these cases, it is about the increase of extremely small mietpreise of 19,66 czk per square metre," argued rpg. 
In 2600 homes remains the miete at the same level in the next year. 
Rpg byty promises that the deregulation of the Rent is not jumped in the level, but gradually take place within four and eight years. 
What is more, the company on a further commitment: all of the revenue from the mieterhöhung - see diagramm - the company wants to get stuck in the homes, especially in wärmeersparnisse - in new windows and the wärmedämmung. 
But - primarily benefit those people to this, the agreements on the mieterhöhung sign.
