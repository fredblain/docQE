Sport and regelumgehung 
Tricks like the alonso and Ramos in the game against the ajax show erfindungsgeist, but not the will to avoid a sanction. 
The supposedly of two players of Real Madrid - xabi alonso and Sergio Ramos - angezettelte exclusion in the game of 23 November against the ajax led to a lot of ink in the Champions League was spilled about whether it is a unsportliche Act was or not and whether any both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA. 
As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before spielende - their team had already clearly won - time and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card. 
In this way, and as the Real Madrid would give his group, the two players of the mandatory sanction the next ligaspiel against the auxerre meet and embark on the next spielphase without cards. 
Finally, the disziplinarkommitee the UEFA, the coach of the clubs, José mourinho, with two to play and the players involved with different amount of money. 
The provocation of a yellow card is not a new practice in such or similar circumstances, it is more often found in the world of football. 
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport befolgten rules. 
Part of that debate set forth in the case is back to that that a team of Real Madrid club - the anthem in his edelmut and honour and provides its players had punished for similar incidents in other occasions - and played the lead role, and on the dramatisierung by mourinho more of an episode of its long history as theatralischer and provozierender technician has added. 
In any case, is the debate about whether this not explicitly banned by the statutes behaviour is against the principles of sport, that is to say whether these actions represent a regelumgehung. Indeed, this approach to the Statute of the sport, but seem to avoid its meaning. 
In this matter should the sportsgeist damage caused to be studied. 
The sportsgeist defended the physical integrity of the counterpart, an aspect that was not endangered by these acts, because it was not an aggressive game. 
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the zuwiderhandelnden players an unjustified use from the gegenteam draw. This did not happen. 
The paradox of the Act of Real Madrid players is that it does not coincide with what we usually under falschspiel or regelumgehung understand because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly taken to avoid a penalty, but it should be as striking as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. 
The players waited, and happily took the sanction. 
A different question is what kind of benefit of the zuwiderhandelnden from the deliberate fouls Drew. 
This should be stressed that the rival has not been brought in a less favourable position still benefits for the gespielte game erheischt were because the obvious result of this action was that continue to play their own team with fewer players. 
It is also no useful strategy for the next game because the club has not then on these players. 
The advantage is obviously that the players of the next round of the Champions League spielphase without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game, begin. 
But it is a long, uncertain Advantage to a certain extent, as the team could eventually retirement. the players also received a sanction with this approach and go on in the second kartenzyklus, in which it because of kartenanhäufung retiring with a card of less than in the first cycle. 
So that it is not clear whether it really is an advantage. 
Eventually put such procedures are not against the sportsgeist, which also includes strategic decisions, in order to benefit from the provisions of a maximum. 
In this case the players wanted to avoid no sanction - this would really be a clear case of regelumgehung -, they wanted more to choose when they undergo this. 
They took a strategic decision to avoid without a penalty or to flee before her. 
Although the Border between imagination and regelumgebung blurred is, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness. 
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because it by two selbstausschlüsse was and because of the nature of the unprovoked regelübertragung. 
The damage that was done by these acts of the principles of sport is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
