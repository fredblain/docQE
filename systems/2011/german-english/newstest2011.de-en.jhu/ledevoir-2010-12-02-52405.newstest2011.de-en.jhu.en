Global Plan for the renewal of the lighting 
The UN has a plan for the renewal of the lighting of households yesterday in Cancun, Trade and Industry in 100 countries in relation to the achievement of a reduction in the treibhausgases - CFC - proposed that the equivalent of nearly a third of the additional reduction, which must be carried out in order to stabilize the earth's climate by 2020. 
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the specific projects, which hopes to implement the UN in Cancun, in order to compensate for the absence of constraints reduktionsverpflichtungen of developed countries. 
After the plan expressed yesterday, the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes would - gt - of CFCs because of the lighting made on the earth be avoided if the weißglühenden pears, which has yet to constitute a monopoly on the market from 50 to 70%, by fluoreszierende or, better still, by leuchtdioden - led - would be replaced. 
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions. 
This represents an equivalent of 70% of the smoke of global fleets. 
In Copenhagen had the big last year abgasemittenten such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including those from Canada also was to voluntary reduktionsplänen to the global fckw-emissionen of 53 gt to 49 gt herunterschrauben should. 
From this record, it would, however, still 5 gt to withdraw today by the year 2020, the klimaanstieg to stabilise 2 degrees Celsius, in order to prevent this spiral out of control. 
In the weißglühenden pears entweicht 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light. 
With the kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced by 75% of the energy consumption, with the new led-glühbirnen be reduced this energy once again in the double. 
The kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen keep between 6,000 and 10,000 hours on average. 
The new led-glühbirnen, such as those of the manufacturers Philips has put on the market this week, the society has, in the uno-studie part - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours pears and use less energy than a weißglühende 80%, which is a suggestion of the einsparmöglichkeiten of auswechselungsplanes message that should be applied in 100 countries. 
In addition to the fact that iese completely novel make very little heat incandescent light bulbs, they can also with a regelwiderstand work. 
And they do not contain any mercury. 
Several specialists have shown that kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves are because they contain mercury and that they are so as sondermüll to dispose of what is not always possible, except in the developing countries, the producers are a Bring Centre available. 
The main source of quecksilberemissionen on the planet, according to the report, however, does not have the kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal plants that emit much more mercury to the weißglühenden pears wasted to produce electricity. 
In the United States alone push this coal plants 25,000 tons of mercury from every year. 
The report gives detailed the profits of each country thanks to this international programmes would earn. 
Indonesia would, for example, a billion dollars a year in the purchase of electricity and save eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 kohlekraftwerken, whose erbauung Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
