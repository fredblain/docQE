Staatsanleihe for the takeover of excentris 
The quebecer government, which has been called on by the Société angus and the company parallèle financially in the takeover of the kinokomplexes excentris declared to participate with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive bond. 
The entwicklergesellschaft angus, as well as the company parallèle a donation to the tune of seven million dollars by the kultusministerium for the adoption of Daniel langlois belonging kinokomplexes excentris on the boulevard saint-laurent had hoped to have this back its actual cineastischen role to überantworten, do not seem to get what you have demanded. 
Although the government has accepted to involve in this matter, but on their own terms. 
Instead of the expected donation offers the quebecer government instead of a bond in less than the amount originally hoped to launch the conditions to benefit a viable solution could, at least according to opinion from the state gerüchteküche entnehmbaren sources. 
A first action plan and a question after 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, the bittgesuch was again since the summenmäßig revised downward. 
A proposal, along with a plan of action have already been the president of the "Société de développement des Entreprises culturelles' - sodec - François macerola, Minister of st-pierre broadcast, which chairs the excentris file. 
Several days ago, he had her a last sachbericht send. 
The counter-proposal of the Cabinet, the sodec, however, sent on Wednesday. 
Parallèle and angus now have time to respond to this by the end of December. 
In any case, the premise of the staatsspende really been pushed to the side. 
Let us remember that the quebecer eigentümergemeinschaft of cinema and kinokomplexe against a direct staatsinvestition to support the adoption of excentris aufgelehnt had issued by the argument, the culture minister have no financial aid for immobilienprojekte to play there, which he does not other kinosälen have to send. 
Several other participants of the segment, but in contrast to a substantial, economic assistance. 
Kinochef Daniel langlois had after the eigenfinanzierten construction of the cinema for more than ten years under great difficulties, the autorenkino in the premises of his kinokomplexes presented what could justify the's unique position on the part of government money. 
The lack of kinosälen, the independent films show is more than evident in Montreal, and excentris knew his clients want to keep on board. 
The Société angus and the company parallèle with Christian yaccarini at the top, taxes, for its part, a privately funded campagne, of which they hoped for a sum of $700 000 to stimulate the acquisition. 
Since the spring of 2009 is only a single screen that continues to show films in excentris, namely Le parallèle. 
Aim of the future erwerber it is, the three kinosäle on 27 February next year with the exhibition of the very successful film of Mr beauvois "of the hommes et the dieux" to open a new one. 
Christian yaccarini but the newspaper "Le devoir" has not removed, and they ignored what he and his group of the proposals to keep you has made to the bottom respectively.
