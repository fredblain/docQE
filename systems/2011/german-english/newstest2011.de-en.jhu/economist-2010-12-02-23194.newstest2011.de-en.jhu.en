Secretly in the middle 
In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy that their beliebtheitsrate drove to over 50% up by 20 points. This is the highest value since its election in 2007. 
Whether it provides a reelection in the coming year, however, depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández kompromissbereiter than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner néstor Kirchner. 
The signs are not clear. 
Néstor Kirchner, who drew the economic policies, even after the election of his wife was often budgets on the tax revenue, the economic growth and inflation does not fully take into account. 
This allowed the präsidentenpaar, the extraeinnahmen spend after its own views. 
On paper, the fernández-regierung the majority in Congress in the last year. 
But the opposition is divided and Kirchners death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further zerwürfnissen. 
Some dissidents from the ranks of the ruling peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández. 
But after chaotic meetings - in which a different face had a member of Parliament and the Government of the other bribery bezichtigten - The Congress failed to pass the budget for 2011. 
"I will not have a debate on it," the president. 
The 2010 budget is now for the next year, which the President still has more opportunity to spend money according to its own views. 
The economy is hot: It will probably grow by up to 9% this year. 
The official rate of inflation is z.z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - unions and wage demands - drive the value to almost 30%. 
Kirchner, who took over the post in 2003, when Argentina was ridden by economic crises, said growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not the inflationssenkung. 
He refused the cooperation with the IMF, singled out for the private sector and säuberte the National Institute for Statistics and Census indec, which then the official inflationsstatistiken schönte. 
Fernández can now a mäßigeren path? 
It has called on the private sector and the trade union leader to talks. 
And, according to official statements should be limited to 18% wage increases in the next year. 
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have been a strong boost to the economy. 
But the inflation undermined the wachstumsschub by a great devaluation in 2002. 
Would probably Cristina Fernández For this reason, Argentina finanzwirtschaftlich back to join the rest of the world. 
At the beginning of this year, the Government an agreement with wertpapierinhabern, had rejected the previous rescheduling of the country in 2001. 
Now appears Fernández to push for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which it owes about $6.7 billion. 
The Kirchners have had a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere, always rejected. 
But last month, the economy minister amado boudou known that the Fund in the drafting of a new national index of consumer prices will make "technical assistance." It is as this would be the first step towards the cleansing of the indec. 
It is not known whether Fernández after the end of their term will be politically active without the support of her husband. 
If so, it needs to get the support of the middle class, which has largely enough by the kirchnerismus. 
If the Argentines in March from their return to their summer holidays, the wave of sympatie it was shown, abgeebbt. 
If you would like to win another election, they must decide whether they quietly lifted many of her husband's political decisions.
