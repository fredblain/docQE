Love in times of war 
Since angelina jolie in the summer with the work on their still nameless regiedeb端t has begun, there is trouble. 
The scenario has written they themselves, a liebesgeschichte between a woman from Bosnia and a Serb man. 
Know much more about it, we do not, but even that is enough for unrest. 
The rumour persists, the woman, a Muslim, verliebe during the jugoslawien-krieges in their Serbian rapists. 
Bosnian women's associations have immediately protested, and some of the planned in Sarajevo drehtage were transferred to Hungary in the short term. 
The film is now marginalised in Hungary and in the postproduktion, but it is still protested in Bosnia. 
Bakira hasecic female casualties from the organization wrote about the un-fl端chtlingshilfswerk UNHCR to jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported, jolie is even Ambassador of un-fl端chtlingshilfswerks. 
Diplomatically, it is not, it has been the women before weeks time offered a meeting in Hungary, but what the rejected. 
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, hasecic. 
Liebesgeschichten in vergewaltigungscamps have not been it, and jolies attitude towards the victims will her enough about the scenario. 
Her organization has the un-fl端chtlingshilfswerk according to recommended that jolie as Ambassador to be released, The Guardian reported. 
But what exactly has jolie written for scenes? 
The Bosnian kulturministerium, which has had to read their scenario after some and forth a drehgenehmigung given for Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why jolie then was not yet. 
The jungautorin themselves have claimed that they has no political intentions with her film, with a lot of trouble in the jugoslawien-konflikt incorporated, wants to show the terrible consequences of war and give a voice to all the parties involved. 
The content but it remains vague. 
So I have a second synopsis for film in the network, which then sounds quite different: The loving knew it before kriegsausbruch and meet again, when you, a Bosnian Muslim, is abducted in a Serbian camp, in which he works as a lively. 
What is but sounds much different than the variant "rape victims verknallt in folterknecht." 
That jolies film actually, even before the war begins, so much is safe. 
The pressure on them, jolie, was "unfair and is based on fehlinformationen." 
Now you can only be the hackers make peace by Hollywood: by the scenario, as has been so many before, put on the network illegally.
