Puzzling erdarbeiten 
The Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence on a secret nuclear programme in Syria. 
But the country refuses to comment on that, nor does it controls. 
Against midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli f-15 I fighter planes a mysteriöses, würfelförmiges buildings in Syria. 
It is on the shores lie of the Euphrates; the next major city, 30 miles away, is dair as-saur. 
Your name, in Documents to the International Atomic Energy Agency - IAEA - on Syria, when it comes to the reactor, allegedly with help from North Korea in the quader has built, hiding in a valley of the electricity does not have. 
According to a briefing by the us-auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA by the end of April 2008 would be under the name of the Middle ortschaft el-kibar geläufige reactor has been well suited to produce plutonium - from the left to build nuclear weapons. 
For other purposes, is hardly the technology from the fifties. 
The CIA conducted a videopräsentation before with unscharfen satellitenbildern. 
By computeranimation blendete where they should have been before the destruction of the components of the reactor, which fell a copy of North Korean model from the atomzentrum yongbyon was. 
They also presented photos, the show from the vicinity of the building or even the innenraum. 
The reactor had been just before the opening, it said, but not yet with brennstäben dispense have been. 
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more aware than at the time, the mystery has been increasing rather with time. 
The former US President George W. Bush has recently in his memoirs, reveals that the CIA before the attack was quite sure that Syria is in el-kibar built a reactor, but hardly saw evidence that it was "an active's nuclear weapons programme" in the country. 
Some geheimdienstler in Europe are there to even more cautious and speak only of a "alleged reactor," even if the cia-präsentation keep for "plausible." 
They lack of hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. 
Asked how he is sure to have a reactor ahead, said a high un-diplomat only briefly in the summer, the IAEA have "enough material to questions to ask." 
The rubble of the alleged "unused militärgebäudes created" the Syrians hastily to one side and planierten thoroughly the site. 
However, took place in June 2008 iaea-team under the former chief inspector Olli heinonen in el-kibar traces of uranium, which was made by people. 
Also received a Member State of the IAEA satellite commercial providers from the time immediately after the attack, which should be stronger than that presented by the CIA. 
However, not to get these recordings on the market, because of the unknown principals - perhaps Israel - exclusively bought it. 
Therefore the IAEA can verify their authenticity is not independent. 
Syria has always claimed that never conducted a secret nuclear program or to have built a reactor. 
The uranium come by the Israeli weapons, said Damascus. 
But the, the IAEA after the analysis of the particles as unlikely back. 
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it, as well as on the satellite. 
Also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the ashes of the zerbombten building. 
But Israel is staunchly silent. 
"We will never comment on this," recently reaffirmed the official position of acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the time of the attack. 
So schleppt the investigation of the case since June 2008 without result out and "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority," such as allowing a high Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, after all, is a serious violation of the NPT in the room watching on the IAEA. 
As the key to progress in the information, the IAEA apparently three more bodies, the "need to be in functional link" with the alleged reactor - and in a different way than this still exist. 
In this context, the inspectors have so far not disclosed to the facilities it is, or what role they have or what they can appear suspicious. 
According to information provided by the süddeutschen newspaper, they will be in the IAEA internally as marj as-sultan, masyaf and iskandariayah described, in turn, derived from nearby cities. 
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington - isis - has identified these places and on satellitenbildern a gebäudekomplex in masyaf located in which it is probably one of the suspicious objects. 
It is probably in or directly, in addition to a base - just with this statement denied Syria the IAEA access to the three places. 
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians were a fishing expedition - that the IAEA by the United States vorgeschickt will to militäranlagen auszuspähen. 
Because the nukleardetektive were by a tipp the us-geheimdienste become aware of the institutions. 
The IAEA has evidence, including satellitenfotos that between the three places and the quader lie on the Euphrates material has been moved back. 
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the sites could "in connection with the brennstoffproduktion are." 
But there is "no evidence of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes, which are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons. 
The reaktortyp will be operated with uranium, which is not enriched. 
But where the uranium should have come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated, to this central issues, there are at most plausible suspicions. 
What is also unclear is whether pieces of debris, the valuable traces mountains could have been stored in the three places. 
As if the hundreds of lastwagenladungen disappeared from the ground, nobody wants to have information on where the rubble has remained. 
Only a few kilometres from el-kibar, on the other hand, lie of the Euphrates, salzmine al-tibni that Syria has investigated their competence in 1998 as a camp for radioactive waste, the IAEA as is unlikely. 
The former iaea-inspektor Robert kelley it had in a recent analysis of satellitenbildern for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review brought in connection with the reactor. 
Recordings from the orbit show, however, that Syria places in the three suspects erdarbeiten undertaking and remote large container after the IAEA had requested access. 
This can be a coincidence, but has done little to dispel the suspicions. 
It is also in diplomatenkreisen, the IAEA have spent many months to develop a plan for inspections there that should allow it to Syria any militärgeheimnisse to maintain - alone the tape shows how big is the interest of the inspectors. 
Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte from this proposal. 
Western diplomats in Vienna had contained a year ago that the reactor is destroyed, so the matter does not have a high level of urgency, brings about us-botschafter Glyn Davies since a few months' sonder-inspektionen into play, one of the harshest means that the Vienna atombehörde to enforce controls. 
Iaea-chef yukiya amano of these inspections should propose an option of "has already spoken for which I am open in the future," but he does. 
There is a high risk in this way: on the one it needs for a majority in the gouverneursrat of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented there are eager to anything other than an escalation. 
On the other hand, as a diplomat to are concerns: "What if they find nothing at the end?"
