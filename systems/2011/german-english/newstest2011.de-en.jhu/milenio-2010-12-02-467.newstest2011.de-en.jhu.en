China maintains its objectives for the reduction of greenhouse gases 
The representative of China said at the cop16 that his country had enormous efforts to reduce the kohlenstoffspuren done and it would maintain his offer, 40 to 45 percent by 2020 to reduce its greenhouse gases. 
China sees his offer of the emission of greenhouse gases in order to reduce 40 to 45 percent by the year 2020, assured Su Wei, the representative of the country on the cop16. 
In his first public appearance in the 16 weltklimagipfel of the United Nations - cop16 - Su Wei assured that his country would have enormous efforts to lower the kohlenstoffspuren and taken to convert its industry. 
He said that his country have invested $245 million dollars in the last four years in order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. 
However, he said that China would not change its objectives, but would work together with the international community in this matter. 
He said that China's strategy on climate change in four aspects unterteile: dialogue, capacity building, construction of institutions and support of pilotprogrammen. 
We have made progress in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energiegesetzes last year, which delivers the objectives on the reduction of emissions of gases, he said. 
On the other hand, he pointed out that the authorities of the States in China with those of the zentralstaats and the communities have worked to the objectives of the energy conservation, an effective use of energy and the reduction of emissions to achieve. 
He also led, have already been addressed some multiannual plans or completed, both those that were financed by the Chinese government, as well as such the money received by other countries. 
For example, he was referring to the programme on the effective use of energy, which was introduced in the last five years and investment of the United Nations - UN - that the government had received and from private hands. 
There is also a project revenue at provincial level on climate change, another for the exchange of the traditional incandescent light bulbs by energiesparbirnen and another to discourage and adjustment, he said. 
Martin krol, scientific regierungsberater on climate change in this country, confirmed that the efforts of China would are much greater than is commonly believed. 
It showed that the pro-kopf-emission of greenhouse gases in China six tonnes per person betrage, while there are 100 tonnes in the United States. China is for a neunprozentigen envelope responsible for the pollution. 
Also shall be unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. The energiewirksamkeit has been increased by 20 percent in the last five years and by the year 2020, another should be done, he said.
