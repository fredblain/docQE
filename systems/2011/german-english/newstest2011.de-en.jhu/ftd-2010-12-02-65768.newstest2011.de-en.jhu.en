Ogoniland is burned down 
The water in the rivers is ölbraun, as the smell of the tankstelle: billion litres of ausgelaufenes crude oil have nature in the Nigerian ogoniland destroyed. 
The lives of people of theft, corruption and illegal ölkochen. 
Celestine akpobari means well. 
"has hit you not from," reassured the ökoaktivist the journalists: "Today you will have enough oil in the linse wars." 
The 37-jährige Nigerians has followed the attempt to the chest in the water, a watenden young with around him schlieren abzulichten: in the regenbogenfarbenen wasserglanz is the scene of almost beautiful. 
That under the surface, Brown rohölschwaden tops, is not to be seen. 
Used to have you here eimerweise shrimps collected, told esther badom on the shores of bodo-jetty-flusses. 
The lazy fluid waters is now completely dead. 
Five years ago, poured from a geborstenen rohrleitung quantities of crude oil in the huge river wetland. 
Fishermen from the nearby städtchen bodo must now rowing for six hours in fischhaltige waters to REACH: that at the heart of the nigerdeltas located ogoniland is regarded as one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world. 
On the trip by the flussläufen durchzogenen mangrovensümpfe will be the full extent of the verheerung striking. 
Instead of helles water wühlt the motorboot Brown brühe on who his hand into the water, is ölige fingers out. 
The roots of the mangrovenbäumchen stand out as black lakritzstangen from the ground, they can occasionally involved palmen their wedel hanging. 
Vogelschwärme, as they are usual in wetlands, is in vain: as soon as the außenborder remains silent spreading in the sweep as a tankstelle former paradise gespenstische calm. 
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says celestine akpobari gloomy: "We live in constant danger to the health." 
The kriegsvergleich is appropriate. 
The siedlungsgebiet the ogoni is akin to disputed battlefield for decades: here, more than 60 years ago, the first explorateure from Europe, organized here in the 1980s with the later exekutierten writer Ken saro-wiwa the first resistance here to shell-konzern 1993 to cease its production because it for its ölarbeiter was too dangerous. 
Even today the company is the return to ogoniland denied that, while from the whole of deltaregion Of the Triple size of Switzerland, with about 5,000 bohrquellen and 700 miles rohrleitungen be pumped more than two million barrels daily of the black gold are the oil fields in the ogoniland broke to the corporation, the situation is unstable. 
Every few hundred metres stand out stählerne gestelle as bizarre skulpturen out of the water," christbäumchen "are the heads of the bohrlöcher much to zärtlich mentioned. 
They are up to 50 years old, the most to the core korrodiert. 
Again and again breche such a bohrkopf apart, says akpobari, then rinne a constant flow of crude oil into the water. 
After more than two billion litres are expertenschätzungen every year to the ecosystem of the delta involved in 50 years: the amount of oil, as in the accident of the supertankers "exxon valdez" 21 years ago into the sea before Alaska drive - one of the biggest environmental disaster in the history of mankind. 
Who for the ongoing öko-gau is to blame, it will be fought. 
During the shell-konzern sabotage and organised öldiebstahl is responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see berstende bohrköpfe and lecke pipelines as main causes. 
Shell in Nigeria attach much lower standards than usual else in the world, accused the us-wissenschaftler Richard, Steiner, the corporation in 2008: only the rate of defects in the pipes was "enormously higher than elsewhere." 
In a place from distant as an abandoned, ölverschmierte werkstatt is conducted under the open sky, there are from the mangroven make: they are splitternackt and up to the neck ölverschmiert. 
Under one of the many fässer, the part with röhren linked to discern some arbitrary scattered on the site, flackert a fire: an illegal kleinraffinerie. 
Heated in barrels of the crude oil on the fire for several hours, said Michael, the leader of the group. 
Insist petrol through the pipes in the first auffangtopf later tröpfelt issued at the end of the management of kerosene, and diesel fuel. 
That produce Michael and four employees up to four a day fässer 300 litres of diesel à: "This brings us 34.000 naira A" - around 22 dollars. 
The deltabewohner use the chronic treibstoffknappheit in the largest erdölstaat schwarzafrikas. 
Nigeria has a single refinery. 
The with less than 40 euro-cent per litre ridiculously low dieselpreis can still undercut the illegal immigrants kocher: because they get their raw material in vain. 
He comes from "bunkerern" The pipelinenetz across ogoniland tap: go on this way, the country according to experts in the whole of the Niger Delta lost at least 16 million litres of crude oil every day. 
Only a very small part of the provisionally zwischengelagerten raw material, illegally veredelt: fill the lion's share of organised criminal networks, which include politicians and senior military to tankers and verscherbeln him on the world market. 
The debate of whether the environmental disaster rather umtrieben of the population or is due to lax production, the activist akpobari for purely academic. 
"The oil companies will not perceived as invaders and they would have the livelihood of fishermen not so thoroughly destroyed, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries." 
Now is the ratio of ogoni especially shell but destroyed so that only a withdrawal of the group's question would be: "Perhaps other nationalities are as the Chinese as better out." 
As Michael will be nervous. 
"high time that her to disappear," says the muskulöse ölmann. 
"The soldiers can come every minute." 
The illegal ölveredler caught by the Special Forces, threatens not arrest them, but I think a painful schmiergeld. 
The soldiers originating mainly from the north, like all Nigerians, want to benefit from the commodity. 
"This downright stuff has brought our country in every respect to the dog," says akpobari.
