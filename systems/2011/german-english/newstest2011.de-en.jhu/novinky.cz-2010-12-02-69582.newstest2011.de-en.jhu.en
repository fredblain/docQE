Czech children betrinken with fernet and beer rum is out, it is simply too slow 
Fernet, vodka and rum, for a time, a good whisky, the father of the people from the hausbar has stolen. 
These are the drinks to their benefit of drunken Czech teenagers under 15 most notbehandelt must be. 
Children are no exception, its kater have repeatedly in the ausschlafen hospital. 
This is clear from the experience of doctors, with similar cases in the opening of the kinderabteilungen faced by clinics. 
"beer or wine are completely out of fashion, simply because it takes too long to get drunk." 
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol," said právo luděk pelikán, the chefarzt the kinderabteilung in the mittelböhmischen clinic hořovice. 
"whisky, if we are successful, the father of a bottle from the hausbar to entwenden, and if not, then at least fernet or vodka. 
"vodka has the advantage of that you can mix it with juice, then, he is not so strong," said the chefarzt. 
The speaker of the fakultätskrankenhauses motol Eva jurinová him is right. 
"Most often, it is fernet or rum." 
"That is today's alkoholtrend, notably in schools." 
"We also wanted to take slibowitz, we are on board at home by well," Mrs led jurinová. 
Chefarzt pelikán, according to dreizehn- or vierzehnjährige drinkers in the krankenhausaufnahme not long ausnahmeerscheinung. 
Before the clinic in hořovice, he has been working for this year, he was ten years in the pädiatrie-abteilung ACT OF THE hospital motol, where the rettungswagen angetrunkene pupils from far and wide ablieferten. 
"A girl had to four times hospitalisiert." 
"They started their careers with 12 years ago, when the first time with a 3.5 level of alcohol in the blood and was still was taken in combination with" extase "to do so," a very serious case, described the doctor. 
"It was in ausstellungsgelände in holešovice on any tanzparty." 
"The interesting thing was that it was not strange that their mother 48 hours of their daughter was not home," at the chefarzt. 
Is the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance to start with its own sprösslingen is regarded as one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism of children. 
To make a genuine dependency in the true sense of the word, according to experts, it is not in children. 
"under Alcoholism is a longstanding chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomenon to understand and that is not the case with these children." 
Which enjoy the repeated alcohol, is mostly a negative familiär-sozialer background characteristic," says chefarzt pelikán. 
The speaker of the hospital motol, Mrs jurinová according to were about 40 drunken children until the middle of November in the European Department of Child Care and jugendmedizin eingewiesen. 
But only the cases with severe alkoholvergiftung, which is a krankenhausaufenthalt was needed to go in the statistics. 
Drunk children after ambulatory care of the parents or, if necessary, will be brought home by the police, are not registered. 
Out of the cases in which children only once a bottle of schnaps in the schulbank austrinken there is, in view of Mr pelikán three jahreszeitliche amplituden the reliance on 100%: walpurgisnacht, being New Year's Eve and the end of the academic year. 
"the latter for two reasons, either from pain due to the poor zeugnisses or from Joy to the holidays." 
"In the walpurgisnacht I have already seen seven drunken children at once in the opening," said Dr pelikán. 
A betrunkenes Child, which spends the night under medical supervision, is better off as a child, paradoxically, it only the next day with an unpleasant kater has to fight. 
The headache in the morning after which the dehydration and the glukosemangel arise, we can in a hospital with an flüssigkeitsspendenden infusion with glukose and nutrients, the absence of the organism, drive. 
"Clearly they are better off because after the 'beautiful' experience in the evening, raise it with good humour on without taking hurts." 
"They are just a little bit confused about where they are,," Dr pelikán, while the patients Sometimes he at least by the good humour in it, in that it will cost them the cost of the reality of the treatment. 
Because the transportation with the rettungswagen and the night in a akutbett come good and happy to a few tens of thousands of kronor. 
"Now and again, I have used this as erziehungsmittel, if I have the children for the trip vorgerechnet directly to what has cost their drunkenness and that it can happen very time that they have to work on all the holidays in order to earn the money for a single such fete," added Dr pelikán added. 
In his opinion, the krankenkassen not, however, after regressverfahren, in order to heal the trunkenen children demand necessary cost of the parents.
