Belarus is in agreement with this, not further waffenfähiges uranium anzusammeln 
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide, the Government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons. 
The deal was in a joint statement after a meeting of the Foreign Minister Hillary rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei martynov in an additional article of the sicherheitsgipfels made known. 
The US government had tried for years to persuade Belarus, not more highly enriched uranium to collect and seemed to have achieved a hurdle last spring. 
But the US administration official told the Washington Post that in the last two months, two geheimabkommen with Belarus have been taken to 187 pounds waffenfähiges uranium from a Belarusian forschungsanstalt to remove. 
That was the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material, according to an official staff, about 500 pounds to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue. 
The agreement is one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear sicherheitsgipfel Of the 47 nations" from April, the Belarus had ruled out. 
And it was obvious good enough to the invitation of the former Soviet republic to ensure the next summit of 2012. 
"I was really excited by the fact that they have a seat in the nuclear sicherheitsgipfel - from 2012 - like." 
"This shows me that it works," said Ken luongo, President of the partnership of global security, a group for the promotion of nuclear safety. 
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant and important step" of Belarus. 
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009, within a period of four years to ensure all vulnerable nuclear material. 
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of their highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus will be the seventh. 
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush. 
At the time of Obama's nuclear sicherheitsgipfel Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never abandon its uranium. 
"How to keep high enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos What is fundamentally waffenfähig, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time. 
"This is our resource... we will not make it dirty bombs and we will not sell it." 
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that is all." 
Belarus approached yet a few months ago the United States, as it a agreement's interest in the meeting. 
The first attempt to remove the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly difficult because the material easy contaminated by radiation was, official says. 
It was in a spezialzug load, the more than 1,500 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, official says. 
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the official by plane. 
The US government pays $14 million for this effort, with a large part of the money in the Belarussian research flows with depleted uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons. 
"This coordinated and was extremely careful" to build confidence, that led to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew bieniawski, a representative of the energieministeriums that in the global gefahrenreduzierung works. 
The Centre for the James Martin nichtweiterzugebende studies estimates that Belarus at least 88 pounds in this year waffenfähhigen uranium had and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus wants to dissolve his camp by 2012, according to the common agreement. 
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, first of all because of lukashenkos harsh abuse of human rights. 
But the statement from Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement. 
"Welcome the progress of this global security issues heißend, to give the United States of America and Belarus announced that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus is a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," it said.
