The North American Space Agency ordered a press conference tomorrow to a fund vorzustelle, which will have an impact on the search for life in all. 
The national air and raumfahrtbehörde - NASA - the United States is tomorrow, Thursday, a astrobiologische discovery known, could confirm the life of the theory of the existence außerirdischen. 
The fund will be 1 p.m. tomorrow at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts of astrobiologie presented. It is the origin of the development of a science, the distribution and examined the future of life in the universe.

IN ANY KIND of used the mikrobie the arsenic as überlebensressource. Taking into account the capacity increase the chances that it is on another planet, which do not have our protective atmosphere, could be similar life.
