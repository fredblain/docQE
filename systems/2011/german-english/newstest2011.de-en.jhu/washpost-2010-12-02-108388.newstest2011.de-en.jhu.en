Durchgesickertes us-dokument portrayed Moscow as a port of corruption 
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptokratie" and is a part of the bribes and the schutzgeldes, which they einsammelt, further to the Kremlin. As reported in February in a memo of the American Embassy in Russia. 
Both the police and the staatssicherheitsdienst blackmail high protection money, so that they can keep their expensive living standards in Moscow, it says. 
They collect money not only of legitimate businesses, but also by organized criminal gangs. 
Each layer of bureaucracy, which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has described as the authority "vertical" - takes its part of the money that the head up river. 
The memo, which under the name of the Ambassador John beyrle was sent to Washington, was on Tuesday of WikiLeaks published on its website. 
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited. 
It was written, while yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accused him of corruption. 
He was in October by President dmitry medvedev fired, but there is little evidence that in the meantime had been sorted out. 
Luzhkov and his wife, yelena baturina, which has a known construction company, have for years korruptionsvorwürfe rejected again and again, and he has a lot of verleumdungsklagen won against such attacks. 
In September, he said a Russian television when he was asked about a documentation, which suggests that he was corrupt," It is crazy, it is dreckig, it is dirty." 
> an unbelievably large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. The surveys have shown. 
But it is unusual that, as happened in the report of ambassador, mentioned by individuals, and It is unheard, that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country. 
"The direct link with the crime of the Moscow government has led to some described it as" disturbed "and come to the conclusion that the government seems more like a kleptokrat is as a government," the memo. 
"criminal elements enjoy a" kryshna "- a concept from the world of criminal/the mafia, which literally means" umbrella "or protection - with the police, the State Security - FSB -, dienstaufsichtsbehörde - mvd - and the Office of the Public Prosecutor, as well as covered by the whole of the Moscow regierungsbürokratie. 
Experts have discovered a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow. 
"Luzhkov is at the top." 
"FSB, mvd and are on the second stage of the militia." 
"The consequences of the ordinären criminal AND THE CRIMINAL inspectors at the lowest level." 
"This is a inkompetentes system in the criminal groups close a gap in some areas, because the city is offering no aid." 
The report goes on to say that the FSB money from the biggest firms from and that the police arrested small businessmen. 
A source, that is to say," said that Moscow's geschäftsinhaber understand that it is best to the protection of the mvd and to get FSB - and not the organised crime - because they have not only more weapons, resources and power as the criminal, but also because they are protected by the law." 
"For this reason, the protection by criminal gangs is no longer asked as it used to be." 
The memo pointed out that, while the collection of the money is comprehensive, not to protect itself be very modest; even the, the figures are sometimes arrested. 
The figures who do not find their business very quickly closed before - because of one or the other vorwands. 
Medvedev has talked about several times to fight corruption, but has said at the same time that he has made little progress. 
The memo of the message contains descriptions of the men with with koffern, probably were fully with money to go in the Kremlin. 
"in its fight against corruption must medvedev relying on the bureaucrats," said georgy satarov, Director of by, a Moscow think tank, in a recent interview. 
"But he is part of the bureaucracy." 
"It is not a part of the political class, because of a political class in Russia no longer exists." 
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable. 
Nationally, estimated by Russia corruption costs more than $300 billion a year. 
The country is a recent investigation on 154 square to global perception of corruption by the organisation of NGOs transparence internationally - countries of "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt" list -. 
The unveiling of the American Embassy memos what happened late at night after Moscow time, is certain to cause offense within the Russian government, although when Luzhkov can be blamed for the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to say that one of the problems löse. 
In an interview with Larry King on CNN, Putin claimed that the wikileaks-dokumente could be a forgery, and reacted furiously to the unveiling that American diplomats him batman and medvedev Robin have mentioned. 
"The truth is that it comes to our interaction, which is an important factor of the domestic policy in this country," he said. 
"But to be honest, we would not have expected that this happened with such a arrogance, with such a pressure and in a way as unethical, you know."
