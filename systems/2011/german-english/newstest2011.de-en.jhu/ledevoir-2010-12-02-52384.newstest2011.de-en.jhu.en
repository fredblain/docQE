This consortium, known as the 'énergie gérance," has been in 2004 as a corollary of the decision of their responsibility to the private sector hydro-québec broken, this important hydroelectric project in the level of a sum of $5 billion to überantworten formed. 
At the beginning of 2005 ergatterte the consortium "énergie gérance" the lucrative Treaty without that it might have been a public tender.

"This is a new way of abgekarteten game and refuted the competition." 
"This means that we rather than fix games instead of in a secret way now carried out in open form," declared yesterday sylvain simard, member of the pq, at the press conference. 
On early morning had simard raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems to understand him, such as the public interest in this way, can be served.

"I remain faithful to my line," lashed out, by confirmed that the pq had acted "Dishonest" and it "lack of its severity." 
They said that it "is the least" that the pq apologize. 
The model of the consortium is standard practice in the world. 
It is usually a time such a temporary alliance, which allowed two or more companies, their expertise known concerning a necessity for a tender for a complex project to join. 
The project "eastmain" has a high komplexitätsniveau with regard to his arbeitsausmaßes. 
The bauverfahren is under way and is to be set up by 2012. 
However, the Treaty was awarded without a competition had can take place; it had already been negotiations. 
The model of the consortium is also in Quebec Even with relatively simple projects no longer an exception. 
As the newspaper "Le devoir noted" last week, is in the area of bauingenieur- and beratungswesens model of the consortium applied the subject of regierungsermittlungen. 
A brief overflying the quebecer unternehmensregisters allowed it to name more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be consistent duration. 
In this way, for example, the company is working dessau in partnership with the majority of their kernkonkurrenten, to which cima +, génivar, snc-lavalin or Roche and tecsult count together. 
Any link, and there are several dozen, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely to dessau. 
With regard to the consortium of "énergie gérance," Minister has normandeau stressed that "the territory of the baie James a special arbeitskräftedynamik is subject to and that hydro-québec account of this fact since the 1970s in a special way gives." 
Réal laporte, the great employers Société d énergie de la baie James - sebj force, has issued a statement, which has the nose on the fact rümpfen let that the Treaty on the projektleitung after the agreement was approved. 
"If you make a tender and there are only a few candidates, your prices to soar." 
"You have two options: Either you nimmst people to this mart are and you say to yourself: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price." 
"The idea is, however, is that not the price is crucial, but underlined the expertise of the people," laporte. 
The consortium that "énergie gérance" APPROVED Treaty is part of a long list of contracts on more than 50,000 by the parti québécois received dollars. 
The contracts were either of the hydro-québec or the sebj for the project eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert approved. 
Was to review the newspaper "Le devoir" more than 100 ingenieurs- and beraterverträge, the firms or their branches, including, in particular, ressourcenlabors, between 2002 and March 2010 were allowed. 
Snc-lavalin had 22 contracts in gerafft, génivar had received 16, tecsult 14 and dessau 10, not counting their involvement in "énergie gérance" here. 
All of these contracts are negotiated. 
They amount to 449 in the entire $783 344, including the treaty with "énergie gérance" about 295 131 $564. 
Sylvain simard had indicated that the four firms, which form the consortium - bpr, dessau, Groupe sm and axor - the "parti libéral you québec are well known." 
Minister normandeau had let full capacity, the pq is equally associated with the companies they "financed" before they specify that it was about their leaders.
