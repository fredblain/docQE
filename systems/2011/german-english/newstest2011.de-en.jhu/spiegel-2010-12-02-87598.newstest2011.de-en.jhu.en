To hell, warriors. 
Suits splatter the kunstkino? 
The director Nicolas winding refn lotet with his kämpfer-epos "walhalla rising" old genre-grenzen new. 
To which audience may Danish director Nicolas winding refn have thought when he "walhalla rising" films? 
A prisoner wikinger-krieger with only one eye - mads mikkelsen - liberated from its peinigern and sets with almost superhuman powers to his opponents by the dozen - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero like rough tötungsmethoden served and his enemies have time the gedärme is breaking from the limb living, if he has bad humour. 
On the other hand, says einauge, as he is referred to in fact not a word on the whole film, and the other characters can only be time to one or two rates or a few painful todesschreien carried away. 
Otherwise, silent and in the gruselig fine hügellandschaft of Scotland geschwelgt the wikingerwelt offers the backdrop of around a thousand years ago. 
More ideal for adults cineasten with interest for existentialismus and very calm kamerafahrten. 
Nice if a film has several target groups, a pity only if they are mutually exclusive. 
Director winding refn applies since its wild and gestylten drogendealer-trilogie "pusher" as a kind of Danish version of quentin tarantino, but refuses stoisch, his works with a little more humour the mainstream or a little less brutality of the arthouse accessible to make. 
Most of the kunstkino-freunde should around by the spritzenden gehirnmasse and the gedärmen to deter. 
The action-fans die then before boredom at the latest, if einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons, with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem aufbricht and trapped in slump and fog, an eternity before the team seems to matter in America, and there is still silent. 
No wonder, then, that "walhalla rising in Germany" does not kino-verleih has found and is now only appeared on DVD. 
This is particularly because of the magnificent images of a jammer, but also because behind the prätentiösen until bluttriefenden facade hiding a sometimes exciting piece of cinema, which has something worthy of attention. 
In this film is not about dialogues or a stringent act, it is all atmosphere, a filmgewordener fiebertraum. 
And from which there is no escape to the viewers. 
Refn gönnt it hardly a moment of relaxation and like him with its icy pictures and the dark trance-artigen soundtrack very slowly to the throat, but above all with the stunning hatred of him from the heart of the characters runs. 
Only a small blonder young, the einauge is true to the side, retains such a thing as innocence, all the others will be driven by anger. 
The vast majority of the einäugige hero whose motives are never declared, but for enemies and allies at some point to the warriors from the hell will temporarily, perhaps even to the Ambassador of the devil. 
It means spoil, but perhaps only for the already verdorbenen. 
"walhalla rising" is a more puzzling film that you can hate and admire the cruel, upset and surprised. 
An experience.
