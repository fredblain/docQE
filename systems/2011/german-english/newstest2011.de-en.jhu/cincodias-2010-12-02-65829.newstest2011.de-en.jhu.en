Sabadell wants his rivals in three years to steal millions of customers " 
The Executive Director of banco sabadell, Jaime guardiola is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but rejects, first of all a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the schuldenkriegs. 
Nevertheless he sees a slump in the zinsspannen advance the banks with increases of the charges and try to offset the price for loans. 
Sabadell expected in three years, a million retail escaped, reached a still existing. 
Sabadell has found the way to exploit the next three years, and to survive in a very complicated economic environment. 
The bank will be a new one in 2011 dreijahresleitplan introduce. 
The goal is not just to survive without the support from the public frob entitled to take, but also the market share for a million Retail - 700 000, if we withdraw the clients, the bank will lose - to increase. That is the great challenge before this bank is, because until now, it has its geschäftskunden more attention than their retail. 
This year it has 250, 000 retail and 50 000 companies hinzubekommen. 
Its market share in retail is at 3.5 percent, while the geschäftskunden represent more than 10 percent. 
Another principle of geschäftsplans 2011-2013 is the increase in the productivity, or austerität, kostenreduktion. It faces the challenges that the bank, it will, together with jahresabschlussbericht imagine. 
Only a few banks dare to set goals and to publish it in these difficult times, as all the plans of the banks have been confused by the financial crisis worldwide. 
Sabadell will this year in their four years ago set leitplan optima conclude. This was initially designed to three years, but as a result of the market situation, he was extended for a financial year. 
The customers who will leave the building societies, are the main objective of the bank. 
In one of the apie organised breakfast stressed guardiola, 2011 would have a "difficult" year "with great scope." 
The manager is considered that Spain would only "slow" out of the crisis. 
Moreover, it would be "very difficult" to create "work in two or three years," essential for the survival of the banks. 
Even if it assumes that the war to liabilities, the zinsmargen punished - will wane, the risikozuschläge, the banks and building societies have to pay for their emissions to the conservation of liquidity, as a compensation for waning profit margins already shifted to the price of loans. 
"The liquidity and financing issues are a structural nature and they will put pressure on the loans." 
"We do not have the Hahn marginalised, but the zinsdifferenziale are very high," was guardiola. 
Banesto was already the order on Thursday in their filialnetz from restricting the allocation of long term loans and the zinsdifferenziale to increase - vgl. cinco días on 22 and 27 November -. 
Of the managers, also a, the banks currently pursued the stategie to increase "the charges," but "within a framework of competition obedience." 
Sabadells leitplan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business. 
Not for nothing, he assured that in Spain," bigger companies are necessary." 
"In the coming year will change everything," he assured. 
He stressed that the need for capital is currently "enormous" and does not exclude the possibility that some of the Spanish financial institutions in red figures abrutschen. 
He is of the opinion that the frob could replace the monetary market on kaptitalaufstockungen. 
After he assured that sabadell could survive a temporary closure of the markets, it weakens the argument of bankers, already predict a new liquidity crisis. 
He stressed that nothing can be put in circulation, but in contrast to the incidents in June, could be short on funding repogeschäfte REACH and to deal with the crisis.
