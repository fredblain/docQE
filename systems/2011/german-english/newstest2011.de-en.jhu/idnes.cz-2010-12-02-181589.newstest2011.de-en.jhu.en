The army has so many zündschnüre that the whole of the Czech Republic umwickeln could keep it but only two years 
The Czech army has 445 kilometres zündschnüre shopped, with sprengsätze catch. 
In the year before, the Defense Ministry has already been 224 km zündschnur to the armeelager supplied. 
It is already reassuring to know that the Armed Forces for 225 years ausgesorgt. 
The problem is only the span of zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years. 
The army bought the zündschnüre by the company stv group, a. s. for läppische 40 million kronor. 
In his justification for the procurement of this huge amount zündschnur said the General Staff issued mf dnes, the soldiers would annually to the 60 kilometres zündschnur use. 
The research of armeepyrotechnikern according to mf dnes raised point is clear from this indication that the whole army would have to be an extremely intense pyrotechnic training every year, of all the generals and officers of the armeekommandos, right up to the secretaries and putzfrauen. 
Defense Minister alexandr Vondra and army general vlastimil picek not excluded. 
Only in this way could be the significant annual consumption of 60 kilometres zündschnüren reasonably justified. 
This length calls for 25,000 detonationen. 
But this would armeebestände rich for more than 10 years. 
But if the old rule of experts is that the training of each new military professionals two metres zündschnur quite sufficient, then the Army through the neueinkäufe, also from the point of view of the increased needs of the pionier- and special units - created a reassuring stock for the 225 years already mentioned. 
Complained the soldiers of the schnelleinsatzbrigade recently at the Defense Minister Vondra, they had almost no patronen more for small arms, so schießübungen due to the lack of funds are severely restricted. 
The unterhosenmangel not to remain silent. 
"To me is also not a why such quantities of US zündschnüre buy." 
But that is their decision at the end of the day, they will have to know what they need to." 
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we want to come as traders to a large extent," says the vertriebsmanager the stv group Jan děcký. 
Jan pejšek, the Defense Department spokesman justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres zündschnur so that the Army would have so for at least ten years with this "ammunition" eingedeckt. 
Jan děcký speaks of the stv group but only by a four gebrauchsdauer the zündschnüre and police and armeepyrotechniker even just two years ago. 
"with perfect storage are probably the four years mentioned possible," one of them, but ungenannt wants to remain in order not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier. 
After the end of the gebrauchsdauer any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers. 
But these tests are not in vain, but cost more money. 
Another argument of the defense department is the mengenrabatt for the 445 kilometres zündschnur. 
"It cost us sixty percent less than the last year's supply of 244 kilometres," tells us spokesman pejšek the position of the einkäufer with the Defense Department. 
Only for comparison, the annual consumption of zündschnüren of the police, the ammunition in the Second World War pyrotechnikern or withdraw the Soviet bruderarmee, exceeds hardly 1,500 metres for quite a few years. 
Appointed and the police are only such quantities of these weapons, which it before the end of the gebrauchsdauer can use. 
The security of the pyrotechniker because of, there is also the possibility to flexible purchases more advanced and therefore reliable zündschnüre open. 
The Defense Ministry has already huge problems in the liquidation tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw treaty, when the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak People's Army prepared to their campaign on the Rhine. 
The pyrotechnikern according to mf dnes raised expected in a few years, the Czech armed forces have the same problem in the liquidierung hundreds of kilometres of age zündschnüre has bought today as "good."
