The Berlusconi government is in Italy in cover 
After a worrying for Italy wochenanfang yesterday, the situation with the decline in the eckzinsen a little down to 10 years. 
A return to a deceptive silence. 
At the end of the meeting with the economy minister had the regionsvorsitzenden Giulio Tremonti qualify as "unentzifferbar" to the situation and have it with a weekend of "unvorhersagbaren" expect to hear what the person concerned, however, immediately,. 
On Tuesday, the gap with the German interest rates would have achieved its record of 210 basispunkten, and the prices of the Treaties to meet the konkursrisikos had risen to 263 points, what a certain kopflosigkeit had caused in Rome. 
Silvio Berlusconi had in his Council of Ministers pointed out that the discrepancy of Spain to the German interest rates in 400 basispunkten lies. 
His right hand, gianni letta, but had as "seriously concerned" by the "market turbulence" and said a possible danger from the direction of Ireland. 
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro zone, is not as Greece or Ireland." 
"The bad news is that Italy is such as Portugal," said Irwin stelzer, volkswirt at the Hudson Institute. 
In plain language may be the problem is the absenz of economic growth and the attendant, schwindsüchtigen steuereingänge, put in danger, the state will no longer be able to cover its financing needs. 
The last of Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government. 
In future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and expected of 1.4% in the year 2012... although the has been submitted to the Senate for consideration haushaltsbudget counts with 1.3% and 2%. 
Under these conditions, it is calculated the EU Commission, will represent the budget deficit in the next year or 4.3% of GDP - contrary to the governments of the projected 3.9% - and - instead of 2.7% - 3.5% in the year 2012. 
Therefore the turmoil for a new haushaltskollektiv that after the feiertagen could be used to a sum of 7 billion euros. 
"If necessary, new tightening measures need to be taken," says Auditors Olli Rehn. 
On the hour, Italy is the support of international institutions. 
"The very foundations of Italy's economy is in order and its accounts are settled, we have repeated that for a long time," assured arrigo sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF is charged with Italy. 
"At the moment, there are no problems in the short term, nor in the long term, because of Italy Despite its high debt - 119,2% of GDP in 2011, A. D. R. - lower stabilisationsfortschritte as demanded by other countries," observed Pier Carlo padoan, chef-volkswirt the OECD. 
Remains the question of the political unstetigkeit. 
On 14 December Silvio Berlusconi will have to face a motion of censure the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of the preferred elections could already be organized at the end of March. 
So it is a little good period for a decision on a serious crisis before.
