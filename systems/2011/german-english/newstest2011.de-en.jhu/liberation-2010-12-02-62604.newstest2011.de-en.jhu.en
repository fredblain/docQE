Climate: as France, its finanzversprechen schönredet 
A year after the Copenhagen treaty, it is time the observance of the dissolved quickly finanzierungsversprechen - also "Almost start called" or premature Finance - to investigate, which were implemented by the developing countries. 
And already are the gross French schönredereien exposed. 
With the Treaty of Copenhagen, the developing countries have committed to allocate 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012. 
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France - i.e. 420 million a year - 1.26 billion euros. 
At the opening of the cop16, the EU has drawn all register their level of commitment to its partners of the fact with regard to the fast-start-finanzierungen to convince: detailgetreuer vorgehensbericht of its Member States, the press conference, great nebenevents, broschürenverteilung. 
The operation of transparency is remarkable and extent of its real value estimated: the developing countries and the civil society would like it if all developed countries of the same on the same präzisionsniveau made. 
The EU announced, in 2010 2.2 billion euros to have released what they on the right way to respektbezollung brings its commitment of 7.2 billion in the year 2012. 
If one looks into detail but things are a little more complicated. 
This money should be "new and additional" according to the Treaty of Copenhagen, to ensure that an additional use has been tabled, without to be to the detriment of public development aid. 
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means. 
While the EU Commission had proposed a harmonisation certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure. 
Today everyone chooses the benchmark he considered as the best. 
The EU Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those of the year 2009 for: the international funding will be maintained, and is within the framework of the funding "fast-start" 150 million over three years to do so. 
Other countries have similar benchmarks, either on year or about conditions at the level of the elected public development aid. 
In return to France was of the opinion that the funding "of all new projects" are "new and additional" of the year 2010. 
In other words, there is no benchmarks in the spending of the previous year, or at the global level of public development aid. 
Specifically, the total of the French support for the developing countries can remain stable - or decline - is - France, its commitment with regard to the "new and additional" comply with funding. 
Another key element is the breakdown in donations and loans. 
About there is no rule, and everyone elects its rechenmodus. 
Some, such as France, are 1 lend _ _ donated as the equivalent of 1. 
This is apparently difficult unacceptable: is not comparable to the effort. 
If the use of loans for certain profitable investment - often to the emissionseindämmung linked projects, based on technologies effektivster - can be justified, it is misleading to present the euro, which we captured as equivalent to a donated euro... there should only be the cost of loan for the kapitalgeberland to be counted as a commitment - that is to say the equivalent of an interest rate -. 
But France has nothing different in the sense as the following thought of it, '"respects its commitment of 420 million euros by 91,5% loans - 389,8 million euro - includes accorded and 8.5% - 36,1 million euro - - see the EU documents in order to convince themselves. 
France is the only country of the EU that loans up to a large extent. 
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or the Slovakia - among other things - their commitments to investigate 100% with donations. 
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union 1 _ spends to fulfil their commitments, France is just 10 cents and understands including a similar use. 
Fine hokuspokus! 
All in all, operates France in its fast-start-finanzierung with a double fraud: a part with a weiterentwicklkung the action on the time, and the other part with the reality of the financial contributions. 
France will be able to let it believe that 420 million "new and additional" has spent millions in accordance with its promises and saves in 36,1 million euros. 
The manipulation of the Treasury - as it seems to be that it bercy was to have carried out the arbitrage - could lead to a double negative effect; even eu-intern - Why are continuing with the other Member States of the donations made, but if there is enough to lend? - and then in the negotiations because the developing countries is not completely to deceive... 
The chapter of premature finance only a small question in a relatively short period in comparison to the whole of discussions on the climate. 
But it could be too much of the drop in the huge machine of the unfccc. 
We hope that this will not be the case. 
As it always was, it is vital to its lesson from this first year verfrühter funding to learn. 
First and foremost, France could announce a change in his verbuchungsart for the years 2011 and 2012, and in the spirit of respect for its commitments and the compensation justice with the other countries of the European Union. 
But above all, France could bring the discussions on the funding of the term streitgegenstand forward - another crucial and currently discussed subject -: you escapes the question of "verrechenbarkeit" or the verbuchungsart not of its loans. 
France could change its position, to be as advanced in terms of the disputes, as it is for other things. 
So the hope is based on the new Environment Minister kosciusko-morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun. 
A surprising announcement on the fast-start of France and his vision of "verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loans would raise the international vertrauensbasis from nature, which is necessary for further discussions.
