Love in Time of War 
Since Angelina Jolie has begun in the summer to work on their yet unnamed debut as a director, there is trouble. 
The screenplay she wrote a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man 
Little more is known about it - but even that's enough for concern. 
Stubbornly keeps the rumor that the woman, a Muslim woman fall in love, during the war in Yugoslavia in their Serbian rapist. 
Bosnian women's organizations have protested immediately, whereupon some were planned days of shooting in Sarajevo moved quickly to Hungary. 
Meanwhile, the film is filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protesting in Bosnia. 
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female victims of war wrote about the UN refugee agency UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper reported now - even Jolie is an ambassador of the UN refugee agency. 
Diplomatic she is not - it has a few weeks ago the women ever offered a meeting in Hungary, which were opposed, however. 
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic. 
Love stories in rape camps had not existed and Jolie's attitude towards the victims tell her enough about the script. 
Your organization has recommended to the UN Refugee Agency According to Jolie dismissed as an ambassador, reports the Guardian. 
What exactly is written scenes for Jolie? 
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, to read her script was added, after some argument, granted permission to film Sarajevo - it is not clear why Jolie was not then anyway. 
The young author herself asserts, involved no political intentions with this film have to be working with a lot of effort into the Yugoslav conflict, would show the terrible consequences of war and give all interested parties a voice. 
The contents of it, however, remains vague. 
So still a second Synopsis circulated to the film in the network, then it sounds quite different: The lovers knew each other is already before the war, and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim woman, is abducted in a Serbian camp in which he as a guard work. 
What after all significantly different sound than the variant "rape victim in a crush torturer." 
That Jolie's film actually starts even before the war - that's for sure. 
The pressure on her, and Jolie was "unfair and based on misinformation." 
Now you can probably only the hackers gain peace of Hollywood: By the script, like so many before, make illegal online.
