The child killer confesses that she had complained on the internet about the "hardships" of motherhood. 
The young woman spoke of the child, as this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror on Galician Art" 
Mónica Fernández Juanatey the Internet "Muki." 
In this nickname, which she runs from a young age, she has a cousin and a friend at least contact. Both are from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born. 
The messages are from the year 2008. 
To understand this, one must know her love life, which reconstructs the daily ABC on the basis of testimony of their families. 
The 30-year-old Galician Women adopted in 1998 a relationship with Iván Túñez, to an industrialist. 
She held one year. 
Shortly after they had dissolved their relationship became known that she was pregnant. 
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his former never let him do a DNA analysis. 
Shortly after, she went a different relationship. 
Alberto was the chosen one, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community. 
With him she lived a long time together. 
Cesar lived with them. 
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands, to look in the labor market, the little one stayed with her partner, who accompanied her even a week to Palma. 
But from the content of their messages can be concluded that their love affair broke, and they separated. 
In March 2008 she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and sour, because I came here to work." 
"When I told him, he found it good but now he realizes, of course, what it means to the boys all day long to be alone and not to be free, and can let them do what they want." 
Later, she mentions a message that she had just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month, or send me an address to which I can can send you the boy." 
She complains: "If he does not like the fact that I let the boy with my mother, I take it off when I get back." 
In May, she speaks of returning to their village: "This week I'm going to be there, but I'll just stay there until the 19th, because I imagine myself on 20 to a work do if I lose the will." 
She explains that she takes her first-born, if all goes well. 
"He will be with that at which he must be, that is, to me. Never in my life I'll let him back with someone except my mother," a doubtful intention, if one takes into account their difficult relationship. 
In July, there is another mail. 
As she writes this, it is assumed that the boy, who on 1 of the month on the island came and said on 10 was murdered, is dead. 
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, do not." 
"On the one hand, it is like for me and the place it a bit, but then he must go every day to school." 
It speaks of moving to Mallorca. 
"There he is (the boy) attend a summer course, I'm spending less on the nanny." 
On 17: memories and actions. 
"A big kiss from Cesar, who asks me when you come." 
"Alberto says he has sent me any videos on your e-mail. You see, if he wants, he finds me, a crap." 
On 30 even further: "The boy is doing well, he goes into a summer course to learn Catalan.." 
By Víctor, their current partners, there is one: "He shoots from money." 
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her. 
She even had a blog in MySpace, now locked, and in which they "Muki, the Gefängnisentlasserin" called. 
"Terror a la Gallega (title)." 
The last man who lived with her, a sworn gamekeepers claims to have pangs of conscience because he felt guilty. 
He can not believe that all happened because she had not told him that she was a single mother. 
Mónica was yesterday transferred from the Centre for prisoners to court in the provincial prison of Menorca Palma. 
The public defender, Carlos Maceda, said she could not remember the sequence of the facts, "and they did not have the intention of causing the least harm." 
Previously she had been, however, César drowned in the bathtub and stored his body in a suitcase have.
