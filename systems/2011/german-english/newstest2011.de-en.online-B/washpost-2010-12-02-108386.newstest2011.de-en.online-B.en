Politeness can connect the divide? 
After a campaign of insults and negativity this week little civility in Washington is broken. 
Is it the omen of a genuine bipartisan cooperation or a moment of illusion, before quickly returning to the struggle of parties in the capital? 
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and peaks of the Congress took a breakthrough in the major issues that might occur during the so-called "lame duck session," session at the end of a reign in which no decisions are taken more to employ, had. 
After all that, what you hear, it was not a polite debate between two different sides nor a respect for their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a party gathering points. 
The public meeting of the deficit of the President Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that exist between the members remain. 
It seems clear that close interaction can occur over a period of months, a mutual respect, of the ideological divide that still separates the members of one another, veiled. 
This is hardly enough to argue, there is a new era of cooperation had begun. 
Both sides are now in a testing phase - in which one of the other characters from the demands of cooperation and compromise, even while trying the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a new party warfare to weigh. 
Therefore, the meeting was limited on Tuesday itself and its evaluation by the participants for a minimum of demands or accusations. 
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to be expected that a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, could. 
Whether it comes to taxes, donations, health and rights is, the two sides are miles apart. 
Finally, the November election Washington, at least for a short time has become more tolerant. 
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration who now works for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center." 
"This is inevitable after elections. 
Elections arouse partisan passions, which eventually die again. 
And that's good. " 
On some issues, particularly those who are on the agenda of the "lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution." 
Bush's tax cuts that end of the year, and no one supports this 
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether temporarily or permanently. 
Likewise, a compromise with respect to the increased unemployment benefits to be expected if only because the Republicans can not afford that one believes that deny favored tax cuts for the rich, while unemployed workers for assistance. 
After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House has increased the optimism that one on these issues during the "lame duck session," while some may not ratify START and the new contract. 
But William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful collaboration lead in pressing issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to sustained cooperation of the parties must, when the new 112th Congress convenes in January. 
Instead, he says, a phase of non-compliance is likely, perhaps inevitable. 
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology turn into confrontation," he said. 
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - that cooperation leads to true courtesy. 
"I lot of what happens between now and 2012, see it as a front line, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said. 
The reasons have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and the Tea Party voters, whose education was appropriate. 
How worried the Republican leaders may also be about having to play poker too high, they know that they have to try out its promise to reduce government spending and put the health reform repealed to comply. 
This party lines in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Commission clearly deficit, which include a tax reform and raising some taxes and increasing the retirement age and lowering government spending. 
The Vice-Chairman Alan Simpson, and Erskine Bowles took over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, so much urged to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored. 
But they need within the Commission, 14 of 18 votes, to make its official recommendation, they plan to fight very come to even get near that number. 
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the Panel, as in financial matters, at least today, is little room for compromise or little sympathy. 
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and Republicans in Congress. 
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party clashes, if the Republicans to challenge Obama regards the national budget, taxes and the health system, later followed by a phase of major zweiparteilicher cooperation. 
What will cause this change? 
Public opinion. 
It is proved that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still wants more, that the two parties work together. 
When confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties need to carefully pay attention to public reaction. 
Whoever is destined to lose, will change course and seek compromises. 
That may indeed be an optimistic view. 
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be more ideological divide between Obama and the Congress as a Republican to be the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. 
At the same time, the activists of both parties in 2010 as a mere prelude to a consequence of much broader choice 2012th 
Seen like the courtesy that is worn on show this week to be welcomed by many Americans. 
But it will take on both sides a lot more effort to find a common denominator in the issues that separate the two remain apart.
