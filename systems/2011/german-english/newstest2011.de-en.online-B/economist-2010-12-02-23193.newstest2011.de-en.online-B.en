An election rout 
No one had expected that the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect. 
But the facts exceeded the concerns of election officials who rushed to help the beleaguered country, by far. 
Crowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast, ballot papers in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were just some of the problems. 
Polling stations opened with an hour-long delay. 
Many Haitians, many of which were caused by the earthquake in January, homeless wandering around, looking for a choice. 
Some finally gave all up. 
A dozen presidential candidates, including several suspected leaders demanded for an alleged fraud, the annulment of election results. 
Throughout the country there were some violent protests. 
Nevertheless, called Edmond Mulet, head of the UN Mission in Haiti, the choice "to be quite good in many respects." 
According to a careful statement of observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "to make these irregularities so serious they may be, the process is not necessarily invalid." 
In other words, the show goes on. 
The election authority said the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jew Célestin required is that preliminary results on 7 Proclaim December. 
The expected run-off election is scheduled for January. 
There is still hope in the election. 
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former First Lady Mirland Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity action. 
If Célestin Jew who finds among voters little or no support, declared the Wahlberhörde the winner of the runoff election, this could cause problems. 
Because of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million victims of the earthquake are still living in tents, a low turnout was expected. 
On Election Day, many Haitians have been hindered by lack of organization on the ballot. 
Just before the start of some 250,000 cards, which are needed for election, were not yet dealt. 
There is much at stake. 
The donor countries consider a legitimate government recognized as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti. 
The Haitians themselves agree.
