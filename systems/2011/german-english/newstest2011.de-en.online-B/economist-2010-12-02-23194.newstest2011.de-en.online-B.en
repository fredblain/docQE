Secretly in the middle 
In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband was told Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez, a wave of sympathy that drove their popularity rate by 20 points to over 50% up. This is the highest figure since being elected in 2007. 
Whether you this but the next year helping to re-election depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more accommodating than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner. 
The signs are not clear. 
Néstor Kirchner, who even after the election of his wife drew the economic policy, is often on budgets, tax revenues, economic growth and inflation has not fully taken into account. 
This allowed the president and his wife, the extra revenue to spend as they see fit. 
On paper, the Fernández government lost in the last year, the majority in Congress. 
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death on the 27th after a heart attack October led to further disagreements. 
Some dissidents from the ranks of the ruling Peronist rallied to Cristina Fernández. 
But after chaotic sessions (which struck another in the face of parliament and other government accused of corruption), it was the Congress not to adopt the budget for 2011. 
"I will not discuss it," said the President. 
The 2010 budget does for the next year, which the President has even more opportunity to spend money as they see fit. 
The economy is overheating: it will probably grow this year by up to 9%. 
The official inflation rate Coll at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of unions - the value to drive almost 30%. 
Kirchner, who took office 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises said growth and poverty reduction to their primary objectives, and not the inflation reduction. 
He refused to cooperate with the IMF harassed, the private sector and cleaned the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which then the official inflation statistics, brightened. 
Fernández can now follow a smoother path? 
They called on the private sector and trade union leaders for talks. 
And, according to official statements, wage increases are limited to 18% next year. 
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a big boost. 
But the surge in growth, inflation, undermined by a large devaluation in 2002. 
Maybe Cristina Fernandez wants financial terms for this reason, Argentina re-connect to the rest of the world. 
Earlier this year, the Government signed an agreement with holders of securities that had earlier rejected the rescheduling of the country in 2001. 
Fernández now seems to an agreement with donors from the Paris Club to push, which it owes about $ 6.7 billion. 
The Kirchner had a review by the IMF, as is usual elsewhere, always refused. 
But last month, announced the Minister Amado Boudou, the Fund will provide support to the creation of a new national consumer price index "technical support." It looks as if this is the first step to clean up the INDEC. 
It is unknown whether Fernandez will be politically active after the end of its term without the support of her husband is. 
If so, it needs to support the middle class, many of whom have had enough of Kirchnerism. 
If the Argentines to return in March from their summer holiday, is the wave of sympathy that she was met, be abated. 
If they want to win another election, it must decide whether to many political decisions of her husband quietly canceled.
