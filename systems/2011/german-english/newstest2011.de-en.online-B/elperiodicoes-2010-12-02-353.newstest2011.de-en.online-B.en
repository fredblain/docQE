Zapatero and the red line in Germany 
Berlin has decided to include retention of the euro, but at the same time set up conditions for the entire European Union. 
The tension in the markets have caused a duplicate response of the government. 
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, presented new adaptation measures, from tax breaks for small and micro enterprises, regulation of employment agencies and cancellation of 426 Euro support for the unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatization of 49 percent from AENA, the administration Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 percent of the state lottery. 
On the other hand, supports the Deputy Prime Minister, Elena Salgado, has with the help of former President Felipe González government criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as managers who herausbeschwört the current crisis. 
As these processes are understood? 
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is no fault of their public relations. 
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro. 
While Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective, a to shaping our future, the conflict with the maintenance of ancient traditions of much of its partners. 
In view of the resistance in Europe starting in Germany to speculate about three possible ways out of crisis. 
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would leave the euro area. 
The Second: The reintroduction of the German mark - although currently it sounds more like science fiction - supported by a majority of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population. 
The Third: A transformation of the euro according to the German proposals. That means more macroeconomic control, strict financial management; punish countries that violate the regulations; möglichereweise the payments of some countries and the expansion of the potential costs of adaptation to the private sector. 
The German position is clear and is emerging for some time. Therefore, there are now no excuses. 
First, 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission provides incentives for deficits and the German government, a constitutional reform took off the sleeve, to prevent this from 2016. 
This was the first sign of the growing gap between what Germany thought it necessary (strict control plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. 
The second sign was the central European country, as Merkel's decision to rescue Greece painful postponed. 
At that time, which was strongly criticized. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion was totally opposed to rescue Greece. 
Finally, Merkel is in the last days of October and again with a clear position of strength. She calls for a reform of the European Union agreements to allow the rescue of a country and at the same time to require private lenders to bear part of the cost. 
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as they advanced the Ireland crisis and all that follows. 
But her proposal, although some sweetened, was adopted. In the coming months we will participate in the reform of the European Union that will allow these measures as of 2013. 
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not pass. 
It says all that - even if unpopular measures must be taken now - there will be from that date the old no longer functioning of the euro. 
2013 the year of birth will be a new currency area in which the offending countries will face severe penalties, may be forced to declare themselves bankrupt and take in this case, the private sector a portion of these costs. 
Germany have shown us is that we are a hard growth, high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improve productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances. 
The other alternative, which is based on debt and building industry with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it was led by Spain in boom times, is simply not acceptable. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would do badly in not understanding it. 
It's not just about the national deficit by 2013 to drive down to three percent. 
The demands are much harder. 
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, we are deceiving themselves. 
I hope the current turmoil to go to more peace. 
And that we have the opportunities that we are commanded to use until the spring of 2013. 
It seems that Zapatero has taken this so well, and its double announcement (the reforms promised after the meeting with the Enterprise on Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel hypothesized order to create in-house, their way has prepared. 
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look that situation would change somewhat. 
Among the options under consideration is that we are serious with the little stuffed euro zone countries would have to leave to exclude. 
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it had warned us.
