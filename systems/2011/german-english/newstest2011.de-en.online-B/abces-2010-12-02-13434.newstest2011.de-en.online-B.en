PP calls from Mas postpone the tax agreement 
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho took the opportunity yesterday, Artur Mas personally present their conditions for support of his taking office as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These do not differ from the sum during the election campaign made and can be personalized with the primacy of the economic recovery and the omission of regionalist independence adventures, such as a revenue sharing agreement that will propose to the regionalist leader at the height of his mandate. 
The chairman of the Catalan people's party turned to the safety of Artur Mas, which gave it the 18 parliamentarians who had won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel indispensable. For the candidate of the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU rely on at least one of the opposition parties to abstain from voting when he came to the vote. 
Future alliances which would like the regionalists in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress, depend on a possible entente from the PP. The talks, the mass at the time with the other party leaders will turn, however, to Catalonia. 
As for the leader of the PPC, they shall request that in order to support the inauguration "all discourses that affect the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia," and an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the autonomous region - similar to the Basque country - and the party leader of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum, will stand back. 
Both political leaders do have in common is that they make the convoluted political apparatus of the regional administration more slender and abolish the inheritance and gift tax. 
With the details of the negotiations took office Mas deal on the part of PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat. 
Mas has already Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - announced the opposition a hard - and Joan Herrera (ICV) basis. Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidarity Catalana).
