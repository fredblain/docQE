The new unit will not unanimous 
Despite the announcement of the possible formation of a new unit available to the fight against corruption and collusion on the part of Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public commission of inquiry on the subject. 
Robert Dutil, minister of public security, claims that this idea did not originate from yesterday: Quebec had already last January, the New York Department of Investigation for advice on this topic. 
The city has since 1870, standing on a unit against corruption. 
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday more than one surprised. 
You have to say that this measure at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec police force on 29 was not October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils discussed at all. 
There was no "deal at a table tinkered end solution" also no doubt that Stéphane Bergeron critic, and member of the Parti Québécois, the announcement in terms of public safety as a "rabbit out of a hat" and qualified. 
Dutil Minister had in turn appealed to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the standing question, future unit. 
"You will see the result when we will announce it," he was content to affirm. 
"One is aware of this problem." 
According to Réjean Parent, president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public inquiry. 
"The more M. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more the people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said. 
"The only way to form a committee, the resignation of Jean Charest," said his part, said Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and political systems at the ENA (state university to form a senior civil servant). 
To break this impasse, he proposes that the Quebec to give control of the audit, a special mandate, so that they can do about corruption and collusion investigate. 
"You should be able to extend the mandate of the audit control," he decided. 
He also represents the view that the Quebec give the control test the same authority as commissioners could, which would also allow her to commit the people to give evidence. 
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government. 
The Quebec will also call on Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code so as to be more sensitive to this type of crime. 
This demand comes from the chief prosecutor of the operation Marteau, the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier has informed that the case law in this kind of law enforcement is not unique. 
Vic Toews, Minister of Public Security confirmed in turn by his colleague Justice, Rob Nicholson put, is currently with certain amendments concerning this matter apart. 
During the operation, Printemps 2001, which concerned the group of motorcycle police, 131 persons had been arrested, although the criminal law was not amended. 
Ottawa has prevailed as a result, the law against racketeering.
