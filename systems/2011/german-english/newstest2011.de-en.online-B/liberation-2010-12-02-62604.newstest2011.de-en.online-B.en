Climate: nice as France persuaded its financial promises 
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to ensure compliance with the rapidly dissolved funding promise (also called "Fast Start" or early financing ") to investigate, which were realized by developing countries. 
And even the French crude Beautiful shipping companies are revealed. 
The Copenhagen agreement, developing countries have pledged to mobilize 30 billions dollars between 2010 and 2012. 
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (ie 420 million per year). 
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has pulled all the stops to their partners on the fact of their commitment to satisfy the fast-start lending: How detailed report of its Member States to press, great side events, brochure distribution. 
The operation transparency is admirable and appreciated just for their intrinsic value: the developing countries and civil society would see it like if all the developed countries did the same on the same level of precision. 
The EU announced that they have released in 2010, 2.2 billion euros, which puts them on track to Respektbezollung their commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012. 
But if one looks into detail, things are a little more complicated. 
This money should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional application was submitted without redound to the detriment of official development assistance according to the Copenhagen agreement. 
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional." 
While the EU Commission proposed a harmonization of certain member states, including France, have blocked the process. 
Today everyone chooses the benchmark, which he deemed best. 
The EU Commission has chosen, for example as a guide for those of 2009: the international finance are maintained and are in the financing of "fast start" over three years to 150 million. 
Other countries have similar values, either with regard to year or with respect to selected conditions at the level of official development assistance. 
In return, France was considered that the financing "of all new projects" of 2010 were "new and additional." 
In other words, there are no guidelines for expenditure of the previous year, or global levels of official development assistance. 
In concrete terms, the total of the French support of developing countries remain stable (or decrease) - France pretends to respect its commitment to the "new and additional" funding. 
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. 
In yet there is no rule, and each elects its calculation mode. 
Some, such as France are, 1 borrowed € to be equivalent to € 1 donated. 
Obviously, this is only difficult to argue: the trouble is not comparable. 
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to the emission reduction projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is wrong to introduce the euro, the one recognized as the equivalent of a donated € ... Moreover, only the costs, should the loan for the investor country are counted as a commitment (ie the equivalent of an interest rate). 
But France has nothing different in meaning as the following consideration: it "respects" his commitment of 420 million euros, by 91.5% Loans (€ 389.8 million) receives and donates 8.5%) 36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document, in order to witness. 
France is the only EU country that uses loan to a large extent. 
Germany calls for 46%, while pursuing Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among others) their obligations to 100% of donations. 
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union 1 € to fulfill their obligations outputs are France just 10 cents and understands a similar use. 
Beautiful Hoax! 
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double swindle: to part with a Weiterentwicklkung of action over time and partly with the reality of financial commitment. 
France manages to make believe that it had issued 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with his promise, saving 36.1 million €. 
The manipulation of the Treasury (as it probably seems that it was Bercy, who carried out the arbitrage) could have a doubly negative effect by itself, once the EU internally (why go the other member states continue with the donation if it is enough to but ? borrow) and then in the negotiations, as developing countries can be fooled so completely ... 
The chapter of the premature funding only a small question in a relatively short time compared to the total in discussions on the climate. 
But it might be too much of the drop in the vast machinery of the UNFCCC. 
Let us hope that this will not be the case. 
Whatever the reason is, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early financing. 
First of France could announce a change in its Verbuchungsart for the years 2011 and 2012, and in a spirit of respect for its obligations and the corrective justice with the other countries of the European Union. 
Above all, France would bring the discussions on the subject-matter of the long-term financing to the front (another crucial and currently debated topic): you can not escape the question of "chargeability" or Verbuchungsart its loans. 
France could change its position to be well advanced with regard to the issues, as it is in other things. 
The hope rests on the new Environment Minister, Kosciusko-Morizet, which will arrive next week in Cancun. 
A surprise announcement about the Fast-Start of France and its vision of "chargeability" and the use of loans would increase by nature, the international trust that is necessary for further discussions.
