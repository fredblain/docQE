2018-2022 World Cup: FIFA appointed by the host country 
In a state of panic because of corruption allegations, the Executive Committee of FIFA on Thursday appointed the host countries of the world championships 2018 and 2022, a highly political election in which threaten to push the jockeying for influence and lobbying the technical criteria in the background. 
One thing is certain: the output of 2018, the pinnacle of FIFA will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold, (the 4 countries: England, Russia, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium). 
The edition 2022 will be somewhat exotic, the International Football Association hopes to win after the first night on the African continent in 2010, new territories (Qatar, Australia) for itself or its subsidiary in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea to follow) on. 
The list of personalities who have to delegate a part (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Prime Minister, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) the level of economic and political use of a World Cup before. 
The machinations behind the scenes so threatening to the last minute to stop. 
Otherwise difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates. 
After the evaluation report the FIFA, which offer English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) Act in improving ways of arguments than those of their competitors. 
But these considerations are not for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees the hour of election are so important. 
The Sunday Times, that the attainment of the suspension was two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations would have as good chances for their own country, the cradle of football to ruin, that only once the was allowed to deliver World Cup, namely 1966th 
The BBC had been the breeding ground again on Monday, was broadcast by a documentary, the three influential members of the committee, namely, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou takes under fire. 
Reason enough to anger, FIFA and the English to bring those responsible at a loss, which had primarily operated with David Cameron in the last few weeks an intensive lobbying. 
The Prime Minister hopes for a new edition of the successful by his predecessor Tony Blair Chess train, which had achieved in 2005 for the organization of the London 2012 Olympic Games. 
If this intensive use are sufficient to enhance the image of England before the committee again? 
Nothing is less certain, since the duo Spain-Portugal, there is no lack of length with his already completed stages of his expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 1992 in Barcelona, ​​Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture. 
But the economic and financial drawbacks of the two countries could dampen their ambitions. 
The possible reprisals against the English as well as concerns about solvency of Spain and Portugal have the chance of Russia, the increase in spite of its deficiencies in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transportation) has become an overweight outsider. 
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided, however, the candid suggestion denounced the accusations of the British press "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the Committee members. 
"They pelted with mud, trying to compromise it," Putin railed. 
For 2022 seem to be the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994 to be the logical favorites. 
First economic world power, seat of FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to be a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea exhibit, which have set up separately a very nice project. 
But these candidates seem premature for two countries that had helped organize the competitions in 2002. 
Another threat: the long-awaited approval from the FIFA World Cup 2026 for China, which will make the Asian opportunities to 2022 fell. 
With Australia and Qatar, which had pulled out all the stops in waiting futuristic stadiums, FIFA keeps its expansion into new areas, however, these two countries are at higher risk for certainty dar. 
Australia could suffer as well as Japan and South Korea under the akquittierten weakness of the European countries of the TV rights (due to the time difference), the sensitive nerve of the FIFA.
