More and more parents want people to monitors, to have the kids under control 
Fear for their own children grow, so consider more and more parents to monitor GPS. 
The system, which was originally invented to search for cars can, that people everywhere as well, which would be helpful in such cases, most recently at the traceless disappearance of nine-year Anička Janatková. 
The unit is currently about the size of a cigarette pack but soon it should be no larger than a wristwatch. 
Many people have added to the case of the disappeared Anička in fear and terror, and they keep on the lookout for ways to protect their children better. 
Also for the price of a risk to their privacy. 
"We try to tell everyone that it refers not to spying, but about an effective way to reduce the probability that the tragedy is," continues to Petr Pilin from society Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market. 
"I admit that there may in some cases to abuse of such devices, such as when someone puts it in his pocket, he knows that without it, but we have had no such case reported." 
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," added pilin. 
In his opinion the child should always know what purpose is the "box" and how to use them in an emergency. 
The child psychologist Dana Bocková but points out that a child if there is such a thing might not wear it just gets rid of his. 
"Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to certain things on purpose to lose if they do not want to be controlled." 
"Even the mobile phones initially aroused great expectations among the parents, but they can be off as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Ms Bocková. 
In your opinion, is also debatable whether such a device in the event of an attack really helps. 
"With the planned kidnapping of the kidnappers almost always controlled, whether the child has any electronics with you, with which it could be located." 
"Today it is the mobile phone." 
"When such monitors could find wider use, they would look for this as well, because their sales would be accompanied by massive safe advertising." 
"In these cases, the criminals of the police one step ahead," says the psychologist. 
It does, however, that similar units in a sudden attack by a pedophile can be quite helpful. 
Roberta Čech of the company RC Monitoring According to the tracking services for both cars, as well as providing for people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack. 
"The device can be adjusted as providing it reports the current position at certain intervals. 
"Although it would be destroyed immediately, or at least is the last position of the affected person." 
"With more expensive units even an inclinometer is integrated, that is, if one falls down and lie motionless remains, the device immediately sends a warning stating the position," said Mr Čech. 
In his opinion, could perform similar services and intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you only need a special software einzuspielen. 
The problem of the current detection devices is that it is either this device in a matchbox-size goes, the trailers are similar to or smaller mobile phones. 
Always there is the risk that you lose. 
Lord of the Pilin Macro Because, according to tests, therefore, in the presence of devices that look like normal digital watches. 
"This has the advantage that the attacker did not identify any needs that there is a monitoring or tracking device. 
"Or he noted only after a certain time, which gives the police a head start," he adds. 
No matter in which direction the development - towards bracelets or pendants, always with the same technology is used as the vehicle location. 
So the combination of location feature using the GPS system (as well as for navigation in the car) and the function of a mobile phone, which reports the current position.
