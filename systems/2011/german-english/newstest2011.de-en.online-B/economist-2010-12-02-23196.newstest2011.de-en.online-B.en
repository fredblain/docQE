Weak applause for China 
Taiwan's voters slowly approach a closer connection to the mainland. 
What Taiwan's view of his big brother across the strait? 
On 27 November made more than 7.5 million voters, or 70% of eligible voters, on to be elected to the five boroughs, mayors and town councils. This will provide a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou scored. 
By building ground-breaking business, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma is itself a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with mainland China for the first time since 1949 lasting. 
Ma has passed the test, but only just. 
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT), three of the five mayors is that they did not receive a majority vote. 
Instead, given the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence for Taiwan, nearly 50% of the vote, the KMT received 45%. 
In a presidential election would have meant for Ma problems. 
Since his election two years ago, the share of votes his party has fallen by about 8%. 
For the first time the DPP drew an even together with the KMT in the city councils. 
During the election there were the usual incidents in Taiwan such as truck convoys with rioters, Flag-waving mass parades and scantily clad dancers. 
There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt. 
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT held on the eve of the election a speech to a KMT candidate, 
him as a man in the crowd shot in the face. Lien was wounded and killed a bystander spectators. 
Bizarrely, was not clear whether the shooter killed Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate. 
Regardless of the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, affected the leader of the DPP, the election and brought the DPP in a bad light, which has brought the KMT more votes. 
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign. 
Remarkably, relations with the mainland was not discussed. 
Instead, the candidates debated plans to housing and job creation. 
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence from China's military threat and refuse. 
For this reason, the KMT government in its relations with Beijing, not like in the foreground. 
But this time avoided the DPP, the anti-Chinese feelings to stir up a lot. 
She was responding to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy without China can not survive. 
Ma would in turn confirm that the majority of Taiwanese favor of his China policy. 
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of Taiwan zurückzulocken with economic incentives in the community. 
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation. 
Certainly, it also wants political integration. But first things first. 
It prefers to wait until after the 2012 presidential election. 
The DPP has now re-invented. 
Two years ago it was severely weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian for corruption was in prison. 
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008 he was strongly committed to absolute independence. 
But under Tai's reign, developed a new generation of moderate politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of working people and youth. 
Tsai was a presidential candidate of the DPP very well received, as Su Tseng-chang to Chen. 
Their party is doing everything now to show that they too will be able to develop strong relations with Beijing. 
Tsai is planning a think tank as a contact point between the DPP and China. This, however, requires open-minded discussions. 
Tsai said publicly that their party is a "trusted alternative" to offer Mas hasty rapprochement with China. 
Chen seems to have this change very angry. 
From his cell, he said, the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence. 
He urged the pragmatist Su even to abandon the presidential candidacy. 
Even without the interference of Chen's DPP has difficulties to choose their candidates. 
The KMT is undergoing its own self-analysis must. 
Mas values ​​are bad, despite rapid economic growth, the KMT candidate wanted to campaign without him. 
The main reasons for its unpopularity and unemployment seem more and more gaps between rich and poor to be. 
According to a KMT spokesman, he will transform his Cabinet and the local bodies. 
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is in favor of rapprochement limited. 
At the same time, most Taiwanese economic cooperation with China seen as inevitable. 
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no way back."
