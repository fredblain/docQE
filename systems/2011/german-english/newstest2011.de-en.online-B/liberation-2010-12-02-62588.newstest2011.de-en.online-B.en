Vindictive hackers and diligent spies 
The affair WikiLeaks has a dual meaning. 
On one hand, it has turned out to be obvious scandal, a scandal that is only a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press. 
On the other hand, it announces far-reaching changes at the international level, and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression. 
But we proceed in order to. 
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each created by a secret file (an x-any nation) is composed entirely of newspaper clippings. 
The "extraordinary" revelations about the sexual habits of American Berlusconi's throw from nothing more than what we got for months anyway-any x in each journal to read (other than those owned by Berlusconi), and the frightening karikaturierte Profile Gaddafi offered cabaret artists for a long time material for their skits. 
The rule that must pass the secret dossiers of known news is essential for the dynamics of the secret, and not only in this century. 
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each plant (of the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosenkreuzler) exactly repeats what is already written in previous works was. 
This is not just the fact that the author of occult texts will not publish research (nor, therefore, that he did not know where to find news would be of the non-existent), but because those who are devoted to the occult, of anything else, as believe what they already know or confirm what they have already learned. 
This mechanism is also the success of Dan Brown. 
Similarly, the secret files. 
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is the head of the secret (otherwise, what could also be, for example, an editor at Lib√©ration), which is only considered as true, as he acknowledges. 
The top-secret information about Berlusconi, who had the American Embassy in Rome sent the State Department were the same as those that Newsweek had already published the week before. 
So why such a fuss about the revelations of this dossier was made? 
On one side, say it, knows what every educated person already, namely that the messages - may take at least since the Second World War and since then the Government can call each other or a plane to meet up for dinner - their diplomatic function have lost and have, with the exception of some small representation tasks, into espionage centers. 
Any viewers of investigative films knows this very well and it does not happen from hypocrisy that we're supposed to ignore this. 
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it in public, violates the object of the hypocrisy and serves to inform the American diplomacy in a bad light. 
Second: The idea that an x-secret secrets of any hacker can tap into the most powerful country in the world, the significant blow against the prestige of the State bears department. 
Moreover, the scandal does not so much the victims, but rather the "executioner" in distress. 
But we are dedicated to the profound nature of what happened. 
Formerly, to Orwell's time, you could combine all the power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects. 
Orwell's prophecy had since been able to turn out to be completely right, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, they make a transaction, the hotel visited, the elected highway and so on, the citizens would be the total victims of the eye of power. 
But if you have in mind would lead what is happening today is that even the secret crypts of power can not escape the control of a hacker, so, the control gear to be addressed on one side and circular ground. 
The power control every citizen, but any citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the avenger of the citizen - can bring the secrets of power in experience. 
How can but hold a power that is no longer able to protect their own secrets? 
It is true, (and be an empty secret can never be revealed) Georg Simmel said, that a real mystery is an empty secret, it is also true that any knowledge is about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel's basically a secret free of Geheimis, because it reveals the public sphere, but in the style of WikiLeaks disclose that were the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty secrets, means to deprive them of any power. 
WikiLeaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, however, but Clinton and Obama. 
What will be the consequences of this insult, which such an enormous power was added? 
It is obvious that the states in the future no longer be reserved, please ask yourself - this one would come up to the street corner glued posting. 
But it is also clear that with the current technology is vain to hope to be able to keep secret confidential reports by telephone. 
Nothing is easier than finding out whether and when a president travels in an airplane and has contacted one of his colleagues. 
What could be maintained in future private and only for certain ears certain relationships? 
I know very well that my prediction at the moment for science fiction and novel-like sounds, but I find myself compelled to imagine the government agent, is a secret way busily moving to uncontrollable roadmaps, their messages anywhere other than in the mere memory carrying with it, and moreover, the few written information they have received, in the heel hiding. 
The information would be stored in single copy in locked drawers in fact had the espionage trial of Watergate reported less success than WikiLeaks. 
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is advancing these days like a cancer, that is backwards. 
A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionized communications, reconstructs the Internet with a telegraph (telephone) wire. 
was the (analog) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers, a film scout band for band by back to front coil and all the secrets of mounting air, while allowing the (numerical) CDs now nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter , ie, in macro portions. 
With the high speed trains you drive within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this requires three and a half by plane, including the interchanges hours. 
It is therefore not unusual that return policy and communication technology on car and horse. 
A final observation. 
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what was forged in secret between the messages. 
Currently, there are the messages that request confidential information from the press.
