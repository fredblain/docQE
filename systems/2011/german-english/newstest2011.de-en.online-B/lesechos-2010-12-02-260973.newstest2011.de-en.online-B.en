Euro: the ECB is forced to keep their purchases of government securities 
The last meeting of the Central Council of the ECB in the past year should be an opportunity to show possibilities how to get out of the crisis, or at least the arrangement of a large number of non-conventional measures of monetary policy announcements, to the end of the year coming to a close. 
The crisis of European government debt obligation, the Central Bank in Frankfurt, it can not afford without a doubt, even today, more to forfeit a tense situation on the European bond markets in order not to cause their deterioration. 
The political cost of this would be far too high. 
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde had yesterday at a press conference by the ECB welcomes the occupied and active role in favor of solving the state budget debt in Europe. 
She has not dared to say whether it was thought that the central bank can do more, for example by boosting its program of purchases of government bonds. 
"I reserve my reasoning for my European partners (...) ." 
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB had the previous day in Brussels to mark not his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament very eloquently about shown its projects, but rather is content to point out that the program of purchases of government securities on the secondary market, "continue to operate" and that we would "be seen as failure, the decisions" at the meeting on Thursday. 
The only certainty: The ECB will leave its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest levels since May 2009. 
In practice, the bond purchases by the Treasury by the ECB last week at about 1.35 billion euros have been doubled. 
And according to indiscretions of some dealers yesterday it is to new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government bonds have made. 
Overall, the Eurosystem central banks since May 2010 purchases of 67 billion euros have made. 
Among the brands the anticipation of a follow-up of purchase price is not in doubt (see page 29). 
Economists expect no remarkable change of course has more. 
If the bond transactions will be gone more than three months, from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter will create yet make the full resources of bountiful nature reserves, and over a period of one week to three months. 
Economists are already becoming prepared to find that this measure will still expand by a few months. 
"I can not imagine that the ECB will amend its program to essential nature." 
"Otherwise, they would run the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert suspects, an economist at Commerzbank. 
"A appears in the course of first quarter of 2011 provided, progressive phasing me more probable," anticipates its part Norbert Braem, an economist at Sal 
Oppenheim. 
In the area of ​​its intervention on the performance of government debt, "the ECB should keep up such a volume of purchases of bonds, which revived the sluggish market," adds Norbert Braem. 
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the market for government debt in the euro zone, the central bank has no other choice than to maintain its presence in the market. 
"You must enter at any price, in the place of the lack of investors in the market and so act to prevent the premature enthusiasm about the returns paid to the weakest states," testified yesterday a major bond holders. 
Because when interest rates start to soar, the states would have prevented more to reduce their debt or to stabilize only. 
This is the price to protect the euro.
