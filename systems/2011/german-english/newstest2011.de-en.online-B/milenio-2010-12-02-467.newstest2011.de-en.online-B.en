China maintains its targets for reducing greenhouse gas 
The representative of China said at the COP16, his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce carbon tracks done and it would maintain its offer to 2020 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases to reduce. 
China keeps its range, the emission of greenhouse gases by 2020 by 40 to 45 percent decrease, insured Su Wei, a representative of this country at the COP16. 
In his first public appearance at the 16th World Climate Conference of the United Nations (COP16) Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon tracks and conversion of its industry. 
He said that had invested in the last four years his country 245 million U.S. dollars to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. 
By contrast, he said China would not change his goals, but cooperate with the international community on this matter would be. 
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change in four aspects as: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programs. 
In all aspects we have made progress, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, the legs keep the goals in terms of reducing the emission of gases, he said. 
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China the authorities have been working with the states where the central government and communities to achieve the targets for energy saving, the efficient use of energy and reduction of emissions. 
He also stated that already have a few more years of plans to tackle taken or been completed, both those who were funded by the Chinese government, as well as those that received funds from other countries. 
For example, he referred to the program for the effective use of energy, which was introduced in the last five years and had received investments of the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands. 
It also runs a project at the provincial level on climate change, another to replace the traditional light bulbs with energy saving light bulbs and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said. 
Martin Krol, scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts would be far greater than generally assumed. 
He showed that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China amounts to six tons per person, while there were 100 tons in the United States. China is responsible for a nine percent overall contribution to environmental pollution. 
Likewise, it makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. The energy efficiency was in the last five years increased by twenty percent by 2020, a further happened, he said.
