Enigmatic earthworks 
The Atomic Energy Agency has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria. 
The country defends itself, however, to comment on it - yet it allows for checks. 
Around midnight on 5 to 6th September 2007 attack at least four Israeli F-15 fighter planes I a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria. 
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates, the nearest large town, 30 miles away, Dair is as-Saur. 
Your name appeared in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) if it goes around the reactor, which Syria has allegedly built with help from North Korea in the cube hidden in a valley that branches off from the stream. 
According to a briefing by the U.S. foreign intelligence agency CIA of 2008 would be the end of April under the name of the nearby village of al-Kibar reactor was common well-suited to produce plutonium - from the could build nuclear weapons. 
For other purposes, however, the technique is good in the fifties hardly. 
The CIA conducted a video presentation with blurry satellite images. 
Using computer animation to a hidden, where the components are said to have the reactor before the destruction, a reduced copy of the North Korean model is from the Yongbyon nuclear center. 
They also presented photos showing the building up close, or even the interior. 
The reactor had been scheduled to begin operations, it said, was not yet equipped with fuel rods. 
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more known than before, so the puzzles were rather larger with time. 
Former U.S. President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack but was pretty sure that Syria build a reactor in al-Kibar, but saw little evidence that in the country " an active nuclear weapons program was ." 
Some intelligence officials in Europe are even more cautious and would rather only speak of an "alleged reactor," even if they hold the CIA presentation to "plausible." 
They lack hard evidence, like the IAEA. 
Asked how sure he is, a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat said succinctly in the summer only, the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions." 
The rubble of the alleged "unused military building" managed to hurry while the Syrians bulldozed the site thoroughly and set aside. 
Nevertheless took place in June 2008 IAEA team under former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium that had been made by people. 
In addition, the IAEA received via a Member State of commercial satellite imagery providers in the period immediately after the attack, which might be more useful than the CIA presented. 
However, these recordings on the market are not getting because of the unknown customer - maybe Israel - it has bought exclusive. 
The IAEA can not verify their authenticity, therefore, independent. 
Syria has always maintained, never run a secret nuclear program or built a reactor to have. 
The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus. 
But the IAEA pointed to the analysis of the particles back as unlikely. 
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss it - as well as on satellite images. 
In addition, it denied the inspectors, a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the wreckage of the bombed building. 
But Israel is silent iron. 
"We will comment on that before," reiterated most recently, at the time of the attack, acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position. 
Then drags the investigation of the case back inconclusive since June 2008 and "is increasingly becoming a serious credibility problem for the Authority, as a high Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA admits in Vienna - after a serious breach of the NPT is in the air, watches over the the IAEA. 
As the key to progress in the investigation, the IAEA apparently sees three other institutions to be "operably linked" to the alleged reactor - and differently as this still exist. 
The inspectors have been disclosed or to which assets it is, or what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious. 
According to the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, will intern at the IAEA referred to as Marj al-Sultan, and Masyaf Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby towns. 
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and satellite images at a building complex made Masyaf locate where it is most likely one of the suspicious object is. 
It may be in or close to a military base - exactly denied on that basis Syria IAEA access to the three locations. 
In Vienna it is said, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be pushed forward by the United States to spy on military installations. 
For the nuclear detectives were due to tip the U.S. intelligence became aware of the facilities. 
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that was between the three towns on the Euphrates and the square footage to and fro. 
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be "in connection with the fuel production" are. 
But there was "no evidence of sensitive activities," ie uranium enrichment and reprocessing processes that are necessary to build nuclear weapons. 
The reactor type is indeed powered by uranium, which is not enriched. 
But where the uranium would have to come from and where it later, the plutonium would be separated for the bomb to these key questions is at best a plausible conjecture. 
It is also unclear whether debris that might hold valuable traces were stored at the three locations. 
As hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the earth, no one wants to have information about where the rubble is left. 
Just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates River Mine located al-Tibni of Syria in 1998 under investigation for use as storage for radioactive waste is, the IAEA is unlikely. 
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently brought in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review in conjunction with reactor. 
Images from orbit show that Syria at the three sites suspected undertook earthworks and large container removed once the IAEA had requested access. 
This may be coincidence, but has done little to dispel the suspicion. 
Moreover, it is said in diplomatic circles, the IAEA had used several months on developing a plan for inspections there, it would allow Syria to maintain any military secrets - but the effort shows how great is the interest of inspectors. 
Meanwhile, Damascus and ironed from this proposal. 
Western diplomats in Vienna were not appeased a year ago, the reactor was so destroyed, so did the cause no great urgency, as U.S. ambassador Glyn Davies takes a few months old so-called special inspections into the game, one of the sharpest agent that the Wiener atom has authority to enforce controls. 
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would propose such inspections, has indeed already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future," but still he hesitates. 
There is a high risk in this way: First, it needs for a majority of the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented in it are anything but eager for an escalation. 
to consider the other as a diplomat is: "What if they find nothing in the end?"
