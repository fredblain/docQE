Sport and control circumvention 
Tricks such as those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax shows ingenuity, but not the will to avoid a penalty. 
The supposedly by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso, Sergio Ramos) instigated exclusion in the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League meant that much ink has been spilled over whether it is an unsportsmanlike act or not act, and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA. 
As is well known, lost two players a few minutes before the end of the game (her team had already won clearly) the time and played several fouls, so the referee showed them the second yellow card. 
would in this way, and give the Real Madrid since his group, the two players to the penalty prescribed for the next league game against Auxerre meet and so on without a card game to the next phase. 
Finally, the Disziplinarkommitee UEFA punished the club coach, Jose Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money. 
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football. 
She is so widespread that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport rules followed - is. 
Part of the arisen debate about the case shown stems from the fact that a team of football club Real Madrid (who claims in his hymn nobility and honor, and punished on other occasions his players of similar incidents had) it played the leading role, and the dramatization Mourinho, who has added one more episode to its long history as a theatrical technician and provocative. 
In any case, turns the debate about whether this is not expressly prohibited by the statutes of conduct contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts constitute a circumvention rule. Actually endorses this on the statutes of the sport, but seem to get around its meaning. 
In the matter of the spirit of sport should be investigated damage caused. 
The spirit to defend the physical integrity of the adversary, an aspect that has not been jeopardized by these actions because it was not an aggressive game. 
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that pull the offending player an unfair advantage of the opposite team. That did not happen. 
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally understand about foul play or rule evasion, for the circumvention of the rule was implemented not in secret to avoid a penalty, but they should be as flashy as possible so that they will be punished by the referee. 
The players waited and took the sentence to joy. 
Another question is what kind of advantage the offender from the deliberate fouls subject. 
Here should be emphasized that the rival was neither placed in a less favorable situation has advantages for the game played were demanded, for the obvious result of this move was that your team had to continue playing with less players. 
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game because the club does not then these players. 
The advantage is obviously that the players begin the next phase of the Champions League without playing cards, which could threaten their participation in a future game. 
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree of uncertainty advantage because the team could leave at some point. In addition, the players with this approach, a penalty and go into the second cycle of cards in which they retire because of accumulation of cards with a card lower than the first cycle. 
Thus, it is not so clear whether there really is an advantage. 
Ultimately, such approaches are not directed against the spirit of sport, to which strategic decisions in order to benefit from the provisions of the possible results. 
In this case, the players wanted to avoid any penalty (which would actually be a clear case of circumvention rule), they would rather choose when to undergo this. 
They made a strategic decision to avoid a penalty or not to flee from her. 
Although the line between ingenuity and control environment is blurred, I think that it is this issue a clear case of inventiveness. 
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: Because there are two self-exclusion was due to the nature of the unprovoked and control transmission. 
The damage that the principles of sport has caused these acts, is less ethical than aesthetic rather Articles
