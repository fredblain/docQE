Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain 
Two light combat aircraft L-159 of a total of five who has the Czech Ministry of Defence against the transport aircraft Casa C-295M exchanged are on Tuesday flew in the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS located. 
It is the first time that these aircraft are in possession of a foreign army. 
Abroad, it had been seen only in maneuvers or air shows. 
At issue here is the ability to fly two-seater version of L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army. 
The other three are single-seat L-159. 
These are currently in einkonserviert Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the company Omnipol - it has taken over the past week. 
When they despatched from the aircraft physically Vodochody, is Jan Pejšek, the Defense Ministry spokesman, according to yet unknown. 
The single-seat combat aircraft L-159 were again separated from long-stored aircraft and this without additional funding and investment from the Department of the Ministry. 
"Were the two-seat L-159T1 replaced in the current state and look," said Pejšek the newspaper Pravo. 
He added that the army would not have to make do without two-seat fighter aircraft, since the Ministry of Defence signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody a 200-million contract for the renovation of four redundant L-159 to the two-seat version. 
A new aircraft acquired by the army in July, the second they will take until the end of this year. 
Pejšek According to EADS has pledged to enforce the fighters in the equipment of the NATO countries. 
"The contract clearly stated that the company buyers of the EADS aircraft L-159, and that those services are intended to train pilots of the NATO countries. 
"It is a matter for the purchaser, the manner in which he realized the cause," led Pejšek. 
The business paper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159. 
The barter of five L-159 to a transport aircraft and the Casa purchasing additional aircraft for 3.5 billion kronor last year had been approved yet by the government of Mirek Topolanek. 
The Defense Department had announced at that time to purchase any invitation to tender, but said EADS directly. 
The former defense official argued that this exchange will help the future export of L-159 abroad. 
The Czech army bought from Aero 72 aircraft, of which she uses only 24, she wanted to sell the rest. 
The purchase of the Casa aircraft would incidentally also have legal repercussions. 
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence namely the European Court of Justice. The reason? It would have to select the aircraft due to a very European call and no means by talking to a single manufacturer. 
The army has already taken three aircraft Casa, the last to land within fourteen days at the airport Kbely.
