Arsenic-resistant microbe could enable new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere 
The discovery of another species of bacteria that include can live on arsenic, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere. 
Although scientists of this unusual bacterium discovered here on Earth, it considers that it is a sign that a life without the hitherto possible as vital elements is considered. 
"This organism has two options." 
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." 
"That makes it something special, even though it is almost a kind of 'alien' life form is," said Paul CW Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science. 
So far, six major elements considered essential to life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur. 
But as the scientists found the bacterium in California's Mono Lake is growing even further when it replaces phosphorus by arsenic. 
"One wonders just what else is possible," the co-author of the report, Ariel D. Anbar, said of Arizona State University. 
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists have to realize life and its forms, Anbar. 
The study deals with microbes that are found on Earth. 
The announcement of a press conference in which no details have been announced to the discovery gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet, that the report could be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life. 
This is not the case. 
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems, organisms with the help of other elements may share biochemical processes in motion and that the 'standard items', which we believe are absolutely essential for life, stipulated not as closely," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the UK. 
Cockels was not part of the research team. 
"This work is a novelty, because it shows that it can be replaced in basic biochemical processes and structures, one element by another," added Cockell. 
This discovery was not accidental. 
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of Astro Biological Institute of NASA, who led the study, chose the Mono Lake because of high arsenic content. 
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically, it was thought that microbes, which both are exposed to potentially replace one element by another. 
"The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to the fact that it is chemically similar to acts such as phosphorus." 
"This makes it difficult for organisms difficult to distinguish one element from another." 
"But the difference is so great that arsenic acts other than phosphorus. It gets in our biochemical system, where almost everything is smeared," says Anbar. 
The researchers used the bacterium from GFAJ-1 increasing arsenic concentration. It is adapting and growing. 
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, but that it can survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on earth or on another planet or moon, the arsenic is more common. 
According to Jamie S. Foster, professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new. But so far there was no working example. 
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, so the science it is assumed that early life forms have used it. 
"This is reason to believe that life may have also developed other than in the early era," says Forster, is not a member of Wolfe-Simon was a research team. 
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
