American soldiers have a new "smart gun." 
The American troops in Afghanistan for the first time used a new "smart" weapon, which so far is only known under its code name XM-25. 
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon affects the conflict there with the Taliban and shifts the balance of power in their favor. 
The new weapon is such a thing as a super accurate gun. 
Their projectiles are in fact guided by lasers with an accuracy of only a few meters to the finish. 
The special projectiles of caliber 25 mm, which were developed for this rifle and contain high explosive work, almost like little grenades. 
The missiles can be programmed so that they can not just explode on impact with the target, but at any point of its ballistic trajectory. 
That means you can use it against an enemy that is behind a barrier - a wall or hide in the trenches. 
From above, it is in fact usually not protected, the murderous steel fragments from above him, then rain can easily put out of action. 
According to Richard Audette, who was involved in the development of XM-25 is the new battle rifle, the first infantry weapon that makes the "smart" technology advantage. 
"The soldier is in fact so taken before: he aims at the target and emits a laser beam, which determines the distance, it gains an accurate sighting point, after which he corrected the increase in angle, then he need only pull the trigger yet. 
"Let's say you measured 543 m." 
"If one pulls the trigger to charge the weapon and fired a bullet to the distance from 543 meters plus or minus one, two or three meters.
