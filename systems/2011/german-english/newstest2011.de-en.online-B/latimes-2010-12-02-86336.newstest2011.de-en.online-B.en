The lion roars again following a court approval of the MGM-restructuring 
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty MGM finally got the green light for a fresh start. 
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed the "prime" from Gläuberplan to pay off the debt of $ 5 billion and the 86-year-old entertainment company to pave the way for new films and television shows. 
According to the testimony of Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy laws, so that the restart of MGM, led by Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founder of Spyglass Entertainment, nothing more stands in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will preside over the somewhat stripped-down studio as General Manager. 
The workforce will be reduced to more than 400 around 320th 
For MGM enters Chapter 11 as recently as in force when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned bond issue of $ 500 million to finance the new MGM productions. 
Right now heads a consortium of investment bank, which itself brings $ 75 million, the company. The financing should be done until mid-December. 
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 to help with the order to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the company's management, with the interest payments of $ 300 million fighting a year, to solve their financial problems. 
In August, the CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert who was his job at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts announced. 
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to resolve the financial concerns MGM and pay out more than 140 Gläuber the studio lasted longer than expected. 
After months of discussions, both parties agreed in late 2009 to offer the company up for sale. 
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the requested $ 2 billion by the creditors. 
In the spring of this year, everything started from scratch, as the MGM team began with the restructuring plan that was after months of internal debates and disputes in late October finally signed by the creditors. 
If MGM has in the weeks to come through the bankruptcy official, Moelis and Cooper for their work in a bonus of several million dollars. 
The proportion of Moelis & Co., which have already received $ 1.2 million, amounts to $ 9.5 million 
Cooper, which was paid for the management of the company $ 375,000 per month will receive a "success bonus" of $ 4 million 
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM again. This year brought out the studio only a movie and created an annual plan with seven or eight films, the initial release in 2012. 
They also are planning two movies after "The Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros. 
The studio needed to a separate loan of $ 265 million to $ 275 million for its financial share of these two films to be established, directed by Peter Jackson. 
The investor Carl Icahn, who has financed about 18% of MGM's loan sought a merger with the studio Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder is he. 
But the last negotiations between the two companies led to no result.
