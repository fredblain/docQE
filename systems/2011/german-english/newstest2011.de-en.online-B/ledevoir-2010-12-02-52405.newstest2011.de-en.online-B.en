Global plan for the renewal of the lighting 
The UN yesterday proposed a plan in Cancun for the renewal of the lighting of households, commerce and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction of the greenhouse gas (CFC), which nearly a third of the additional reduction is equivalent to be recovered in order to stabilize the Earth's climate by 2020. 
This ambitious plan takes up its position in the steps of the concrete projects, which hopes to implement the UN in Cancun, to compensate for the absence of mandatory emissions reduction commitments by developed countries. 
After yesterday put forward a plan would the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the avoided because of the lighting on the earth emitted CFCs, when the incandescent bulbs, which represent so far a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market by fluorescent or better yet, would be replaced by light emitting diodes (LED). 
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. 
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of smoke from the global fleet. 
In Copenhagen, had last year, the major gas emitters like the United States, China, Europe and others, also including Canada is obliged to voluntary reduction plans that would scale down the global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt. 
From that review we would have to deduct another 5 Gt to stabilize between now and 2020 climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius to prevent this out of control. 
In the incandescent bulbs escapes 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light. 
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs to reduce this energy requirement by a further two times. 
The compact fluorescent bulbs hold on average between 6000 to 10.000 hours. 
The new LED bulbs, such as those required by the manufacturer Philips has launched this week on the market - this company has incidentally participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy consume 25,000 hours and 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an indication of the potential savings of Auswechselungsplanes that is to be used in 100 countries. 
Besides the fact that hese completely new light bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a rheostat. 
And they contain no mercury. 
Several experts have pointed out that reserves have compact fluorescent bulbs because they contain mercury and that they therefore dispose of as special needs, which is in the developing countries is not always possible, unless the producers provide a collection point for disposal. 
The main source of mercury emissions to the planet, according to the report is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but the coal plants that emit much more mercury to produce the wasted by incandescent bulbs electricity. 
Just in the United States experience these coal plants 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually. 
The report presents a detailed account of the profits that would generate each country thanks to this international program. 
Indonesia would save, for instance a billion dollars annually for the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 means a coal-fired power plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
