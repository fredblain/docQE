The ice-University 
On the "Gelato University" in Bologna ice-cream are prepared for better seasons. 
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest feed and visitors from around the world. 
Where does all the ice? 
From Gelatiere and the Gelataio. 
The Gelatiere on some old-fashioned German of the ice cream maker is to apply the cream to her all the rules of Italian Eismacherkunst. 
The Gelataio collected with a spatula the ice from the refrigerated counter, she sweeps into the wafer and then sells them. 
To know this, you must not drive after Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna. 
But who still want to know more about ice, can not pass on the "Gelato-University of the Italian company Carpigiani. 
The University has set up ice, the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003, so the ice cream from its machines throughout the high Italian best values. 
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest feed and visitors from around the world. 
There are also multi-day special courses and internships around the chocolate ice cream in our own ice cream parlor. 
Some people dream in the mid-life crisis of a new career, others just venture onto ice smooth their vague yearnings. 
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary and Saudi Arabia. 
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow Food movement and will in the land of industrial ice-cream offer in the future, a European quality product. 
Anke from Berlin is a consultant and wants after years in a nerve-wracking job something of my own bagging. 
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo. 
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of their ice cream bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia's because children love their Italian ice cream. 
Maestro Luciano Ferrari Gelatiere explained to the participants, first the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream. 
The point is not only good taste but also the silky smoothness and good consistency. 
Luciano forgets his training but not the icing on the national and even southern superstructure 'Italian Gelato is simply the best - and still is a lot of romance here. " 
The first step in the production seems very simple. 
Luciano tilts the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer, which is heated with an electronic program all at 85 degrees and then immediately cooled to four degrees. 
Then he turns on the machine to a faucet and out comes a white base pasteurized cream, foundation for all Milcheissorten. 
Is immediately assailed the instructor with questions: Is it possible to produce ice cream with only natural ingredients without a stabilizer? 
How to give your own desire to experiment free reign? 
Luciano warned to be led astray by the spirit of the times. 
Those of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" speech, perhaps using them anyway stabilizers - usually a product of nature, such as guar gum from the guar bean. 
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, but it must be sold within a day, or it collapses into itself, and the customer bites loud ice granules. 
Some variations of the matrix are allowed. 
More exciting is it with the flavors. 
For the taste in ice Maestro Luciano distinguish between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit department or at the sweets of the supermarket. 
In addition, there are powders and pastes. 
"The suppliers are all trying to palm you dozens of flavored additives." 
"But you should just experiment times." 
Either in fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit. 
Or even at the ice cream out of the white matrix, which is yellow to cream with eggs and cocoa powder as the basis for all kinds of chocolate temptations. 
Now, students will be distributed to the ice machines. 
Luciano, they can produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base, with more or less vanilla or other natural supplements. 
The same experiment can be subjected to the fruit ice. 
More flavor, more fruit puree - the taste is not necessarily better. 
Hazelnut ice cream does not taste absolutely nutty if it contains more hazelnuts. 
The popular Kiwi ice cream makes the working group that uses more fruit, less water and less stabilizer. 
Only a balanced mix lift the taste of Gelato out properly, "says Luciano. 
Ice cream is a question: peach puree is used with lots of sugar, the sugar content are reduced in the basic recipe. 
Lemon ice for an extra helping of sugar is necessary. 
Luciano pulls out a device with which it determines the sugar content of fruits (wine measure so that Oechsle in grape must). 
Fortunately tables facilitate the computation. 
to make ice cream does not require as much physical effort as before. 
Not only the device for automatic preparation of the matrix helps. 
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture struck simultaneously creamy and cooled to minus temperatures. 
Despite all the automation stay small margins is not enough. 
The Brazilian Gustavo blotted himself and his course colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree, as he gets the oversized blender out of control. 
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
