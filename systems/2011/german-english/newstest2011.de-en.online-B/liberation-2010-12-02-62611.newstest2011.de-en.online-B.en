Alarm - pesticides ingested by children 
A child of 10 years, takes over the day 81 different chemical substances, a this Wednesday by the Association Générations Futures (formerly the Movement for the Protection of the rights and respect of future generations) published study. 
The association, which declared that their results "reflect the face of the small number of samples analyzed, no statistically significant value, but represent Illustration character of the treated problem, had between July and September, usually within four, one about ten years old child at meals consumption of foods plus a snack in the supermarkets in Paris and bought Oise. 
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruits and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 liters of water per day - were examined as well as treats from laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants. 
The balance plate is staggering: 81 chemicals, including 42 as possibly or probably cause cancer and five classified as safe karziogen classified, as well as 37 substances with Endokrinin-disruptive, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center. 
"Even if not exceeded in the virtually all the cases, the legal limit for any chemical, individually ingested substance, one of the survey takes it very well that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to cancer-causing agents or substances with Endokrinin-disruptive is worrying, "says the association. 
Already at breakfast alone contain butter and tea with milk, more than ten of the potentially cancer-causing residues and three safe proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the endocrine system. 
The apple imported from Brazil, planned as a snack for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a banned fungicide in France. 
The same goes for the green beans from Kenya, including the lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide banned in the EU has strict. 
Furthermore, were the hamburger steak, the tuna from the can, even peppered the baguette and the chewing gum of pesticides and other chemicals. 
The tap water, the analysis, the presence of nitrates and chloroform have brought to light. 
When dinner was the salmon steak with 34 identified, chemical residues in the "richest" and even that was not to warm up the meal in the microwave used plastic plates unloaded. 
The eventual risk of this "pollutant cocktails" for the consumer "is probably undervalued," says the study. 
The "Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts" (EE-LV) has also proposed "given the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in lifestyle diseases." 
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) regarding the presence of residues of 365 different, identified in fruit and vegetable pesticides identified, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
