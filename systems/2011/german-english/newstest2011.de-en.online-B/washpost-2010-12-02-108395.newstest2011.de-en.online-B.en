Belarus agrees not to collect more weapons-grade uranium 
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign for global nuclear material security, the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. 
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton in the White Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the security summit. 
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus expects to earn no more highly enriched uranium and last spring seemed to have reached a hurdle. 
But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that were taken in the past two months, two secret agreements with Belarus, to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian Research Institute. 
That set the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee, who remains anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue, about 500 pounds. 
The agreement seems to be one of the main results of Obama's "Nuclear safety summit of 47 nations to be" in April, had been ruled out of Belarus. 
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next peak 2012th 
"I was really impressed by the fact that they want a seat on the Nuclear Safety Summit (2012)." 
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety. 
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant and important step" of Belarus. 
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, within four years to secure all nuclear material precarious. 
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries, their highly enriched uranium to get rid of. 
Belarus will be the seventh. 
A dozen countries were doing it under the administration of George W. Bush. 
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Safety Summit of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never give up its uranium. 
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of pounds, which is essential weapons-grade and less-enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time. 
"This is our raw material ... We will make it no dirty bombs and we will sell it to anyone." 
"We use it for research purposes only, that's all." 
Belarus approached yet in a few months ago the United States, as it indicated interest in meeting an agreement. 
The first attempt to remove the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly complicated because the material was contaminated slightly, say officials. 
It was loaded onto a special train, the more than 1300 miles to say a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials. 
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was conducted according to the officials by plane. 
The U.S. government pays for this $ 14 million effort, with much of the money in the Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium flows, which can not be used for nuclear weapons. 
"This was very carefully coordinated and agreed to build trust," which led to the agreement that was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official with the Ministry of Energy, which operates on the global risk reduction. 
The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende study estimates that this year Belarus had at least 88 pounds of uranium and hundreds of pounds waffenf√§hhigen of highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus wants according to the joint agreement to resolve his camp until 2012. 
The relations between Belarus and the United States were strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko harsh abuse of human rights. 
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a possible approach. 
"The progress of these global security issues welcome hot end, announced the United States of America and Belarus that an increased respect remains for democracy and human rights in Belarus, a key issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens, "she explains.
