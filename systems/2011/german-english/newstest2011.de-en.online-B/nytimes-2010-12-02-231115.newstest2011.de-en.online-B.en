Tech Toys Your Gift Budget holds in equilibrium 
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can tear a considerable hole in your budget gifts. 
An iPad costs as much as five BMX bikes for $ 99, while the price for a game about 10 Kinect classical skipping ropes, or about 48 cans Play-Doh meets. 
But you can protect your gift budget. 
I recently visited in search of three electronic toys under $ 80 three national toy retailer - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club. 
I was immediately clear that Moore's Law was in force. This year, the technology toys at the same time efficient and cost slightly less than last year. 
And although fewer new toys appear with their own web sites found on the most famous of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, a wider range. 
More and more button-cell powered toys come on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries. 
Here are some recommendations. 
(Unless otherwise indicated, all prices of Toys "R" Us are.) 
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $ 13 for children 3 years) are plush figures, the size of guinea pigs that sing a note, if you press on her stomach. 
Press once corresponds to a note by pressing several times can you play a song. 
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony. 
Note: If you started with the press of time, you can not stop. 
For a combination of envoys and dance is the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $ 60 for children 2) the best choice. 
Based on the offers in the last year developed Elmo Live doll animatronic technology, the changing games like 'Simon says', and thanks to the novel hinge legs with wheel lock, they dominated the Moon Walk. 
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. Her parents complained, however, about the lack of volume control. 
If you are a child of the 80s, you can certainly remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys. 
Now he is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $ 40 for children over 3), with a whole pile of question cards, with which a car can be a lesson, with a know-alls with auto-correction function as a teacher. 
If your child does not want to entrust your phone like, here are three independent alternatives. 
Mobigo from VTech ($ 60 for children 3 to 8) is the cheapest and easiest to use solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. It or its games are not as instructive as those on the Explorer Leapster ($ 70 for children 3 to 12), which is equipped to the first major revision of the Leapfrog Leapster-series with a new, brighter screen. 
None of the versions is compatible with older tapes. 
iXL by Fisher-Price ($ 90 for children 3 to 7) used for the Games and eBooks, a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD card drive can also be considered family photos on it. 
Finally, there are Scrabble Flash ($ 30 from Hasbro, for children over 8). The five blocks are no larger than a matchbox and have their own LED display. 
The game is about to merge the blocks to form words before time runs out. It is great for an impromptu spelling bee. 
More and more toys have some sort of online connection. 
If you go alone to the offer in the toy stores, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important. 
To give your child an online pet on Club Penguin, you may also a Disney Club Penguin 2 "Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($ 5 for children 6 to 12) buy, which includes a coin with a confidential code. 
If you enter the code online, your child will receive the Club Penguin Store enough credits for two other parts. 
It can be roller skates or a Puffle-stuffed animal. 
The latest head-cell powered micro-robots, nano Hexbug ($ 10 for children over 5) is not larger than the head of your toothbrush. 
The beetle is moving quickly to 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction. 
It's fun to send him through a maze of blocks. 
And he is very durable. 
We fell off the kitchen table and survived even some time in the mouth of our dog.
