A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudi 
The roof seems like the back of a prehistoric lizard that staircase as the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are gaping fish mouths. 
This is the Casa Batlló by the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. 
Of the local residents got the house, with its organic forms the nickname "bone house." 
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile and mosaic fragments that are reminiscent to shed facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these features typical for the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi. 
The facade of the house plays with beautiful lines, gentle colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals. 
Only on closer inspection one notices that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm, and thoughtful order. 
At night, the whole facade is still vivid, dramatic and special being illuminated increases the brightness of the colors yet. 
The same sweeping lines and intricate shapes dominate the interior of the house. 
Wave-shaped timber copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements from doors, peep holes and even bars. 
The House Batlló in the Eixample district of the busy shopping street Passeig de Gracia No 43 was rebuilt from a house built in 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese pointed out. 
The reconstruction took two years and completed in 1906. 
The investor, a wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of an entirely new building, but eventually he agreed to the idea of ​​Gaudí on an unusual and cheaper construction. 
The apartment building Casa Batllo Antoni Gaudi designed not alone, however. 
He worked together with the architect Josep Maria Jujol. 
Especially on the drawing board, the decorations were for the representative of the apartment property owner and also the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea. 
In the design of the facade but also worked with several other sculptors and artists. 
The joint work on the design of the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí. 
Thus Jujol also involved in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Mila in Park Güell, in which there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí. 
Shortly after its completion, the house was given by the local population of its organic forms because of the nickname "bone house." 
Others called it the special window opening mechanism due to the "yawning house." 
It also says at the top of the building is the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia presented. 
But even more sculptural elements symbolize hidden religious motives. 
Gaudí designed for the house of a unique for its time central heating system with venting channels and traditional fireplaces. 
Somewhat bizarrely seems its 45-degree tilt on already. 
In his work consistently ignored Gaudí all that time building and was not swayed by them. 
Before construction starts, although he took from the city of the appropriate planning permission but the information given by him about the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers and two years later at the completion of the results were so horrified that they required help. 
The senators met with, among other things, the fact that the construction interfered with its pillars, even in the public sidewalk. 
came to change it but no longer quite the opposite - only fifteen days after the relevant request of the district presented Josep Batlló a request for approval to the hiring of the two highest floors of the house - and it was granted to him promptly. 
The house owner himself moved into the lower floors. 
In the gallery on the 2nd Stock was a social room, third floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment. 
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store. 
The entire six-story building by running up a flight of stairs up to the roof terrace. 
Due to the fundamental elements of the renovation all right angles and straight lines were eliminated and replaced by bent and curved walls. 
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for interconnecting rooms. 
The social part can be explained by the opening of the saloon doors combine completely and so a bigger company could chat easily without losing confidential conversations to have a certain intimacy. 
The house was given by Gaudí's conversion except for a new facade, a very unusual roof and two floors. 
It is also impressive Gaudí's play of light and the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is covered and the atria. 
The interplay of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum of light. 
He simply set out the principle advantage that white reflects the light better than darker colors, which absorb the sunlight on the contrary. 
The house Casa Batllo, which was launched in 2005 in the World Heritage list of UNESCO can now visit everyone. 
On the first floor the spacious and attractive accommodation is made available to the public. 
The owners decided only in the year to take this step and this on the occasion of the famous 150.Geburtstags Creator. 
When they found out that this is a very lucrative business, they kept the visits at, so they expanded to include other common and the attic rooms, including from the roof terrace. 
The price to visit the monument, however, is not chicken, it amounts to 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist cards get 20 percent discount. 
This amount exceeds the admission fees to other Gaudi buildings in the city. 
Who wants to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with his dragon tower should try to make friends with one of the residents and visit him at home.
