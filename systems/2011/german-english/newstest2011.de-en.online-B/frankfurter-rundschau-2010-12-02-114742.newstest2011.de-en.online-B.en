Inspectors in the twilight 
The European Food Safety Authority had been "infiltrated by the experimenting with GM crops industry. 
This charge now formulated, the expert group test Biotech, which sees itself as an independent institution for the assessment of biotechnology. 
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have it well documented," Test Biotech CEO Christoph Then said on Wednesday in Munich. 
The leader of EFSA's expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA experts had in years, the association ILSI lobbyists under contract. 
Who is paid by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle and Bayer. 
Kuiper had significantly contributed to the EFSA testing of GM crops and therefore am in a clear conflict of interest criticized Then. 
The EFSA rules are intermittently identical to position papers from the ILSI and contribute to the signature of the industry which will be under the control of the Authority in Parma, Italy. 
It was the second time that Testbiotech bem√§ngle a conflict of interests. 
So be a senior manager recently Efsa without conditions, or transition period to the Swiss agricultural company Syngenta - and I have changed so that the pages. 
Also, the Central German Radio (MDR) was recently unveiled personal connections between the controlling authority and EU industry lobby, which has made the Federal Environmental Agency as well as MEPs hear everything. 
EFSA, however, can not see any conflict of interest. 
They resort to all legitimate data, including those of the industry, provided they are of high technical quality, it said in a statement. 
From the experts working for EFSA, asking you not think they have any contacts with industry. 
You would have to disclose this but. 
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the United States. 
This refers to himself as a neutral forum for experts from academia, industry and politics - including risk assessment of biotechnology without lobbying job. 
In criticizing the field of independent experts such as Then, that genetically modified plants are currently approved without any feeding study in animals and will not test the reaction of GM crops to environmental effects. 
"We want to know what makes, for example, genetically modified maize on the field," said Then. 
Current practice, only isolated proteins, but not the entire gene plant is to test, what do not provide reliable results. 
"If the risks are not looking for, how can you find them?" Then asks accusingly. 
The Angelika Hilbeck also agrees. 
The scientist conducting research in genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technische Hochschule Zurich. 
The industry attempts in this field as in the U.S. now also in Europe more and more to influence critical scientists or discredit. 
There is therefore hardly researchers who were not intertwined with corporations. 
For business critical studies would not usually published. 
"The industry controls the security research," says Hilbig.
