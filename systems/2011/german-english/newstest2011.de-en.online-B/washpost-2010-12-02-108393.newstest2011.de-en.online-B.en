Khmer Rouge veterans forced a confrontation with the past 
In a dimly lit, concrete classroom with peeling walls and dirty, the director of Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built it, to the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok. 
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok." 
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Cor Sreng Ma, 42 years. 
known for its brutality during the Khmer Rouge's reign as "the butcher," is the commander popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still living . 
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, long-term followers will be challenged in Anlong Veng. 
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum that victims are allowed public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime. 
In June, the government distributed a textbook, the first former child soldier tells the story of the Khmer Rouge. 
And in July a joint tribunal condemned the UN and Cambodia for the first time a former member of the Khmer Rouge than the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek IEV, better known as Duch, sentenced to 35 years in prison. 
Each of these developments, the fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Veng, their efforts made it difficult for reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia. 
"There is still resentment and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do something," said Youk Chhang, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an independent organization that studies the regime. 
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." 
"It even splits families." 
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died from disease, overwork or starvation. 
When the Vietnamese invaded and 1979, the Pol Pot-Ied government collapsed, fled the remnants of the regime and its military on the border of Cambodia to Thailand. 
Here they spread until December 1998 when the last movement surrendered to sleep. 
As introduced Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary, the guerrilla war from its base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok went the next generation matured in Anlong Veng. 
But the mid-1990s, when a project funded by the UN peace agreement led in 1993 the first democratic elections in the country, started a large group of Khmer Rouge fighters, to the government to overflow, leading to the capitulation of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998 led. 
Pol Pot died in 1998 of natural causes, and Ta Mok, who was not given, was arrested in 1999 by government forces in the Dangrek Mountains. 
He died in 2006 in prison in Phnom Penh, where he waited for his trial. 
As their patron they are no longer protected, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the grinding poverty of rural Cambodia, and many kept the movement in nostalgic memories. 
Even if kept a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge their local government posts, because they laid down their weapons, were the rank and poor, uneducated peasants. 
"These people have very little benefit from the surrender," Sok Leang said the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds throughout Cambodia, in Anlong Veng, public forums 
"They are rooted in the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime." 
"They grew up without any professional knowledge." 
Sor Lim, 55, who joined in 1974 as a teenager the Rhmer Rouge, fought in the jungle to Anlanger Veng, before he settled in 1998 to lead a life of a poor rice farmer. 
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said. 
"Ta Mok has been eating something for everyone." 
"But now, life is hard because we have to take care of themselves." 
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also aroused concern. 
Early next year, the court will try to provide Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister in court. 
The order of the court is to order the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will follow on these four cases, further action. 
That has done little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng. 
Recent media speculation have focused on the Chaem, 64 years, concentrated, which during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s was the district chief in the province Manteay Meanchey. 
In 2007, she had told agents of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, they have guided the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of slave laborers died probably. 
On a hot evening in Chaem came from work in the fields of her wooden house in a dirty back road out of Anlong Veng. 
As the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass threw leaned in Chaem discuss it off to charge, their past, the Khmer Rouge. 
If they summon the court, they would refuse to leave, she said. 
"Cambodia is at peace and stability," she said. 
"If there were no more prosecutions would be war here." 
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled in 1878 by the Khmer Rouge, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be unsafe, would accuse the court more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this. 
"Cambodia dig a hole and bury the past," he said. 
But confrontation with the past is what Cambodia has to do to go to forward to, "said Youk Chhang by the Documentation Centre. 
"Reconciliation with the Khmer-time means of collecting the broken pieces," he said. 
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together, so as to understand everything." 
The center created the first government-approved textbook about the Khmer Rouge, the 75seitige "History of Democratic Cambodia." 
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the history books for the High School Ministry of Education that contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge. 
How many times in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know very little about the Khmer Rouge regime, despite the compounds of the city. 
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new textbook will help students to understand an important part of their history. 
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he brought the book home to read it. 
"My family does not accept many parts of the book and the court," he said. 
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are convicted by the court." 
Such resistance is complex and complicated the process of reconciliation, "said Sok Leang. 
But obtaining the public forums, the textbook and the court gradually influence, "he said. 
Still has the Khmer Rouge here a powerful attraction. 
Up in the mountains Dangrek launches of shrubs and overgrown with plastic garbage dirty way to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof. 
Pol Pot's body was cremated here after his death in 1998 at a tire pile. 
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile vendor on the roadside, said she did not know much about the man who was cremated here. 
"But he has a strong mind and many people go here to pray to him," she said. 
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's final resting place, where she will take a bush of ripe bananas - in the hope that it brings her luck.
