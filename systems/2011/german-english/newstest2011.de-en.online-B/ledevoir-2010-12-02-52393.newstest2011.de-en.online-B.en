Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris 
The Quebec government, which was approved by the Société Angus and the company Parallèle asked to contribute financially to the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris declared their agreement to cooperate, but only through a competitive loan. 
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle that a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take on the Daniel Langlois owned cinema complex had eXcentris hopes on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, at this again to answer his true cinematic feature will not appear what they have requested. 
The government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, but to their own conditions. 
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers rather a loan in less than initially expected amount that could get a viable solution with competitive conditions in life, at least in the opinion of the removable from the state's rumor mill sources. 
An initial action plan and a request on 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the petition was again revised since the sum terms down. 
A proposal along with an action plan have already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, Minister of St-Pierre, who heads the Act eXcentris.

Cinema chief Daniel Langlois had after the self-financed construction of the cinema for ten years with great difficulty, the author presents the premises of his movie theater complex, which could justify the exceptional status by the State. 
The lack of movie theaters that show independent films, is in Montreal more than obvious, and eXcentris knew his clientele to keep them working. 
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle Christian Yaccarini at the top to control their part of a privately financed campaign, which they hope to gain a total $ 700,000 to bring in more. 
Since the spring of 2009 only runs a single screen proceeds to show movies in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle. 
The aim of future purchasers is to the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the opening demonstration of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois' Des hommes et des dieux "too new. 
Christian Yaccarini but the newspaper "Le Devoir" has not recalled and they ignored what he and his group from the downwardly revised budget proposals, which have been made to them.
