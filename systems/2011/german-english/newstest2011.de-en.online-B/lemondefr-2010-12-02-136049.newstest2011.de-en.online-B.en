Clotilde Reiss affair: the Elysee Palace is exaggerating his role as mediator for Syria 
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, held the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "spying," the French public in suspense, the diplomats said on alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran. 
All under the watchful eyes of diplomats from the United States. 
By WikiLeaks and obtained by the newspaper "Le Monde" by American seen documents provide some background cheap this crisis. 
They describe how the Americans had the Elysée explained his strategy that went so far as to give this advice on dealing with their own crisis of hostage-taking in Iran (a small group of hikers). 
They show how the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman is not the release of Majid Kakavand, a French captive and the American justice on the basis of trade in material for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program sought Iranian Gege to have power. 
Finally, they share the way, has tried with the French Presidency to manipulate the media for the purpose of making this idea plausible, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad has played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a bright light. 
In truth he had not done anything in this regard. 
A on 12 August 2009, edited in Paris diplomatic telegram, entitled "Iran: French comments on ways of dealing with hostage-taking." 
François Richier, Elysée advisor on strategic matters, talked accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone. 
They told her the French method. 
Who advised the Americans to do their utmost to carry back their own nationals who were being held by force in Iran. 
"Make Noise," they said, "articulated loudly and clearly and without ceasing" the words "basic human rights," "Innocence," "immediate release" in the media. 
This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime at a loss, which respects very sensitive to its image. 
"Runs all the more so since you ask the Iranians not to do that." 
Because "silence solves nothing, past experiments on the discussion on understated way, the Iranians are" masters in evasive maneuvers. " 
Mr. Richier added that the detention of aliens "current, Iranian tactics" was "hostage-taking for purposes of political blackmail." 
He announced the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which should come about on August 16, the day on which it takes refuge in the French Embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 € deposit). 
And he can announce the Elysée anticipate further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will intensify." 
The Iranians could be "in the near future for another of the arrest about 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said. 
28. August 2009. 
Clotilde Reiss was released twelve days ago from prison, but is still being held in Iran. 
An information was put into circulation: the Iranians Kakavand Majid, whose extradition the United States due to illegal trade in sensitive electronic equipment to Iran asking for is a decision of a judge in Paris has been released from prison. 
The U.S. Embassy is located, like many other observers, troubling questions about this coincidence. 
For Washington, that tracks the illicit Iranian acquisition of the Network for the nuclear program provided material, the release of Majid Khakavand bad news dar. 
France has made a deal to purchase? 
The liberation of the Iranians against that of the French? 
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September François Richier assured that this is not the case. 
The Elysée, he says, was not only "totally surprised by the decision of the judge," but also tried to rebel against. 
"It has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government can not change the court decision," he explains. 
Mr. Richier would like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under "strict" supervision of the French secret service. 
The Elysée advisers dials a phone number, hangs up, then informed the U.S. diplomat, the Iranians "JURISDICTION is currently in the lead by the Iranian embassy building in Paris." 
While in detention in Iran by Clotilde Reiss protects the Elysée not his efforts to make believe by the media and statements by organized "escapes" the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad to play an "important" and "influential mediator. 
The Americans observe this activity is not without irony, and state that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version. 
One of 25 August 2009 telegram dating conjures "the flash media of the French authorities" up. 
On what is so much "thanksgiving" to Mr Assad, asks the Paris embassy. 
"Despite their statements full of praise, the French authorities to secretly that they have only a vague idea of ​​what the Syrians did in fact." 
The document then deals with the reasons that the Elysée have caused to expire this fiction. 
The intensive communication effort "aims to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria," he says. 
A 2008 policy was launched, which was perceived by many critics votes in France and abroad as premature and undeserved "then. 
"The Syrian role based predominantly" try Paris' Syria to keep in mind you can achieve what Commendation by playing a constructive role in the region. " 
The aim is also to "discord between Syria and Iran of sowing." 
The American Embassy know this from a good source. 
On 11 August François Richier had told her: "Of course we do not know if the Syrians have always done whatever." 
"But we are nevertheless grateful to them." 
"This should at least create confusion among the Iranians." 
Clotilde Reiss returns on 16 May 2010 in France is back. 
Nicolas Sarkozy she receives at the Elysee. 
In a communiqué, he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for its "active role for the release of our compatriot."
