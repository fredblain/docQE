Get out of here 
This evening it finally works again right around the Irishman. 
No trace of sadness. 
But the home team's guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA dominated too much. 
The fans howl for joy when crashing loud music, they stamp their feet. 
The Bailey-Pub in the southern Irish Cork quakes, because the players throw ping pong balls over a three-meter distance in the beer mug - and take. 
"Bierpong" called the bizarre spectacle of winning there are 500 € prize money plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong World Championships in January. 
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this shrill drinking game and the modest computer that does not really fit together. 
And yet tries to amuse the 26-year-olds here to distract himself from the nagging question of what the future will bring. 
His route is not fun in Las Vegas, he is interviewing in January in New Zealand. 
"I have a queasy feeling about it," he says. 
"It's so far away from home and yet I have no work there." 
After all: His girlfriend is waiting in Auckland already on it - "she had jerk, jerking her dream job as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man, smiling. 
Due to poor prospects at home already have two of Tanner's three children sought their fortune abroad. 
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London. 
The boys go: As with the Tanners is the situation on the island in many families. 
100 000 Ireland will probably leave the country in the near future, say experts of the Economic and Social Research Institute ESRI ahead in Dublin. 
Until 2015, they expect even with 200,000 emigrants. 
For the small country of only 4.5 million inhabitants, a violent loss. 
The forecasts will come true, it is comparable to a wave of emigration to that under which Ireland suffered in the eighties. 
After a decade of boom, which brought great prosperity to Ireland with it again now makes wide sadness. 
The economic crisis is uncertain primarily the young, educated Irishman, for which there are currently only went uphill. 
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years. 
Each was used, there was money in abundance. 
Meanwhile, however, without three of ten women and men under thirty work. 
are in the Irish Times letters abound of young immigrants who complain: "Everything is going down the river in Ireland." 
"There should be a revolt against politicians and bankers -. But who can go away and our country loses an entire generation" 
"The last one then please out the light." 
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, provides pull up a bleak future because the administration is operating only window dressing and the young people offer no future anymore. 
"You reduce the minimum wage, but they have no strategy, such as new jobs are to be made," says the 20-year-old. 
They watched as their fellow students shimmy from an unpaid internship to the next. 
Their greatest worry, she says it is having to emigrate in four years itself. 
"This thought is sad and depressing." 
In this case try men like Stephen McLarnon occupy the subject positively. 
McLarnon organized the "work inga broad expo," an exhibition that provides a full service on working abroad. 
"For young professionals working abroad is still a great opportunity to make the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager. 
On his website shows photos in Australia surfers and snowboarders in Canada. 
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun. 
How it feels to build something else, Seán O'Donovan know in six months. 
Because for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland was nothing more to do, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany. 
In Gelsenkirchen, they just pull up a fashion house. 
In January, we continue to Hanover and Berlin, to the next project. 
His home O'Donovan now sees only rarely, because it causes extra shifts in order to pay off the mortgage on his house at home. 
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says as he steps in a long time for the first time over the threshold of his house. 
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I am as good as ever again." 
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes through the cooled rooms. 
The little house in an upmarket residential area with manicured front yards, park in the driveways big, expensive cars. 
Together with a sister O'Donovan has bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 € - 100 percent loan financing. 
"They were crazy times, it was easy money without a lot of questions," he says. 
Is he afraid that it could go wrong with the credit? 
O'Donovan thinks for a while, after pouring hot tea and says: "I have no children, by which I must feed them and I am young, and even when everything goes wrong, I can start anew." 
The civil engineer may not be the wailing, the moment he hears often. 
"No one should go hungry - but our situation is not nearly as dramatic as in previous times here on the island," he says. 
"For a while working abroad, which is not the worst thing that can happen -. Perhaps, we feel this only as an Irishman" 
He laughs and then tells of his father, who has gone into the last major economic crisis in England. 
"After seven years he was there again and life went on in Ireland, very simple." 
Cian Tanner likes this idea. 
The future can open and see just how it goes with life elsewhere. 
A couple of years working in London when he has nothing behind them and why it should not in New Zealand was going well for him and his girlfriend? 
One thing is there but that it these days, duly alarmed: the celebration of his 27th Birthday on Friday in Dublin. 
He fears that it might turn into a farewell party. 
"Just not too many emotions," he says and takes a long swig of his beer. 
"Farewell, that sounds scary." 
"Call it rather a Weggehparty, very loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
