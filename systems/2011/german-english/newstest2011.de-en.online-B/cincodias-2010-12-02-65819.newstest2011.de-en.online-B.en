Threats of the European Central Bank (ECB) 
Investors yesterday reacted sharply to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our capacity to respond." 
The spreads of euro Peripheriländer have risen dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%. 
However, we should be allowed, that the ECB may be deceived and fed, the euro has hardly points to what causes for concern, do not underestimate. 
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, which recovered to the extent in which he breaks down again, but due to the closure of short positions and highly speculative. 
The institutional investors are still not lose his fear. 
A month ago today urged the European Central Bank on us to make our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen reversed, that the ECB must be tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably make quite a few times in the future, backed down. 
The Bundesbank demanded the termination of the plan to purchase government debt, as these were ineffective, and the removal of all temporary extraordinary liquidity measures. It should only be a one-week unlimited access will be maintained. 
After the Ireland crisis, we expect that the current liquidity measures "at least until March," and extended the quarterly awards shall be maintained with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure the liquidity until at least June. 
We also expect that the program continued to purchase of bonds and a strengthening signal is output. 
If the established expectations are not met, the excellent response by the markets yesterday reflected again and if halstarrig insists is that we take back our liquidity measures can only help us God! 
As with the ECB meeting in May in which reaffirmed the bank, the purchase of debt securities not to be considered and the markets collapsed, then, could be repeated this story tomorrow. 
The ECB must be credible and persistent. 
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said to have bought a lot, provoking a new market collapse. 
Yesterday, the annual auction of government securities in Portugal was rather weak. 
The state asset management spent only 500 million of 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction. 
Nevertheless, the interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points across the curve, mirroring a perception change in the markets reflected in the words Trichet. 
In Ireland the numbers of the debt hole by Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published. 
The sum is estimated to be 10 000 million short-term and possible further estimated 15 000. It is time to February, to raise private capital or those banks are nationalized. 
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after it had recognized the problem with the stress test in July, the numbers under the rescue plan, acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty. 
However, the government on Tuesday received parliamentary approval for his new budget. Since it has still not have the proper support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty. 
Angela Merkel has her discourse in regard to the Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December designed moderate. There, political unity is needed to show that we play together the same score. 
The problem is that Germany will play Wagner and the other countries of the ninth symphony of Beethoven. 
The Spanish Government President presented yesterday before the action plan to be adopted on Friday by the Council of Ministers. 
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reducing the national deficit, liberalization, privatization and job creation programs. Actions that sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldi's Four Seasons. 
The dual effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has risen by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges. 
Compared with February, the reaction of the government and the Bank of Spain was swift and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise. 
Today it is a major draw a three-year government bond auction that will benefit from the Trichet effect is. Therefore, we rely on strong demand, which will eliminate any doubt about our ability to reschedule. 
For Spain would be requesting a relief plan, a self-sacrifice. 
We would receive cash which we do not need. The Treasury has made available 40 billion euros, three times more than in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to markets would be closed without notice. 
Nevertheless, our strategy in accordance with the motto Caesar's wife: "Now is not only being, but also the appearance." 
Take heart, we can!
