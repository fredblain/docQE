What to do, the CSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "pastry." 
The new councilors of the capital from the ranks of the CSSD will have to overcome some obvious language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague City Council and in the representation at all. 
The newspaper has Aktuálně.cz members of the new Council from the ČSSD even a little "knocked off" as they master the notorious slang that has become standard in recent years that the current coalition partners in Prague were at the helm. 
The coded vocabulary that was introduced in the bygone era of Mayor Pavel Bém of the Prague political elite, some of the most famous actors, situations and Causae borrowed. 
Surprisingly it was found that the new councils fall in relation to these new terms somewhat in the dark. 
They say at least. 
"Who's Voldemort?" 
"No idea." 
"I'm more of a newcomer to Prague's politics," responded Lukáš Kaucký, the new councilor for culture, to test the "godfather of vocabulary." 
But the councilman Karel Březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar manner. 
For example, the term "golf hole." 
"This is the only expression of those that you present to me here, I occasionally use." 
"Otherwise, I do not think much of slang." 
From the vocabulary that had published the daily paper Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the election congress of the ODS, the editors picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously associated with the Prague City Council. 
The Social Democrats should "go to the pastry shop, the terms" Voldemort ,"" Prague's largest golf hole, ,"" buffalo hump ,"" paneling "" betrayal of the capital "and define. 
Three Prague councilmen agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - but promised his first participation in the conversation, but not even then took up the receiver. 
The fifth councilor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test in advance. 
"These things I do not care and how the Civic Democrats together to talk, I do not judge it." 
"For me it is important how we see ourselves as part of our programs," he countered. 
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký in the above headline would have allegedly failed to recognize that the speech by the influential businessman and friend of the ex-Mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek. 
The term "Voldemort" Kaucký says absolutely nothing and the only term he guessed correctly when tested, was "the country's largest golf hole." 
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, added security, but added: "But I know more from the newspaper." 
And jokingly, "I'll have to take a language course." 
The "golf hole" is then deciphered not only from Matador Karel Březina, but also by the councilor for environmental issues as Tunnel Blanka Lukáš Plachý correctly. 
Both Social Democrats also know for whom the term is Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý suspects even where this figure is related to and therefore also what it means to "go into the pastry. 
"I think it's like to go in any Prague restaurant business," Plachý is pretty close to the riddle, if you know that this is the seat of Janoušek companies. 
Consistent with Březina he asserts, however, to have derived this knowledge from the newspaper rather than to him this vocabulary would own. 
Judging from the test participants after, it appears under the Socialists actually do give similar naturalized slang. 
"I asked my colleagues, but obviously there is something we really do not." 
"We call us by name, from time to time we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of the CSSD Prague Petr Hulinsky - from his party comrades shot "Hulda" called. 
"In school I Bříza (birch) was called, but I do not know if my colleagues call me that," tells us Karel Březina his nickname. 
The newspaper has tried Deník Aktuálně.cz the name and lo and behold - it works. 
Councilman Weinert is for the party comrades kind of "grandfather" or less friendly to the "old," the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention before the elections by machinations of the party sponsorship to the will of some colleagues, "Igráček" (famous Czech Lego figure) called. 
Nicknames are the only allow the Social Democrats in the intra-party usage. 
Hulinsky like it allegedly did not when he is "Hulda" calls, but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered yet another nickname of Prague's chairman. 
His nickname is "Doctor of truncheon-rights" has nothing to brag that Petr Hulinsky received his Juris Doctor from the title Bratislava police academy.
