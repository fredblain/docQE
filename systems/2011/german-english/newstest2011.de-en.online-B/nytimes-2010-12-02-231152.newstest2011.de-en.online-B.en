Police operations in China are gentle 
As a training officer walked Tang Shenbin on a city square, checked his nervous subordinates and gave it to military authority and subdued voice commands. 
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guardians of the City Planning feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their penchant for violence - to impress the audience. 
"Just want!" 
"Look straight ahead!" 
"Show them," he whispered to them, "as girls are so pretty!" 
grow out of four girls, barely a teen-age, stood at attention with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants. 
Four pairs of black pumps were in a straight line. 
Four ordinary hats sat perfectly with the blue and white striped hair kept grinding. 
"To me they look average," said Mr. Tang disdain. 
"Models are pretty." 
Several governments have already sought to burnish the image of China's city inspectors. 
In a city, all new applicants have a college degree. 
Guangdong Province led the grayish green instead a bright blue uniform. 
Wuhan in central China replaced by low-power staring: 2009 reportedly circled on 50 officials have not properly established food carts and stared at the operator until it packed up after half an hour and left the place. 
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 residents would like to change the perception fundamentally. 
Since 2003, 13 women strengthen the municipal police patrols. They were selected because of their special appearance, good figure and its youth. 
They should give the crude police a softer, feminine aspect. 
But unfortunately, it would hardly succeed and Scarlett Johansson to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of this city commands. 
By law, the critics. 
Unlike the police officers may enforce these laws, the city only through fines or other administrative penalties. 
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture. 
In January 2008, beating officials in Hubei province, for an audience to death as this with his cell phone while she was filming, as they beat down a protest against a garbage dump. 
Last year was a training manual of the Beijing officials stolen and published on the web. It describes how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed. 
This year, a Shanghai dealer watermelon suffered after a scuffle with five officials of brain injury. 
An exuberant violence video game that can be downloaded from the Internet, shows in China-trained officers in an attack on street vendors. 
"Chengguan does the government fear," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy over the tactics. 
The newspaper called for a "really thorough cleansing." 
Skeptics are the current approach clearly inadequate. 
When examined in October by the Distrik display eight female recruits, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News put the question of whether the women had real jobs or are provided as a visual distraction. 
Probably both. 
According to job offer women were aged 18-22 with good looking figure and "harmonious facial features. 
You should be larger than average - over 1.5 m or 5 feet, 2 1 / 2 inches. 
The employment relationship ends at the 26th Birthday. 
According to officials, working for women over 25 is physically exhausting. 
"The most important is their image," stated an unnamed district official at the quasi-governmental Rednet.com website. 
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc." 
Then come temperament and "inner qualities." 
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but they also have other duties." 
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the Government of the District would like to disagree with this description, 
but admitted that in China, not size requirements in job advertisements for both sexes are unusual. 
The same is true for even facial features. 
Whether that equates with good appearance, is controversial in China. 
But people with disabilities or physical disfigurement need not apply for. 
"We can unfortunately not use the lame or hunchback," said Mr. Zheng. 
"Your image was not good." 
Liu Yi, the patroliert Baoguang on the Square, next to a monastery, is 22, has apple cheeks and a well-shaped mouth. 
She does not feel as sexist that so much emphasis on their appearance. 
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic glance. 
Her colleague with the dimples, the 21-year-old Xu Yang commented, "We have the task of representing the city's image." 
They state that they regret the short shot, since they have ambitious career plans to herd than just dealers through the streets to prevent them from doing business. 
Every morning the patrol deals with about twelve street vendors who try to walk or bike as many rolls and tofu dishes to sell before they are sent packing. 
"Mr. Wang, you are out of here please." 
"We've said this so many times!" Ms. Xu said a dealer who had fled on foot and had left his bicycle mounted on a cart rolling kitchen temporarily down. 
According to officials of the activity is more monotonous than tiresome. 
"It's almost the same every day," said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying in the Arts distribution operations. 
"Office Space." 
One reason is that female officers may confiscate the goods of traders do not like their male counterparts. 
You can only criminals threaten to report them to their male superiors. 
They will protect public hostility, which officials in China are often exposed. 
This year, hundreds of residents rioted from Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province, after a rumor circulated, Chengguan officials have killed a dealer. 
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officers were injured in the nighttime incident, 14 government vehicles were overturned and set on fire. 
Xindu remained of such violent incidents so far been spared. 
But riots are not excluded. 
Only two blocks away from the quiet-Baonguang place where patroulierten the female officers that morning, about 50 people gathered at a street corner. 
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired contrary to the provisions on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop. 
The owner screamed bloody murder. 
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officials paved the way with a grim face to their vehicles and drove off with the bike and its owner. 
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of male patrol was left. He turned his white name tag in order to remain anonymous. 
Like their fellow coordinators play - men over 40 - a purely supporting role. 
But they were not trained to present a clean image. 
"Sometimes we go to verbally." 
"Sometimes, but also physically," Mr Li said soberly. 
"Most of the time people start with the argument."
