The routine demokatrische 
The movement for democracy in Latin America is stronger, so as to support private enterprise. 
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment. 
In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil is larger than that of the United States. 
These results were the Latinobarómetro survey which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist. 
This survey is conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in the region. 
Two figures fall in this year's survey in September and October, particularly in the eye. 
First, the good mood in Latin America 
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions. 
In many countries of the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased dramatically (see Table 1). 
In Peru, for example, where the economy is growing annually since 2002 by about 6% and the number of democracy advocates increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. 
Even in Mexico, where the economy from the sharp drop last year recovered, such a trend can be seen. 
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region are convinced democrats, lowering the regional average (see Chart 2). 
Ca. 44% of respondents said they are satisfied with the democratic practice of their country. They are as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Chart 3). 
Some 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values ​​are the same as last year, show a marked increase over 2003 (17% and 24%). 
A decade ago, Latin American economic crises have undermined the efforts for more democracy. 
That this continued even during the Depression, there may be the fact that the Latin American countries experienced a short recession and have recovered quickly. 
In addition, the poor were offset by a stronger social network. 
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week 2009, the poverty rate in Latin America increased only slightly and is again this year fell by 32%.) 
But from country to country, there are strong differences in mood (see Chart 4). 
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread belief in progress. 
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and have increased violent crime, this is less the case. 
For only the second time since the beginning of many survey respondents see in Latin America in the crime in their country is a bigger problem than unemployment (see Chart 5). 
Ca. 31% say that either they or a family member last year were victims of a crime. However, compared with 38% last year, the values ​​declined and thus reach the lowest level since 1995. 
The growing economic power is reflected in the increasing support for the private and the market economy: about 71% of respondents nationwide indicated that the private sector is essential for the development, in 2007 there were 56% (see Chart 6). 
Ca. 58% stated that only the market economy can bring progress their country, compared with 47% last year. 
Interestingly, 62% of people in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% for private sector), although her left president, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private companies. 
Brazil has, according to 19% of the respondents (18% last year) the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year). 
The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, however, see in the U.S., the most influential country, and this role is in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua is from Venezuela.
