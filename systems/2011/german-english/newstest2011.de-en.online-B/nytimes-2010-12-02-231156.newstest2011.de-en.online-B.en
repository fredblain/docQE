Cheshire appeal draws attention to Twitter 
Half a dozen of them tapped into the riots off in the courtroom. 
The minute they sent their reports on Twitter gruesome testimony. 
In the end, the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process to rape and child chained to beds in a house that burst into flames. 
On Thursday, the closely watched process by Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to find a formal end when the verdict on the death sentence, which has pronounced the jury makes. 
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already filed claims with the court, explain the reasons for an appeal and the courts will be dealing for years. 
One of the provocative reasons is that the intensive coverage of the process - and by the extensive use of Twitter by the average reporter - came to a "circus atmosphere" and a so widespread, immediate penetration of insurgent details is so that the jury in inadmissible way by the public outcry had been affected. 
Such opposition could lead the Courts of Appeal to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules in court is necessary. 
"So as I have experienced during this process, I think it's really a risk if the intake influences of new technology in the courtroom of everyone's right to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes lead counsel. 
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue Chamber of the Supreme Court last week dismissed the applications by decision succinctly back when he said, would be that the new media "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion. 
But that was certainly not the last word on this matter. 
For decades, appeals courts have determined that bear the coverage of notorious cases of doubt as to the fairness of a process can be. 
In its historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States the conviction of Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who allegedly murdered his wife lifted, and said in his ruling that due to the new media a "carnival atmosphere in the court would have given ." 
Some people believe that based on the television series and the feature film "The Fugitive" in this crime. 
Some say lawyers, court appeals, which Mr. Hayes condemnation consider a half-century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom, at the time of the case, Dr. Sheppard was still inconceivable . 
"It's a good reason, about the impact of new media in processes that are followed by the general public to be alarmed," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut . His report states that it is imposed arbitrarily. 
Professor Donohue said that some Courts of Appeal could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of prompt communication from the courtroom out the processes could make fairer. 
The Twitter matter is just one of many who claim the lawyers of Mr. Hayes to discuss for years, and thus postpone a conviction. 
The defense lawyers argue, for example, that Mr. Hayes might have been already prejudiced when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them during jury selection gruesome crime scene photos. 
Some jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and their TÃ¼chter, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years, had filled her with disgust. 
The defense lawyers say they would make the constitutionality of the death penalty constitutional in question, and argue that the judge had incorrectly replaced a juror who had been a critic of the prosecutor, and that he had improperly exerted pressure on the ruling, as he had taken the unusual decision to put the jury on the weekend off. 
The jurors were not isolated. 
But their arguments about the influence of the detailed reporting of the process takes perhaps the greatest interest. 
In one sentence challenge, which they submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and throughout the election campaign was discussed for the office of governor and for the American Senate candidate. 
They argued that the new media have continuously ignited the flames of emotions about the case again. 
"Such a rush of everyday media beepers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," wrote the lawyers, "one has before that in New Haven, and perhaps not even the country experienced." 
Its focus on reporting by Twitter is controversial. 
In interviews, some said journalists that the claim that these direct messages were rabble-rousing than reports which are, slowly, an anti-technology view is that the impoverished on future reporting processes. 
But some lawyers said, Courts of Appeal were often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes require adaptation by the courts. 
Mr. Hayer Legal reinforce this assertion. 
In their appeal they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, was repealed on the conviction of Dr. Sheppard because of reporting and made it clear that new media require new rules. 
"This case," they wrote, "Sheppard against Maxwell represented the 21st century."
