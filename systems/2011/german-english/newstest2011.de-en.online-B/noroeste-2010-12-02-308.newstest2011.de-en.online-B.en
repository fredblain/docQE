NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life 
The North American Space Agency, convened a press conference tomorrow to introduce a fund that will be the impact on the search for living organisms in space. 
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States is tomorrow, announced Thursday, a astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life. 
The Fund will be presented tomorrow at 13.00 clock at a press conference in NASA headquarters in Washington by experts of astrobiology. It is a science that studies the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe. 
At the press conference convened by NASA assured that it would "an extraordinary find in the search for extraterrestrial life," imagine what sparked speculation in experts from other countries. 
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments, which they found so far for unbwohnbar can exist human-like creatures. It has raised the hypothesis that it is in intelligent beings - just like people - could turn when their living conditions improved. 
Apparently there is a microbe that at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, was found California. She lives there in an environment that was considered too toxic to all kinds of life forms, because the lake is heavily arsenic-rich. 
In some way uses the microbe arsenic as a survival resource. In the light of this ability increases the chances of it on other planets, which do not have our protective atmosphere, life might be like. 
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic is detected in accordance with the astrobiologists that "there is really another form of life, a second form of life that differs from the known to us." 
The space agency is tomorrow, Thursday, announced at the press conference, the actual range of their funds. 
The conference is attended by the Geobiologin Pamela Conrad, is investigating the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, the Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), with the question whether its chemical composition is similar to the Earth studied.
