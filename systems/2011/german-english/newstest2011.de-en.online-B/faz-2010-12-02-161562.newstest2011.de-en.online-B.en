Amazon locks Server - threats against Assange 
Wikileaks is increasingly coming under pressure. 
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the unveiling of his platform servers. 
You may put political pressure behind after the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic telegrams. 
Wikileaks founders Assange allegedly keeps in England. 
The unveiling platform Wikileaks gets into the United States are increasingly under attack. 
The Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are now looking to the Internet home in Europe. 
The prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman said while other countries and companies for a boycott of Wikileaks. 
Wikileaks and founder Julian Assange that appears on the wanted list of Interpol is to stay after a newspaper report in the UK. 
"Wikileaks displaced from Amazon servers." 
"Free speech in the land of the free," shared the investigative activists via short message service Twitter on Wednesday (local time) with. 
Shortly before the internet company Amazon the Wikileaks documents had been banished from its servers. 
The Internet activists had in publishing the secret diplomatic telegrams on the Amazon Web Service (AWS) are used to cope with the high traffic to the documents. 
Twitter explained by Wikileaks continues to step: "Prima - our dollars are now spent to deal with people in Europe." 
When Amazon had this problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books." 
Amazon have stopped the use of its servers by Wikileaks, after staff of Senator Joe Lieberman had made inquiries, the CNN reported, citing Lieberman's office. 
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security had threatened a boycott of Amazon, told the British Guardian. 
"I would have liked to see that Amazon is taking this action earlier, given the previous releases of classified information by Wikileaks," the senator said. 
Lieberman, meanwhile, called on the result of denying the platform in other countries to use to servers. 
"Wikileaks" illegal, outrageous and reckless approach to our national security is at risk and endangers lives around the globe, "also mentions a statement by the independent senator. 
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - Wikileaks should help in its efforts to distribute stolen material." 
Wikileaks founders Assange, who is wanted for rape suspect by the authorities in Sweden, is on the wanted list of Interpol. 
According to a report in the London newspaper The Independent to keep the 39-year-old Australian in the UK, the precise location was known to Scotland Yard. 
The Internet activist, has called the investigation in Sweden as always intrigues of his opponents. 
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats. 
"There were even calls for the murder of Julian Assange." 
Therefore rightly fear for his safety Assange said Hrafnsson. 
The Wikileaks founders will therefore continue to keep hidden. 
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America. 
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations should be tried and executed for treason. 
In Canada, said an aide to Prime Minister Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - on television, Assange should be "killed" and Obama "could use a drone." 
Between the White House and Assange meanwhile broke out a slugfest. 
The speaker of President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange the resignation of Foreign Minister had called Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for recently become known spy calls on diplomats. 
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," said Gibbs. 
"Our foreign policy and interests of this country are far more significant than its a website." 
The U.S. government now provides comprehensive protection of their databases to the test. 
As Special Representative was the deputy director of the Center for Anti-terrorism measures, Russell Travers was appointed, said the White House. 
Travers was responsible for "structural reforms" to develop, which are following the disclosure of the Embassy reports by Wikileaks become necessary. 
The White House wants to examine the ways in which the entire government exchanging information and protects. 
The U.S. government also announced to want to ensure the safety of dissidents and most active, if it fell through the Wikileaks release in danger. 
"We have done everything to contact them in touch," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley. 
"We stand ready to protect them, if that be necessary."
