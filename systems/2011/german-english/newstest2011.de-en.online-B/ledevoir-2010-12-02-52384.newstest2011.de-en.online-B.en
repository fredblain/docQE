450 million in contracts without tenders 
Hydro-Quebec has agreed by mutual agreement of project planning company 450 million U.S. dollars in contracts for the hydropower project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert. 
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium comprising the companies BPR, Dessau, SM and Groupe Axor, the most important part, that of project management, has received a total of 295 million dollars without tender. 
This consortium, known as "Énergie gérance" in 2004 to answer as a corollary of the decision by Hydro-Quebec, the private sector, their responsibility, that important hydroelectric project in the amount of a sum of $ 5 billion, is formed. 
In early 2005 landed the consortium "Énergie gérance" the lucrative contract, without that there was a public tender. 
For the Parti Québécois, the recourse is to consortia of companies is a serious ethical problem, evoking the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung and a price increase. 
"This is a new way of a conspiracy and exhausted the competition." 
"This means that instead of carrying out prearranged games instead of a secret way now in open form," said Sylvain Simard yesterday, deputy of the PQ, at the press conference. 
In the early morning Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, for it seems difficult to understand how the interest of the public in this way can be operated. 
Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau the afternoon had responded by vehemently contest that it had been in this contract is a put-up job. 
"I remain faithful to my line," she thundered, encouraged by the PQ was "dishonest" basis and "their lack of hardness. 
She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologized. 
The model of the consortium is the world standard practice. 
It is usually a time such temporary alliance that allows two or more entities to pool their expertise regarding a bid on a tender for a complex project. 
The "East Main" has a high level of complexity with respect to his employment proportions. 
The construction process is underway and should be installed by 2012. 
However, the contract was awarded without a competition had to take place, it had already been negotiations. 
In addition, the model of the consortium is in Quebec even with relatively simple projects no longer an exception and 
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" last week noted that in the field of civil engineering and consulting model being used by the consortium subject of government investigations. 
A short flight over the Quebec business registry makes it possible to designate more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be of constant duration. 
In this way, for example, the firm Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its key competitors, which include CIMA +, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, or Roche and Tecsult together. 
Any link, and there are several dozen leads back to one and the same entity, namely, Dessau. 
What the consortium "Énergie gérance" is concerned, Minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territory of James Bay is subjected to a specific labor market dynamics and that Hydro-Québec, this fact since the 70's in a special way bill unpaid. 
Réal Laporte, the major employers of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that the nose can turn up on the fact that the contract was approved by the project management agreement. 
"If you make a call and there are few candidates, your prices will soar." 
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on the Mart and say to yourself. We will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price" 
"The idea is that not the price is decisive, but the expertise of the people," insisted Laporte. 
This, the consortium's Énergie gérance "approved contract is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 received from the Parti Québécois dollars. 
The contracts were either approved by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert. 
After reviewing counted the newspaper "Le Devoir" more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts, the firms or their subsidiaries, including, in particular resources, laboratories, were granted between 2002 and March 2010. 
SNC-Lavalin had gathered 22 contracts per se, Genivar had received 16, 14 and Dessau Tecsult 10, without whose participation in this counted "Énergie gérance. 
All these contracts have been negotiated. 
They amount to a total of $ 449,783,344, it included the contract with Energy gérance "of $ 295,131,564. 
Sylvain Simard had made it known that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe Axor and SM) are the "Parti du Québec Libéral well known. 
Minister Normandeau had had hinted, the PQ was similarly connected with the companies that they are "funded," specified before, that it was contrary to their executives.
