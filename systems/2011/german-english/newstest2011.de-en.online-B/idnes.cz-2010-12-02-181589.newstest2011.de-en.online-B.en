The army has so many fuses that you wrap the whole Czech Republic but you could keep only two years 
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers fuses are ignited with explosive devices. 
The year before, the Defense Department already 224 km fuse had delivered to the army camp. 
It is to know reassuring that the military has safe hands for 225 years. 
The only problem is the durability of the fuses - two and a maximum of four years. 
The Army bought the fuses of the corporation STV Group, as for a paltry 40 million kroner. 
In its reasoning for the purchase of this huge amount of general staff said fuse MF DNES, the soldiers would consume annually to the 60 kilometers fuse. 
According to research by the Armeepyrotechnikern, the MF DNES spoke out, it is clear from this statement that the army would have to annually complete a very intense pyrotechnic training - of all the generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaning ladies. 
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded. 
Only in this way the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers fuses could reasonably justify. 
This length corresponds to other 25,000 detonations. 
Even so, this army would be enough stock for more than ten years. 
But if there is the old rule by experts that are sufficient to train any new professional soldiers six feet fuse completely, then the army has carried these new acquisitions - has a calming stock for which - even in the light of the increased needs of the pioneer and specialist units mentioned 225 years created. 
It complained of the rapid reaction brigade soldiers recently at Defense Minister Vondra, they had almost no ammunition for small arms more so target practice the lack of resources are limited due to strong. 
That of the trouser to mention. 
"I will also not know why they buy from us such vast amounts fuses." 
But this is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need. " 
"For us, the army a good customer, we want to come largely as a seller should," says the sales manager of STV Group January Decky. 
Pejšek January, the Defense Ministry spokesman justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometers fuse so that the army would have just become a cover for at least ten years with this "ammunition." 
January Decky of the STV Group, however, speaks only of a four-year life of the fuses and police and army pyrotechnician even just two years. 
"With perfect storage are probably the four mentioned years possible," admits one of them that wants to remain anonymous, to avoid being a soldier accused of criticism of the army. 
After the expiry of the period of use any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and endangering the lives of soldiers. 
These tests are not free, but cost more money. 
Another argument of the Defence of the quantity discount for the 445 km fuse. 
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's supply of 244 kilometers," spokesman tells us Pejšek the position of the buyers of Defense. 
Just for comparison: liquidate The annual consumption of fuses of pyrotechnics to the police, the ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet army, brother, for some years barely exceeds 1,500 meters. 
And the police ordered only such amounts of ammunition they can use before the end of its life. 
Even the safety of pyrotechnics because, well, keep to themselves as open to the possibility of purchases of more modern flexible and thus more reliable fuses. 
The Defense Department already has huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, as the two hundred thousand-strong Czechoslovak People's Army in its campaign to the Rhine prepared. 
According to the pyrotechnicians, the MF DNES spoke to the Czech armed forces expected in a few years ago the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of miles of old fuses, it has today purchased "cheap."
