Puigcercós examined with a nod to the Carod loved ones peace in the ERC 
The Republican leaders allowed the party a secret vote on its continuance in office. 
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and before the end of the assembly principle. 
Puigcercós Joan seems to have found a recipe for the umpteenth time of internal turmoil within the ranks of directionless after the loss of 11 Deputies and half the votes ERC to go out of their way. 
The party chairman is aware that his threat of resignation is not the loved ones of the former party leader Josep Lluis Carod-Rovira is sufficient. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is now so weakened as her mentor themselves and not bring him the same headaches, as other former currents. 
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tried with a wink, the new critic to win, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections. 
For starters, announced yesterday that over 200 local council members could comment ERC secret about his remaining in office. 
With ballots, not a superior hand. 
If the Carodisten wanted to miss the Presidential those getting a ticket, they could do so without fear of reprisal. 
In fact, the boss wants both the impression of division as well as avoid the submission of his person. 
In several interviews, he reiterated that he would not feel vindicated with half the votes plus one, and he added, without specifying percentage values, a result "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good. 
Carod the Allies demand that the President more than just the party to make his office available. Insufficient gesture, as Puigcercós controlled the governing body of the Congress. 
But since they do not have a sufficient majority for promotion of resignations, they will agree with the Board a plan of action from now until May. 
But they expect in the drafting of the document on strategic reorientation that the line on 18 referred to the Council on the vote is to be able to participate. 
Their intention is to guarantee Puigcercós. In return, these promise to bring forward the Congress in the fall of 2011, which keeps the party leadership is already a fact. 
The leader of the ERC is of the opinion that "Polyphony" is detrimental to the stability and he seeks once and for all time to bring the organization in a position to wash their dirty laundry behind closed doors. 
In this sense, the item that the incumbent Consellers Josep Huguet wrote in his blog, symptomatic. 
Given the Puigcercós is an ideologue, was the owner of Innováció it for a fact that the party chairman was supported "in exchange for a number of goals." 
He counted five, of which there are two in the foreground. 
First, the "restructuring" of the Board so that it takes at least 90 percent of party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod environment. 
The second could be the big news. 
Huguet suggests ERC should give up the General Assembly as a principle operation at last. 
He championed a reform of the statutes that would allow it to hold the meetings with elected delegates. 
By the end of the assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós' team that struggled on their last two meetings for obsessed. 
In fact, was commissioned on the quaking Assembly of 2008, the party leadership with the review of the assembly principle to a conference that would deal with the reform of the statutes. 
This date is still pending because of internal infogle resting of the last years, the addressing of this matter was not advisable. 
Now, without the critical sectors lie in wait, could be the time came to reopen the matter and complete forever.
