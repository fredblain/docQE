The winning position in the "Small Businessman of the Year" Lukáš Pytloun have helped in the sale of the franchise of his hotel. 
Winner of last year of the competition "Small Businessman of the Year Award was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec. 
The story of his success seems like a film scenario. 
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel. 
Only abroad he realized that it is missing in Liberec in good accommodation at reasonable prices. 
From the savings of his holidays working abroad and using a bank loan, he bought a dilapidated house with five apartments. 
Considering that he was then a university student in the sixth semester, this was certainly a bold undertaking. 
"This angered then-price-quality ratio me so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun. 
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers. 
All profits are invested back into the house immediately, which he then rebuilt step by step to the pension with 54 beds. 
Since then, he succeeded in just seven years of doing business in Liberec four guest houses, to open two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds in all categories of accommodation. 
The most comfortable of them was, until recently, the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel." 
This year was added another first-class hotel. 
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tise, which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties on the franchise Pytloun hotels already reported," the entrepreneur says number one last year. 
"A large part of this license sales for the operation of the hotel had just won the contest" Entrepreneur of the year, "adds Mr. Pytloun added appreciatively. 
The victory has given him greater recognition, so popularity in Liberec and surroundings is introduced. 
"People recognize me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I must say, that did really well," he recalls. 
I definitely recommend it to all who want to create something to take part in this competition. 
You need to win not the same, each visualization is good. 
He says that he still made the contacts and friendships will take advantage, on which it would otherwise not come at all. 
"With some people I've met thanks to the competition, I think to this day regular business." 
The fame associated with the success reflected in his opinion a little down on each of its employees. 
And as he has in the seventies. 
"I notice them at greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something, the universal recognition it deserves." 
I see this is indeed not only as a personal success, no, that is the result of good work by all of us. " 
"My name is just something brought to the fore," says Lukáš Pytloun modest.
