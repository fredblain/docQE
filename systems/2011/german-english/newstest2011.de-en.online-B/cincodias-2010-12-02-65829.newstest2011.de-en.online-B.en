Sabadell wants to 'steal' his rivals in three years, a million customers 
The Executive Board Member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis, and predicted the end of the war debt. 
Nevertheless, he predicts a fall in interest margins, the banks try to offset the increases in fees and rates for loans. 
Sabadell expects to capture in three years, a million retail customers - even to an existing subject. 
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years, and so to survive in a very difficult economic environment. 
The bank will introduce new Dreijahresleitplan 2011. 
The goal is to not only survive, without taking the public funds from the FROB claim, but also the market share of around one million residential customers - 700 000 if you subtract the customers who will lose the bank - to zoom. This is the great challenge facing the bank is, because until now she has devoted more attention to its business customers as their retail customers. 
This year it has added 000 private customers will receive 250 and 50 000 enterprises. 
Its market share in retail is 3.5 percent, while business customers make up more than 10 percent. 
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is to increase productivity, meaning austerity, cost reduction. The challenges faced by the bank that is, they think along with annual report. 
Only a few banks to venture into these difficult times, set targets and publish, as the world financial crisis, all plans of the banks are confused. 
Sabadell will complete this year its master plan set out four years ago, Optima. This was initially for three years, but due to the market situation, he was extended for one year. 
The customers who are leaving are the savings banks, the main objective of the bank. 
At a breakfast organized by Apie said Guardiola, 2011 would be a "difficult" year "long range." 
The manager believes Spain could only "slowly" out of the crisis. 
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to create "work" in two or three years - crucial to the survival of banks. 
Although it assumes that war to liabilities - will abate, the risk premiums that banks and savings banks for their emissions to obtain pay by cash, as passed to compensate for shrinking profit margins on already, the price for loans - the interest rate margins punished . 
"The issues of capital and financing of a structural nature and they will put pressure on the loans." 
"We do not have the tap turned off, but the interest differentials are very high," admitted Guardiola. 
Banesto was already on Thursday from the arrangement of its branch network to restrict the granting of long-term loans and to increase the interest rate differentials (see, Cinco DÃ­as of 22 and 27 November). 
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently Stategie, "the fee increase," but "within a competitive framework." 
Sabadell's master plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as always, excludes non-corporate businesses. 
Not for nothing, he assured that in Spain, "larger firms are necessary." 
"Next year will change everything," he says. 
He stressed that the need for capital is currently "enormous increase" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will slide into the red. 
He believes the FROB Kaptitalaufstockungen could replace the money market. 
After being assured that Sabadell could survive even a temporary closure of the markets, he refuted the argument of some bankers who already predicting a new liquidity crisis. 
He points out "you get nothing in circulation, but in contrast to the incidents in June, could be achieved short-term financing through repurchase agreements, and thus intercept the crisis.
