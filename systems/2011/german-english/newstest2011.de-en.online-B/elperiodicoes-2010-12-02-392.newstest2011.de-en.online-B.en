Interpol issues a red alert to track and locate Assange. 
Everything connected with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forming a complicated labyrinth, allowing it to clear up the facts is difficult. 
Interpol yesterday gave a "red alert" from the "tracking and tracing" of Assange. 
However, these are not a traditional arrangement of the arrest. 
It is also not new, it dates from 20 November. 
It has nothing to do with the final revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the U.S., but rather with the sexual abuse allegations, which the Australians were raised in Sweden.

The action outraged Assange lawyers released yesterday a letter in which she informed you that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is willing to answer questions via video conference, the Swedish authorities. 
They also recall that Assange requested departure from Sweden and from the prosecutor, with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's security chief, is compared, the authorization was given. 
"It's like a fighter, not as a prosecution," is accused in the letter. 
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia protested the innocence of her son - has Assange to an unknown place, but not in silence. 
On Monday, he was the director of Time magazine on Skype from an unspecified place in an interview. In the interview, he requested the resignation of the Secretary of the United States, Hillary Clinton. 
"If it can be shown that she was responsible for the arrangement of North American diplomats of spying on the UN and thus to international agreements signed by the United States has failed should withdraw them," he said. 
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd." 
"I'm not sure why we should attach importance to the views of a type with a website," he told the CNN. 
Obama himself has engaged a high charge of the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, with the prevention of new documents reveal. 
The attempt by the speaker of the presidents, Barack Obama, Assange to pay less attention is to announce, in contrast to the opinions, the conservative politicians and commentators in those days. 
Congressman Peter King, who will lead from January to chair the National Sicherheitskommitee the House of Representatives, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of Wikileaks to add to the list of terrorist organizations, "to impound the money and anyone who supports or contributes to pursue. " 
Tom Flanagan, Advisor to the Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had his statement, Assange must be "murdered" revoked. 
"Obama would turn him into a target and not use a manned aircraft or something." 
Who does not apologized, was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate. 
"Who ever was the leaked information in the government, he is guilty of treason and all that is no execution, is too mild a punishment egg con," he told the Fox.
