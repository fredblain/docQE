Hell, soldier! 
Fits to splatter art cinema? 
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores new fighters from his epic "Valhalla Rising" old genre boundaries. 
To which audience likes the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought, as he has "Valhalla Rising" filmed? 
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is freed from his tormentors and places with almost superhuman powers rows of his opponents to - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, just because our hero like rabid killing methods served and its enemies ever tear the guts out of the living body, if he's in a bad mood. 
On the other hand, One-Eye says, as he is known in fact, the whole movie about nothing, and the other figures can be at most times to one or two sentences or carried away a few agonizing death cries. 
Otherwise, silence and the creepy beautiful hills of Scotland reveled that offers the Viking world of a millennium ago the backdrop. 
Ideal for more adult film buffs with an interest in existentialism and quiet camera movements. 
Nice if a movie has multiple audiences pity, only if they are mutually exclusive. 
Director Winding Refn, since its wild and drug dealer-styled trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino refuses, but stoic, make his work accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor or a little less brutal to the Arthouse. 
Most art Cinema fans should feel let down by splashing around the brain or the intestines. 
The latest action fans will die of boredom when One-Eye breaks free from interpretable reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries by ship to Jerusalem and is stuck forever in doldrums and fog before the team appeared to arrive in America and continue still. 
No wonder then, that has "Valhalla Rising" in Germany found a movie rental and is now available only on DVD. 
This is especially for the fabulous pictures a shame, but also because it is hidden behind the pretentious facade to a sometimes bloody exciting piece of cinema that deserves attention. 
This film is not about dialogue or a compelling plot, it's all atmosphere, a film had become a fever dream. 
And from which there is no escape for the audience. 
Refn begrudge him hardly a moment of relaxation and strangled him with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack very slowly to the throat, especially with the incredible hatred that proposes to meet him in the heart of the figures. 
Only a small blond boy, One-Eye is the loyal support of preserves such a thing as innocence, all others are driven by anger. 
Most of all, the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but the enemies and allies temporarily at some point the warriors from hell, might as Ambassador of the Devil itself 
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the already spoiled. 
"Valhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that one can admire and hate, to the annoyance, excitement and wonder. 
An experience.
