The owners of the center in Olot do not rule out that her nurse killed eleven elderly 
The leaders of the nursing home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) announced yesterday a press conference in which it turned out, the damage the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmen - the nurse who had killed during his work at least eleven elderly, for which he was responsible - was added to the device. 
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, entered, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Ca√±ada, in court and announced, "La Caritat would prosecute those responsible (for deaths)," but "the right and our liability to force us to the process and civil liability "to accept. 
The device must accept not only a loss of prestige in society, because it's criminal actions of the nurse had not found in time, but now paying a high amount of compensation that is used by the legal representatives of the families of the victims charged. 
Joan Vila Dilmen admitted that the first crime goes back to August 2009 and that he had killed since then. 
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - at, since he suspected that no doctor had examined the deceased person, but the formalities due to their age and illness were conducted by telephone. 
The director of La Caritat flatly denied this point and stated that "lack of action could be keinerzeit been the reason for the incidents." 
The lawyer of La Caritat added that it "would in the case of no evidence for negligent actions of another person as the accused." 
The already confessed as "Angel of Death" baptized the day before eleven deaths and said that the first crime, 29 August 2009 and have committed a half months later, murdered the second old lady. 
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of different sedatives. 
The director of La Caritat said, the access of staff to the drugs was difficult to control. 
Insulin syringes and the sedative cocktail was one of the nurses in six of nine crimes committed in order to free the patient with the death of their suffering. 
But highlighting the results of laboratory investigations will Vila lies and for his first victim actually chose a less cruel death, or whether or not this from inside burned by them bleach administered, as he had done, according to confessions of three women he between 12 and 17 October murdered. 
In La Caritat gives you the testimony of the keeper no faith, not even as regards the number of seasoned murder, which could well be more. This setting is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it made no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders. 
They say they stood on that basis and to clarify the scope of these incidents the judiciary available.
