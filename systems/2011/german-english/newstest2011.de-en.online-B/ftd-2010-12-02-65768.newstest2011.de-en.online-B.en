Ogoniland is burned 
The water in the rivers of oil is brown, it smells like at the pump: billion gallons of spilled crude oil have destroyed the nature of the Nigerian Ogoniland. 
People live by theft, corruption and illegal oil boiling. 
Celestine Akpobari means well. 
"Do not be plagued from" calms the Ökoaktivist the journalists: "You will now get enough oil sludge from the lens." 
The 37-year-old Nigerian has been following the attempt to scan a wading chest-deep in water boy with the surrounding streaks: In the rainbow sheen of water, the scene looks almost pretty. 
The fact that hover beneath the surface of brown oil fumes is not visible. 
They used to have here collected buckets of shrimp, Esther badomen told on the shores of Bodo-Jetty River. 
Meanwhile, the slow-flowing water was completely dead 
Five years ago, poured from a ruptured pipeline tons crude oil in the vast wetland. 
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo have to row now six hours to get into fish-containing waters: in the heart of the Niger Delta located Ogoniland is one of the worst polluted regions in the world. 
On the way through the criss-crossed by rivers, mangrove swamps, the full extent of the devastation is apparent. 
Instead of bright water stirs the motorboat on brown stock, who dips his hand into the water, pulls out oily fingers. 
The roots of the mangrove trees extend like black licorice sticks from the ground, sad to hang occasionally encountered their palm fronds. 
Flocks of birds, as they are in wetlands usually the case, one searches in vain: when the outboard motor is silent, is spreading like a gas station in the former paradise smelling of eerie silence. 
"What happened here is ecological warfare," Celestine Akpobari says gloomily: "We live in constant danger to health." 
The war comparison is appropriate. 
The settlement area of ​​the Ogoni is fought for decades battlefield: Here penetrated more than 60 years, the first Explorateur from Europe, here was organized in the 80's with the later executed author Ken Saro-Wiwa, the first resistor, in this case had the shell Group in 1993 to close its production because it was too dangerous for the oil workers. 
Even today, the company refused to return to Ogoniland: While three times from the entire Delta region the size of Switzerland with over 5000 Bohrquellen and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines every day more than two million barrels of black gold pumping, are the oil fields fallow in Ogoniland to the group is unstable the situation. 
Every few hundred yards rise steel frames and bizarre sculptures out of the water: "Christmas tree" the heads of the drill holes are called much too affectionate. 
They are up to 50 years, most corroded to the core. 
Again and again, cracking up such a drill head, said Akpobari, then trough a constant stream of crude oil into the water. 
More than two billion gallons have flowed according to expert estimates, in 50 years the ecosystem of the Delta: Year after year, the amount of oil as it urged the sinking of the supertanker Exxon Valdez 21 years ago in the sea off Alaska - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of mankind. 
Who is to blame for the continuing eco-case scenario, it is argued. 
While the Shell Group makes sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution responsible environmentalists see bursting drill heads and leaking pipelines as the main cause. 
Shell Nigeria put in much lower safety standards, as is usual in the world, accused the U.S. scientists Richard Steiner of the Group 2008: Only the rate of defects in the lines was "higher by far than anywhere else." 
In a place that looks remotely like an abandoned oil-stained garage under the open sky, emerge from the mangroves figures: they are naked and smeared with oil up to the neck. 
Among one of the many barrels, partly connected with tubes, some identify scattered randomly on the site, flickering fire: an illegal small refinery. 
In the barrel, crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, said Michael, director of the group. 
First, gasoline comes through the pipes into the collection cup, and later drips at the end of the line out and finally diesel fuel. 
Michael and four staff to produce it every day up to four barrels of 300 liters of diesel, "This brings us 34 000 naira - about 22 dollars. 
The delta residents use the chronic fuel shortages in the country's largest oil-Saharan Africa. 
Nigeria has only one refinery. 
The can with just under 40 euro cents per liter diesel ridiculously low price to undercut the illegal boiler still, because they get their raw material free. 
He is from "bunkers" that tap into the network of pipelines across Ogoniland: In this way the country are daily, according to experts in the entire Niger Delta at least 16 million gallons of crude oil lost. 
Only a tiny proportion of the raw material is stored temporarily between refined but illegal: the lion's share of fill organized criminal networks that will include high-ranking politicians and military, its will in tankers and him on the world market. 
The debate about whether the disaster is due rather to the machinations of the population or lax mode of production, the activist Akpobari holds for purely academic. 
"If the oil companies, not perceived as intruders and they would have destroyed the livelihood of the fishermen not so thoroughly, it would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries." 
Meanwhile, is the ratio of the Ogoni especially Shell but destroyed so that only a subtraction of the group would qualify, "Maybe yes imagine other nationalities like the Chinese out to be better." 
Since Michael is nervous. 
"Maximum time that you disappear," said the muscular man oil. 
"Every minute you can bring the soldiers." 
If the illegal oil refiners caught by the special unit of the armed forces, although they face no arrests, but a painful bribe. 
The mainly coming from the north country soldiers do - like all Nigerians - benefit from the raw material. 
"This damn stuff has placed our country in every respect to the dogs," says Akpobari.
