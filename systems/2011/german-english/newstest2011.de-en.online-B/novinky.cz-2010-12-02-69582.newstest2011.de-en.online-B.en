Czech children get drunk with rum, beer and Fernet out - it just seems too slow 
Fernet, rum and vodka, in exceptional cases even a good whiskey, one has stolen his father from the house bar. 
These are the drinks must be drunk after eating notbehandelt Czech teenagers under fifteen most frequently. 
No exceptions are children who have repeated their cat sleep in the hospital. 
This is evident from the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the recording of the Children's wards in hospitals. 
"Beer and wine are completely out of fashion because it simply takes too long until you're drunk." 
"Today's trend is clear hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikan, the head physician of the Children's Department in the Central Bohemian Hořovice clinic. 
"Whiskey, if it is possible to steal a bottle from the Father of the bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka. 
"Vodka can have the advantage that you mix it with juice, then he does not smell as strong," said the chief doctor. 
is the speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová him right. 
"Most often it is about Fernet or rum" 
"This is the current trend of alcohol, especially in primary schools." 
"Occasionally it was also about plum brandy, which can take one of the home," led to Mrs. Jurinová. 
According to Chief Medical Pelikán thirteen-or fourteen-year-old drinkers in the long hospitalization are no exception. 
Before the clinic in Hořovice, where he has been working this year, he spent ten years in the Paediatric Department of the Motol hospital where the ambulance drunken students from near and far delivered should. 
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times." 
"She started her career with 12 years ago when it was first with 3.5 per mille alcohol in the blood and more, in combination with the" "was taken" ecstasy, the physician described a very serious case. 
"She was in the exhibition area in Holesovice on any dance party." 
"The interesting thing was that her mother never seemed strange that her daughter came home 48 hours," marvels the chief doctor. 
Especially the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance for bumping with their own offspring is one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism in children. 
A real function in the true sense of the word experts say it's not in children. 
"In many years of chronic alcoholism addiction is to understand the alcohol, together with all related phenomena and this is not the case with these kids." 
For those who enjoy alcohol again, mostly a negative family-social background characteristic, "said chief doctor Pelikán. 
The Speaker of the Motol hospital, according to Mrs. Jurinová, were sent to mid-November about forty drunken children in the local Department of Child and Adolescent Medicine. 
However, only the cases with severe alcohol poisoning, which made hospitalization necessary shall be reflected in the statistics. 
Drunken children who are brought to outpatient treatment by the parents or, where appropriate, by the police back home are not registered. 
In addition to the cases where children drink just so a bottle of liquor in the school there in the opinion of Mr. Pelikán three seasonal amplitudes, which absolutely rely on is: Walpurgis Night, New Year and the end of school year. 
"The latter two reasons - either out of grief because of the bad product or joy to the holidays." 
"In the Walpurgis Night I have experienced too drunk for seven children at one time in the recording," says Dr. Pelikan. 
A drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision, is paradoxically better off as a child who has to fight the next day with a nasty hangover. 
The headache the morning after that result from dehydration and lack of glucose, you can sell that is in the hospital with a liquid-giving infusion of glucose and nutrients that are missing from the organism. 
"They are clearly better off, because after the" glorious "experience at night, they wake up in a good mood without something hurting somewhere." 
"They're just a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. A pelican, taking the patient by at least sometimes spoil the good mood by giving them lists the costs they will cost treatment. 
For the transport by ambulance and the night come good in an acute bed and like a few tens of thousands of crowns. 
"Every now and again I have used it as a means of education, if I had put paid directly to the children at the visit, which cost her drunkenness, and that it can happen that they sometimes work the whole vacation on need, the money for a single to make such a party, "added Dr. Pelikan. 
He believes that the health insurance companies do not intend to recourse procedures, the demand for the healing of drunken children necessary costs of the parents.
