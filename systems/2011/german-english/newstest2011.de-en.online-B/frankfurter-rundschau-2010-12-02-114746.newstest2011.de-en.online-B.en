The Trace of Stones 
Uli Gsell has also concerned that, in total about 400 pounds. 
On Monday evening he was standing in front of the Stuttgart train station, the tuba on his back. 
It was demo. 
It was snowing. 
The story is known: In September, the diggers moved in and began to break off a large chunk of the north wing. 
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrating against S21, the billion-dollar lowering of the station. 
When it came to stop the building, a large part of the wing was in ruins. 
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces. 
Crailsheimer coquina, a soft coarse stone, built 1914-1920. 
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old. 
He has secured some of the chunks. 
"These stones are relics." 
"You can not disappear." 
He says: "A cheap and poor stone, earth and easy way." 
When he aufsägte one and got the smell of cigarette smoke. 
What will he do with the scraps, he does not know yet. 
Stones have time. 
Uli also Gsell. 
The trail of Stuttgart stones into a forest near Tübingen in a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone-kingdom. 
The 44-year-old is with stones. 
He bought all that were incurred during the demolition in Stuttgart. 
"It would be a shame, they would ground into gravel or disappear in the landfill," he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen, which was once a guard house. 
Insulted and threatened to have him, he says, than in September was in the newspapers that he the remains of the north wing was bought by the demolition contractor. 
But he has talked with the S-21 opponents, for days. 
And he has told them that he could do nothing now but for the demolition. 
And what if it happened once, it was still the most sensible, if the stones were reused. 
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of an average of 80-pound blocks with, unit price from 6.50 to 14 €. 
As a souvenir, but some also in the hope of being able to return it for a reconstruction. 
Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 large truckloads. 
About half stored in the forest, the rest is long since sold. 
Gardeners, landscapers, homeowners. 
From everywhere they came and were dragged off, which could carry luggage and trailers. 
The Stuttgart stumbling blocks have long since turned into "Mäuerle" or limitations of herb beds. 
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," said Rongen. 
"Would not the political component." 
He gets in his SUV, making a tour through his 20-acre kingdom. 
He studied law and canceled later biology, he was interested in computers and eventually become stone dealer. 
And stone lovers. 
40,000 tons of stones he stores. 
From all over Germany, he carts his treasures together. 
He says he was the greatest Altsteinhändler of the Republic. 
He slowed down. 
In the snow are artfully carved sandstone. 
"They were once at Dresdner Marie Bridge," he says. 
Elbe, yellow, warm, he says. 
"My favorite stone." 
There goes the way up through the forest. 
He points to a heap: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe train station. 
And again. 
"Beautiful travertine." 
Once the blocks were part of the grandstand of the Neckar Stadium. 
Everywhere in the snow bricks and stories, Cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the Cathedral Saint Blaise, tuff from Heilbronn hospital. 
What work, what effort, what sweat. 
If Rongen think about how the stones were once carved by hand and controlled by simple pulleys and ox carts, it is quite awesome. 
"It would be a scandal if we were to shred something." 
Rich he did not become filthy rich even less. 
But 14 people of the stone traders employed today, have also settled in the forest at the top of stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a horticulturalist. 
"We work hard, but it is satisfying," says the remaining brokers. 
Soon he has to Cologne. 
Also there will be saved stones.
