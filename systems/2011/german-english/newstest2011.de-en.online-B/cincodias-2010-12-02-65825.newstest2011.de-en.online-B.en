Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens 
The cars will be improved with a software in real time. 
Since Red Bull in 2004 invaded the world of Formula 1, their history in this fine world of speed of surprises and successes, is marked. 
At first no one gave attention to the newcomer, and despite its steep rising career during the past few seasons set last November at the final sprint to win all of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso. 
reduce Without the capabilities of the German pilot and World champion Sebastien Vettel, or the performance of the engine from Renault to do is the "secret weapon" that the multi-Siemens Red Bull put in his hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend. 
In reality, is a powerful software for the simulation of processes that the German company in 2007 for purposes that have nothing to do with car racing, brought to market. 
This called PLM computer science program was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments. 
The aim is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built in order to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs. 
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras from Canon, the Sukhoi aircraft and the most famous vehicles from Nissan. 
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, said that with the use of this software in Formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes and improvements that are observed on the race and the tests can design and execute. 
Russwurm points out that in 1992 worked in the racing teams, an average of ten technicians who were able to introduce in a season at most three or four improvements. 
In Red Bulls team today 180 highly qualified young people are employed. With powerful computer systems analysis, and they do all sorts of changes to the cars through. 
The Siemens manager, said that the PLM software is able to analyze all components of the cars of Red Bull and to improve, with the exception of the engine, the Renault explained solely responsible. 
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed. 
The changes due to advanced manufacturing and high-tech autoclaves in less than 24 hours of television in the reality of the virtual reality of the simulator. 
The only limit to this crazy technical perfectionism is set, the 40 million dollars, a Formula 1 - may issue for his race team in a season. 
Red Bull has built up its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its cars in a remote location 50 kilometers from London. 
There are two buildings that out - are very limited - especially from journalists. 
Everything that happens there is Top Secret. 
The staff includes 580 people, including two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber. 
But Red Bulls true Formula 1 - Held without a doubt is the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell. 
Behind the enormous technological resources, which makes the energy drink manufacturer in the service of his participation on the race tracks, hide other protagonists, whose invaluable support and their reputation is zero. 
The Technologichef of the work, Steve Nevey stressed that it was five years ago could still say that the progress in R & D for race cars, 50 percent contributed to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest. 
Today, the share values ​​have changed. The technology makes 85 percent of success, while the contribution of the pilot is estimated at 15 percent. 
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computers, because they "are not predictable gladiators.
