A longer index finger than ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer 
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously exposed to a lower risk of developing prostate cancer. 
That's the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer. 
This is intended to relate to the levels of the male hormone testosterone. 
"Our results show that the relative length of fingers can be used as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and this in particular to sixty men," said co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick. 
The finger could help to determine the case, what men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially when genetic risks or other risk factors are present, such as family health problems, she added Eeles. 
In the period 1994-2009 she followed with their counterparts in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3000 healthy men. 
In more than half of the participants in the study of the index finger of right hand was shorter than the ring finger. 
For these men was the same probability of prostate cancer, as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were of equal length. 
In men, the index finger was longer than the ring finger, but this risk was reduced by 33 percent, or sixty men as much as 87 percent. 
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned that form already in the prenatal age reflects clearly the different levels of sex hormones, which the child was exposed in the womb. 
Less testosterone equivalent to a longer index finger. 
Previous research showed that just accelerates the testosterone, growth of prostate cancer. 
Václav Pačes, a leading geneticist and former president of the Czech Academy of Sciences told CTK, bowing to him that this study, yet he considered the relationship between finger length and cancer risk has not been for "proved completely.
