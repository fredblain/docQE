Popular Party won four seats in Congress to PSC and lost 9 
With the results of 28 November could play the PP in the cities of Lerida, Tarragona and Barcelona a crucial role 
After the major cast members and growth in the recent local elections the PP directed her eyes already on the parliamentary elections - anticipated or not. Their expectations are more positive, because the number of votes, the party achieved this in this election, is usually twice as high as that in the elections in Catalonia. 
Thus the Catalan Popular Party won 610 473 votes in the parliamentary elections of 2008, while this number in the regional elections in 2006 only amounted to 316 222. 
On the last Sunday scored the PPC 384 091 votes. 
If this upward trend - the result of diversion of the voting shares of PSC and the binding of the electorate of the PP - should continue, predict the analysts of the PP, that could rise in the parliamentary elections, the PPC of 8 to 12 members of Congress, while also CiU four (she has now 10 to win) and lose the PSC at least 9 members (of 25) would. 
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE. 
According to the analysis of the Popular Party, the ERC would lose one representative - currently she has three - while ICV could keep their members or to win. 
If the election calendar are maintained, the next date coincides with the local elections in May 2011. Even then, the Popular Party (PP) may be the tongue of the scale in order to put the socialist hegemony to an end, and in fact, four provincial capitals and with the majority on the city council of Barcelona, ​​one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011 . 
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC can access the cities of Barcelona, ​​Tarragona, Lerida and Gerona in which the Socialists with a majority either to achieve even its traditional allies (ERC and ICV) will lose. 
After the Republican debacle, it is not unreasonable that the party lost its representation in the municipal council of Barcelona, ​​in which they would achieve 5% of the vote is. 
The PP, however recorded an increase in their voting participation in the four provincial capitals and could be the decisive force in Barcelona, ​​Lleida and Tarragona. 
The nationalists are convinced that we can play the main role in Tarragona change. There they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP. 
En Lleida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign met them several times. 
In other important places, such as in Badalona, ​​Castelldefels or Reus The People's Party observed a significant increase. 
Currently, the PP in 34 municipalities of Catalonia and seeks the creation of lists in as many places as possible.
