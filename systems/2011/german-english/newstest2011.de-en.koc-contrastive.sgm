<seg id="1"> What can you do to the ČSSD? the Czech social democrats in Prague are not aware of voldemort, nor the "konditorei." </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new ratsherren of capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously certain language barriers must be overcome their alt-neuen colleagues from the Czech ODS in Prague Council and in the stadtvertretung understand at all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The newspaper aktuálně.cz, members of the new Council from the ČSSD time a little "abgeklopft ', as they dominate the notorious slang, which in recent years has established, in which the current coalition partners in Prague at the helm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The codierte vocabulary, which in the long era of mayor Pavel bém of the Prague political elite has been introduced, is some of the best-known actors, situations and borrowed causae. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Surprisingly, showed that the new councils in relation to these new notions of somewhat in the dark. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The claim they at least. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "who is voldemort?" </seg>
<seg id="8"> "No idea." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am more a newcomer in the Prague policy," responded Lukáš kaucký, of the new town councillor from on culture, on the test of the "paten-wortschatzes." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But also the town councillor from Karel Březina - a political veteran, responded in a similar way. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example, at the term "golfloch." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "This is the only expression of which they are submitting me, which I am now and again." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "otherwise, I believe that not much often infiltrated by slang." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> From the vocabulary of the aktuálně.cz tageblatt, in June this year before the electoral congress of the ODS, the editorial was published pickte six words, especially those that are notoriously with the Prague magistrate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Social Democrats should the concepts of 'voldemort,' 'biggest Prague golfloch, "" in the konditorei go', "stiernacken," the capital of "betrayal" and "verblechen define." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Three of the Prague ratsherren agreed to the test, the fourth - Mr weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - first promised his participation in the conversation, but not even the listeners. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The fifth, town councillor from Petr dolínek, rejected the test. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "These are things I do and as the Civic Democrats talk about each other, I passed." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "for me, it is important, as we understand, within the framework of our programs," he countered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> As already indicated, would have Lukáš kaucký in the aforementioned headline allegedly failed to understand that the influential businessman and friend of the ex-oberbürgermeisters bém, Roman janoušek. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The term "voldemort" says kaucky absolutely nothing and the only one he had on the test erriet correctly, was "the greatest Prague golfloch." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "This is the tunnel blanka," says kaucký, added to safety but still added: "But I know this from the newspaper instead." </seg>
<seg id="23"> And jokingly: "I will be a sprachkurs must show." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The "golfloch" will then not just of matador Karel Březina, but also from the town councillor for the environment Lukáš plachý right as blanka entziffert tunnel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Both Democrats also know, however, for whom the term voldemort and Lukáš plachý senses even where this figure is to find and also what it means, "in the konditorei to go." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "I believe that that is, in any company in Prague to go," plachý is pretty close to solving the conundrum hit, when we know that it is the seat of janoušeks firms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> In keeping with Březina, he asserted, but rather this knowledge from the newspaper to have drawn, as this would embrace that language. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The testteilnehmern, judging by the Social Democrats, in fact, it seems no similar slang habit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I have asked my colleagues, but obviously there is something we really not." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "We call upon us in the name of, and again we use also acronym or nickname of," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr hulínský - by his own party who put "hulda." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "at school I was bříza (birch), but I do not know whether to call my colleagues too," Karel Březina tells us his nickname. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The newspaper deník aktuálně.cz has pioneered the names and lo and behold, it works. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Town councillor from weinert is for the party of "friendly" OPA or less friendly to the "old," the representative, Miroslav poche, before the elections, with operations in the partei-sponsoring on, will be made by some colleagues' igráček " (well-known Czech lego-figur). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Nicknames are so the only thing that the Social Democrats in the intra-party vocabulary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> It may not hulínský allegedly, if it is "hulda ', but deník aktuálně.cz registered yet another moniker of Prague chairman. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> His spitzname 'doctor who allegedly gummiknüppel-rechte "has to do with the fact that Petr hulínský his juris doctor title to the bratislaver police academy has acquired. </seg>

<seg id="11"> The House in the eixample quarter batlló on a busy shopping road passeig de grácia no 43 was created by the renovation of a house from the years of 1877, the architects Emilio sala cortese said. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but in the end, he agreed to the idea of gaudís on an unusual and even cheaper to reconstruction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The mietshaus Casa batlló Antoni Gaudí noted, however, is not alone. </seg>
<seg id="15"> He was working with the architect Josep Maria jujol together. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Not the tollste bettrahmen, but the quality of the liegefläche - mattress and rost make the good bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> These must, however, harmony, in order to supplement the wishes of the specific user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In selecting the many things to play a role - the weight, the size of the state of health and, last but not least, the gender of the schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Just as important is the interieur where mattress and subordinate rost. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a wochenendhaus, in which no heated on a regular basis, latexmatratzen are not well suited to much longer because they need in order to "warm." </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethan-matratzen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And, they should be turned on a regular basis. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If it is not enough entlüftungskanälchen in the core and have yet to have a solid record, staut humidity in itself: it is not therefore ruled that under their mould will. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the election, of course, also plays a role, to which it is used. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Those long periods of time was abroad, where very high with mattresses weichschicht fare, will be difficult to a low mattress with hard surface can get. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "probably all hockey players, who are stuck in the NHL, have complained to me that they are no longer able to sleep properly." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "for their abgeschundenen shoulders, heels and hüften they need just a weichschicht from visco-schaum (memory foam, a formgedächtnis-polymer)." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "This, I recommend including diabetic people under a disorder of the nervous system, so that they are suffering from the" information "from the gelenken and the skin can receive bad," said hadamcziková Sylva, which specializes in polstermöbel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> That is why I have many years ago eishockeyspielern, but also other customers these mattresses with visco-schaum (memory foam) concerned. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Today, this is no longer a problem, since such mattresses provide the tempur among manufacturers, the Italian company magniflex or the Czech manufacturer tropico." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And one need not be a famous hockey players for the benefits of the visco-schaums learn to appreciate. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" actually works quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The foam optimalisiert his toughness and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, he is schmiegt on warm body. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Nowhere is there, in the middle of the night shifts we are not as around after a major battle. </seg>
<seg id="22"> You simply sleep much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The viskoelastische foam also offers protection against dekubitus (gangrene). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The election of the matratzengröße you should still be at the height of the length of the fußsohlen add is approximately 21 to 34 cm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> As Mrs Mann, of the 180 cm in size, need as a 210 to 220 cm long bed. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Each of the schläfer ought to be at least 90 cm liegebreite available, so together 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In einzelbetten, for example in singles, are 120 to 140 cm. </seg>
<seg id="28"> For the comfort and also for any visitors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise, the following rule of thumb for the ideal bettbreite: "If you take on the backs of lies, should have enough room for the easy angewinkelten poor," ing advises. Prokopová Helena, the zunftmeisterin the polsterer and raumausstatter, which has for many years the issue of common sense and makes the ergonomics of furniture is dedicated to this issue and at university. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> In a doppelbett everyone needs a home and his own mattress, but be careful when buying products, so that the mattresses are too high. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise there is nothing, as the roste variations in assembling and that is not in any bettrahmen possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with federskelett 15 cm, ought to be at least three centimetres in the formschicht and the feinpolster alone. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "with the hand or sit down, we must in any case, feel the feathers," warns prokopová Helena. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Each mattress makes a special rosttyp needed. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Ganzgepolsterte beds with bed and document as zusammengewachsene siamzwillinge have nothing to look in the bedroom. </seg>
<seg id="36"> These mattresses are not to reveal the terms and you cannot wash today, which already is. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And because you are in a single night between 0.2% to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years to a huge (and congested sieve). </seg>
<seg id="38"> This is also why reject werbeslogans specialists, the mattresses in a lifespan of up to 25 years, and yes even lifelong guarantee promises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Every cause has its if and buts. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And it is therefore a practical advice from dealers: mattresses of 120 or 140 cm wide should the hygiene of the waschbaren, abziehbaren remuneration should not be afraid, however, it is recommended that a matratzenschoner, you have to leave and can easily wash. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even if today, in the rule matratzenbezüge with rundumreißverschluss produced after the open, so that you get two halves (immensely important for the waschvorgang and the waschmaschinengröße!), looks the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially just pointed out, often as the unequal battle between David and Goliath. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> Have you in bed instead of a rostes a fixed panel? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Out with it. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or a maximum for a bed for undesirable guests and for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Even so, you should be preferred to the plate with lüftungslöchern oversight (if not in there already are) and mattresses with federskelett and 15 cm floor with so-called taschenfederkern and feinpolster use. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethan-matratzen belong on such a document is not. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For not verstellbare lattenroste with 14 to 18 federleisten (lamellen) are latex- or sandwichmatratzen suited (possibly even combinations of latex and kokos), always figures are roste with a larger lattenanzahl, 28 and more federleisten from, with lordosenstütze in lendenwirbelbereich and the possibility of the lattenhärte to regulate. </seg>
<seg id="48"> On verstellbare lamellenroste include no mattresses with federskelett, since they are not on the ergonomische verstellung respond. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> In addition to the suspension of the stiff the federleisten will also be special flexible schultermodule. </seg>
<seg id="50"> There is a specific integration of the federleisten, enabling the federleisten einzudrücken or even to verwinkeln, that it is the odd einsinken the shoulder of the schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Especially for men with broad shoulders of an important matter. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There are even matratzenhersteller have started, "herrenmatratzen" weichzonen for the schulterbereich to use. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Also in the ladies is - you guessed it takes these weichzonen in the hüftgegend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For ambitious customers are punktelastische flügelfedersysteme (lattoflex) or roste with punktelastischen kontakt-pads with so-called multitorsionsfederung. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure will be distributed at several points, and thereby reduce the tension. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But, if you are on the right mattress and right rost a bad (too big and fülliges) kopfkissen, used to go to most of the gains will be lost. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Here too, a rule of thumb: the kopfkissen is the head, his tips should only up to the shoulders of rich, so that the schultermuskeln can relax. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Ideal is therefore a 50 X 60 cm great cushion, as it may, for example, the Scandinavians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In the seitenlage should be the kopfkissen (along with the schulterentlastungszone rost or in the weichzone in the bed of the schulterhöhe). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Rather, our modern mattresses, with the former (with hay festive) strohsäcken but in common. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern manufacturers increasingly use natural materials, or at least their mixtures. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Also in the new magic formula mattresses "organic." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of erdölrohstoffen we used for the manufacture of polyurethanschäumen frequent naturelle oils - for example, rizinus- and soya oil. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soya is known to be used by all manufacturers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> "organic is, in other words, the mattresses at its heart from materials purely natural origin, there is," said Petr vašíček by the firm tropico plus. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Naturstoffe but they are also used in the manufacture of matratzenbezügen - one of the first was aloe Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We can but also mikrokapseln, sleep in the fresh woodland or lavendelduft. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Here too there is a difference between a man and a woman. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While the men a "kühlender" pflanzenextrakt from birkenblättern used so that the matratzenbezug absorb the heat and cool the body can have the salary for women "wärmende" effect. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Extracts from red paprikaschoten rain in the blood, the weaker sex will sleep in the wohlig warm words. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> And the current favorites? </seg>
<seg id="72"> Mattresses from kaltschaum (he has more poren with devastated zellstruktur and is therefore atmungsaktiver than standard polyurethan and also much more flexible). </seg>
<seg id="73"> Through the combination of the various stiff (force) of kaltschäumen and visco-schäumen mehr-zonen-matratzen arise, the know exactly where head, hip and heels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> For a high-end mattress is 7,000 crowns and to fork out more. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Gesundheitsmatratzen are, however, usually with a lower value added tax, since you, as a medical tool. </seg>
<seg id="76"> As the first Czech companies were gumotex this advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> You see, on the bed and on rost save is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="78"> And again there are special offers of manufacturers and dealers, the two mattresses for the price of an offer. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The brand magniflex the mattress duofreeze with in relation verstepptem visco-schaum memory for 11.990 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="80"> The second one gets free to do so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the tempur material, that the era of the viskoelastischen schaumstoffe with open zellstruktur and dense in almost kosmischem pace. </seg>
<seg id="82"> Not surprisingly, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts at the launch of enormous überbelastungen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83"> Tempur will warm soft, in a cool place, in turn, reinforces it. </seg>
<seg id="84"> So it fits perfectly in the human body and spread over the best way körperdruck. </seg>
<seg id="85"> It is therefore not just ideal for the prevention of druckbrand, but increased the schlafkomfort generally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86"> Viskoelastische schaumstoffe but they are not only in mattresses, but also in other gesundheitsprodukten, such as, for example, in particular fußpolstern used the legs and the gefäßen relief are laid down. </seg>

<seg id="9"> But who still want to know more about ice, which is not on the "gelato-university" the Italian firm carpigiani over. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The eis-universität, the manufacturer of eismaschinen set up in 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines across the high Italian ideals. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The three-day grundkurs for future gelatieri has the most numerous and visitors from around the world. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But there is also mehrtägige spezialkurse around the schokoladeneis and internships in the hauseigenen eisdiele. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Some in the midlife-crisis dreaming of a new career, other cars simply time on the treacherous ice of their vague aspirations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Jacky, kunstlehrer from California, loves the slow-food-bewegung and wants the country to the industrial ice-cream, in future, a European quality product offer. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Maestro-gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains the participants, firstly the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is vital, not only of good taste, but also the seidige fluidity and the good consistency. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Luciano forgets at his training but also not the icing on the cake of all national and South überbaus: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of romanticism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first step to manufacture seems simple. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Luciano dump the grundzutaten milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilisers in a large mixgerät which, with an electronic programme everything at 85 degrees and then cooked immediately on four degrees cools. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Then he turns to the machine on a tap, and out comes a pasteurised White basiscreme, basis for all milcheissorten. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The teacher immediately they were all practically crowding me with questions: can you only ice cream with natural substances without stabilising factor? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How can one of their own experimentierlust give free rein? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Luciano warns the zeitgeist to mislead. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Who of ice cream "only from natural ingredients' speech, perhaps, has nonetheless used stabilisers - usually a product of nature, such as guarkernmehl from the guarbohne. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Of course you can ice without stabiliser, only it must then be sold within a day, or else it sackt in together, and the customer bites on eiskörnchen louder. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Certain variations in the grundmasse are allowed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It will be more exciting with the flavourings. </seg>
<seg id="32"> For the taste of the ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients, the one in the obst-abteilung or the sweets of buying supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, there are there and pasten powder. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "The suppliers will all try to foist onto them dozens of aromatised additions." </seg>
<seg id="35"> "But they should simply time to experiment." </seg>
<seg id="36"> Either the fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruits. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Or just in the ice cream from the White grundmasse with eggs to a yellow flower with kakaopulver and will form the basis for all kinds of schokoladen-verführungen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Now, the kursteilnehmer to the eismaschinen. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano, they each four different types of vanille-, schokolade-, mokka- and produce haselnuss-eis - with or without eggs in the grundmasse, with more or less vanillearoma or other natural additives. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The same experiment will also be subject to the fruchteissorten. </seg>
<seg id="41"> More flavourings, more frucht-püree -; that is not necessarily better. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Haselnuss-eis tastes not necessarily nussiger if it contains nuts. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The most popular kiwi-eis, the working party, which more fruit, use less water and less stabiliser. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Only a balanced mix will highlight the taste of a gelato correctly, says Luciano. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: will pfirsich-püree with a lot of sugar, used the sugars in the grundrezept must be reduced. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For zitroneneis is a extraportion sugar is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano prefers a device with which he stressed the sugar content of the fruchtsorten (winegrowers fairs so that the oechsle in grape must). </seg>
<seg id="48"> Fortunately, the rechnerei easier tables. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Ice does not require longer to make so much physical use as before. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Not just the equipment for the manufacture of the automatic grundmasse helps. </seg>
<seg id="51"> There is even a device, in which the final eis-mischung while at the same time, cremig beaten and on minustemperaturen gekühlt. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Despite all the automation remain small glitch. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The Brazilian Gustavo himself and his kurskollegen intervention from top to bottom with fruchtpüree him, as the überdimensionale hand blenders spirals out of control. </seg>

<seg id="5"> A prisoner wikinger-krieger with only one eye (Mads mikkelsen) is liberated from its peinigern and sets with almost superhuman powers multitudes of his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, it is precisely because our hero like rough used to kill his enemies and have the gedärme from the vibrant life, limb when he has bad humour. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA has new evidence of a clandestine nuclear program in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The country holds out but to comment - nor does it controls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 fighter I. a mysterious, würfelförmiges building in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is on the shores of the Euphrates, the next major city, 30 miles away, is as-saur dair. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Her name is in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on when it comes to the reactor, Syria allegedly with help from North Korea in the quader has built, hidden in a valley by the electricity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing of the us-auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA of 2008 would be the end of April, also under the name of Middle village el-kibar normal reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes, but the technology is hardly from the fifties. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA has led a videopräsentation before with blurred imagery. </seg>
<seg id="10"> By computeranimation they ignored a, where the components of the reactor, before the destruction should be a copy of the North Korean model fell from the atomzentrum Yongbyon. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Moreover, it presented photographs, above, in which the buildings from the vicinity show or even the innenraum. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor was just before the operation, it said, but had not yet been brennstäben peppers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombing, is scarcely more than it was then known, is the mystery at the time were more important. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The former US President George W. Bush has recently in his memoirs, revealed that the CIA before the attack is fairly sure that Syria was in el-kibar built a reactor, but saw little evidence that, in the country, "an active nuclear weapons programme." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some intelligence officers in Europe that are rather more cautious and only talk of an "alleged reactor," even if they cia-präsentation for "plausible." </seg>
<seg id="16"> They lack of hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Asked how sure he was a reactor is said to have a high un-diplomat in summer only, the IAEA "simply had enough material to pose questions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The rubble of the supposed "dormant" militärgebäudes created the Syrians are hastily aside and planierten the site thoroughly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It was in June 2008, a iaea-team under the former chief inspector Olli heinonen, in el-kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Moreover, the IAEA about a Member State of satellite imagery of commercial providers from the period immediately after the attack, which may be more meaningful than those outlined by the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, these recordings are on the market, not because of the unknown purchaser - perhaps Israel - it has bought exclusive rights. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The IAEA can therefore not independently verify its authenticity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always asserted, has never been a secret nuclear program, farms or to have built a reactor. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But the instructed the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then, Damascus, refuses to discuss - as well as on the satellite pictures. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In addition, the inspectors have been denied a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the rubble of a bombed-out building. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But Israel too Stony silence. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We will never comment on that," confirmed recently by the time of the attack acting Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, the official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> As the investigation drags on the case since June 2008 and ineffective "is becoming a serious problem of credibility for the office," as a senior Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna pointless - after all, it is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area, on which the IAEA watchdog. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA apparently three other facilities in the "functional link" with the alleged reactor should be - and unlike this still exist. </seg>
<seg id="32"> While the inspectors have so far not revealed what the assets are, or what role they have or what they appear to be suspicious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to information the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are in the IAEA as as-sultan masyaf marj internally, and iskandariayah calls, which are derived from nearby cities. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent institute for science and international security in Washington (ISIS advises) has identified in these places and imagery in a complex masyaf, in which it is most likely one of the suspects objects. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It is probably in or directly next to a military base - precisely on these grounds, Syria denied the IAEA access to the three locations. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In Vienna, it is feared the Syrians a fishing expedition - that the IAEA from the United States vorgeschickt will auszuspähen military equipment. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Because the nukleardetektive goods through a tip of the US intelligence services on the institutions has become. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the quader on the Euphrates material was moved back and forth. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could "in connection with the brennstoffproduktion ." </seg>
<seg id="40"> But there was "no evidence of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes, to the construction of nuclear weapons are needed. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The type of reactor is with uranium farms, it is not enriched. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But where the uranium would have to come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated, on these central issues is there any plausible conjecture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> Also unclear is whether the valuable pieces of debris, traces of mountains, could at the three locations were stored. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As if the hundreds of lastwagenladungen disappeared from the ground, nobody wants information about where the rubble. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Only a few kilometres from el-kibar, on the other side of the Tigris salzmine allocated al-tibni Syria, 1998 to their suitability as a camp for radioactive waste has investigated, the IAEA as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The former iaea-inspektor Robert kelley had it in a recent analysis of the imagery for the venerable magazine Jane 's intelligence review with the reactor in mid-afternoon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Recordings from the orbit but show that Syria to the three suspects places erdarbeiten and large containers distant, after the IAEA access had requested. </seg>
<seg id="48"> This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped the suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> In addition, it says the IAEA in diplomatic circles, have used a number of months, a plan for inspections there to develop the Syria should allow any military secrets - the effort alone shows how great is the interest of the inspectors. </seg>
<seg id="50"> However, Damascus bügelte also this proposal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Western diplomats in Vienna ahead of a year, soothed the reactor was destroyed, so the matter was not a high sense of urgency, bring about US ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months' sonder-inspektionen into the game, one of the harshest means that the Vienna atombehörde, in order to impose controls. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Iaea-chef yukiya Amano, these inspections should propose, has been of "an option, for which I am open in the future," but he still hesitates. </seg>
<seg id="53"> It is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it needs for a majority of the Board of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented are anything other than eager for an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other, like a diplomat to think: 'What is, if you end up with nothing at all? " </seg>

<seg id="1"> The demokatrische routine </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The movement for democracy in Latin America is stronger, as the support of private companies. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil larger than that of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="5"> These findings, the latinobarómetro-umfrage in 18 countries and exclusively in the economist has been published. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This survey is carried out regularly since 1995, and shows that the people in this region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two facts fall in the annual survey of September and October, particularly in 's an eye. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First, the good mood in Latin America </seg>
<seg id="9"> And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In many countries of the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement intensified S. (table 1). </seg>
<seg id="11"> In Peru, for example, where the economy annually since 2002 by around 6%, the number of demokratiebefürworter from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Also in Mexico, where the economy has been the sharp drop in the past year recovered, is such a trend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, and are staunch Democrats, which reduces the regional average (S. diagram 2]. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Around 44% of respondents said that they, with the democratic practice of your country satisfied. These are as much as in the last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3). </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some 34% trust the Congress of your country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of the past year, but show a sharp increase from 2003 (17% and 24%). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> A decade ago, Latin American economic crisis undermined the efforts to achieve more democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Also during the Great Depression lasted perhaps, is that the countries of Latin America, only a brief recession and saw a speedy recovery. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, the poor by a stronger safety net - instead. </seg>
<seg id="19">  (according to reports from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week 2009 rose, the poverty rate in Latin America only slightly and is once again this year fell by 32%.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But from country to country, there are strong stimmungsunterschiede (S. graph 4). </seg>
<seg id="21"> Brazil, strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread fortschrittsdenken. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In Mexico and Central America, where the recession Mount was and violent crime have increased, this is less the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> For only the second time since umfragebeginn see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country, a bigger problem than in the unemployment (S. graph 5). </seg>
<seg id="24"> Around 31% say that either they or a family member in the last year have been victims of a crime. But, compared to 38% in the past year, the values have fallen, reaching the lowest level since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The rising economic performance is reflected in the increased support of the private and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents surveyed at cross-regional level that the private sector for the development is essential, in 2007 there were 56% (S. graph 6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> Some 58% said that only the market can bring their own progress, compared with 47% in the last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela this view maintained (and 80% are for a private sector), though their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, nationalised many private companies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil has according to 19% of the respondents (18% last year), the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year). </seg>
<seg id="29"> The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see in the United States, the most influential country, and this role in the Dominican Republic of Venezuela and Nicaragua. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband, Argentine President, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy to their beliebtheitsrate 20 points to more than 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Whether it is, however, that in the next year to get re-elected, depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández kompromissbereiter than her late husband, your predecessor and political partner of Néstor Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The signs are not clear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Néstor Kirchner, even after the election, the economic policies of his wife, drew, was often on the budgets, the tax revenue, the economic growth and inflation does not fully into account. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This allowed the presidential couple then, the extraeinnahmen spend as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On paper, the fernández-regierung lost in the last year, the majority in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is divided and Kirchners death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further divisions. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But after chaotic meetings (in which a Member of another in the face and others suggested the government of the bribery of lying), managed the Congress not to pass the budget for 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I will not discuss," as the President. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The 2010 budget now is for the next year, leaving the President still has more opportunity to spend money as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy is hot: probably it will this year by up to 9%. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official inflation rate is z.z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - the value of up to almost 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was negatively by economic crises, said growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not the inflationssenkung. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He refused to cooperate with the IMF, the private sector säuberte singled out for bullying and the National Institute of statistics and census indec, which then the official inflationsstatistiken schönte. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Fernández now can we road? </seg>
<seg id="18"> It has the private sector and the trade union leader has called for talks. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And, according to official statements should wage increases in the next year to 18%, will be limited. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The high world prices for agricultural products of Argentina have a strong boost to the economy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the inflation undercut the burst through a big devaluation of 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Perhaps for this reason, Cristina Fernández would like Argentina again and economic terms to the rest of the world to follow. </seg>
<seg id="23"> At the beginning of this year, the government had an agreement with shareholders holding the former rescheduling of the country in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Fernández now appears to have an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which they owe about $6.7 billion. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Kirchners have had a review by the IMF, as elsewhere, always rejected. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But in the last month, the economy Minister Amado boudou, announced that the fund in the drafting of a new national consumer price index "technical support." It looks as if this were the first step to cleaning up of the indec. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not known whether Mr Fernández, after ending her term even without the support of her husband will be politically active. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely enough by the Kirchnerism. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the Argentines in March to return from their summer vacation, the wave of the sympatie, it has been shown to be, fizzled. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If you want another election win, she must decide whether you many political decisions of their man quietly lifted. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The discovery of a strange variety of arsenic, which can live opens up new possibilities for new life on the earth and elsewhere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Although scientists say this unusual bacterium discovered here on earth, it is their view, a sign that a life without the previously deemed vital elements is possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "This organism has two possibilities." </seg>
<seg id="5"> "He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "It makes it to a very particular, although it is almost a kind of 'alien' way of life is," said c.w. Paul Davies of Arizona State University and co-autor of the report, which the Internet on Thursday in the journal Science. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> So far, six key elements as vital - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> But, as the scientists figured out the bacterium grows mono lake in California and then still further, if it phosphorus replaced by arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "one wonders what else is possible," said the report that the co-autor Ariel Anbar of Arizona State University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is an important step in the search for außerirdischem lives since scientists life and his forms have to recognise as Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study addresses on the earth, the microbes have been found. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The announcement of a press conference in which no details on the discovery was announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet, that the report by the discovery of außerirdischen life could act. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "shows that in other planetensystemen organisms with the help of other elements of biochemical processes can set in motion and that the 'standardelemente', which, in our opinion, are absolutely vital, do not necessarily see are imposed," said Charles cockell, a professor at the planetary and space sciences Research Institute of the open university in Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockel was not part of the research teams. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "This work is a new departure, because it shows that, in fundamental biochemical processes and structures of one element can be replaced by another," added cockell added. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="17"> This discovery was not accidental. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Felisa wolfe-simon from astrobiologischen Institute of NASA, who led the study, chose the mono Lake because of the high arsengehalts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Since arsenic and phosphorus chemically identical, they took on that microbes that both are exposed, may be an element in the other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "The toxicity of the arsens is based above all, that it is chemically similar to behave like phosphorus." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "by the organisms, it is difficult to distinguish between an element from the other." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "But the difference is so great that arsenic different acts as phosphorus. It into our biochemisches system, where it is almost covered everything," said Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers used the bacterium gfaj-1 rising arsenkonzentration. It is suited to and grew. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The microbe is growing in phosphorus better, but also that it can survive in arsenic, shows that a arsen-basierte lifestyle that can happen, of course, either on land or on any other planet or moon, to the arsenic occur more frequently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> According to Jamie S. foster, dozentin for Microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus by arsenic can be replaced, not new, but until now there has been still no functioning example. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Prosecutors in the justice department, have Senator John Ensign of the accusations, acquitted after his case with a former wahlhelferin and his attempt to her husband, a lobbying to win against him, the lawyers of the senator on Wednesday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This decision will put an end to the worst rechtsvorwurf against Senator Ensign, a Republican from Nevada, up to the scandal, the nationwide headlines and sparked a damper on his career, he was seen as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As Senator ensigns office, indicated that he was on the judgment after the year-long investigation "delighted." </seg>
<seg id="5"> The set up of the Senate, however, could still impose a disziplarstrafe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to testimony from ensigns lawyers, they were informed by the Department of Justice that investigations against Senator Ensign have been drafted in this matter and that no further charges. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Justice Department did not comment on the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The ruling was for many ethik-anwälte outside the Ministry of Justice came as a surprise. Their opinion there was sufficient evidence that the lobbying-verbot Ensign has disregarded. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Interviews, e-mails and other documents for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times have been revealed, gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election agent, to lucrative contracts, gave his silence about a case with hamptons wife Cynthia. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Cynthia Hampton was during an election campaign ensigns worked as treasurer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Ensign, contact with few political friends in order to give Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogate them after he took over for the recruitment of hamptons lobbying. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Since Hampton recently in ensigns wahlteam was, it was he was a year of no lobbying for his former employer, or the entire Senate. </seg>
<seg id="13"> According to the ethik-experten verstieß the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, which in the case were chummy, against the so-called ban on the drehtür-lobbykratie. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> According to the published evidence "is, to all appearances a consultation and the violation of the drehtür-statuten," Stanley fire, a Washington lawyer, to the defence of clients, specialising in the sights of the government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> While the justice department formally rejected it, the reasons for the decision in ensign-fall to publicise, said Mr. fire and other ethikanwälten, the department notes to be very cautious in political charges after a series of defeats, the media have been followed with great interest, including the decision last year that the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens because of malfeasance on the part of the public prosecutor to drop. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Prosecutors "are clearly schreckhaft," said Melanie sloan, the chairman of the association ," citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington" (an organisation whose aim of combating corruption in parliamentary and government circles in the United States), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr. Ensign has brought before the courts. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "This means that, in principle, high-profile officials now can assume that the law does not apply to them," she added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Paul coggins, hauptverteidiger of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview on Monday that he had received a phone call to a public prosecutor and another on the next day, in which he was told that the Ministry has no complaints against his client will speak. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Mr. ensigns defender had cooperated with prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator, as his office in a statement on Wednesday repeated again, "in accordance with the law." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr. coggins refused, the legal arguments to the prosecutors, which he put forward to explain in more detail. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "I am not, in the gesprächsdetails between the Ministry and me to go. Only so much to be said: we believe that the right decision," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Last month, the bundeswahlkommission decided that the investigation for a separate lawsuit by the group to suspend, after the payment of $96,000 of Mr. ensigns parents to the hamptons against the bundeswahlgesetz read. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The electoral Commission said it was not enough evidence that the money is anything other than a gift. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> NV energy, a large firm in Nevada, which for a long time the senator supported, was one of the companies, in which Mr. Hampton thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyisten-arbeit took place. </seg>
<seg id="25"> An e-mail from the December 2008 shows that, after the company Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist has got us nowhere, Mr. ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a conversation with Mr. Hampton had, in which he told him that he, the Interior Ministry for a cause, "anklopfe." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and another customers from Nevada, and allegiant air, agreed to lunch and asked the transport minister, a meeting in the name of the airline to agree after this Mr. Hampton to lobbying had stopped. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Last year, for the first time, information about this affair to the public, Mr. Ensign is, make no apology to his constituents and gave his position in the Senate, where he is in the order of precedence of the Republicans in fourth place. </seg>
<seg id="28"> After many months, he no longer was struck, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he would seek a third term in the Senate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> In the announcement that Mr. Ensign may no longer be the target of police investigations, "said his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, the senator, the ethics committee hope that very soon the example of the justice department, and his investigation einstelle. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Half a dozen of them tippten itself in the riots in the courtroom. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the minutentakt verschickten you on Twitter their reports on grausige testimonies. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the end, so the defence, there was more than 140,000 twitter-meldungen on trial for rape and beds gekettete children in a House, the flare-up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Thursday, the process will be closely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was charged, three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to have been killed, an official end, if the ruling on the death sentence, which the panel has ruled. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted proposals in court, the reasons for an appeal, and the outline of the courts in years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> One of the provozierendsten reasons is that, by the intense coverage of the process, even through the extensive use of Twitter by durchschnittsreporter - to a "zirkusatmosphäre" and such a widespread, swift penetration take details, so that the jury in an improper manner by the public outrage had been affected. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This protest could prompt the appelationsgerichte, to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules will be necessary in the courtroom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "as I have seen during this process, I believe that it really is a danger, if the introduction of new technologies in the courtroom every individual " s right to a fair trial," said Thomas J. influenced Ullman, Mr. Hayes hauptverteidiger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The presiding judge Jon C. blue by the Supreme kammergericht, rejected last week, the applications by ruling, briefly and succinctly when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But this was certainly not the last word on this matter. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For decades gerichtseinsprüche have found that the coverage of famous cases of doubt on the fairness of the process. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In his historic decision by 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States the ruling against Dr Sam sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, who killed his wife would have to be lifted, and said in his decision, that it is because of the new media as a "karnevalsatmosphäre in the courtroom" had been made. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some people believe that the TV show and the movie "on the run" on this crime is based. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some lawyers say, gerichtseinsprüche, which Mr. Hayes condemnation of half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary, the communication from the courtroom, the time of the fall of Dr sheppard were unimaginable to rules. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "There is a good reason, on the impact of new media in trials of the general public are persecuted, to be alarmed," said John J. donohue III, a professor at Stanford law school, of the death penalty in Connecticut has investigated. His report, it will be applied arbitrarily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor donohue said, some appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restrictions on a prompt communications from inside the courtroom could make the process fairer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The twitter-angelegenheit is only one of many, the lawyers of Mr. Hayes outline for years, in order to discuss and thus a condemnation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defenders claim, for instance, that Mr. Hayes had already been regarded with hostility under any circumstances could be, as judge blue had not allow them to test the reaction of potential judges, by giving them during the jurorenauswahl grausige tatortfotos showed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some of the judges said that photos of the victim, Jennifer hawke-petit, 48 years, and their tüchter, hayley, 17, and michaela, 11 years, they would have with horror. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defenders say that they would also carry the constitutionality of the death penalty in question, and argue that the judge mistakenly replaced a jury, which is a critic of the prosecution, and that he had been unacceptable pressure on the ruling, than he would have made the unusual decision, the panel had taken over the weekend to free. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The judges were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But their arguments about the impact of the extensive coverage of the process is perhaps the greatest interest. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In a urteilsanfechtung, which you have submitted last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the post of Governor and for the American Senate has been discussed by the candidates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They argued that the new media constantly the flames of the emotions on the case would be reopened. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "such a daily crush of medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "has even beforehand in new haven and perhaps even have not yet seen a nationwide." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Its focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct news are rabble-rousing but effective as reports, the slower are reimbursed, a technikfeindlicher view was that the reporting on verarme future processes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> However, some lawyers said, would appelationsgerichte often with the argument, social and technical changes we need to give the adaptation by the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr. hayers lawyers reinforce this assertion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In her complaint, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, in which the sentencing of Dr sheppard due to the coverage was rescinded and made it clear that the new media, new rules require. </seg>
<seg id="32"> "this case," they wrote, "represents sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress produced no breakthrough on the big issues, while the so-called "lame duck" session of the meeting, at the end of a period in which no decisions are being taken, had to employ. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After all, what one hears, it was neither a polite debate between two sides or an account of their shared responsibility to rule, but rather an empty episode of a partisan punktesammelns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meeting of the deficit Commission of the President on Wednesday was also to be civilised, despite the political differences between the Members will continue. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months, a mutual respect creates, of the ideological divide, which still divides the Members, disguises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> That is hardly enough to claim that it was a new era of cooperation here. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Both sides are now in a testing phase - in one of the other signs of cooperation and conciliation, while it tried to the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters, according to a new parteienkriegsführung weigh in. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Therefore, they were meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants to a minimum requirements or accusations, limited. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep, that you as a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, one might expect. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Regardless of whether it is tax, donations, health or benefits, the two sides are miles apart. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Finally, the novemberwahl Washington, at least for a short time bribed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "No question, the tone has changed," said pete wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, now for the "ethics and public policy center" works. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "It is inevitable after elections. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elections are partisan passions, the die again. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And that is a good thing. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In some issues, particularly in the ones on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. " </seg>
<seg id="19"> The Bush tax cuts will end at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way to receive some or even all, either temporarily or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is also a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits to be expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that it believes the favoured tax cuts for the rich, while unemployed workers to refuse to support. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House is the increased optimism that it is in these issues during the "lame duck" session some and at the same time the new START Treaty can ratify. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But William glaston of Brookings insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily to a permanent cooperation must lead to the parties, if the new 112. Congress convened in January. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead, he says, is a phase of the nichtübereinstimmens more likely, perhaps even inevitable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "After the things that have to be done, will have done, this short-term psychology in turn confrontation," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - the courtesy to real cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "I see a lot of what is happening in from today until 2012, when vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the intended by 2012," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons have a great deal to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House to do so, and with the teeparty-wählern, who use their education. </seg>
<seg id="29"> How worried the Republican leader also that they may be, to instil fear high, they know that they must try to their promise to cut government spending and healthcare reform to stymie, adhere to them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> This parteilinien are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the deficit Commission clearly, which is a tax reform and the raising of some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and reduce government spending. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The Deputy Chairman, Alan Simpson and erskine Bowles, one of the toughest jobs in Washington and have taken over, according to their own judgement, so very pressed the defizitfrage on the public agenda, that this could no longer be ignored. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need within the Commission, 14 of the 18 votes, about their plan to make the official recommendation and they contend that only very close to this number. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The greatest opposition is in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial issues, today at least, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Galston says two stages in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The first battle next year in the form of parteizusammenstößen take place, if the Republicans Obama in terms of the state budget, taxes and the health care system are challenging, then followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will this lead to change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> Public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It is a proven fact that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties to work together. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If confrontation into a blind alley, as it happened in 1995, then both parties should take care to ensure the public reaction. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Whoever loses will be condemned to change tack and seek the compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> This may in fact be an optimistic outlook. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Partisanship and polarization are now greater than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem a more ideological divide between Obama and the kongress-republikanern than at the time, to be between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> While at the same time, the activists from both parties in 2010 as a mere prelude to a far greater choice of rigour in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> So may seen the courtesy which display this week, will be welcomed by many Americans. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a surprising victory for President Obama 's campaign to global security of nuclear materials, the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The deal has been in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei martynov in an additional article of the sicherheitsgipfels announced. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The US government had for years sought to persuade, Belarus, not more highly enriched uranium to gather last spring and seemed to have reached a hurdle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But the US administration official told the Washington Post, that in the last two months, two secret agreement with Belarus have been made to 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian forschungsanstalt. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The folks on the stage for the agreement on Wednesday, the rest of the material - to remove, according to an official staff who, because of the sensitivity of the matter remains anonymous, roughly 500 pounds. </seg>

<seg id="7"> The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama "nuclear sicherheitsgipfel of 47 nations" in April, the Belarus had excluded. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And it was obviously well enough, at the invitation of the former Soviet Republic of the next summit in 2012. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="9"> "I was really impressed with the fact that they have a seat on the nuclear sicherheitsgipfel (by 2012) want." </seg>
<seg id="10"> "This proves to me that it works," said Ken luongo, President of the partnership of global security, a group on the promotion of nuclear safety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Clinton called the agreement "a very significant and important step" of Belarus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, within four years to secure all vulnerable nuclear material. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since then, the US government of six countries, helped her to get rid of highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Belarus will be the seventh. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "how to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos of what is, fundamentally waffenfähig, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "This is our raw material... we will not derive any dirty bombs and we will sell it on anyone." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We use it solely for research purposes, this is everything." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Belarus, however, approached a few months ago in the United States, as there is interest in the meeting of an agreement anzeigte. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The first time round, the uranium Belarus in October to remove was particularly complicated, because the material was easily irradiated, officials say. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It has been in a spezialzug load, the more than 1 300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, officials say. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the official. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The US government will pay for this effort $14 million, with a large proportion of the money in the Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which can be used not for nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "This was extremely carefully coordinated, in order to build trust," the agreement, which was signed by Clinton led, said Andrew bieniawski, a representative of the primary, which, at the global gefahrenreduzierung operates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The James Martin Center for nichtweiterzugebende studies estimates that Belarus in this year waffenfähhigen had at least 88 pounds of uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Belarus wants, according to the joint agreement his camp until 2012. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="28"> The relations between Belarus and the US have been strained for years, first and foremost because of Lukashenko 's harsh disregard for human rights. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But the statement on Wednesday suggesting a possible rapprochement. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1"> Zapatero and the red line of Germany </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin has, for the keeping of the euro, but at the same time, conditions for the entire European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tension on the markets have a two-fold response from the government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation measures, starting with the tax reliefs for small and micro-enterprises, regulation of the agencies or the lifting of the 426 euro support for the unemployed, no unemployment benefit, and the privatisation of 49 per cent for aena, the management of airports, particularly Barajas and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former Prime Minister Felipe González, the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible, along with the current crisis herausbeschwört said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How are these events? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is anticipated the Merkel 's position is not a mistake of their public relations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In Germany, is a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future, the one with the maintenance of the old traditions of so many of his partner. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Given the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis to spekuliern. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South to leave the euro area should have been. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The second: the restoration of the German mark - although at the moment, sounds more like science fiction, supported by a large proportion of public opinion, approximately 50% of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The third: a review of the euro in accordance with German proposals. That means that more macroeconomic control; rigorous financial management; punishment of the countries which exceed the requirements of möglichereweise; the failure of some countries, as well as the extension of the potential costs of adaptation to the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is clear and has been for some time. That is why there is now no excuses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First, in 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission incentives for deficits, and the German Government is a constitutional reform drew from the sleeves in order to prevent this from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It was the first signs of the drift between what Germany was thought necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second sign suspended the Central European country, when Merkel announced the decision to save Greece painful serious. </seg>
<seg id="18"> At the time, the heavily criticized. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion absolutely against a bailout of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally, Merkel in the last oktobertagen with an unambiguous position. It calls for a reform of the agreements of the European Union, in order to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time the private lender, to commit a part of the costs. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position was interpreted as anti-European, since they irlandkrise and everything the following. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But its proposal, albeit slightly sweetened, has been adopted. In the coming months we will be in the reform of the European Union, which these measures from 2013 that should enable us to participate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has drawn a red line, which it does not intend to cross. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It says all that - even if now unpopular measures need to be made - it from that date, the old ways of the euro will not be. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The geburtsjahr 2013 will be a new currency zone, in which the force countries severely punished, that can be forced to declare itself insolvent and, in this case, the private sector a portion of the costs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows us that we must take a hard path, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The other alternative in the debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments is based, as it was led by Spain in boom times, is simply not acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would be wrong to do so, it is not understood. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not only a question of the budget deficit by 2013 runterzufahren at three per cent. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much tougher. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, is ourselves to cheat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the current turbulence in more calm. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And that we need the opportunities offered to us, be offered until spring 2013 will use. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero also has understood, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) points out that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, right in their own House, to create their way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But the of Germany want red line is there, and it does not seem that things would change. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Among the possibilities is taking into account the fact that we, the countries with little serious fully gestopften euro area, cannot be ruled out. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In this case Germany might still tell us that it had warned us. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tricks such as that of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the desire to avoid a penalty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The supposedly of two players of real Madrid (xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) proposed exclusion in the game on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League led to much ink has been shed, about whether it is a unsportliche action or not and whether any both players should be sanctioned by UEFA. </seg>
<seg id="4"> As is well known, the two players lost a couple of minutes to go (your team had already won clearly) time and played several fouls, so that the referee showed them the second yellow card. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way, and as the Real Madrid his group, the two players would be the prescribed sanction in the next ligaspiel against auxerre and so without playing cards in the next spielphase. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Finally, the disziplinarkommitee of UEFA, the coach of the club, José mourinho, with two to play and the players involved with various sums of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow card in this or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is so widespread that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this game - is visible rules. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of the debate about the fact that outlined case that a team from the football clubs, Real Madrid (who, in his anthem edelmut and honor claims and on other occasions, his players had punished for similar incidents), and the key role played in the drama by mourinho, the more an episode to its long history as theatralischer and provocative engineers has added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case, the debate about whether this is not explicitly of the statutes of illicit behaviour runs counter to the principles of the sport, that is, whether these actions represent a regelumgehung. Indeed, believes that this approach to the statutes of the sport, but appear to circumvent its meaning. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this matter should be of the sporting spirit ailment being investigated. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sporting spirit defends the physical integrity of the challengers, an aspect that, through these actions was not at risk, because it was not aggressive play. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the force the players an unfair advantage from the gegenteam. This was not done. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradox of the plot of the players of real Madrid is that they do not match up to what we normally regard as falschspiel or regelumgehung understand, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly taken place, in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be so visibly as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players waited and took the sanction to go. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is, what kind of advantage the ban from the deliberate fouls. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Here, it should be emphasised that the rival either in a disadvantageous position has yet been brought advantages for the feigned game were erheischt because, the obvious result of this action was that their own team with fewer players had to play. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is also not a useful strategy for the next game because the club has not then on these players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The advantage is obviously the players that the next spielphase of the Champions League without playing cards, their participation in a future game could begin to threaten. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a long-term, up to a certain extent uncertain advantage, since the team eventually could exit. Moreover, players with this approach to a sanction and go in the second kartenzyklus about where they are because of kartenanhäufung with a card less than in the first cycle of exit. </seg>
<seg id="21"> That is not so clear is whether it is really an advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Ultimately settle such practices are not against the sporting spirit, which also include strategic decisions, the rules in order to derive maximum benefit. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case the players wanted to avoid any penalty (this would really be a clear case of regelumgehung), they wanted more, when you choose this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They made a strategic decision, without a penalty saved, before her, or to flee. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Although the border between imagination and regelumgebung blur is, I believe that this issue is a clear case of inventiveness. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because it was about two selbstausschlüsse and because of the nature of the regelübertragung unprovoked. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The damage of the principles of the sport by these actions inflicted is less ethical rather than aesthetic nature. </seg>

<seg id="9"> "The bad news is that Italy, as Portugal is," said Irwin stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In plain words, that may be, is the problem of the absenz of economic growth and the attendant, schwindsüchtigen steuereingänge, which the State is in danger, its financing needs will no longer be able to cover. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In the future will be an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the expected in the Senate is examining budget with 1.3% and 2%. </seg>

<seg id="14"> Hence the uproar about a new haushaltskollektiv, after the holidays to a sum of EUR 7 billion could be used. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "If need be, the new austerity measures must be taken," says accountant Olli Rehn. </seg>
<seg id="16"> On the hour receives Italy the support of international institutions. </seg>

<seg id="19"> There remains the question of the political unstetigkeit. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The Wikileaks case has a twofold significance. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On one hand, it is as obvious scandal, turns a scandal, only one scandal in the sinner hypocrisy, which is the beziehunge between the States, the citizens and the press. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand, it has announced major changes at international level, and gives a taste of the future, dominated by regression. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But we walk of the series after. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each by a secret service produced acts (a nation), other exclusively from press cuttings. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary," American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi 's throw from nothing more than what you anyway for months on end in any other Journal got to read (except those whose owner Berlusconi is), and the terrifying karikaturierte profile of Gaddafi " s kabarettkünstlern already provided for a long time for their sketche stuff. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule, according to the secret dossier only from already well-known news must exist, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go into a library, which is dedicated to esotherischen publications, you will realise that each work (on the grail, the mystery of rennes-le-chateau templer, the or the rosenkreuzler) exactly what happened in previous works have already been written. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is not only, therefore, that the author occult texts do not want to publish research (still, therefore, that he does not know how, where news about the nicht-existierende to), but because those who are the okkultismus devote to nothing different than what you already know and confirms what you already have learned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the erfolgsmechanismus of Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Also the secret files. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informant is lazy and lazy (or restricted spirit) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could also be what is, for example, editor at Libération), which is just as true to what he considers it. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The top-secret information on Berlusconi, the American Embassy in Rome, the staatsdezernat had sent, were the same as those of us who already Newsweek published the previous week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> So why was such a fuss about the revelations made this dossier? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On one side of this, to say what any educated person already knows, namely that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the government can call each other or an aircraft can take in order to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of a few small virtue in spionagezentren have turned. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Any viewer of ermittlungsfilmen knows this very well, and it is not from hypocrisy that one way of doing this is to ignore. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Still, the fact it publicly to repeat violates the task of hypocrisy and serves, the American diplomacy in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Secondly: the idea that a business-as-usual hackers of the geheimsten secrets of the most powerful country in the world can tap, runs the significant blow to the prestige of the staatsdezernats. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, the scandal is less the victims rather than the "executioner" in trouble. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we are dealing the profound nature of what happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Formerly, Orwell " s times, they could all power like a big brother, the pool every gesture of his subjects controlled. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwell " s prophecy would have been quite right since then as can highlight any movement, where you can control thanks to the telephone, drain every transaction, visited the hotel, the elected motorway and so on; the citizens would result in the total victims of the eye of power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But, bearing in mind what is happening today, even the secret krypten of power is no longer the control of hackers can escape, so the kontrollgang, to be directed to unilaterally and will zirkelförmig. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power of controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - chosen as rächer of the citizen - can the secrets of the power in experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> How can a power, but keeping the is no longer able to preserve their own secrets? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is true, Georg simmel has already said that a real mystery, a mystery is empty (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi or Merkel 's, in fact, a secret free of geheimis is, as it surrenders the public sphere; but in styles of WikiLeaks, reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means any power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Wikileaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel against injustice, but Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What are the consequences of this violation of which would be such a huge power has been done? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the Member States in future no longer reserved for information online posts - would be the one on the street corner angeklebten aushang guilt. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is equally obvious that with the current technology is to be hoped not, confidential reports on telephone to keep secret. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is easier than finding out whether, and when a Head of State is in a plane and moved one of its Members has been in contact with. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could in future private and only for certain ears certain relationships? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know very well that my forecast at the moment and romanhaft sounds like science fiction, but I am compelled me to present the government agents on secret way to score and uncontrollable marschrouten moving, their communications anywhere else than mere memory in order to deal with, and, moreover, the few written information they received in the schuhabsatz verbergend. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information would be in single copy in closed drawers of stored: basically the spionageversuch had less success of Watergate, when WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity to write that the technology today is like a cancer progresses, namely backwards. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A century after the wireless telegraf communications had revolutionized, reconstructed the Internet with a telegrafen (telephone) line. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The (analogue) cassettes had the filmforschern allows, a film band for band auszukundschaften by one from back to front spulen and all the secrets of the installation could lift, while the (digital) CDS nowadays is nothing other than allow from chapter to chapter to jump in makroportionen. </seg>

<seg id="17"> In other words, there are no guidelines on the expenditure of the previous year or on a global level of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In practical terms, the total amount of the French aid to the developing countries remain stable (or decline) - France, his commitment to the "new and additional funding." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is still no rule, and everyone chooses his rechenmodus. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, such as France, for example, are 1 lent €than equivalent with donated €1. </seg>
<seg id="22"> That is clearly difficult to justifiable: the effort is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often conditional on the emissionseindämmung projects, which is actually based on technology) can be justified, it is misleading to try to present the euro, as the equivalent of a donated euro captured... and only the cost of the loan for the kapitalgeberland than commitment should be (in other words, the equivalent of an interest rate). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France has no place in a different sense than the following consideration: it 'respect' his commitment of 420 million euros, by 91.5% of loans (389,8 million euros), and takes 8.5% accorded) 36.1 million euros) - see the EU documents, to see for yourselves. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only country in the EU that loans, to a great extent. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among other things) to 100% of its commitments with donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union 1 €to meet their commitments, France spends just 10 cents and understands including a similar commitment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Beautiful hokuspokus! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> All in all, operated on France in his fast-start-finanzierung with a double fraud: to a part of the action with a weiterentwicklkung over time, and partly with the reality of financial support. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France, to believe that it is 420 million "new and additional" million in accordance with its promise and it saves has spent EUR 36.1 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the Treasury Department (because it appears that there was the Bercy, the arbitrage has carried out a double negative effect) could entail; even internally (why the other Member States with the donations, but if there is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries is not completely fooled... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter on the early funding only a small issue in a relatively short time compared to the entirety of discussions on the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it might be too much of the drop in the huge machinery of the UNFCCC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> We hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As always, it is essential to his lesson from this first year of premature funding to learn. </seg>
<seg id="36"> First and foremost France could be a change in his verbuchungsart for the 2011 and 2012, and in the spirit of respect for his commitments and the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> But above all France could the discussions on the subject of a dispute of the long-term financing forward (another key issue discussed) and at the moment: you can escape the question of "verrechenbarkeit" or the verbuchungsart its loans. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could change its position, as well as progressive in terms of the issues to be, as it is in other things. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The hope is based on the new Minister for the environment Kosciusko-Morizet, the next week will arrive in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="40"> An unexpected announcement on the fast-start of France and his vision of the "verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loan would, by nature, the international trust, raise the need for further discussions. </seg>
