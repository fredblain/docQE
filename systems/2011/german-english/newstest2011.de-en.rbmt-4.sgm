<seg id="1"> What she is supposed to do, the SSD? Neither the Czech social democrats in Prague do not know Voldemort, yet the "cake shop." </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new councillors of the capital from the rows of the SSD will have to overcome obviously certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues anyway from the ODS in the Prager council and in the city representation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Member of the new council "knocked" the newspaper Aktuáln.cz out of the SSD once a little bit as they dominate the notorious slang which was established in the last years in which the present coalition partners were in Prague at the oar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The coded vocabulary, that in the passed era of chief burgomaster Pavel Bém of the Prager was introduced political elite, is to some of the best known protagonists, borrowed situations and Causae. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Surprisingly showed, that the new councils with respect to those ones these new concepts a little in the dark grope. </seg>
<seg id="6"> They claim that at least. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Who Voldemort is"? </seg>
<seg id="8"> "No presentiment." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am rather a newcomer to the Prager politics," reacted Lukás Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, onto the test of the "godfather vocabulary." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But also the councillor Karel Bezina - a political veteran - reacted to similar manner. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example onto the concept "golf hole." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "That is the only expression of those which you present to me here which I use occasionally." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Otherwise I do not hold much of slang." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> From the vocabulary, that the day leaf of Aktuáln.cz in this year's June in front of the choice congress of the ODS had published, the editorial staff pecked six concepts out, particularly such that are notorious united with the Prager municipal council. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The social democrats should the concepts "Voldemort," "biggest Prager" golf hole," "to go into the cake shop," "Bull nape, Betrayal of the capital" and "verblechen" define. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Three Prager councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prager school being - promised his participation in the conversation first indeed, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prager school being - did not pick up then the listener once, however. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, refused the test from the beginning. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "These things are to me regardless and as the Middle Class democrats under each other talk, I do not judge that." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "For me it is important how we get on within the framework of our programs" it countered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Pointed out as already, Lukás Kaucký would supposedly not have recognized in the above-mentioned headline, that of the influential entrepreneur and friend of the ex chief burgomaster Bém, Roman Janousek is the speech. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The concept "Voldemort" does not say anything to Kaucky at all in that and the only concept which he guessed during the test correctly was "the biggest Prager golf hole." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "That is the tunnel Blanka," Kaucký says added for the security, however, still: "But I rather know that from the newspaper." </seg>
<seg id="23"> And jocular: "I will have to do presumably a language course." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The "golf hole" is deciphered to Lukás Plachý correctly then not only by matador Karel Bezina, but also by the councillor for environmental questions as a tunnel Blanka. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Both social democrats also know, however, for whom the concept Voldemort stands and foresees Lukás Plachý even, where this figure is to be found and through that also, what means it "to go into the cake shop." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "I believe, that is, to go into some Prager gastronomy company," it is quite close to that to Plachý at the puzzle's solution if one knows that it at that around the seat Firmen deals with Janouseks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> In agreement with Bezina he declares, however, to rather have drawn this knowledge from the newspaper than that this vocabulary would be particular to him. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> It seems among the social democrats not to give any similarly adopted slang in fact to judge according to the test participants. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I asked also to my colleagues, but obviously there is really not something like that with us." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "We calls us with the name, occasionally we use also abbreviations or nicknames," the chairperson of the Prager says SSD Petr Hulínský - mentioned "Hulda" by his party comrades casually. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "In the school I was mentioned Bíza (Birch), but I do not know, whether me also my colleagues so nominal," Karel Bezina betrays us his nickname. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The newspaper Deník Aktuáln.cz tried out the name and see there - it functions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The "grandpa" or little is councillor Weinert in a friendly manner in a friendly manner for the party comrades the "altos'," the representative Miroslav Poche that made attentive before the choices through machinations during the party Sponsoring on themselves is mentioned "Igráek" (Czech Lego figure confessed) by some colleagues. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Nicknames are so the only one which the social democrats admit in the internal party usage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Hulínský does not like it supposedly if one mentions him "Hulda," but Deník Aktuáln.cz registered still another nickname of the Prager chairperson. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> His nickname "Doctor of the truncheon-rights" has to do alleged with Petr Hulínský acquiring his title of Doctor juris at the Bratislaver police academy. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The government wants to stop the torture of "hexes" and handed over a brochure </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Women who are stamped as hex in Burkina Faso normally show some common social features. </seg>
<seg id="3"> You rather belong to the older generation, they do not find any work - for example for sanitary reasons, they are single and do not have any children. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> If one of these women "becomes" the witch, she is isolated severely, in this way they the rest of the village not dangerous can become. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Men are quite rarely affected by this fate." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "Also young and healthy women have this saved since they help with the work and "give birth to children" a nun describes the situation that takes care in the capital of the west-African Burkina Faso state in a special home of more than a hundred women that were expelled by their communities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The local government decided now, to proceed against this abnormal "social measure." </seg>
<seg id="8"> And a brochure that is supposed to stop the "witch pursuit" handed over for this reason. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The thing has, however, a hook. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can not read," the newspaper "derStandard" referred to the dilemma of the written clarification. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> To be accused of the witchery is, however, also in other African countries gang und gäbe. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In Ghana, the neighbor country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year old Ammy Hemmahová was tormented by three women and two men to death - they poured petroleum over it and simply lit it. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Also the servers' BBC reported about this incident among other things. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The culprits said, however, the thing would have been only a concurrence of unhappy circumstances. </seg>
<seg id="15"> According to your version oil ignited which is used to ritual anointings. </seg>
<seg id="16"> And indeed, after the group attempted "to drive out" "a bad spirit" from the woman. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The people support the isolation of "hexes" here without regard for their education. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "The standard one" summoned a 42-year old entrepreneur to that from Burkina Faso: "Mug gutters of human souls are formerly as today a danger," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> While the government is making at least an effort in Burkina Faso for defusing the witch-hunt, the president himself mixed the gambianische president in the last year tidily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "Präsident Yahya Jammeh provoked a monstrous witch-hunt after the death of his aunt since these supposedly had part onto their deaths and would attempt now to kill also the president even through black magic." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "It called Schamane for this purpose from the near Guinea to help that in company women randomly arrested by policemen, soldiers and the lifeguard of the president and men carried off violently from gambianischen villages and brought onto the farm of the president" in Kanilai" the organization Amnesty International mentioned in their report. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> On the farm the incarcerated people were forced, a decoction from plants with hallucinogenic effect drink, that but also intestine and kidney problems caused. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> First due to the international pressure the almost a thousand were released prisoners again. </seg>

<seg id="1"> A tenant of Bakala: It gives a good heat indeed in the stove - in spite of that higher rent pays </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> An older thickset man just leaves the client center of the society RPG Byty the "coal baron" Zdenk Bakala, the tallest private owner of flat lets for rent in Czechia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Under the arm a folder with three new rent contracts to three apartments: for the own one and the apartments of his daughters and his son who serves just a prison sentence. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The rent was just increased to all three within the framework of the so-called "deregulation." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Instead of 3500 crowns of month rent the son is supposed to fork out 4100 crowns in the next year for a 2-room-apartment with kitchen of the second category. </seg>
<seg id="6"> "And over there there is in the apartment water not once fluently warm and must heat one in a simple coal stove," he bets annoyedly on the new rent contract of the son to whose signature he has a proxy with the finger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "But what - signed have I, declared it half detunes and half gives up." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The civil union BytyOKD.cz that referred to the new rent conditions as "incorrect and immoral" guesses to the tenants, the new contracts not simply to sign and to wait up to the 7th December at which proposes to publish it some instructions as one proceeds against such contracts. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But the man beckons only off. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "One says this, that other that," it does a dark face. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The region Ostrava becomes like this to the big "deregulation lab." </seg>
<seg id="12"> After New Year this deregulation awaits most flat lets for rent in Czechia whose tenants up to now do not pay any market-just rent. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Aktuáln.cz decided therefore on going to this "lab" personally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The RPG waiting room in Havíov is to one of four in the region Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday breaking full. </seg>
<seg id="15"> To stand now next to the door the bodyguards of a security agency and with it a call device. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "Rents in 2011," a specific feeling-field shines so on the Touchscreen. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In a word touchedly and already the device spits out a number note. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Hardly we did not decipher the number "in 157" and already it bleeps on the big display at the cover of the waiting room. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Half a second later it is up to one. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> A little later an older married couple enters the waiting room in order to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room is not meant apparently at all for the new rent. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Most people are here in order to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and similar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> From middle November the envelopes with the new rent contracts flutter to most tenants of the in total 44.000 apartments of the port folio of the RPG in the region Ostrava into the mailboxes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The RPG Byty suggests a rent increase of approx. 15 to 38 percent to them in the writings. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The specific counter for the new rents in the client center is since the 18th November opened. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "The action runs a little across a week, that is, that is first the beginning," the ladies answer to hesitation behind the counter after a moment when the "client" turns out as a journalist. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The deregulation and Bakalas former miner apartments are an explosive topic. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before the choices the parliament vice-president Lubomír Zaorálek coming from Ostrava had picked up this topic from the SSD quite lauthals, no miracle, that the newspapers are full of that today. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> "Twenty years I want a new floor from them." </seg>
<seg id="29"> "Not once ne besch. they could "exchange" toilet glasses," the at the beginning mentioned man makes himself for air. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Until now outcrop according to the employees before all pensioner at the counter in order to convince oneself whether they really receive the promised rent reduction that RPG promises them if they sign the special offer in time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> February rent reduced into the pleasure of one half are supposed to come also the other tenants, that sign the new rent contract up to the 15th December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Until now "Deregulation counter" is everything else, however, in Havíov, than overloaded from demands. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> "From the 360 clients of yesterday only about 40 to 50 were here because of the rent in the year 2011," reckon the clerks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> RPG offers in this case both on their web pages, as also blackboards individual rent agreements, where it appears necessary. </seg>
<seg id="35"> If the rent parties should agree not on the new rent, however, it is defined by an independent court. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> "That is not supposed to be a threat, but that is as information about those ones only to understand possible and completely legitimate legal approach," declares RPG on his web pages. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> "Here nobody goes in court," thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client center gives to her at least in part right. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> "I have 13.000 (Crowns) pension, from that 5.000 remain for me for the food," where I should "get" the money for a court quarrel, he thinks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Nevertheless then the employee becomes unsure. </seg>
<seg id="40"> "Seeing once." </seg>
<seg id="41"> "Herr Zaorálek tells them about the media, they are not supposed to sign and so the people wait still off," she admits consider. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The adjusted rent ends in the biggest part of Czechia to New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty the rent increase is an economic necessity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> "The existing height of the rents does not suffice once for the maintenance of the living-ground" Pavel Klimes argues, the director of the apartment Portfolios of the society RPG Byty and - just the disregard of the apartment ground criticized by the angry tenants is in opinion of the house-owners the main reason for the rent increase. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> During RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the taken rents four billion into the apartments could invest, in the four years of 2011 to 2014 it is supposed to be to 5,2 billion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> On the grossformatigen LCD display at the cover opposite the armchairs in the waiting room of Havíov a few information in a red way radiant emerge in between again and again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> "The rent increases in the year 2011 around 15% and less affect 31 200 apartments, that is more than 90% of the apartments of RPG." </seg>
<seg id="47"> "Always this means at most 7,50 CZK per square meter and month," is to read on the LCD monitor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> Only near 400 apartments from the port folio of RPG the rent increases about 38 percent to itself. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "In these cases it is a question of the rise of extremely small rent prices from 19,66 CZK per square meter," RPG argues. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Near 2600 apartments the rent remains in the next year on same height. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not push up the rents suddenly, but occurs in a step by step way within four and eight years. </seg>
<seg id="52"> What more - that imposes enterprises a further obligation: All gains from the rent increase (see diagram) the enterprise wants to put again into the apartments, particularly into heat savings - into new windows and into the thermal insulation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> But - with first priority people that sign the agreements on the rent increase are supposed to benefit to those ones these. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The architects saw - to the office also a kindergarten belongs </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of the enterprise Arch.Design. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But who would expect here already a minikindergarten, with everything something for this purpose belonged: colorful walls, creative furniture, an amount toy and even a miniplayground on the exterior terrace. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This kindergarten is available since last year to the employees of Arch.Design. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Avriopoint charged the project planning and architecture office Arch.Design whose studios a whole series of constructions in a more of repute way Brünner come from from the first drafts for the new building with the premises for his company mini kindergarten. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In wise foresight, because most of his 90 employees (inside) are in the baby boom age and it suited to the company at that that the Projektantinnen and architects return as quickly as possibly onto their job. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Together with the possibility, it shortens to work, the kindergarten is a further bonus that Arch.Design has to offer to his employees in the draft of their social program. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The construction engineer and architect have it so more easily to bring their pretentious profession and the child welfare under a hat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The minikindergarten is an initial idea of the employees (inside) of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they succeeded in extracting supporting-money of the European Union and the ministry for work and social one for their project. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The company internal minikindergarten is financed to humane resources and to employment politics from means of the European Social Ground and from the state budget through the operation program to the Czech Republic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Thanks to this financing (Subsidies at the level of 2 8 million CZK) the necessary facilities and the equipment could be gotten and for the duration of 2 years is worried for qualified personnel and for the company. </seg>
<seg id="12"> According to the exhaustion of the promotion means (2 years) the society Arch.Design is obliged to keep on practicing the minikindergarten 3 more years onto own costs. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The preparation of this project used a whole year at which the society Economy Rating gave active help during the request handling. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Of the children takes care whole-active qualified personnel - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, children without age-moderate restrictions can go to the kindergarten although most of them are more than three years old. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And since it is a question of a mini-kindergarten at that, only 5 children may be simultaneously present, change, however, the day over several children mutually off. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The kindergarten company is synchronized with the need of the parents flexible, the children of all employees have the same rights with respect to the use of the kindergarten - without regard for the company hierarchy and their respective position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Although it is a question of individual education and care, nevertheless the program contents are comparable in the mini-kindergarten with the general-purpose program of the preschool education. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The children do only not play here, particularly excellent instruction is offered to them - of basic findings up to the preschool instruction, incidentally they also still learn English. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The classroom is endowed not only with toy and creative games, but also with a computer which is available to the children. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Which more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The parents can fling at any time a look onto the children and so the stress is dropped while fetching late the children from a far remote kindergarten. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The parents use therefore their working time more productively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> No miracle, that also natural and loyal employer Arbeitnehmer-Beziehungen develop here. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Arch.Design joined so under the Czech companies that offer clear Benefits with the recruitment of new employees that are family-friendly and confirm their personnel-marketing through such programs. </seg>

<seg id="1"> A bone house fascinated also still after 100 years. Have a look at the Interieure of fun </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The roof seems as the back of a prehistoric saurian, fish mouths torn open are the stairs as the spine of a dinosaur and the Balkone. </seg>
<seg id="3"> That is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="4"> From the local inhabitants the house with his organic forms got the nickname "bone house." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splinters and mosaic's, that facades reminding of scales and omnipresent soft lines, all this are typical features for the Jugendstil of Antonio Gaudi. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The facade of the house plays with marvellous lines, gentle colors and textures that remind of nature and living beings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Before in the case of more exact seeing one does not notice that all of geometry, rhythm and order thought over is governed. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In the night the whole facade seems even more plastic, more dramatic and the specific Anleuchtung still intensifies the shine of the colors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The same swing-full lines and cost forms also the interior of the house master. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wood in a wavelike way shaped even copies the window frames, rails, adornment elements of doors, spyholes and strips. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The house Batlló in the quarter of Eixample at the animated shopping street Passeig de Grácia no. 43 arose through the reconstruction of a house from the year 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese exported. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reconstruction used two years and was finished in 1906. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The investor, the prosperous industrial Josep Batlló, insisted initially on the demolition of the old one and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to the idea of Gaudís onto an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Antoni Gaudí did only not project the apartment house Casa Batlló, however. </seg>
<seg id="15"> He cooperated in this case with the architect Josep Maria Jujol. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Just on his drawing board the decorations arose for the representative apartment of the reality owner and also the use of mosaics at the facade was his idea. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> On the organization of the facade worked, however, also numerous further creators and artists with. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The common work at the drafts for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fertile cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So Jujol participated also in the construction of Gaudís Haus Casa Milá in the park Gueell in which there are also further works of Antoni Gaudí. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Already shortly after his finishing "Knochenhaus" got the house of the local inhabitants of his organic forms because of the nicknames. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Other in turn it called because of the specific window opening mechanism the "yawning house." </seg>
<seg id="22"> One also says very above on the building the sword of the holy Georg is the patron's represented from Catalonia. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But also further sculptural elements symbolize hidden religious motives. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Gaudí projected a central heating system unique for the former time with ventilation channels and typical chimneys for the house. </seg>
<seg id="25"> A little bizarrely their 45-degree-inclination already seems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> During his work Gaudí ignored all former design specifications consistently and could not be disconcerted by any means from these. </seg>
<seg id="27"> For start of building he obtained the corresponding planning and building permission indeed from the city but the information done by it over the planned reconstruction were so vague, that the city fathers were two years later so horrified during the finishing from the result that they demanded remedy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The councillors also disapproved themselves among other things on the construction with his pillars intervening even in the public sidewalk. </seg>
<seg id="29"> To changes more did not come it, however, quite the opposite - only fifteen days according to the related request of the quarter Josep Batlló made a request for the permission of the rental of the two höchstgelegenen storeys of the house - and it was given to him promptly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The house-owner himself moved in in the lower floors. </seg>
<seg id="31"> There was a society parlor in the gallery in the 2nd stick, there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment in the third stick. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The ground floor was leased to a jeweller. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The entire six storey building ran through some stairs to up to the roof terrace. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Through the fundamental elements of the reconstruction all right angles were removed and straight lines and replaced by bent and swung walls. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Gaudí worked, however, also with a modern draft to the mutual connection of rooms. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The social part can completely be combined through the opening of the parlor doors and so a larger society could chat comfortably without having to renounce a certain intimacy in the case of more confidential conversations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The house received also a quite unusual roof and two more storeys through Gaudís reconstruction except for a new facade. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Impressive is also Gaudís game with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles, with which the inner court is covered and the patios. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The game of these two colors gives a maximum of light to all floors of the house. </seg>
<seg id="40"> He shut the principle in this case in a simple way Wear, that white reflects the light better as if Farben that absorbs the sunlight on the contrary for this purpose darkens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> Everyone can go to the house Casa Batlló which was incorporated in 2005 into the world heir list of the Unesco today. </seg>
<seg id="42"> In the first stick the most spacious and most splendid apartment is made accessible to the public. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The house-owners decided only in the year on this step and this on the occasion of the 150.Geburtstags of the famous creator. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> When one found, that this a quite profitable business is, one retained the inspections, yes one also bulged it wider common and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace from. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The price for the inspection of the monument is not, however, a cardboard stem, it is 16,50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist identity cards get 20 percent of reduction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> This amount surpasses the admission charges to other Gaudí-constructions in the city. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Who would like to become acquainted with the real atmosphere of the house with his dragon turrets should attempt, to close friendship with one of the house inhabitants and to visit it at home. </seg>

<hl>
<seg id="1"> The correct mattress and the correct bed rust? Women have other wishes than men </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Not the most fabulous bed frame, but the quality of the sunbathing area - therefore mattress and rust form the good bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> These must complement themselves harmoniously, however, in order to be raked to the wishes of the concrete user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> During the selection many things play a role - the weight, the size, the health state and last but not least also the sex of the sleeper. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Also the interior in which Matratze and rust have to subordinate themselves is just as important. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a weekend house in which regularly does not give a good heat latex mattresses are not well suitable since they need much longer in order to become warm. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition they are clearly heavier than usual polyurethane-mattresses are. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And - they should be turned regular. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If indeed they do not have enough Entlüftungskanälchen in the core and still lie on a firm plate for this purpose, moisture builds up: It is not therefore impossible that mold forms itself under it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> During the choice it plays of course also a role what one is used to. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Who was longer time abroad, where very high mattresses with soft shift are usual, will be able to become accustomed to a low mattress with hard surface heavily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "Presumably all ice hockey players that came back from the NHL complained with me, that they can not sleep here more correctly." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "They simply need a soft shift for their mistreated shoulders, heels and hips from Visco foam (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I recommend these among other things also to diabetic people who suffer from a trouble of the nervous system so that they can receive the information badly of the hinges and the skin," declares Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes on upholstered furniture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Therefore I got already before years to many ice hockey players, however, also other customers these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam). </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Heute is not this any problem more, because the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico offer such mattresses among other things." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And one does absolutely not have to be a famous ice hockey player in order to learn to estimate the advantages of the Visco-Schaums. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" actually very simply functions. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The foam optimalisiert his hardness and form according to the absorbed heat, differently said he cuddles up downright to the warm body at. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Anywhere it does not press, in the night one does not roll over as after a difficult fight. </seg>
<seg id="22"> One sleeps simply much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The viskölastische foam in addition offers also protection from Dekubitus (Wound fire). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> During the choice of the mattress size one should still add the length of the soles of the foot to the height, therefore approx. 21 to 34 cm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Man as woman that is large onto the 180 cm need such a 210 to 220 cm long bed. </seg>
<seg id="26"> At least 90 cm of chaise longue width should be available to each of the sleepers, together therefore 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Near single beds, for example with singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached. </seg>
<seg id="28"> For the sake of the comfort and also for possible visitors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise the following rule of thumb is valid for the ideal bed width: "When one lies on the back," still enough place should "be" for the slightly bent arms," Ing. guesses Helena Prokopová, the guild master of the upholsterers and interior decorators that dedicates herself to the problems of the healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture already for years and presents this topic also on technical schools. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Near a double bed everyone needs an own rust and his own mattress, to look out, however, during the purchase so that the mattresses are high also now. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise nothing else remains, to mount as the rusts in different height and that is not for a long time possible near every bed frame. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, from that at least three centimeters should be allotted to the form shift and the detailed cushion. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "With the hand or while putting down one must not sense the feathers in any case," Helena Prokopová warns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Every mattress requires a specific rust type. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and pad as Siam twins grown together do not have to search anything in the bedroom. </seg>
<seg id="36"> These mattresses can not be ventilated and one can not wash the purchase, which today yes already gang und gäbe is. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And since one loses sweat in a single night between 0,2 to 0,75 l is, clear, that the mattress after five to seven years becomes slow to a gigantic (and were blocked sieve). </seg>
<seg id="38"> Also therefore specialists refuse advertising slogans, that near mattresses a lifespan of up to 25 years, to promise even lifelong guarantee. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Every thing has their if and Aber. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And therefore a practical council of the traders: Near mattresses of 120 or 140 cm of width one should not shun from the hygiene of the washable, strip-off purchases, nevertheless it is recommended to use a mattress schooner which one can remove easily and wash. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even if mattress covers with Rundumreissverschluss are today normally manufactured so that one gets two halves after the opening (immensely important for the scrubbing-process and the washing machine size!) the manipulation with bigger mattresses mutet, particularly only taken out, often as the different fight between David and Goliath at. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> Do they have a firm plate in the bed instead of a rust? </seg>
<seg id="43"> From that in this way! </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or at most for a bed for disliked guests and for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Also so they should put ventilation holes on the plate more gladly (provided that already none are in that) and to use mattresses with feather skeleton and 15 cm least height with so-called bag feather core and detailed cushion. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethane-mattresses do not belong onto such a pad. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For grilles not adjustable with 14 to 18 spring contact strips (Lamellae) latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable (where appropriate also combinations of latex and coconut palms), always rusts with a greater slat number are paid in this case, therefore of 28 and more spring contact strips from, with Lordosenstütze in the lumbar vertebra field and the possibility to adjust the slat hardness. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Onto adjustable lamella rusts no mattresses with feather skeleton belong since they do not react to the ergonomic change. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Next to the attitude of the starch of the spring contact strips also specific flexible shoulder modules are offered. </seg>
<seg id="50"> At that it works in order to push in a specific fixing of the spring contact strips that it facilitates the spring contact strips or really so too verwinkeln, that they facilitate the punctual sinking in of the shoulder of the sleeper. </seg>
<seg id="51"> In particular for men with wide shoulders an important thing. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There are even mattress manufacturers which started using Soft zones for the shoulder field near "gentleman mattresses." </seg>
<seg id="53"> Also onto the ladies is thought - one grants them these soft zones in the hip area. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For most pretentious customers point-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or rusts with point-elastic contact-pads with so-called multitorsion resilience are certain. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure is distributed onto several points through which the tension is reduced. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But - when one to the correct mattress and used a bad (too large and plump) pillow correct rust, most advantages disappear again. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Also here a rule of thumb: the pillow is supposed to support the head, his tops should reach only up to the shoulders so that the deltoid muscles can relax. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Ideal appears therefore 50 x 60 cm big cushion, as for example the Scandinavians like it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In the side situation the pillow (together with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Our modern mattresses had something with the former (filled with hay) straw bags nevertheless common. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern manufacturers always use frequent natural materials or at least their additions. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Also near mattresses the new charm word is called "Bio." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of oil raw materials one uses increasingly more frequently naturelle oils to the production of polyurethane foams - for example castor-oil plant and soya oil. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soja is used presumably by all known manufacturers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> "Are called Bio near mattresses, that their core withstands of materials in that of natural origin," declaredly Petr Vasíek of the company Tropico Plus. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Natural materials become but also during the production of mattress covers uses - one of the first was in this case aloe Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> One can treat oneself, however, also on microcapsules which spread fresh forest or lavender fragrance while sleeping. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Also here one does a difference between Mann and woman. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While with the men a "chilling" essence is being used from birch leaves, so that the mattress cover absorb the heat and it can cool off the body, the purchases have for effect "warming" women. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Extracts from red peppers stimulate the blood circulation, the weaker sex becomes while sleeping therefore wohlig warm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> And the present favorites? </seg>
<seg id="72"> Mattresses of cold foam (he has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and also much more flexible). </seg>
<seg id="73"> More-zone-mattresses that know exactly, where there are head, Hüfte and heels, arise through the combination of the different starch (Hardness) of cold foams and Visco-foams. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> For a high-quality mattress one has to fork out, however, 7000 crowns and more. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Health mattresses are burdened with smaller value added tax, however, usually since they are regarded as medical aids. </seg>
<seg id="76"> As first Czech enterprise Gumotex became this advantage zuteil. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> One sees to economize on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Occasionally there are special offers of manufacturers and traders who offer two mattresses for the price of one. </seg>
<seg id="79"> So the brand Magniflex offers the mattress to Duofreeze with Visco-foam Memory quilted in the purchase for 11.990 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="80"> One gets the second free for this purpose. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the material Tempur which introduced the era of the viskölastischen expanded plastics with open cell structure and high density in almost cosmic speed. </seg>
<seg id="82"> No miracle, nevertheless they were developed for the NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the starts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83"> Tempur becomes with heat soft, in cool environment it consolidates in turn. </seg>
<seg id="84"> So adjusts it to the human body perfectly and distributes the body pressure over optimal manner. </seg>
<seg id="85"> It is not therefore only ideal to the prevention of pressure fire, but it increases the sleep comfort generally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86"> Viskölastische expanded plastics are supposed to provide, however, not only near mattresses, but also with other health products as uses e.g. near specific foot cushions that the legs and the vessels relief. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Native manufacturers use for example the expanded plastics Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products. </seg>

<seg id="4"> The device is currently about as big as a cigarette packet is but already soon it might not be larger, as a wristwatch. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="6"> Also for the price of an influence of their privacy. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "We make an effort for saying to all that it is not at that of spying a question under any circumstances but around an effective means to reduce the probability that it results in the tragedy," Petr Pilin mentions from the society macro because, one of the suppliers of GPS fault-locating units on the Czech market. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> "I admit that it can result in the abuse of such devices on an individual basis for example if one puts it to somebody into the bag without his knowing about that, but we did not have to record up to now such a case to any." </seg>
<seg id="9"> Most customers really buy it for themselves from safety reasons," adds Pilin. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In his opinion the child should always know, however, for which purpose the "box" is used and how one uses it in an emergency. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The child psychologist Dana Boková refers, however, to a child simply ridding it himself from his if it does not like to bear such a thing. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "Also very much small children show great creativity if it is a question of losing certain things on purpose if they do not want to be controlled." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In his opinion similar services would keep up also intelligent mobile telephones navigation perform, one needs to record only a specific software. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The problem of the current fault-locating units consists in it being a question of devices at that either in matchbox size that resemble supporters or around smaller mobiles. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The army has so many fuses, that one could completely wrap around Czechia you to hold, however, only two years </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Czech Army bought 445 kilometers fuses, to be ignited with Sprengsätze. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Per year before the Ministry of Defense had provided with already 224 kilometers onto the army warehouses fuse. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is already calming know, that the armed forces for 225 years have worried. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The problem is only the durability of the fuses - two, at most, however, four years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The army bought the fuses of the limited company STV Group, a. see for foolish 40 million crowns. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In his reason for the purchase of this tremendous amount fuse the general staff MF DNES answered, the soldiers would consume annually fuse onto the 60 kilometers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to the investigations of army pyrotechnists, that spoke TO MF DNES about that, it follows from this specification that the whole army would have to complete an extremely intense pyrotechnic training annually - of all generals and officers of the army command, up to the secretaries and cleaning ladies. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Defense minister Alexandr Vondra and army general Vlastimil Picek not excluded. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Only so the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers fuses could be justified to some extent. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This length corresponds after all to 25.000 detonations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> However, these army supplies would suffice for more than ten years also so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> When, however, still the old rule of experts is valid, that for the training of every new regular soldier two meters completely suffice fuse, then the army got a calming stock through these new purchases - also from the viewpoint of the climbed need of the engineer and special units - for the already mentioned 225 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> In this case soldiers of the quickness use brigade complained recently with the defense minister Vondra, they would not have almost any cartridges for small arms anymore so that firing-exercises are strongly restricted because of the missing means. </seg>
<seg id="15"> To completely be silent from the pants lack. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "I do not understand either why they buy such vast quantities fuses from us." </seg>
<seg id="17"> But finally that is their decision, they will know already what they need it to." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "For us the army is a good customer, that we would like to come as traders largely towards," the marketing manager of the STV Group Jan Dcký says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Jan Pejsek, the speaker of the Ministry of Defense establishes the purchase with that Hunderter kilometer fuse, the army would have provided itself with this "ammunition" so at least for ten years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Jan Dcký of the STV Group even speaks, however, only of two years only from a four year long service life of the fuses and police and army pyrotechnists. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "In the case of perfect storage also the four mentioned years are presumably possible," adds one of them who, however, wants to remain unnamed in order not to be accused of the criticism as a soldier at the army. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the service life any ammunition must be tested thoroughly whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the life of the soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="23"> These tests are not, however, for nothing, but they cost further money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> A further argument of the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers fuse. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "You cost us sixty percent less, as the last year delivery of 244 kilometers," speaker Pejsek informs us of the point of view of the buyers of the Ministry of Defense. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Only for the comparison: The annual consumption of fuses of pyrotechnists of the police that liquidates ammunition from the second world war or the Soviet brother army does not exceed hardly for already some years 1.500 meters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> And the police order always only such amounts of this ammunition which can still consume it before course of the service life. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Already because of the security of the pyrotechnists, in addition one holds the possibility to flexible purchases so more modern and thus also reliable fuses' open. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The Ministry of Defense has anyhow gigantic problems during the liquidation Zehntausender tons of ammunition from times of the Warschauer contract, when the two hundred thousand-headed Czechoslovak nation army prepared itself for their campaign to the Rhine. </seg>
<seg id="30"> According to the pyrotechnists, who spoke TO MF DNES, the same problem expects the Czech armed forces in a few years during the liquidation Hunderter kilometer old fuses, that bought it today so "favorably." </seg>

<seg id="3"> Winner of the last age-group of the competition "Small entrepreneur of the year" became Lukás Pytloun from Liberec. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The history of his success seems as a film scenario. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Lukás Pytloun traveled gladly. </seg>
<seg id="6"> First abroad it became conscious to him that good overnight stay possibilities to reasonable prices are missing in Liberec. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It arose from the savings of his vacation works abroad and with the aid of a bank loan a dilapidated house with five apartments. </seg>
<seg id="8"> If one considers that he was a college student then in the sixth semester, this was surely a courageous venture. </seg>
<seg id="9"> "The former price-quality-relation annoyed me and so I attempted to undertake something against that," says Lukás Pytloun. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> He let out the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He invested the whole profit immediately again in the house which it encircled with 54 beds afterwards step by step to the retirement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Since then he succeeded only in seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec in opening four pensions, two style-just restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of more than 300 beds of all accommodation categories. </seg>

<seg id="1"> I wish my successors a quieter year than we had it in Farmet </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The victory euphoria was dissolved quickly of the consequences of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Thanks to his consistency Farmet has the worst thing behind itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Karel Žárský, the owner of the firm of Farmet, took the price for the first rank of the competition Vodafone Firma the year in the last age-group towards. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The jury acknowledged then the efforts with which it stamped an enterprise from the small tool construction in eská Skalice from the ground that hundreds of millions of turnovers does. </seg>
<seg id="6"> "I can say that this assessment encourages not only me myself, but also all my employees and confirmed our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," says the previous year winner. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At the beginning of the company history of Farmet the effort to do something useful stood. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And when then the state offered his father Karel Žárský as compensation for the property confiscated by the communists a small workshop to the lease, he did long not hesitate, his career in the company in which it was until then busy made whistle and an own company for the production of plastic tubs founded with a few comrades of his father. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Short time later it began to concentrate on vegetable oil presses. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Within 18 years they are to the tallest manufacturers of automatic presses in whole Central Europe climbed up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But first through the success in the mentioned competition and his Medialisierung it kicked in also into the consciousness of the non-compartment public. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "Not only, that our customers perceive the brand Farmet now clearly more intensely, to be able to cooperate with a company that achieved the maximum success in their country, also our foreign partners began the circumstance to attach bigger value," Karel Žárský says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The last year did not stand at Farmet, however, only in the sign of the victory euphoria. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The assessment went out of 2009 from the economical results of the enterprise in the year 2008 and a part. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And in just 2009 the most difficult year was for the sale of tool construction products. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The crisis, that then still less the citizens, but particularly enterprise shook, reached just their climax - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and to restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "We could not escape this situation of course either." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "The turnovers fell off about 40 percent, we had to restrict the production and catch even to dismissals," declares Karel Žárský </seg>
<seg id="19"> A viable enterprise must take also such unpopular measures sometimes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Succeeded, however, in getting the situation into the grip and holding the company in the black also when with smaller profits, than before the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="21"> At one the enterprise was not willing to do cutbacks - with the investments in the research and development. </seg>
<seg id="22"> "From the subsidy we built a research and training center, we confirmed our presentation on international fairs and we gained main prices in the case of domestic exhibitions," says Žárský. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Everything shows that we had overcome the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The turnovers also increase again and with them the number of new employees. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "I wish the new winner a lot of joy of the victory - however in quieter atmosphere, Karel Žárský makes be orientated." </seg>

<seg id="1"> An opinion poll which tidies up senseless rules </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The opinion poll around the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneur competition for the fourth time. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Some senseless rules it succeeded already, to obtain from the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The duty became the doubtful winner of the next age-group of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the year," to get documents onto authorities, to be available the online ones. </seg>
<seg id="5"> So more than one third decided of not completely four thousand voice-giving entrepreneurs. </seg>
<seg id="6"> So the social security administration demanded a paper departure from the commercial register, even if the official would have been able to call it up through two mouse clicks. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Thanks to the opinion poll this is changed now. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "The Czech Social Security Administration will not demand in future in the case of controls any departures from the commercial register anymore from social security payers," mentioned the speaker of SSZ Jana Buraová. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It is sense and purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the year" to take all rules and orders under the magnifier to have to be given to the entrepreneurs in Czechia and to disconnect the senseless ones. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is a part of an entrepreneur competition this year already for the fourth time, that of the tsch. Economic newspaper (HN) is organized and delighted popularity increasing in public. </seg>
<seg id="11"> When in the last year onto the three thousand persons at the vote involved, it was this year already four thousand. </seg>
<seg id="12"> No miracle, because still there is an amount of legal duties that only and only for this purpose serve for hindering the enterprise activity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "What affects for example the number of the income tax forms, we take a front rank in the world one," Karel Havlíek of the union of small and centrally located enterprises and traders of the Czech Republic notices. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The simplification of the entrepreneurial activity is in the last years the proclaimed objective of all governments. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In the comparison to the world the situation hardly improved in Czechia, however. </seg>
<seg id="16"> According to information of the World Bank Czechia takes the 74th rank with respect to the enterprise conditions, in the comparison to the previous year one around eight places worse placement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The competition absurdity of the year was called out for the first time in the year and happens every year according to same scenario. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Everyone can announce administrative and bureaucratic nonsense of April up to the copy deadline of the competition at the end of September. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used for the registration. For that the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "antiprice" and the public makes vote on the Internet on the web pages www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It the absurdity that gets most voices triumphs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Already more than a hundred were said to the this year's opinion poll in a more exact way, 105 senseless rules and orders announced. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are so for example also regulations, that maintenance vehicles have to pay toll for motorways and expressways or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must do every two years. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The list of the this year's "seven" is published on the pages of the competition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The proclamation of the competition in each case at the beginning of November on the Prager Wenzelsplatz is part of a happening which also personalities of the political and public life participate in regularly. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This year was for example Eva Svobodová, the directress of the association of small or centrally located enterprises and traders of the Tsch. Republic as well as Petr Kuel, the president of the chamber of commerce of the Tsch. Republic near the climax of the competition with of the lot. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "Where the state flings the entrepreneurs sticks between the legs, there can not be any real economical upswing, therefore it is my objective to pick up every year of at least thirty Paragrafen that today complicate their enterprises for the entrepreneurs still unnecessarily," Martin Kocourek, the minister of industry and trade with, split up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The efforts to obtain senseless orders from the world show effect. </seg>
<seg id="29"> In the year 2007 the duty imposed on entrepreneurs disturbed the people the most, to have to announce to the trade office at the place of their constant firm three days in advance the intention to want to go with a booth to an exhibition or kermess. </seg>
<seg id="30"> This duty was canceled by virtue of a novelette of the trade law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The duty, that 2007 the second-largest number the voices' kept - the duty, to have to announce official trips of employees to the labor office in the extent up to 30 days - so-called "Green Party member Karte" was eliminated through the law about them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> And - all good things' are three: </seg>
<seg id="33"> The regulation that imposed it on physiotherapists was chosen for the absurdity of the year 2009 in the consulting room a mirror, a refrigerator and two scales have stood. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This regulation was quite moderated by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare this year - the refrigerator duty was omitted. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Pilsner ground grounds - arrests of the police at a public announcement </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the building of the ground ground in Pilsen the anticorruption police carried out in the last days arrests. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In this case the local media-entrepreneur and estate agent Lubos G. was led away to handcuffs by the detectives. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This had attempted supposedly to manipulate a just occurring public competition for the handling of restitution claims so that the plots offered in the competition fell to a concrete prospective customer. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Half a million is supposed to have paid this Lubos G. for that. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "To this time I can only confirm that the police follow a person because of the offense of fraudulent machinations at a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner one prosecution of the newspaper "Právo," it can not give further details with regard to the current investigations. </seg>
<seg id="7"> 24 hours later the 46-year old entrepreneur was released by the police again. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In which way it could manipulate the public competition, one can only speculate on that faced with the sparse official information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The speaker of the Lubomír erná ground ground led onto the related question from Právo, the police carried out arrests in the Pilsner branch of the ground ground in fact and this during a public competition. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "It was a question around a client and by no means of one of our employees," it concretized. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The public competition had followed woman erná the correct denomination "Request to the offer delivery of claims to the transfer of plots according to the ground law" and would occur in cases in which several proposers express interest at the offered plot. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "These persons offer within the framework of the request a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled through the transfer, as the property value called out." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "According to the offered claims the precedence of the potential acquirers is defined, afterwards the ground fund transmits the plot to the person with the highest offer," the speaker of the ground declares. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Information were available to Lubos G. obviously, who had enrolled himself there onto the request and since he himself was an entitled person since it a series of restitution claims had been bought he offered one plot interests, that he withdraws from the competition. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Obviously against a fat compensation. </seg>
<seg id="16"> That would be also a sufficient declaration for why he had such a great amount of money during his arrest with himself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Lubos G. had already in the past far too good contacts to the Pilsner ground fund. </seg>
<seg id="18"> So he played also in the Causa of the former head of the ground ground Václav Sankota a role which was pursued legally because he handed over in replacement restitutions plots to which already location decisions to projects had been made. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Then Lubos G. of the ground fund acquired for example also plots that were certain to the construction of public streets, in a more exact way said, at the place where the construction of the Zufahrtsmagistrale to the trade area Borské poles was planned. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Later he exchanged these very favorably with the municipal council for a house directly in the historical center of the city which climbed over the value of the plots far. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The city hall had to endanger then heavy Herzens Kleinbeigeben in order the project not through the blocking of the plots. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The living-costs of the budgets increase around some hundreds monthly </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The budgets do not have to reckon from January only higher costs for all energy kinds, but also with higher water and waste water fees and for Fernwärme and mancherorts also the rents increase. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Families will have to pull January several hundreds of crowns monthly more so off from the purse than up to now. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Stream becomes to about 4,6 percent more expensive, gas around 2 percent and more, in some cities one will have to pay more up to a tenth for water deliveries and mancherorts also the long-distance heating deliveries increase in price. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Only the stream price increase costs some a hundred crowns more to the apartment budgets annually. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The heavy current prices were reduced in this case by all main suppliers, the clear promotion of the electric power production is guilty therefore from renewable sources, in particular from photovoltaics installations. </seg>
<seg id="7"> If gas becomes only moderately more expensive the most then exactly the people indeed this, however, must heat, and they have the highest consumption. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Also here some a hundred crowns more per annum are to be reckoned therefore. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> During stream and gas in whole Czechia teuerer become, the prices are different for long-distance heating from city to city. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Particularly bigger places' level increases in prices. </seg>
<seg id="11"> So more must pay for example the budgets for Fernwärme monthly in Pardubice and Hradec Králové from January up to 50 crowns, more than 1000 crowns more per annum pay families in Liberec. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> To threaten the inhabitants of Prague in turn 9 percent of higher water and waste water fees and this for the case, that the city increases the infrastructure rent. </seg>
<seg id="13"> If the rent is not changed, it is only 6,8 percent. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The price heard in Prague in comparison with whole Czechia, however, also furthermore to the lowest. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In the north Bohemia, where the prices belong already now to the highest, water and waste water fees are supposed to increase around 7,4 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Enormous rent price increases are to be expected for example in 140.000 flat lets for rent near which from January the so-called rent regulation is omitted. </seg>
<seg id="17"> So for example the CPI apartment enterprise intends to increase Byty that has 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem the rents from January like about a hundred percent. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Who with this rent increase does not agree agreed, the enterprise wants to prosecute that one judicially. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The adjusted rents which one pays today still in approximately 300.000 apartments might go up next year around more than 10 percent. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it simply seems too slow </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Fernet, rum and vodka, by way of exception also once a good whiskey that one stole from the father from the house bar. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Those ones are the drinks, according to whose pleasure drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen most frequently are need-treated must. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Children that must sleep off their tomcat repeated in the hospital are not an exception. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> This follows from the experiences of doctors which are confronted with similar cases by clinics in the photo of the child departments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "Beer or wine are complete from the fashion because it long lasts simply too until one is drunk." </seg>
<seg id="7"> "The present trend is unequivocally hard alcohol," said Právo Ludk Pelikán, the medical superintendent of the child department, in the middle-Bohemian clinic Hoovice. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "Whiskey, when succeeds in stealing a bottle from the father from the house bar, and otherwise, then at least Fernet or vodka. </seg>
<seg id="9"> "Vodka has the advantage that one can mix it with Juice then it does not smell so strongly," the medical superintendent declares. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The speaker of the department hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives to him right. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Most "frequently it is a question of Fernet or Of that." </seg>
<seg id="12"> "That is the present alcohol trend, in particular at elementary schools." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Occasionally it was a question also of Slibowitz that one takes along from home" Ms Jurinová mentioned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> According to medical superintendent Pelikán alcoholics thirteen or fourteen year old are not an exception appearance in the hospital photo for a long time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Before the clinic in Hoovice which he works on since this year it was for ten years active in the pediatrics department of the hospital Motol, where the rescue cars tipsy pupils from near and far from delivered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "A girl had to be hospitalisiert four times." </seg>
<seg id="17"> "She began your career with 12 years, als sie the first time with 3,5 per mille of alcohol in the blood and still for this purpose in combination with "Extase" was delivered," the doctor described an especially difficult case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "It was in the exhibition grounds in Holesovice on some dance party." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "That was interesting, that it occurred their mother not at all strange, that their daughter" did not "come" home 48 hours, the medical superintendent is surprised. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Just the missing interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance while activating with the own grafts is regarded as one of the main causes for the wachsenden alcoholism of children. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is not a question of a real dependence in the true sense of the word according to experts with children. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "Under alcoholism a long-standing chronic dependence on the alcohol along with all in this way is hanging together phenomenon understand and that is not the case with these children." </seg>
<seg id="23"> At those who enjoy alcohol repeatedly mostly a more negatively familiar-social background is characteristic," declares medical superintendent Pelikán. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The speaker of the hospital Motol, according to Ms Jurinová, were sent until middle November approximately forty drunk children in the local department of child and youth medicine. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Yet only the cases with difficult alcohol poisoning that required a stay in hospital come in into the statistics. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Drunk children are not registered who are brought home by the police after out-patient treatment of the parents or where appropriate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Except for the cases, in which children only it gives to drink up such a bottle of liquor once in the school bench in opinion of gentlemen Pelikán three seasonal amplitudes onto which in an one hundred percent way Verlass is: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> "The last-named one for two reasons - either from grief because of the bad report or from joy onto the vacations." </seg>
<seg id="29"> "In the Walpurgisnacht I already saw seven drunk children at the same time in the photo," stresses doctor Pelikán. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> A drunk child that spends the night under medical supervision is switched on paradoxically better, as a child that has to fight only with an unpleasant tomcat on the next day. </seg>
<seg id="31"> One can market the headaches at the morning after that that stem from the dehydration and from the glucose lack in the hospital indeed with a liquid-donating drip with glucose and nutrients that the organism lacks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> "You are switched on unequivocal better, because after the "marvellous" experience at the evening, they wake up with good mood without something doing sorely somewhere." </seg>
<seg id="33"> "You are only a little confused about that where they are" doctor Pelikán adds with which it spoils the patients the good mood sometimes at least through that when it counts them the costs, that will cost it to the treatment. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Because the transportation with the rescue car and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly to a few zig a Thousand Crowns. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Occasionally I have that than education means uses if I have vorgerechnet to the children directly during the doctor's round, what cost their drunkenness and that it can absolutely happen, that they once the whole vacations over" doctor Pelikán added "to have to work in order to earn the money for an only such party." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> In his opinion the health insurances do not reach, however, for recourse procedures, to demand around the costs of the parents necessary for the cure of the drunken children. </seg>

<seg id="12"> A new airplane took over the army in July, the second wants to take it over until end of this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to Pejsek EADS committed itself to putting through the fighter aircraft into the outfit of one of the NATO-countries. </seg>
<seg id="14"> "In the contract it is klipp and clearly mentioned that the enterprise EADS is customer of the airplanes L-159 and that these are supposed to be used for the training of pilots of the NATO-countries. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="17"> The barter of five L-159 against an airliner Casa and the purchase of further airplanes for 3,5 billion crowns had still been approved of in the last year by the government from Mirek Topolánek. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The Ministry of Defense had not written out then any announcement procedure for the purchase, but that spoke TO EADS directly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The former defense office argued, this exchange will support the future export of the L-159 abroad. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The Czech army bought Äro from 72 machines from which she uses only 24, she wanted to dispose of the rest. </seg>

<seg id="21"> The purchase of the airplanes Casa might have after all also still a judicial consequence. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defense indeed at the European Court of Justice. The reason? The airplanes due to a whole-European announcement would have had to select it and by no means through addressing of an only manufacturer. </seg>

<seg id="1"> A longer forefinger than ring fingers means a lower risk, to fall with cancer ill </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Men, whose forefinger is long, as the ring finger, are obvious one exposed to smaller risk, to fall with prostate gland cancer ill. </seg>
<seg id="3"> That is the surprising result of a study which was published by the British Journal of Cancer on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="4"> That is supposed to be associated indeed with the mirror of the masculine hormone testosterone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Our results show, that the relative length of the fingers can serve for the risk of prostate gland cancer as a simple test and this in particular with men to sixty," the Mitautorin of the study, Ros Eeles, declared professor at the oncology institute at the university in Warwick. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The finger could help so to determine which men should absolutely subject themselves to a prostate gland cancer test particularly, if genetic risks or other factors of risk are available, as for example familiar sanitary loads, Ms Eeles added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In the period of 1994-2009 she hunted more than 1500 patients with prostate gland cancer with their colleagues in Britain, simultaneously however also 3000 healthy men. </seg>
<seg id="8"> With more than half of the participants of the study the forefinger was shorter to the right hand than the ring finger was. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The same probability of prostate gland cancer was valid for these men, as for 19 percent of those men, whose struggling and showing-finger were now long. </seg>
<seg id="10"> With men that Zeigefinger was longer than the ring finger this risk sank, however, around 33 percent, with men to sixty quite about 87 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The relation of the length of the two mentioned fingers that form themselves already in the pränatalen age reflects obviously the different mirrors of sex hormones to which the child was misfired in the womb. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Less testosterone corresponds to a longer forefinger. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Former investigations showed that the testosterone just speeds up the growth of prostate gland cancer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Václav Paes, leading Czech geneticist and former chairpersons of the academy of the sciences, TK said, this study is fleetingly known to him, nevertheless he does not hold the relation for "completely proven" between the finger length and the cancer risk up to now. </seg>

<seg id="6"> The Gelatiere, in German a little outmoded the ice confectioner, the cream makes according to all rules of the Italian egg maker art. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Gelataio gets the ice cream with a putty knife from the cold shelves, it deletes into the waffle and she sells then. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In order to know that, one does not have to go after Anzola dell'Emilia in the Bologne province. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But who would like to know still more above ice that one does not pass by the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The manufacturer fitted out the egg-university from ice machines in the year 2003 so that the ice cream is raked to the high Italian ideals everywhere from his machines. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The three day long basic course for future Gelatieri has the biggest inflow and visitor from all world. </seg>
<seg id="12"> There are, however, also more days special courses about around the chocolate ice and practical trainings in the in-house ice-cream parlor. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Some dreams in the Midlife-Crisis about a new career, others venture simply once onto the smooth ice of their vague longing-addictions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> This time 40 participants are it from 19 countries of all continents - of Brazil above Hungary to Saudi Arabia. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food-movement and wants to offer the industrial Ice-Cream a European quality product in the future in the country. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Anke from Berlin is management consultant and wants some Own eintüten after years in a nerve-racking job. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Two young Egyptians dream about opening an ice-cream parlor in Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to correct the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because their children love Italian ice cream. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Mästro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream first of all. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Decisive is not only good taste, but also the silky pliability and the good consistency. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Luciano forgets the cream hood of the national and anyway südländischen projecting part during his training but neither: "Italienisches Gelato is simply the best thing - and then still every amount of romanticism in this case is." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first step to the production seems very simple. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Milk, cream, milk powder, sugars and stabilizers into a big blender which arouses everything with an electronic program on 85 degrees and cools off immediately on four degrees then, tilts the basic ingredients to Luciano. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Then he opens a cock at the machine, and out a pasteurized white base cream, basis, comes for all milk ice sorts. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Immediately the university lecturer is bombarded with questions: Can one manufacture ice cream only with natural materials without stabilizer? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How one can let the own experiment pleasure free race? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Luciano warns before making oneself be led from the spirit of the time into the insane. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients," used possibly in spite of that stabilizers - mostly a natural product, about Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Of course one can manufacture ice also without stabilizer, only it must be sold then within a day, otherwise it collapses in itself, and the customer bites open loud ice granules'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Certain variations at the groundmass are allowed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It becomes more thrilling with the aromas. </seg>
<seg id="32"> For the taste in the ice maestro Luciano differentiates between the ingredients which one buys in the fruit-department or with the sweets of the supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Furthermore there is powders and pastes gives. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "The suppliers" attempt to turn on to you dozens flavored additions all." </seg>
<seg id="35"> "However, you should experiment simply once." </seg>
<seg id="36"> Either at the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Or now at the ice cream from the white groundmass, which becomes the yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder for the basis for all possible chocolate seductions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Now may the course participants onto the ice machines. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano lets it to each four different kinds of Vanilla-, to manufacture chocolate, espresso and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the groundmass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additions. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Also the fruit ice-cream sorts are subjected to the same experiment. </seg>
<seg id="41"> More aroma materials, more fruit puree - that is not flavorful absolutely better. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Haselnuss-Eis does not taste absolutely nuttier if it contains more hazelnuts. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The most popular kiwi ice makes the team that uses more fruits less water and a little less stabilizer. </seg>
<seg id="44"> First a balanced mixture lifts the taste of a Gelato correctly out, says Luciano. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Ice production is an arithmatical problem: If peach-puree with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar part must be reduced in the basic prescription. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For Zitroneneis an extraportion of sugar is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano pulls out a device with which it determines the sugar content of the fruit sorts (Wine-growers measure in this way the Öchsle in the must of grapes). </seg>
<seg id="48"> For the luck tables relieve the Rechnerei. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Making ice does not require more so much physical use as formerly. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Not only the device for the automatic production of the base sizes helps. </seg>
<seg id="51"> There is also a device in which the ready egg-mixture simultaneously cremig is beaten and chilled on minus temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="52"> All automatization zum Trotz small breakdowns are not missing. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The Brazilian Gustavo stains themselves and his course colleagues of above up to below with fruit puree, than it the over-size stick mixer out of hand turns out. </seg>
<seg id="54"> "In every course," maestro Luciano means, "it is only a question of the time until something like that happens." </seg>

<seg id="3"> The expert group of Testbiotech which defines itself as an independent institute for the consequence estimate of the biotechnology formulates this reproach now. </seg>
<seg id="4"> "It rings as a conspiracy theory, but we documented it well," said Testbiotech-leader Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The conductor of the Efsa expert group for gene-technical changed plants, Harry Kuiper, and Ilsi under contract are a further Efsa-expert for years also with the lobbyist association. </seg>
<seg id="6"> That one is paid by company groups as Monsanto, Nestle or Bavarian. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Kuiper cooperated in the Efsa-specifications in a leading way for gene plants and stands in this way in a clear interest conflict, criticizes Then. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The Efsa-rules are word-identical sale-wisely with position papers to the Ilsi and would bear in this way the handwriting of the industry which actually is supposed to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It is already the second time that Testbiotech criticizes an interfood collision. </seg>
<seg id="10"> So a hochrangige Efsa manageress is youngest without editions or transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta - and changed in this way the pages. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also the Central German radio (MDR) had revealed recently staff connections between controlling EU authority and industry lobby, which made the Federal Office for Environment Protection poorly soundproofed just the same as EU parliamentarians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Meanwhile the Efsa can not recognize any interest conflict. </seg>
<seg id="13"> One falls back to all serious data, also onto such of the industry as long as they are from high professional quality it is called in a comment. </seg>
<seg id="14"> One does not demand of the experts who work for Efsa that they do not have any contacts to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="15"> You would have to disclose these, however. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Kuiper grants his work for the International Life Sciences institutes (Ilsi) in the USA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This calls himself neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for the risk estimate for biotechnology without lobby task. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In the thing independent experts as Then criticize, that gene-technical changed plants are approved currently without any feeding attempt at animals and is tested the reaction of gene plants to environmental impacts not. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We want to know what for example gene-technically changed corn does on the field," says Then. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Present practice is it, only isolated proteins, not to test the whole gene plant, however, what does not supply any dependable results. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "If one does not search the risks, as one is supposed "to find" it then"?, Then asks accusing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Also Angelika Hilbeck sees that like this. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The scientist researches since 1994 in the gene technique and is currently active at the Technical Zurich College. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The industry attempts on this field as in the USA now also in Europe more and more, critical scientists to influence or to discredit. </seg>
<seg id="25"> There are hardly yet therefore researchers that did not intertwine with company groups. </seg>
<seg id="26"> For enterprises critical studies would normally not be published. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "The industry controls the security research," says Hilbeck. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The track of the stones </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Uli Gsell also has itself which one gets, about in total 400 kilos. </seg>
<seg id="3"> At the Monday evening it stood before the Stuttgart railway station, the tuba on the back. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It was demo. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It snowed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The history is known: In September the diggers had moved up and had begun to break off a big piece of the north wing. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Stuttgart world was not the same one anymore: Zigtausende demonstrated against S21, the billion-heavy Tieferlegung of the railway station. </seg>
<seg id="8"> When it resulted in the construction stop, a majority of the wing lay in ruins. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, used in between 1914 and 1920. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It safeguarded a few of the pieces. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "These stones are relics." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "You must not disappear." </seg>
<seg id="15"> He swarms: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and erdenhaft." </seg>
<seg id="16"> When he sawed off one, that one smelt of cigarette smoke. </seg>
<seg id="17"> He does not know what it will do with the pieces yet. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Stones have time. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Uli Gsell also. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The track of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest near Tübingen onto a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen established his stone-empire. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The 44-year long one sells old stones. </seg>
<seg id="22"> He bought all which accumulated with the demolition in Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "It would be a disgrace, they would be milled to gravel or in the dump disappear," he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen that once was a guard cottage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Sworn and threatened one has it, he tells when in September in the newspapers it was that he bought the residues of the north wing of the breaking off entrepreneur. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But he talked to the S-21-Gegnern, for days. </seg>
<seg id="26"> And it declared to them, that it nevertheless nothing now at all for the demolition can. </seg>
<seg id="27"> And if it happens now, it is nevertheless the most reasonable thing then if the stones were reused. </seg>
<seg id="28"> About 200 S-21-Gegner took along then one the on average 80 kilos difficult ashlar, unit price 6,50 to 14 euros. </seg>
<seg id="29"> As souvenirs, unites, however, also in the hope to be able to return it at a reconstruction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 big truck loads. </seg>
<seg id="31"> About half stores still in the forest, the rest is for a long time sold. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Gartenbesitzer, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer. </seg>
<seg id="33"> From everywhere they came and would have way-lugged, which trunk and supporter could carry. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The Stuttgart stones of the impulse changed for a long time into "Mäuerle" or in limitations of cabbage beds. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Actually this stone is not anything special," says Rongen. </seg>
<seg id="36"> "The political component would not be." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> It climbs in his ground cars, a tour does through his 20 hectares big empire. </seg>
<seg id="38"> He studied and broke off law, late biology, then he was interested in computers and finally Steinhändler became. </seg>
<seg id="39"> And stone lover. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> It stores 40000 tons of stones. </seg>
<seg id="41"> From whole Germany it carts his treasures together. </seg>
<seg id="42"> He says he is the tallest old stone trader of the republic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> It brakes. </seg>
<seg id="44"> In the snow lie artistically hewed sandstone. </seg>
<seg id="45"> "You belonged once to the Dresdner Marienbrücke," he tells. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Yellow Elbsandstein, warm, he swarms. </seg>
<seg id="47"> "My favorite stone." </seg>
<seg id="48"> It works the way high through the forest. </seg>
<seg id="49"> It points at a heap: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruher of Bahnhofs. </seg>
<seg id="50"> And wider. </seg>
<seg id="51"> "Beautiful travertine." </seg>
<seg id="52"> Once the ashlars belonged to the bleacher of the inhabitant of Stuttgart Neckarstadions. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Everywhere in the snow stones and histories, Cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the cathedral Sankt Blasien, tuff of the Heilbronner hospital. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> Which work, which efforts, which sweat. </seg>
<seg id="55"> If Rongen thinks of that, were hit as the stones formerly by hand and they were moved with simple tackle blocks and ox carts, he becomes very reverential. </seg>
<seg id="56"> "Nevertheless it would be a scandal, when one would become so some schreddern." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57"> He did not become empire, stone-rich already not at all. </seg>
<seg id="58"> But the stone trader employs 14 people today, in addition stone-cutters, a sculptor, a smith, a glass blower and a garden farmer sat down above in the forest. </seg>
<seg id="59"> "We work in a hard way, but it is satisfactory," says the Resteverwerter. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Talent fight for High-Potentials </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> There is it reger crush at the sideboard. </seg>
<seg id="3"> 16 students push themselves around salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweet. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Technical Brunswick University and the car builder Volkswagen invited the machine building and design students to a Workshop. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In a kind of idea competition should they together with VW developers about the car of the future fachsimpeln - and to become acquainted with Volkswagen very incidentally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In the contest around the cleverest heads many enterprises go in the meantime into the infighting and set, as VW, on co-operations with the universities. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Your mission: To recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the lecture halls before they come to the labor market and are umworben by others. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And because the universities no installations over the services of their students hand over, attempted to spot one the exception talents in practice projects and to tie to himself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> On the second day of the Workshops at the TU Brunswick the car company group solicits the talents. </seg>
<seg id="10"> A young lady from the personnel department distributes ball-point pens, rubber bears and folders with VW-logo. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It tells the hopeful young talents about practical training programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the company group. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Nico Selle of the TU Brunswick is in charge of the project with VW. </seg>
<seg id="13"> He sees the advantages for both pages: "The students get into contact to the industry and gain experiences." </seg>
<seg id="14"> Students can become acquainted with VW simultaneous, interesting candidates look at themselves nearer and consider who as employees into consideration would come." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Such co-operations are not, according to Selle, unusual. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It is new that the students are wooed so offensively. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Otherwise the emphasis rather lay on the professional project," Selle says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The fight for those ones fresh to graduates will become presumably even harder. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In many branches the enterprises can not select themselves their employees more from a big crowd of applicants. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But they must recommend themselves and especially around highly qualified workers croon. </seg>
<seg id="21"> There are particularly graduates from the engineer disciplines in an excellent negotiation position in this case. </seg>
<seg id="22"> According to the association of German Engineers VDI more than 40.000 engineer places remained in October vacant. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And the so-called engineer gap will become even bigger according to VDI-predictions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> For the economic examination and consultation enterprise KPMG Roman Dykta goes onto the talent hunt. </seg>
<seg id="25"> He organizes extensive Recruiting-events as about the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern escalope hunt, at which the participants must find their way by means of GPS-coordinates. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The enterprise wants to send eight promising students so in the next year through the USA crossways. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Very incidentally the participants can have a look at KPMG-branches and become acquainted with the enterprise. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Who with may, decides in two selection rounds previously. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies into the USA. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> In the case of the blanking and twinge around the High Potentials at the universities the guns become increasingly bigger according to Dykta. </seg>
<seg id="31"> "We want to remove ourselves with the Race from the mass." </seg>
<seg id="32"> "Only one simpler Segeltörn was us too little." </seg>
<seg id="33"> For talent hunter Dykta the bill seems to open. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "We have until today contact with all participants of a similar action in the last year." </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Some stand shortly before their end and want to apply soon to us," he says. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="36"> Next to the direct beloved at the campus particularly small and medium-sized enterprises go also very classically onto the deerstalking in the case of professional fairs. </seg>
<seg id="37"> "We attempt to reach graduates on trade fairs." </seg>
<seg id="38"> "About on the Intersolar," Sitha Stübe, personnel head, tells with the heliotechnology manufacturer Solarworld. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The Bonner enterprise employs about 1500 employees in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Stübe knows about the junior staff problems. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Currently 35 places are advertised on the enterprise web site. </seg>
<seg id="42"> "It is just very heavy to fill vacant positions." </seg>
<seg id="43"> "That costs a lot of time and money," she says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> A further way is the contact about the uni-professors. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Solarworld co-operates with different colleges, about the university, in Freiberg. </seg>
<seg id="46"> "The professors give tips, that one can do practical trainings with us or write his master's thesis." </seg>
<seg id="47"> Expensive advertising campaigns are not announced with the solar specialist. </seg>
<seg id="48"> For that the enterprise attempts with other advantages to advertise itself: Personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and slight communication. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "A big concern can often not offer that," says personnel head Stübe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> Money does not play the title role anymore for a long time during the job search. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Flexible working times, child care or good rise possibilities are further decisive factors. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Solarworld occupied the 55th place with a study of the Great Place to Work Instituts among the 100 best employers of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The institute creates an annual Bestenliste of German employers. </seg>
<seg id="54"> For this purpose employee consults it as in a satisfied way they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the general conditions for the employees. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Personnel head Stübe expects also pluses from the placement at the job-searching ones. </seg>
<seg id="56"> "I think that applicants look about a potential employer especially according to external evaluations," she says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57"> Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Akademie advises enterprises which want to establish themselves a good call with a long-term strategy as employers. </seg>
<seg id="58"> He recommends his customers more authenticity. </seg>
<seg id="59"> And that means, aloud Kriegler, particularly internal measures. </seg>
<seg id="60"> "The best way to make oneself attractive as an employer leads about the own employees," he says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> In the branch jargon that is called internal Employer Branding, that is employer brand education, within the own staff. </seg>
<seg id="62"> "Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors." </seg>
<seg id="63"> If one treats his people well and they identify with the enterprise, then they would advertise their employer very by oneself with friends and acquaintances. </seg>
<seg id="64"> "That is as a game with gang," says Kriegler. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Before the coast of the Florida US Federal state in the golf of Mexico there will not be in the coming years any new drilling for oil. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The government issued a corresponding prohibition in Washington - and so that finally their former plans revoke. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Also before the Atlantic coast new drillings keep on being forbidden for the time being. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar informed of this on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Trigger for the strict prohibition which at least is supposed to be valid for the coming five years is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Before the misfortune, that eleven workers the life cost and to the greatest environmental disaster of the USA led, president Barack Obama had signaled on pressure of the opposition and the industry his willingness to approve new drillings in the eastern part of the golf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The proponents want to reduce in this way the dependence of the USA on oil deliveries from the exterior. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Who bears the responsibility for the disastrous oil pollution in the golf is not until today definitively clarified. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In the center of the criticism the British bp energy company group stands which is confronted with billion demands. </seg>
<seg id="11"> An investigation commission in the task Obamas is supposed to present their results in the course of December. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In October Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar had canceled the drilling-stop imposed after the explosion. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In the connection different oil company groups had made immediately requests for new drilling-projects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> With sharper controls and more severe safety regulations Obama and Salazar want to exclude a recent disaster. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Currently the responsible control authority which had fallen into disrepute after numerous corruption reproaches is reformed basically. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In parallel to that Obama announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas company groups. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The industry warns now in public against the supporting-amount turning out in the golf through a more severe regulation in a clearly smaller way than up to now. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "The plans of the government are the biggest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industry," the result of a current branch inquiry says through the consultant company BDO - still before the drilling-prohibition of Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The American Energy Alliance laments furthermore the insecurity in the branch: "Nobody knows what will be changed with the regulation exactly." </seg>
<seg id="20"> Investments in new promotion projects would be postponed for the time being - at the expense of the growth. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells as at the service station: Billions of liters of crude oil run out destroyed the nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The people live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Celestine Akpobari means it well. </seg>
<seg id="5"> "Does not trouble you off," the eco-activist calms the journalists: "You will get today still enough oil sludge before the lens." </seg>
<seg id="6"> The 37-year old Nigerian pursued the attempt to photocopy one up to the breast in the water of wading boy with the striaes surrounding it: In the regenbogenfarbenen water shine the scene seems almost pretty. </seg>
<seg id="7"> That under the surface brown crude oil swaths float is not to be seen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Formerly it collected here bucket-wise prawns, tells Esther Badom at the shore of the Bodo-Jetty-river. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Meanwhile the sluggish fluent waters are completely dead. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Five years ago vast quantities poured from a burst pipeline crude oil into the gigantic wetlands. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Fisherman from the small town seemed likely now six hours must row Bodo in order to reach fish-containing waters: The Ogoniland sited in the heart of the Niger delta is regarded as one of the most badly verpesteten regions of the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> On the journey through the mangrove swamps durchzogenen of courses the whole extent of the devastation becomes obvious. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Instead of the motorboat churns up bright water brown gravy who his hand dives into the water, pulls out oily fingers. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The roots of the Mangrovenbäumchen jut out as black licorice poles from the ground, sadly palms to be found occasionally leave their whisks. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Bird flocks as they are usual in wetlands otherwise one searches in vain: As soon as the outboard motor keeps quiet, spooky rest expands in the former paradise smelling as a service station. </seg>
<seg id="16"> "What happens here is an ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari darkly: "We live in constant danger for the health." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The war comparison is made. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battlefield umkämpftes since decades: Here the first Explorateure penetrated from Europe more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance organized itself in the 80er-Jahren with the later exekutierten writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the shell company group had to stop in 1993 his production because it became too dangerous for his oil workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Still today the return is refused to the enterprise according to Ogoniland: During from the entire delta region of the triple size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling-sources and 7000 kilometers of pipelines daily more than two million barrel of the black gold are pumped, the oil fields are fallow in the Ogoniland, the situation is too unstable to the company group. </seg>
<seg id="20"> All paar a Hundred Meters jut out stählerne frames as bizarre sculptures of the water: "Christbäumchen" is mentioned the heads of the boreholes much too gently. </seg>
<seg id="21"> You are up to 50 years old, most to in the mark corrodes. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Again and again such a chuck breche auseinander, thinks Akpobari, then a constant stream crude oil runs into the water. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> More than two billion liters flowed into the ecological system of the delta after expert estimates in 50 years: Year for year the amount of oil, as it penetrated the sea with the average of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago before Alaska - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of the mankind. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Who is to be made responsible for the continuous ECO-DISTRICT, people argue about that. </seg>
<seg id="25"> While the shell company group is making responsible sabotage and the organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting chucks and leaky pipelines as main causers. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Shell lays down considerably lower security standards in Nigeria than else in the world usual, the US scientist Richard Steiner reproached to the company group in 2008: Only the rate of defects at the lines is "higher around a multiple than elsewhere." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> At a place, that from the distance as a left, oil-blurred workshop in the open looks, emerge from the mangroves figures: You are splinter-naked and oil-blurred up to the neck. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Under one of the many barrels, that in part with tubes united, to define in part arbitrarily scatteredly on the ground are, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery. </seg>
<seg id="29"> In the barrel the crude oil is heated up above the fire for several hours, declares Michael, the head of the group. </seg>
<seg id="30"> First gasoline penetrates the absorbing-pot through the tubes, later kerosene and finally diesel trickles at the end of the management out. </seg>
<seg id="31"> So Michael and four employees produce daily up to four barrels of diesel à 300 liters: "That is 34.000 Naira to us worth" - about 22 dollars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel scarcity in the biggest oil state Schwarzafrikas. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Nigeria is in charge only of a single refinery. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The diesel price ridiculously low with just 40 euro cents per liter the illegal cookers can undercut still: Because they get their raw material for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It comes from "Bunkerern" who tap the pipeline net right through Ogoniland: In this way daily at least 16 million liters of crude oil disappear to the country according to experts in the entire Niger delta. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Only one disappearing small part of the provisionally interbedded raw material is refined, however, illegally: Organized criminal networks which also politicians and hochrangige militaries are supposed to belong to into tankers and verscherbeln it on the international market fill the lion's share. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The debate, whether the environmental disaster is owed to the machinations of the population or the lax production method rather, the activist Akpobari holds for academic in that. </seg>
<seg id="38"> "If the oil societies would not be perceived as intruders and if they would not have destroyed the base of life of the fishermen so thoroughly, neither there would not be sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries." </seg>
<seg id="39"> Meanwhile the Ogoni particularly to shell is the relation but in such a way it destroys that only a withdrawal of the company group would come into consideration: "Maybe other nationalities as the Chinese turn out than better." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> There Michael becomes nervous. </seg>
<seg id="41"> "Highest time, that you disappear," the muscular oil man says. </seg>
<seg id="42"> "Every minute the soldiers can come." </seg>
<seg id="43"> The illegal Ölveredler are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, indeed no arrest threatens them, presumably however a painful bribe. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Also the soldiers coming from the country north above all want to profit - as all Nigerians - by the raw material. </seg>
<seg id="45"> "This condemned stuff brought our country in every respect to the dog," says Akpobari. </seg>

<seg id="6"> In the north and in the east partial 15 centimeters thick snow coverages lie. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On several motorways and many streets the traffic is strongly restricted. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> More than 10.000 people thought in New Zealand of the spilled miners that were declared as dead after several explosions in a mine. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Yet the corpses could not be brought out because the security situation keeps on being precarious in the misfortune shaft. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Just two weeks ago it had resulted in a vehement explosion in the pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth. </seg>
<seg id="5"> 29 miners in the age between 17 and 62 years were spilled under days. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> A probe had been let into the misfortune shaft, had not discovered, however, any track from survivors. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Due to the high concentration of poisonous gases and further following explosions no rescue teams could descend from safety reasons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> According to the second vehement detonation the authorities and experts had assumed that there is not any survival chance for the pals anymore. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The corpses could not be brought out up to now. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Now members and friends with a commemoration reminded of the dead. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Ten thousand people had met near shining sunshine in Greymouth on the New Zealand south island. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For two minutes they were silent. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In honor of the spilled miners 29 tables were set up, on which helmets, lamps and the names of the pals were to be seen. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Also pictures and personal objects, under that garments and surfboards, found here their place. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Before the government buildings of the country the flags at half-mast waved. </seg>
<seg id="16"> New Zealand hoped for the miners coming onto the surface "from the depths of the earth" again, said the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the commemoration. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "But they have never come home." </seg>
<seg id="18"> It can not close with the death of his son as long as he did not see his corpse, said to Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was spilled in the pit. </seg>

<seg id="20"> During the first explosion on 19th November also miners of British and South African origin were spilled. </seg>

<seg id="1"> To the hell, warrior! </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Does splatter fit to the art cinema? </seg>
<seg id="3"> The director Nicolas Winding Refn plumbs old genre-borders again with his fighter-epic "Walhalla Rising." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Which public does the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn like to have thought of when he turned "Walhalla Rising"? </seg>
<seg id="5"> A caught Viking warrior only with an eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees from his tormentors and kills his opponents in rows with almost superhuman strengths - rings ideally for young masculine spectators in search of bloody Action, just because our hero uses gladly aggressive killing methods and tears his enemies the bowels already once from the live body if he has bad mood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On the other hand it does not tell Einauge the whole film about any word how in fact it is called, and also the other figures can be forced at most into one or two sentences or a few very painful death screams once. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Else is kept quiet and feasted in the weirdly beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, that the Viking world of about a thousand years ago the scenery offers. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Ideal rather for grown-up film makers with interest in existentialism and very quiet tracks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Beautiful if a film has several target groups damages only if they exclude themselves mutually. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Director Winding Refn is regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and gestylten drug dealer trilogy "Pusher," refuses, however, stoically to make to the main stream or a little to little brutality his works with something accessible to the Arthouse more humor. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Most art cinema friends might make be deterred from the around splashing brain mass and the bowels. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Action-fans die at the latest from boredom then if Einauge opens for freely interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and pins an eternity in lull and fog before apparently the team arrives in America and keeps on being silent there. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> No miracle therefore, that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any cinema rental company in Germany and appeared only on DVD now. </seg>
<seg id="14"> That is a misery especially because of the splendid pictures, however also, because behind the prätentiösen one to blood-dripping facade a piece of cinema exciting occasionally hides, that earned some attention. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In this film it is not a question of dialogs or a stringente action, it is everything atmosphere, a film-become fever dream. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> And from that there is not for the spectator any escaping. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Refn does not grant him hardly a moment of the relaxation and ties him up the throat very slowly with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack, vor allem, however, with the incomprehensible hate that entgegenschlägt to him from the hearts of the figures. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Only a small fair boy who stands loyally to one eye to the page preserves himself something as innocence, all others are driven from anger. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Most most of all the one-eyed hero whose that, however, become from the hell sometime for enemies and allies in a temporary way to the warrior motives are never explained possibly to the ambassador of the devil himself. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It means ruin, one maybe, however, also only for those ones anyhow Spoiled. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The atomic energy authority IAEA has new references to a secret nuclear program in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The country defends itself, however, to take position for this purpose - nor it does not approve controls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Against midnight of the 5th on the 6th September 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attack a mysterious, die-shaped building in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It stands at the shore of the Euphrates; the next larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Your name emerges in documents of the International atomic energy authority (IAEA which comes off from the stream) when it is a question of the reactor which Syria supposedly built with help from North Korea in the ashlar, hidden in a valley. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing of the US foreign secret service of CIA of end April in 2008 the reactor common also under the name of the near small town el-Kibar would have been well suitable to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes on the other hand the technique is hardly worth from the fifties. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA demonstrated a video presentation with blurred satellite photographs. </seg>
<seg id="10"> By computer animation she inserted, where which components of the reactor are supposed to have been before the destruction that is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the atomic center Yongbyon. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Furthermore she presented photos, which show the building from the proximity or quite the interior. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor stood shortly before the initiation, it was said, been not loaded with burning-sticks, however, yet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombardment, hardly more is known than then, the puzzles became with the time rather larger. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The former US president George W. Bush revealed youngest in his memoirs that that one was quite indeed sure of CIA that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, but did not see hardly clues about there being in the country "an active nuclear weapon program" before the attack. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some Geheimdienstler in Europe are even more cautious there more gladly and speak only of an "alleged re-actuator" even if they hold the CIA-presentation for "plausible." </seg>
<seg id="16"> You lack hard proofs, in the same way as the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Asked how surely it is to have a reactor before themselves, a high UN-diplomat answered in the summer only succinctly, the IAEA has "material enough in order to ask questions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Syrians created the debris of the alleged "unused military building" urgently indeed aside and leveled the ground thoroughly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Nevertheless an IAEA-team found in June 2008 tracks of uranium which had been made by people under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Furthermore the IAEA about a member state received satellite photographs of commercial providers from the time directly after the attack, which might be more expressive than those ones of the CIA presented. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, these photos are not to be gotten on the market, because the unknown customer has bought - maybe Israel - excluding them. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The IAEA can not verify therefore their genuineness independently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria always declared to never have practiced a secret atomic program or to have built a reactor. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium comes from the Israeli arms, declared Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="25"> However, the IAEA rejected that to analysis of the particles as improbable. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then Damascus refuses to discuss about that - just the same as about the satellite photographs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Furthermore a second inspection into el-Kibar and the access to the ruins of the building bombed out refuses it to the controllers. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But also Israel is silent iron. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We will never comment on that," the prime minister Ehud Olmert current in the attack's times confirmed recently the official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> So the investigation of the case is dragged since June 2008 without any result there and "develops increasingly into a serious plausibility problem for the authority," as a high western diplomat at the seat of the IAEA in Vienna grants - finally a difficult violation of the nuclear weapon blocking-contract stands in the room which the IAEA watches over. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The IAEA sees as keys to progress during the clarification apparently three more facilities that are supposed to stand "in functional connection" with the probable reactor - and still to exist differently than this. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Neither in this case the inspectors did not disclose up to now which installations it is a question of still which function they have or what makes her be appeared suspicious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to information of the South German Newspaper they are called Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah inside at the IAEA, in turn carried off by cities seemed likely. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent institutes for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and did on satellite photographs a complex of buildings at Masyaf ausfindig with which it is a question of one of the suspicious objects most probably. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It is possibly in or immediately next to a military base - refused exactly with this reason Syria of the IAEA the access to the three places. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In Vienna it is said the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA is vorgeschickt by the USA in order to spy out military areas. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Because the nuclear detectives had become attentive through a tip of the US secret services onto the facilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has tips, under that satellite photos, that between the three places and the ashlar at the Euphrates material hin- and was transported. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A high western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the installations could stand "in connection with the combustible production." </seg>
<seg id="40"> There are, however, "no references to sensitive activities," therefore uranic enrichment or reprocessing; Processes which are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The reactor type is practiced indeed with uranium which is not enriched. </seg>
<seg id="42"> However where the uranium should have come and gives where from that the plutonium should be separated later for the bomb, for these central questions it at best plausible suppositions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> It is also unclear whether ruins which could hide valuable tracks were stored at the three places. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As if the hundreds of truck loads would have disappeared from the earth, nobody wants to have information about that, where the debris stayed. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The only few kilometers of salt mine al-Tibni sited from el-Kibar on the other hand of the Euphrates that Syria examined for their suitability as warehouses for radioactive garbage in 1998 the IAEA is regarded as improbable. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The former IAEA-inspector Robert Kelley had brought it recently from satellite photographs in an analysis for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor in touch. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Photos from the orbit show, however, that Syria carried out at the three suspicious places earthworks and removed big containers after the IAEA Zugang had demanded. </seg>
<seg id="48"> That can be coincidence, if clearing the suspicion hardly contributed, however, to that. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Furthermore it means in diplomat circles to keep possible military secrets, the IAEA that should allow it to Syria put many months into developing a plan there for inspections - only the expenditure shows how in a large way the interest of the inspectors is. </seg>
<seg id="50"> While, Damascus ironed also this proposal off. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Western diplomats had appeased in Vienna still a year ago, the reactor is destroyed, therefore the thing does not have any high priority, it deprives for instance US ambassadors of Glyn Davies since a few months of so-called special inspections ins Spiel, one of the sharpest means that has the Viennese atomic authority of controls to put through. </seg>
<seg id="52"> IAEA leader Yukiya Amano already indeed has that would have to suggest these inspections of "an option, for which I am open in the future" spoken, nor, however, he does not hesitate. </seg>
<seg id="53"> A high risk lies in this way: On the one hand a majority needs it for that in the governor council of the IAEA, and many of the there represented 35 countries are keen on an escalation all but. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other hand, as a diplomat gives to consider: "What is if they do not find anything at the end at all"? </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Since Angelina Jolie in the summer with the work at their still nameless direction debut has begun, there is annoyance. </seg>
<seg id="3"> She herself wrote the screenplay, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man. </seg>
<seg id="4"> One does not know many more about that - however already that suffices for noise. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Stubbornly the rumor the woman, a Muslim, falls with their Serbian rapist in love during the Yugoslavia-war holds itself. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Meanwhile the film turned away in Hungary and in the postproduction, however protests still in Bosnia. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Bakira Hasecic of the organization of feminine war victims wrote to Jolie over the UN refugee public social aid UNHCR and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper told now - Jolie is even an ambassadress of the UN refugee public social aid. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is not diplomatic - she offered to the women before weeks already once a meeting in Hungary, which those ones, however, refused. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The meeting must occur in Bosnia, according to Hasecic. </seg>
<seg id="11"> There were not love stories in rape camps, and betrays Jolies attitude opposite the victims their enough about the screenplay. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Your organization recommended according to the UN refugee public social aid to release Jolie as an ambassadress, tells the guerrilla warfare. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> What exactly, however, did Jolie write for scenes? </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Bosnian culture ministry that their screenplay agreed to read gave a knack permission Back and Forth after some for Sarajevo - it is not very clear why Jolie did not come then in spite of that. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Declared the young authoress herself she does not hunt any political intentions with their film incorporated with a lot of effort in the Yugoslavia conflict, want to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give a voice to all shared pages. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> With the contents it stays, however, vague. </seg>
<seg id="17"> So another second synopsis for the film in the net nevertheless to ring quite differently then circulates: The loving ones knew themselves in that already before outbreak of war and meet again when it, a Bosnian Muslim, is verschleppt into a Serbian camp in which he works as a guard. </seg>
<seg id="18"> What nevertheless rings considerably differently than the variant "Rape victim verknallt in torturer." </seg>
<seg id="19"> That Jolies begins film in fact already before the war - so much is secure. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The pressure on them is, according to Jolie, "unfair and based on misinformation." </seg>
<seg id="21"> Now can provide their presumably only still that one hacker of Hollywood peace: When they the screenplay, as already so many before, to put into the net illegally. </seg>

<seg id="17"> 100.000 Irish will presumably leave the country in next time, predict experts of the economic and social research institute ESRI in Dublin. </seg>
<seg id="18"> To 2015 they reckon even 200.000 emigrants. </seg>
<seg id="19"> For the small country only with 4,5 million inhabitants a vehement loss. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If the predictions Bewahrheiten, it results in an emigration wave comparably with that which Ireland suffered from in the eighties. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> After a decade of the upswing which brought great prosperity with themselves for the Irish dreary chimney spreads now once again. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The depression verunsichert in this case particularly the young, well trained Irish for whom it went up to now only uphill. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Job loss and social descent seemed in the boom years absurd. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Everyone was needed, there was money in plenty. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Meanwhile, however, three of ten women and men are less than thirty without work. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="26"> In the Irish Times there are zuhauf reader's letters of young emigrants who complain: "Everything goes into Ireland the creek under that." </seg>
<seg id="27"> "There should be a revolt against politicians and bankers - however who can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation in this way." </seg>
<seg id="28"> "The last one does then the light from asks." </seg>

<seg id="29"> Jurassic-student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, sees a dark future coming up because the government practices only eyewash and does not offer the young people any prospects anymore. </seg>

<seg id="35"> McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a fair which offers a Rundumservice on the topic to works abroad. </seg>
<seg id="36"> "Nevertheless for professional beginners the work is abroad a splendid chance to do the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager. </seg>
<seg id="37"> On his web page photos show surfers in Australia and Snowboarder in Canada. </seg>

<seg id="39"> Seán O'Donovan knows to establish something somewhere else, as it feels, since half a year. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Because not doing anything more for the 29-year old engineer in Ireland gave, it works now with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In Gelsenkirchen they pull up just a fashion house. </seg>
<seg id="42"> In January it goes on to Hanover or Berlin, for the next project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> Meanwhile only still O'Donovan sees his home rare, because it does extrashifts in order to be able to pay off the credit at home for his house. </seg>
<seg id="44"> "The situation is already a little mad," he says when it goes over the threshold of his house after long time for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="45"> "I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland in which I am as good as never again." </seg>
<seg id="46"> He laughs a little in embarrassment and goes through rooms cooled down. </seg>
<seg id="47"> The small house stands in one fine residential area's with well-kept front gardens, in the entrances big, expensive cars park. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Together with a sister O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380.000 euros - 100 percent credit-financed. </seg>
<seg id="49"> There were mad times, there was simple money without many questions," he says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> He is afraid, that it could go wrong with the credit? </seg>
<seg id="51"> O'Donovan considers a while, pours hot tea after and says: "I do not have any children, that I must feed and am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can begin anew." </seg>
<seg id="52"> The civil engineer does not like the lamentation, that it hears at the time of often. </seg>
<seg id="53"> "Nobody has to hunger - nevertheless our situation is not as dramatic here on the island by far as in former times, "he says." </seg>
<seg id="54"> "A while abroad work, that is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we feel ourselves through that first as Irish." </seg>
<seg id="55"> He laughs and tells then about his father who went to England in the last great depression. </seg>
<seg id="56"> "After seven years it was again there and the life went on into Ireland, very simple." </seg>

<seg id="57"> Cian Tanner likes this thought. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The future leave open and simply once look, how it runs with the life somewhere else. </seg>
<seg id="59"> He really already has a few years of work in London behind himself and why it should not run into New Zealand also well for it and his friend? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> A thing which worries him appropriately in these days is still there, however: the celebration to his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin. </seg>
<seg id="61"> He fears that it could degenerate into a farewell-party. </seg>
<seg id="62"> "Only not too many emotions," he says and drinks a great sip of his beer. </seg>
<seg id="63"> "Farewell, nevertheless that rings frightening." </seg>
<seg id="64"> "Let's mention it more gladly a going party, very loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games." </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1"> The demokatrische routine </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The democracy movement in Latin America becomes stronger, so as the support of private enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Criminality is a greater problem than the unemployment is. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In many parts of the region the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States is. </seg>
<seg id="5"> For these results the Latinobarómetro inquiry came, that in 18 countries carried on and excluding in The Economist was published. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This inquiry is carried out since 1995 regularly and shows so the opinion change in this region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two facts fall in the this year's inquiry of September and October especially of in's eye. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Firstly the good atmosphere in Latin America </seg>
<seg id="9"> and secondly the wachsende interest at democracy and their most important institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In numerous countries at the South American Pacific coast the democratic movement increased strongly (see table 1). </seg>
<seg id="11"> In Peru e.g. where the economy increases since 2002 annually around approx. 6% the number of the democracy proponents climbed from 40% per year in 2005 this year 61%. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Also in Mexico, where the economy recovers since the strong burglary in the last year again, such a trend is to be recognized. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Nevertheless only half of the interviewees in Mexico and Brazil, the most densely populated countries of the region, convinced democrats are, what lowers the regional average (see diagram 2). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Declared to approx. 44% of the interviewees, that they satisfied with the democratic practice of their country be. Those ones are so many as in the last year, however, 25% more than in the year 2001 (Diagram 3). </seg>
<seg id="15"> In about 34% trust the congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of the last year, show, however, a clear rise opposite 2003 (17% and/or 24%). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> A decade ago Latin America's depressions untergruben the endeavours towards more democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> That this also during the world economy crisis lasted, is due possibly to the countries of Latin America experiencing only a short recession phase and recovering quickly again. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition the paupers were caught by a stronger social net. </seg>
<seg id="19">  (According to reports of the UN economic commission for Latin America of this week the poverty rate went up in 2009 into Latin America only insignificantly and fell this year around 32% again.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> However from country to country there are strong atmosphere differences (see diagram 4). </seg>
<seg id="21"> Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the parting president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reflects in a spread progress thinking. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more strongly perceptible and power crimes increased, this is the case less. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> First for the second time since inquiry beginning many interviewees see a greater problem in Latin America in the criminality in their country than in the unemployment (see diagram 5). </seg>
<seg id="24"> Approx. 31% state that either she herself or a member of the family in the last year became victims of a crime. However, opposite 38% in the last year the values sank and reach thus the lowest state since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The increasing economic achievement reflects in the stronger support the Private- and the market economy against: approx. 71% of the interviewees indicated supraregionally that the private enterprise is indispensable for the development in the year 2007 it was 56% (see diagram 6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> Approx. 58% declared that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared with 47% in the last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly enough 62% of the interviewees retained this opinion in Venezuela (and 80% are for a private enterprise) although their left president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private enterprises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil followed the biggest weight according to 19% of the interviewees (18% in the last year) in the region from the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% in the last year). </seg>
<seg id="29"> On the other hand to see the interviewees in Mexico and most countries of Central America in the USA the most influential country near which this role is taken over by Venezuela in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua. </seg>

<seg id="1"> A choice setback </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Nobody had expected that the choices would be perfect on the 28th November in Haiti. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But the facts surpassed the apprehensions of the election officers that were urgent for the shaken country for the help by far. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Full ballot boxes, multiple given voices, voter registration cards in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidations were only a part of the problems. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Polling stations opened with delay lasting for hours. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Many Haitians from whom many had become homeless through the earthquake in January roamed in search of an option. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Finally some completely gave up. </seg>
<seg id="8"> A dozen premiership candidates, under that unites supposed top riders, demanded due to an alleged fraud the cancellation of the election results. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the whole country it resulted in in part violent protests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Nevertheless Edmond Mulet, the conductor of the UN-mission in Haiti, referred to the choice "as quite good in many interests." </seg>
<seg id="11"> According to a cautious statement of observers of the organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "these irregularities" do not "make the process necessarily invalidly" to like to be so seriously it also." </seg>
<seg id="12"> In other words, the show goes on. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The choice authority which is supposedly obliged to the unpopular parting president René Préval and to his candidate, Jew Célestin, will announce the provisional results on 7th December. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The expected second ballot is arranged for January. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> There is still hope into the choice. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The two leading opposition candidates, the rap-musician Michel Martelly and the former ridge-Lady Mirlande Manigat, pulled back their initial nullity complaint. </seg>
<seg id="17"> When Jew Célestin, that at the voters only small or no approval at all finds, declared as the winner of the second ballot by the Wahlberhörde, this could lead to problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Due to the cholera-epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents a small poll was feared. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Many Haitians were hindered the choice day through lacking organization at the voice delivery. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Shortly before choice beginning approx. 250.000 identity cards which are needed for the choice were not distributed yet. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It stands a lot on the game. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The giver countries consider a legitimate, acknowledged government as an important step during the reconstruction of Haiti. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The Haitians themselves are the same opinion. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Secret in the middle of </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, found out a wave of sympathy which drove their popularity rate up onto more than 50% around 20 points. That is the highest value since their choice in the year 2007. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Whether this helps her to a re-election, however, in the next year depends on whether the Cristina Fernández mourning visibly is more willing to compromise than their late husband, their predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The signs for that are not unequivocal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Néstor Kirchner, who controlled the economic policy also after the choice of his wife, made frequently budgets which did not consider the tax yields, the economic growth and the inflation fully. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This allowed it the president pair, to distribute the extragains according to own discretion. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On the paper the Fernández-government lost in the last year the majority in the congress. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Nevertheless the opposition is divided and Kirchners death after a heart attack on 27th October led to further disagreements. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some dissidents from the rows of the ruling Peronisten positioned themselves behind Cristina Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> However, after chaotic meetings (in the case of which a parliamentarian beat to another into the face and others accused the government of the bribery) the congress did not succeed in adopting the budget for 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I" will not "discuss" about that," according to the president. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The budget 2010 is valid now also for the next year, through what the president has distributed still more occasion money according to own discretion. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy run hot: probably it will increase this year around up to 9%. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official inflation rate is currently near 11,1%, however, numerous private estimates - and wage demand of the trade unions - drive the value onto almost 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner that took over the office in 2003 when Argentina was joggled from depressions declared growth and poverty abatement as his main aim, and not the inflation lowering. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He refused the cooperation with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned the National Institute for statistics and Volkszählung INDEC, that then the official inflation statistics schönte. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Can Fernández take a more moderate way now? </seg>
<seg id="18"> She appealed to the private enterprise and the union leaders for conversations. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And according to official statements wage increases are supposed to be restricted in the next year on 18%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The high world market prices for Argentina's farm products gave a strong impetus to the economy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Nevertheless the inflation untergrub the growth push through a great devaluation in the year 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Possibly Cristina Fernández would like to connect Argentina again finance-economically for this reason to the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="23"> At the beginning of this year the government found an agreement with security holders who had refused the former debt rescheduling of the country in the year 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Now it seems to push Fernández onto an agreement with the financiers from the Paris club, that they approx. $6,7 Mrd. owes. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Kirchners had always refused an inspection through the IMF, as somewhere else usual. </seg>
<seg id="26"> However, in the last month the minister for economic affairs Amado Boudou announced that the fund will perform "technical support" during the creation of a new national consumer price index. It looks as if this were the first step to the purge of the INDEC. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active on completion of their term of office also without the support through their husband. </seg>
<seg id="28"> When yes, she needs the support of the middle class for that, that has most mainly enough of the Kirchnerismus. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the Argentines return in March from their summer vacation, the wave of the Sympatie which was brought to her will have faded away. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If she liked to win a further choice, she must decide, whether she puts aside many for political decisions of their husband quietly and quietly. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Weak applause for China </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Taiwan's voters come closer slowly to a narrower connection to the mainland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> What holds Taiwan of his tall brother beyond the straits? </seg>
<seg id="4"> On 27th November more than 7,5 million voters did themselves, those ones are open 70% of all elective, in order to elect mayors and town councils in the five municipal districts. This is evaluated as a wide evaluation of the president Ma Ying-jeou. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Through the construction of epoch-making business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma is even a symbol figure for the relationships to the mainland. His politics changed the relation into the Chinese land of origin lastingly for the first time since 1949. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Ma passed the examination, however only just. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Although his Kuomintang-party (KMT) sets three of the five mayors, she did not receive any majority of votes. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Instead of this the Democratic progress party (DPP) which approves a greater independence of Taiwan received almost 50% of the voices, the KMT received 45%. </seg>
<seg id="9"> At a premiership choice this would have meant problems for Ma. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Since his choice two years ago the voice part of his party has fallen around approx. 8%. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For the first time the DPP moved in even together with the KMT in the town councils. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> During the choice it resulted in the incidents usual in Taiwan as truck convoys with rioters, flag-waving mass moves and only sparsely dressed dancers. </seg>
<seg id="13"> There was even the compulsory, mysterious murder attempt. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT kept a speech to the eve of the choice onto a KMT candidate, </seg>
<seg id="15"> when a man fired to him from the amount into the face. Lien was wounded and killed a spectator overleaf. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Bizarrerweiser is not clearly whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or attach a quarrel with the candidate. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Independently of that the assault influenced the choice according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, and moved the DPP into a bad light, which brought the KMT more voices. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Possibly China was the tallest winner of the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Remarkable proofs became the relationships to the mainland not thematisiert. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Instead of this the candidates debated on plans to council houses and the job creation. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The Taiwanese love their actual independence and refuse China's military threat. </seg>
<seg id="22"> For this reason the KMT does not put their relationships to the government gladly into the foreground in Peking. </seg>
<seg id="23"> However, this time also the DPP avoided to stir up the anti-Chinese feelings too very much. </seg>
<seg id="24"> It reacted to the new consciousness, that Taiwan's economy without China can not survive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Ma for his part would like to be able to confirm himself that the majority of the Taiwanese approves his China-politics. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The government in Peking will keep on pursuing his strategy, to lure Taiwan with economical stimuli back into the community. </seg>
<seg id="27"> China sent immediately an agent to Taipei in order to prepare a summit conference to investment security and medical cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Certainly also a political integration wants it. But the most important thing first. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It maintains in this way more gladly to the premiership choices in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Meanwhile the DPP invented herself again. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Two years ago it was strongly weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was because of corruption in the prison. </seg>
<seg id="32"> During his premiership of 2000 to 2008 it kicked in vehement for the absolute independence. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Nevertheless under Tais regency developed a new generation of moderate politicians and the DPP fights for the voices of the working one and the youth. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Tsai found great approval, as Su Tseng-chang, as a premiership candidate of the DPP among Chen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Your party does now everything in order to show that also it is in the situation to establish narrow relationships to Peking. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Tsai plans an idea forge as a contact point between the DPP and China. This presupposes, however, unprejudiced discussions. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Tsai declared in public that their party offers a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas of rash approximation to China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Chen shines about this change very annoyedly. </seg>
<seg id="39"> From his cell it declared the candidates of the DPP would have done better at insisting on Taiwan's independence. </seg>
<seg id="40"> He even asked the pragmatist Su to renounce the premiership candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Also without Chens interference the DPP is for herself heavily to elect their possible candidate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The KMT will have to subject herself to an own selfanalysis. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Mas values are bad, in spite of the rapid economic growth; the KMT-candidates wanted to lead their election campaign without it. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Seeming to be unemployment and the increasingly further scissors between arm and empire the main reasons for his unpopularity. </seg>
<seg id="45"> According to a KMT-speaker it will reshape his cabinet as well as the local facilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> The strong appearance of the DPP lets to presume that Taiwan approves a re-approximation only restrictedly. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Most Taiwanese see the economical cooperation with China as inevitable simultaneous. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> Esperanza Spalding asked president Obama himself for performing during the ceremony on the occasion of the Nobel prize awarding 2009. Now the 26-year old jazz-bassist and singer was nominated überrachsenderweise for the this year's Grammy in the category Newcomer of the year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Faced with the fact that Spalding is already a celebrated star since their album "Esperanza" In 2008 in the jazz-scene the nomination appears a little bit unusual. However, it corresponds to the Grammy-rules according to which an artist may have handed over at most three white poplars for publication of the album which he became known with in the wide public. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Your ambitious album from the year 2010, "Chamber Music Society," is certainly a step forward. And one can compare Spalding quietly with their exhilarated voice and a good feeling for pop, radio and Latin Music, with Norah Jones 2003, who great success comes in the year 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category the nomination Spaldings nearest. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Further "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer trio was nominated the album in the category instrumental white poplars. This darling of the critics experienced a huge success through that. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "Moody 4B" of the practised saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the Keyboarders John Beasley belong to the competitors Iyers among other things. </seg>

<seg id="8"> Trombone Shorty, a robbery-united favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBOs "Treme," Contemporary jazz in which otherwise white poplars are rather to be found by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber was distinguished in the category. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk-musician Darcy James Argue received in the category major group presumably earned attention. He competes thus with the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber-jazz and the adventure-merry Dave Holland and his octette that Life-Ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bass player as a democratic Bandleader. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Arsenic-resistant microbe could facilitate new ways of life on the earth or elsewhere </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The discovery of a foreign bacterium kind which can live on arsenic among other things opens new possibilities for new ways of life on the earth and elsewhere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on the earth, it is according to their opinion a sign for a life also without the elements up to now taken as vital being possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "This organism has two possibilities." </seg>
<seg id="5"> "He needs either phosphorus or arsenic for the increasing." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "That turns it into something very Special in spite of its being almost a kind of foreign way of life," declared Paul C.W. Davies of that one Arizona State University and co-author of the report that appears on Thursday in the online edition of the magazine Science. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Up to now six main elements were considered as vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> However, as the scientists found out, the bacterium also still keeps on growing in the Californian mono brine if it replaces phosphorus by arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "Nevertheless there one wonders what otherwise still is possible," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar by that one to Arizona State University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is an important step during the search for extraterrestrial life since scientists must recognize lives and his forms, according to Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study deals with microbes which were found on the earth. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The announcement of a press conference in which no details for the discovery were announced gave reason to widespread speculations in the Internet, that the report could deal with the discovery of extraterrestrial life. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "it "shows" declared Charles Cockell that in other planetary systems organisms with the aid of other elements biochemical processes can get going and that" the 'standard elements' that are completely vital in our opinion "are" not "absolutely firmly set," professor at the Planetary and space Sciences Research institutes of the Open university of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockel was not a part of the research team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "This work is a Novum, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures an element can be replaced by another" added Cockell. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> This discovery was not accidental. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiologischen Institut of the NASA which led the study chose the mono brine due to the high arsenic salary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Since arsenic and phosphorus resemble chemically, she picked up that microbes which are exposed to both can replace an element by the other one possibly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "The toxicity of the arsenic is based particularly on its behaving chemically similarly as phosphorus." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "Through that it falls to the organisms heavily to distinguish an element from the other one." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "Nevertheless the difference that arsenic works differently than phosphorus is so great. It reaches our biochemical system, where it smears everything as it were," declares Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers released the bacterium GFAJ-1 of an increasing arsenic concentration. It was adjusted and increased. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The microbe grows indeed into phosphorus better, however, that it can survive also in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based way of life can occur of course either on the earth or on another planet or moon on which arsenic occurs more frequently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> According to Jamie S. Foster, university lecturer for microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by Arsen is not new. However, up to now there was not yet any functioning example. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Arsenic occurred in the early earth years more frequently, she says, therefore the science assumed that early ways of life had used it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> "That gives" Forster, who was not a member in Wolfe-Simons research team, "reason for the assumption that life can have developed also differently than in the early earth age" so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The studies were supported by the NASA, the energy ministry and the National Health Authorities. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The lion roars again according to judicial permission of the MGM-restructuring </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to 18-month long turbulences and insecurities MGM got now at last green light for a new start. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A New-Yorker bankruptcy judge blessed on Thursday that one offiziel Gläuberplan "prepares" off, around which to pay off debts at the level of $5 Mrd and to smooth the way for the 86-year long conversation enterprise for new films and variety shows. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to the statements of the Thursday the plan meets the requirements of the US bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the management of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass entertainment, nothing more in the way stands. Barber and pear tree will protrude to the studio a little slimmed down as main managers. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The employee number is lowered by more than 400 on approx. 320. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For MGM Chapter 11 comes into force first in fact if JPMorgan Chase has finished a planned loan of $500 Mio for the financing of the new MGM-productions. </seg>
<seg id="7"> At the moment a consortium of the investment bank which brings in even $75 Mio, the enterprise, leads. The financing is supposed to stand until middle December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the task onto the investment bank Mölis & Co to help the management which fought with interest payments at the level of $300 Mio/year at the solution of their financial problems. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In August the manager Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO with Enron and restructuring expert that became known through his activity with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The efforts of Mölis & Cooper to solve the finance worries MGMs and to pay out the more than 140 Gläuber of the studio lasted longer than expects. </seg>
<seg id="11"> After discussions lasting for months the parties decided at the end of 2009 on offering the enterprise for the purchase. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Nevertheless the auction attracted only few bidders and Mrd did not want to pay any the $2 demanded by the believers. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In the spring this year's all of front began, than the MGM team began with the redesign plan that was signed by the believers after debates lasting for months and internal quarrels at the end of October at last. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> If MGM has survived the bankruptcy officially in the next weeks, Mölis and Cooper for their work receive a bonus at the level of several millions of dollars. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The part for Mölis & Co., that already kept $1,2 for Mio, amounts to $9,5 Mio. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Co-opera, to whom for the management of the enterprise $375.000 was paid monthly, Mio receive a "success bonus" of $4. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Barber and pear tree to intend to resume the production at MGM. This year the studio brought out only a film and created a year plan with seven or eight films that are supposed to come into the cinemas at the beginning of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Further they plan two films after "The small Hobbit" in co-production with warner Bros. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The studio needs for this purpose a separate loan for his financial part of these two films which are supposed to arise under the direction of Peter Jackson between $265 Mio to $275 Mio. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The investor Carl Icahn that financed approx. 18% of the MGM loan attempted a fusion of the studio with Lions gate entertainment whose tallest stockholder he is. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Nevertheless the last negotiations between the two enterprises did not lead to any result. </seg>

<seg id="3"> An iPad tastes so much as five BMX wheels for $99, during the price for a Kinect game about 10 classical jumping-ropes or approx. 48 cans Play-Doh corresponds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> But you can protect your present budget. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Recently I visited three national toy traders in search of three electronics toys under $80 - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Of Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club. </seg>
<seg id="6"> I realized immediately that Moores law had come into force. This year the technology toys are more efficient and cost simultaneously a little less than in the last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> And although less new toys with own web page appear, a wider offer is found on the best known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Comes more and more button cell-practiced toys onto the market, and many contain wiederaufladbare accumulators. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="10">  (If not different indicated, all prices of Toys are "R" Us.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are plush figures, as big as guinea pigs that sing a note if one presses onto their stomach. </seg>
<seg id="12"> To press once corresponds to a note, through repeated pressing one can play a song. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Respect: If you have begun with the pressing once, you can not stop anymore. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> For a combination of Gesand and dance the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice. </seg>
<seg id="16"> On basis of the Elmo Live-Technologie developed in the last year the animatronische doll offers interplay as 'Simon says', and thanks to the novel hinge feet with wheel blocking it dominates the Moon-Walk. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. Your parents complained, however, about the missing volume control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> If you are a child of the eighties, you remember certainly Alphie, one of the first computerized learning-toys. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Now it is again there (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole heap question cards, with which a drive can become a lesson, with a smart aleck with selfcorrection function as teachers. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="21"> The cheapest and most user-friendly solution is, equipped with a qwerty-Tastatur, to MobiGo of VTech ($60 for children of 3 to 8). The games contained on that are not, however, as informative as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children of 3 to 12) who is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrogs of first great reworking of the Leapster-row are. </seg>
<seg id="22"> None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> iXL of Fisher-Price ($90 for children of 3 to 7) uses a system for the games and eBooks similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD card disk drive also family photos on that can be looked. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In the End there is still Scrabble Flash ($30 of Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not bigger than a matchbox is and have an own LED-screen. </seg>
<seg id="25"> During the game it is a question of putting together the blocks to word before the time elapses. It is suitable for an improvised spelling-competition splendidly. </seg>

<seg id="27"> If one goes only to the offer in the toy shops, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The judgment was a surprise for many ethic-attorneys outside of the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion there were sufficient proofs of Ensign disregarding the Lobbying-prohibition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Interviews, E-Mails and other documents that were disclosed to the erstenmal in October 2009 in the New York Times gave reason to the supposition that to Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election officers, to lucrative tasks helped in order to buy his silence over an Affaire with Hamptons wife Cynthia. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> While the Ministry of Justice was refusing it officially to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign-case, Mr said. Fire and other ethic attorneys, the ministry shines very cautiously from defeats that were pursued by the media with great interest in the picking up of political accusations after a great number, including the decision in the last year to make the accusation against the former senator Ted Stevens because of error behavior on the part of the public prosecutor fall. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Public prosecutors "are obviously nervous," said Melanie Sloan, the chairperson of the union of "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization that objective is the abatement of corruption in parliament and government circles of the USA), a group of lawyers, To Accuse the different one against Mr. Ensign in court has brought. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "That means fundamentally that superior government officials can assume now that the laws do not apply to them" she added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Paul Coggins, main defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview, he received on Monday a call of a public prosecutor and another on the next day, in which he was informed that the ministry will not raise any complaints against his client. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Mr. Ensigns defenders had co-operated with the public prosecutors in order to convince her of that that the senator has acted," as his office repeated in a declaration on Wednesday once again, "in agreement with the law. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr. Coggins refused to explain the legal arguments which he had put forward opposite the public prosecutors in a more exact way. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "To me is not presumably at going into the conversation details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much is said: We believe to have made the correct decision," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Last month the federal choice commission decided on stopping the investigations because of a separate complaint through the ethic group after which a payment of $96,000 of Mr. To expel Ensigns onto the Hamptons parents against the federal choice law has. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The choice commission said, it did not give enough proofs that the money was something else than a present. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="1"> Cheshire-appointment makes attentive on Twitter </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Half a dozen of them typed in the riots in the courtroom away. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the minute time they sent their reports above Twitter about horrible testimonies. </seg>
<seg id="4"> At the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140.000 Twitter-announcements about the process around rape and children chained to beds in a house which opened in flames. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Thursday the attentively pursued process of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused, finds three members a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to have killed, an official end if the judgment falls about the death sentence that the jury expressed. </seg>
<seg id="6"> However, Mr. Hayes attorneys submitted already requests near court which reasons for an appointment explain and which will employ the courts onto years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> That one is one of the provozierendsten reasons, that it has come through the intense reporting about the process - also through the extensive use of Twitter through average reporters - to a "circus atmosphere" and one so far spread, going around penetration incendious details', so that the jury was influenced by the public indignation in improper manner. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This objection could lead the Appelationsgerichte to occupying oneself with the question whether to made the new technologies new rules in the courtroom become necessary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "So as I experienced it during this process, I believe that it is really a danger if the entry of the new technologies into the courtroom influences the right of every individual to a fair process," Thomas J. Ullman, Mr, said. Hayes main defender. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Uppermost Chamber Court, rejected last week the requests by decision succinctly, than he said, that the New Media carefully would become, and that it would not give any proof of that that the jury was driven from passions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> However, that was not the last word with security in this thing yet. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Since decades court objections have stated that the reporting makes about famous-notorious cases doubts about the fairness of a process arise. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In his historical decision of 1966 the Uppermost court of justice of the United States canceled the judgment to an osteopath from Cleveland that is supposed to have killed his wife against Dr. Sam Sheppard, and it said in his decision that there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the New Media. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some believes, that the TV series and the feature film "on the Run" based on this crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some lawyers say, court objections, which Mr. To consider Hayes later condemnation half a century, could follow the argument that new rules became necessary in order to control the communication paths from the courtroom that were still inconceivable in the case's Dr. Sheppard times. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "There is a good reason to be worried about the influence of the New media in processes that are pursued by a wide public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at the Stanford Law School that examined the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report it is imposed arbitrarily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor Donohue said some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated from the idea that the restriction of an immediate communication could make out of the courtroom the processes fairer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Twitter matter is only one of many, that the lawyers of Mr. Explaining Hayes in order to discuss onto years and to put off a condemnation thus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defenders also claim for example, that Mr. Hayes already would be condemned could, than judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential Juroren when one showed them horrible scene photos during the Jurorenauswahl. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some of the Juroren said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, would have given her disgust. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defenders say, they would question also the constitution moderateness of the death penalty constitution, and they argue, that the judge exchanged by mistake a Juror that a critic was to the prosecution and that it would have carried out improper manner pressure on the judgment, than it had made the uncustomary decision to reserve the jury over the weekend. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The Juroren were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Maybe the greatest interest draws nevertheless their arguments about the influence of the detailed reporting about the process onto itself. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In a judgment contestation that they submitted last month they stated that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American Senate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> You argued, that the New Media would have provoked the flames of the emotions again continuously about the case. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Maybe "one" did not experience "such daily crush of the media beeps, cameras and reporters outside of the courtroom" even nationally yet "before still," the lawyers wrote, "in New Haven and." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Your emphasis onto the reporting through Twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In interviews some journalists said, that the claim, this direct news is aufwieglerischer as reports that are refunded more slowly a technique-hostile look is that the reporting about future processes becomes impoverished. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Nevertheless some lawyers said Appelationsgerichte would be confronted often with the argument, social and technical changes would need the adaptation through the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr. Hayers lawyers intensify this claim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In their objection they related themselves to the decision of the Uppermost court of justice of 1966, in which the condemnation was canceled by Dr. Sheppard due to the reporting and did clear, that the New Media require new rules. </seg>
<seg id="32"> "These case, so they wrote, Sheppard represents against Maxwell of the 21st century." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Can politeness combine the separating thing? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> After a campaign at swearwords and Negativität little politeness broke out this week in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Is it the omen of a real two party cooperation or a factor of the illusion before one returns quickly again for the fight of the parties in the capital? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The meeting on Tuesday between president Obama and spitzes of the congress did not bring any breakthrough in the great questions which one had to occupy oneself with during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government period in which no decisions anymore are made. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After all to the, what one hears, was not to rule over it either a polite discussion between two different pages or an observation of their divided responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a party dot compiling. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meeting of the deficit commission of the president on Wednesday was likewise civilized, in spite of the political differences that keep on existing between the members. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems to be clear that a narrow communication makes over a period of months a mutual respect that the ideological fissure that keeps on separating the members from each other veils arise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> That is not hardly enough in order to say a new era of the cooperation broke. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Both pages are now in a test phase - in which one of the other sign of the cooperation and compromise willingness demands while one himself is attempting to consider the borders of the public opinion and the patience the voter after a renewed party warfare. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Therefore the meeting on Tuesday itself and his assessment were restricted through the participants onto a minimum of demands or accusations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the republicans are too great and too deep, than that one could expect a fast change of the atmosphere that predominated in the last two years. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Identical whether it is a question of taxes, donations, health or candidacies, the two pages are away of each other in a miles long way. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In the End the November choice Washington tuned at least for short time mild. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "No question, the accent changed itself," Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government that now for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center" works, said. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "That is after choices inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Choices raise party passions which again die. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And that is good so." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In some questions, especially in those which stand on the agenda of the "lame duck session" republicans and democrats do not have hardly another choice than to find a solution." </seg>
<seg id="19"> Bushs tax abatement ends at the end of the year, and nobody approves that. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both pages want to find a way, around some or quite all too keeps, it is now temporary or durable. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In the same way a compromise is to be expected concerning the increased unemployment pays, when also only, because the republicans can not afford it, that one believes, the favored tax abatement for the rich men, while they are refusing unemployed workers a support. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House the optimism increased, that one can agree in these questions during the "lame duck session" and contract ratify also the New START simultaneously. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> However William Glaston des Brookings Insitution warns against the lame duck session" not having to lead "a successful cooperation" to a durable cooperation of the parties compellingly "in urgent questions" if the new 112th congress will call in January. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead of this, so he says, a phase of the Nichtübereinstimmens is more probable, maybe even unavoidable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "After the things which must be done are done, this short-term psychology will change in confrontation," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Wehner is also sceptical - and this skepticism is divided by many - that leads politeness to true cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "I see as Vorkampf, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012 many things which happens from today to 2012," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons for that have to do a lot with the getup of the new republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters, that those one education were useful. </seg>
<seg id="29"> To know, as gotten the republican leaders like to be also over their playing poker too highly, it that they must attempt their promises, to lower the editions of the government and to annul the health reform, to stop. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> These party lines already in the first reactions concerning the recommendations become clear to the deficit commission which a tax reform and the emphasis of some taxes as well as the increase of the retirement age and the lowering of the government expenditures contain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The Deputy Chairpersons Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles took over one of the most difficult jobs into Washington and have, according to their own assessment, so very much close on that to put the deficit question on the public agenda. </seg>
<seg id="32"> To need it, however, within the commission 14 of the 18 voices, around their plan to the to do official recommendation and they fight very much in order also to come only into the proximity of this number. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The biggest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the committee, there in finance questions, at least today, only little elbow room or little sympathy for compromises is. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the republicans in the congress. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The first fight will occur next year in the form of party collisions, when the republicans challenge Obama with regard to the national budget, the taxes and the health system, later then followed from a phase of greater two party cooperation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will lead to this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> The public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It is proved, that, in spite of the partiality of the current choice, the majority of the Americans still always wants, that the two parties work together. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If confrontation leads to a dead end as it happened in 1995 then both parties must pay attention to the public reaction carefully. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Who is condemned to the losing will change the course and will search will have the compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> That likes to be in fact an optimistic viewpoint. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Partiality and polarization are today greater than in the middle of the 1990th years, and to seem it to be a bigger ideological fissure between Obama and the congress republicans than at that time between president Bill Clinton and the republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Simultaneously the activists of both parties see as a pure prelude by far in 2010 for one at consequence more comprehensive choice 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> So seen the politeness which is borne this week for the show likes to be welcomed by many Americans. </seg>
<seg id="45"> However very much more effort will require on both pages, to find a common denominator in the questions that still separate the two from each other. </seg>

<seg id="6"> The Memo which was sent to Washington under the name of the ambassador John Beyrle was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his home page. </seg>

<seg id="8"> It was written, during Yuri Luzhkov Moscow's mayor was still, and accuses him of the corruption. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It was fired in October by president Dmitry Medvedev, however, there is not hardly a proof of people having tidied up in the meantime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a known building firm, rejected corruption reproaches again and again over years, and he won numerous slander complaints against such accusations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In September it declared a Russian television broadcast station it is corrupt when he was asked for a documentation which suggests: "It is mad, it is dirty, it is dirty." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="12"> > An incredibly great number at Russians believe, that their society is corrupt. Inquiries showed that. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But it is unusual that, happened as in the report of the ambassador, single persons are named, and it is unheard that this happens through a diplomat of a foreign country. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="14"> "The direct connection of the government of Moscow with the criminality it resulted for this purpose in the government rather acting as a Kleptokrat that some designate it as "faulty" and come to the conclusion than a government," according to the Memo. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "Criminal elements enjoy one "kryshna" (a concept from the world the criminals / the Mafia, what in a word for word way means "roof" or protection), that above the police, the state security (FSB), the service inspectorate (MVD) and the office of the public prosecutor just as extended as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy. </seg>

<seg id="23"> "For this reason the protection is through criminal walk's no more as in demand as formerly." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The Memo notices, that, while the compiling of the money is being comprehensive, to be the protection itself very modest no; even the ones who pay are arrested sometimes. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Those that do not pay find their business very quickly closedly - due to the one or other pretext's. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a weakly illuminated, concreted classroom with walls dirty and flaking off, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds leaders Ta of the man that uplifted it at the later Khmers Rouge Mok. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> "Everyone here loves Ta Mok." </seg>
<seg id="4"> "He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Confessed because of his brutality during Khmer Rouge domination as "the butcher," the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in the north-west of Cambodia, where it hospitals and bridges built, which developed infrastructure and where thousands' of former soldiers still always live. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Nevertheless this year, of 12 years according to the capitulation of the Khmers Rouge opposite the government, long-standing supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In April a local truth and conciliation forum allowed the victims the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In June the government distributed a school book which for the first time the history of Khmers Rouge tells to children of former soldiers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And in July a community tribunal of the UNO and Cambodia condemned for the first time a former member of Khmers Rouge, than it the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng Folterkammer, Kaing Khek Iev, better known than Duch, to 35 years of prison condemned. </seg>
<seg id="10"> With each of these developments the fear increased to veterans Alnlong Vengs under Khmer Rouge, complicated their endeavours towards conciliation and re-integration into the society of Cambodia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "There are still refusal and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they do not have any power to do something," said Chhang Youk, conductor of the documentation center of Cambodia, an independent organization that investigates the regime. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "For them the life was glorious under Khmer Rouge, but the regime became a symbol of the evil." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "It divides up even families." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> During the Khmer rouge domination in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1,7 million people were exekutiert or they died of illnesses, reworking or for hunger. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When the Vietnamese came in and in 1979 those ones flung pole Pot-Ied Regierung, the remains of the regime and his military fled onto the border of Cambodia according to Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Here they spread noise until December 1998 when the last movement capitulated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their basis in the west of the mountains and jungles from Cambodia, Ta Mok drew the next generation in Anlong Veng. </seg>
<seg id="18"> However in the middle of the 1990th years, when led a peace agreement supported through the UNO in 1993 to the first democratic choices of the country, great groups of Khmer Rouge Fighters began to overflow to the government, which led to the capitulations from Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Pol Pot died in 1998 a natural death's, and Ta Mok that had not given in was arrested in 1999 of government strengths with the Dangrek Mountains. </seg>
<seg id="20"> He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he waited for his process. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> When their patrons did not protect her longer more, most former Khmers fled rouge fighter into the zermürbende poverty of the rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Also when of a few kept elitist official of Khmers Rouge their local government posts because they laid down their arms the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> "These people profited only very much little by the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the center for justice and conciliation which holds public forums in whole Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng </seg>
<seg id="24"> "You are anchored into the utopian Agrarideologie of the regime." </seg>
<seg id="25"> "You grew up without any professional knowledge." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Sor Lim, of 55 years, who had connected himself in 1974 as teenagers of the Rhmer Rouge, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he sat down in 1998 in order to lead a life as a poor rice farmer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> "The life under Khmer Rouge was good," he said. </seg>
<seg id="28"> "Eating something gave everyone Ta Mok." </seg>
<seg id="29"> "However now the life is difficult because we must take care of ourselves ourselves." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The walking Khmer rouge tribunal called worries also here in an awake way. </seg>
<seg id="31"> At the beginning of next year that attempts court's, Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to put in court. </seg>
<seg id="32"> It is the task of the court to condemn the old leaders and those ones that are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further actions beyond these four cases. </seg>
<seg id="33"> That helped little to moderate the fears in Anlong Veng. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Current media speculations are had on In the Chaem, 64 year, concentrated, which during the Khmer rouge domination in the late 1970th years district leader had been in the province Manteay Meanchey. </seg>
<seg id="35"> In 2007 she had told to representatives of the documentation center of Cambodia it led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms a project, at the thousand of mandatory workers presumable died. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> At a hot evening came back In the Chaem from the work to the fields to their wooden house at a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng. </seg>
<seg id="37"> When the sun flung long shadows onto the verdorrte grass In the Chaem it leaned, to discuss about their past with Khmer Rouge. </seg>
<seg id="38"> If the court should summons her, she would refuse so to go, she said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> "Cambodia lives in peace and in stability," she said. </seg>
<seg id="40"> If "there were not any pursuits anymore, war would be here." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> Prime minister Hun Sen in addition repeated that fled in 1878 of Khmer Rouge warned against the situation becoming unsure the court would accuse more suspects although experts and historians discuss this. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> "Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia must do in order to be able to go forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center. </seg>
<seg id="44"> "Conciliation with the Khmer-times means collating of the broken pieces," he said. </seg>
<seg id="45"> It is our duty so to set these broken parts together that as everything can understand." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> The center created the first school book approved by the government about Khmer Rouge, the 75-sided "history of the Democratic Cambodia." </seg>
<seg id="47"> It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the history book for the High School of the education ministry which contains less than four pages about Khmers Rouge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> To know as often in Cambodia the young people in Anlong Veng only little about the Khmers Rouge, in spite of the connections of the city to the regime. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Understanding an important part of their history said to Touch Valeak, of 19 years, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, that the new school book helps the students. </seg>
<seg id="50"> But his parents reacted sceptically, in order to read it, than it the book with home brought. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> "My family leans many parts of the book and the court off," he said. </seg>
<seg id="52"> "You are mistrustful because they are not sure as many people are condemned by the court." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> Such resistance does the conciliation process in a complex way and complicatedly, said Sok Leang. </seg>
<seg id="54"> He said "To attain the public forums, the school book and the court, however, after and after influence." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> Still Khmer Rouge has a powerful attraction here. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Above in the Dangrek Bergen a way überwucherter from shrubs and dirtied with plastic garbage leads to a rectangle from black soot, covered with a rusty sheet roof. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Pol Pots body had been burned here after his death 1998 on a tire heap. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> Nuom Sothea, of 31 years, a mobile vendor at the street edge, said she does not know much about the man who had been burned here. </seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>

<seg id="1"> Belarus is agreed on not keeping on collecting arm-capable uranium </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a surprising victory for president Obamas campaign to the worldwide protection of nuclear material the government announced from Belarus on Wednesday, which is a critical component of nuclear arms, that one will not collect more longer highly enriched uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The deal was announced to the exterior minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Byelorussian foreign minister Sergei Martynov in a common statement after a meeting in an additional article of the security peak. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The US government had attempted for years to convince Belarus of that not to collect more highly enriched uranium and it seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> However official of the US government told to the Washington mail that in the last two months two secret agreements were hit with Belarus in order to remove 187 pounds of arm-capable uranium from a Byelorussian research institution. </seg>
<seg id="6"> That prepared the stage for the accord on Wednesday, to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee that remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obamas To "Nuclear security peak of the 47 nations" of April that had excluded Belarus. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And it was obviously good enough in order to safeguard the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next peak 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I was really enthusiastic of the fact that they want a seat in the Nuclear security peak (of 2012)." </seg>
<seg id="10"> "That proves to me that it functions," said Ken Luongo, president of the partnership of Global Security, a group for the promotion of the nuclear security. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Clinton named the agreement "a very significant, important step" of Belarus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to safeguard all precarious nuclear material within four years. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since then the US government helped six countries with becoming their highly enriched uranium loosely. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Belarus will be the seventh. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A dozen of countries put it under the government from George W. Bush. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At this time Security Peak Nuclear of Obamas the Byelorussian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared, that the nation will give up never their uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "As keep highly enriched uranium -" Lukashenko said "hundreds of kilos, what is basically arm-capable, and less enriched uranium," then. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "That is our raw material... We will not make any dirty bombs from that and we will not sell it to anybody." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We use it exclusively for research purposes, that is everything." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Nevertheless Belarus approximated to the USA few months ago, when it indicated interest in the meeting of an agreement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The first run, to remove the uranium of Belarus in October was especially complicated because the material was light verstrahlt, say official. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It was loaded into a special train, that more than 1.300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, official say. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The second run was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the official ones by airplane. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The US government pays $ for these efforts to 14 million at which a majority of the money flows into the Byelorussian research with weakly enriched uranium which can not be used for nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "This was extremely cautiously coordinated and synchronized in order to establish confidence" that led to the descendant that was signed by Clinton, Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the energy ministry that works on the Global Danger Reduction, said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The James Martin Zentrum for studies not to be passed on estimates, that Belarus had this year of at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium as well as hundreds of pound at highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Belarus wants to dissolve his warehouse according to the common descendant to 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The relationships between Belarus and the USA were for years strained, in the first place because of Lukashenkos harsh disregard the human rights'. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But the statement of the Wednesday suggests a possible approximation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> "The progress of these global security questions welcome being called, the United States of America and Belarus announce, that an increased respect for the democracy and the human rights have a central topic in Belarus in the improvement of the bilateral relationships and it is essential for the progress of the country and his citizens," she declares. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> According to the significant voice and representative increase at the last regional choices the PP already focuses their look on the parliament choices - preferred or not. Your expectations are more than positive, because the voice number which achieves this party at these choices is usually twice as high as those at the choices in Catalonia are. </seg>
<seg id="4"> So the Catalan people's party received 610.473 voices at the parliament choices of 2008, during this digit at the regional choices in the year 2006 only 316.222 was. </seg>

<seg id="3"> The seven Pakistanis arrested by the policemen of the secret service place of the police of Barcelona and the Nigerian formed the dschihadistische cell operated from Thailand, that different Al Qaida groups, under that the "movement for the liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Lax cirque e-Taiba" (Let) - latter was authoress of the assassination attempts in Bombay that required 2008 106 dead - with passports supplied. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Spanish Minister of the Interior assigns a great importance that it is possible so far that he insures to these investigations with the "Operation Kampai" the forgery apparatus Al Qaidas "was weakened" worldwide and thus their action ability. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where these were forged and sent after that onto the groups which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida consists of in this way whose "fighter" unpunished the borders of European and other western countries could cross. </seg>

<seg id="9"> Pässe stole the Catalan net - a part of them had been done in the year 2009 to the ground - in particular from tourists according to the handicaps of the so called "International Islamic front." </seg>
<seg id="10"> That means that the documents had to be made out by men in the age of 25 to 45 years on the names and be valid still several years; they were not allowed to show any visa stamps. </seg>

<seg id="12"> In spite of that should be reminded of some days in front of the assassination attempt from Catalonia by means of a money transfer enterprise several thousands of dollars that "were invested" in the purchase of Prepaid-cards for mobile telephones that later were used by the members of the "command" that prepared an end for the life of 106 persons having been sent. </seg>

These do not distinguish from the already during the election campaign set ones and make summarize with the Vorrangigkeit of the economical re-upswing and the refraining of regionalistischen independence adventures, as a finance compensation agreement, that the regionalistische leader wants to suggest on the climax of his mandate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The chairperson of the Catalan people's party turned with the security to Artur Mas, which the 18 representatives that she had won on the last Sunday lent her - a digit that is more than sufficient in order to feel indispensable. Because the candidate of the middle class regionalistischen party CiU is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties abstaining during the vote with his assumption of office. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The future alliances which the regionalists want to enter into at the coming parliament choices in the congress depend on a possible entente with the PP. The conversations which Mas at this time with the remaining party leaders leads are, however, about Catalonia. </seg>
<seg id="5"> What affects the party chairperson of the PPC, so this demands, that to the support of the assumption of office "all discourses, which affect the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as an agreement on the finance compensation between state and the Autonomous region - similar as in the Basque Country - and that the party leader of CiU wants to submit even a referendum, to be done behind. </seg>

<seg id="2"> The owners of the home for the elderly in Olot do not exclude that their nurse killed more than eleven older people </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The persons responsible of the geriatric home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave yesterday a press conference in which they put out which damage had caused the criminal actions Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse that had killed during his work at least eleven old people for whom it was responsible - the equipment. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The conductor of the geriatric home, Joan Sala, performed in company of his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced, "La Caritat would like to accuse the person responsible (for the deaths) ," but "the right and our liability duty force us to that to accept "the process and the civil law liability." </seg>
<seg id="5"> The equipment does not have to accept only a social renown loss because she had not found the criminal actions of the nurse in time, but pay now also a high indemnity which is charged the dependant of the victims by the legal representatives. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime goes back to August 2009 and that he killed since then further. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The judge arranged the exhumation from eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric home - since he presumed that no doctor examined the deceased personally, but the formalities were run due to their age and illnesses by telephone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The conductor of La Caritat denied this point flatly and declared that "absent measures keinerzeit could have been the reason for the incidents." </seg>

<seg id="12"> The conductor of La Caritat declared the access of the personnel to the medicines is to be controlled only heavily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The insulin syringes and that the nurse fitted in tranquilizer cocktail from nine committed crimes at six in order to free the patients with the death from their suffering. </seg>
<seg id="14"> However the results of the laboratory research will present, whether Vila lies and chose for his first victims in fact one little cruel death or whether he burned out these from inside in his giving them paleness lye that he murdered between the 12th and 17th October as he had done it according to confession with three women. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> In La Caritat one does not give any belief to the statements of the nurse, not even what does not affect the number of the stood murders that more could absolutely be. This attitude is justified with Vila having done very different statements in court and it not turning any sense to change his approach suddenly after eight successful murders. </seg>

<seg id="3"> The risk impacts of the Euro-Peripheriländer increased dramatic and the stocks of the European banks around more than 5%. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nevertheless we should not underestimate the possibility that the EZB can deceive herself and the euro hardly increased points, which leads to the worry. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Today a month ago the European Central Bank asked us to cancel our Liquiditätmsassnahmen after what that EZB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably still many must do Male in the future, a moving-snag. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The Federal Reserve demanded the ending of the plan for the purchase of national debts since these are ineffective as well as the cancellation of all extraordinary limited liquidity measures. Only a one week long unlimited access is supposed to be retained. </seg>
<seg id="9"> After the Ireland crisis we expect, that the present liquidity measures "at least extends "until March" and the quarterly announcements with unlimited access at the quarter end to the guarantee of the liquidity until at least June will retain. </seg>
<seg id="10"> We also expect, that the program to the purchase of obligations continued and will distribute a strengthening signal. </seg>

<seg id="15"> Yesterday the auction of one year long state titles was quite weak in Portugal. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The state property administration distributed only 500 million to 5,28%, opposite 750 million to 4,81% in the preceding auction. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In spite of that the interest rates fell into Portugal around 30 base points in the entire curve and reflected in this way a perception change of the markets according to the words Trichets. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In Ireland the numbers of the fault hole were published by Allied and Bank of Irish country. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The sum becomes at short notice on about 10 000 million and possible wider 15 000 estimated. There is time until February, in order to get private capital or to become these banks nationalizes. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Although Ireland completely lost his plausibility after the problem with the stress tests had not recognized it in July, the numbers are acceptable within the framework of the rescue plan and help with reducing the uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, the government must receive on the coming Tuesday the parliamentary approval for his new budget. Since it does not have the sufficient support yet, Ireland is also furthermore sources of the uncertainty. </seg>

<seg id="27"> In the comparison to February the reaction was fast and convincing to the government and to the Spanish central bank, and we profit by the surprise effect. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Today there is a leading auction of a three year long state loan which will profit from the Trichet-effect. Therefore we back on a strong demand which will remove all doubts about our debt rescheduling ability. </seg>

<seg id="29"> For Spain the ordering of an auxiliary plan would be a self-sacrifice. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The managerial board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers are. He believes that in 2001 a hard year will be for the banks, at first, however, a new liquidity crisis rejects and the end of the fault war prophesies. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In spite of that he foresees a burglary of the interest margins which the banks attempt to compensate for with rises of the fees and the prices for loans. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Sabadell expects, in three years one to catch millions of private customers - a compartment to still be withstood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Sabadell found the way to empty the coming three years and to survive so in a very complicated economical environment. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The bank will introduce in 2011 a new Dreijahresleitplan. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The objective does only not say to survive without using the public aids from the FROB but in addition the share of the market about one millions of private customers - 700 000, if one removes the customers that the bank will lose - increase. That is the great challenge before which this bank stands, because until now she dedicated more attention to their business customers than their private customers. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This year she has to manage 250 000 private customers and 50 000 enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Your share of the market with private customers is near 3,5 percent while the business customers are forming more than 10 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> A further principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the rise of the productivity, speak Austerität, cost reduction. She will present the challenges which the bank in this way faces together with annual account report. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Only few banks dare in these difficult times of objectives to define and to publish since through the financial crisis all plans of the banks got messily worldwide. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Sabadell will finish this year their four years ago defined leading-plan Optima. This was initially laid out onto three years, but due to the market it was prolonged around a business year. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main aim of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Guardiola accentuated at a breakfast organized by the APIE, in 2011 a "difficult" year "with great range" would become. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The manager starts from that, Spain would come only "slowly" out of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In addition it would be "very difficult" to create Work in two or three years - basic for the survival of the banks. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Even if it goes out of the war around passives - that punishes the interest margins - fading, the loadings, the banks and savings banks for their emissions for the receipt of liquidity will have to pay, shifted as a compensation for profit margins fading away already onto those ones price for credits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "The topics of liquidity and financing are more structurally kind and they will exert pressure on the credits." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We did not wring the cock, but the interest differentials are very high," admitted Guardiola. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Banesto distributed on Thursday already the order onto their branch net, to restrict the allocation of long-term loans and to increase the interest differentials (cf. Cinco Días of the 22nd and 27th November). </seg>
<seg id="21"> The manager also admitted to increase the fees, however, the banks currently pursued the Stategie "within an embossed from the competition frame." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Sabadells leading-plan is based on an organic growth even if the group does not exclude corporate businesses, as always. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Not for nothing he assures that in Spain "greater enterprises are necessary." </seg>
<seg id="24"> "In the coming year everything will change," he assures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> It stresses, that the need for capital at the time of "enormously climbs" and it does not exclude that some Spanish finance institutes will slip into red numbers. </seg>
<seg id="26"> He thinks the FROB can replace the money market at Kaptitalaufstockungen. </seg>
<seg id="27"> After he assuring that Sabadell can survive also a temporary closing of the markets, it invalidates the argument of some bankers who prophesy already a new liquidity crisis. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Stressed it one can not bring anything into circulation, however, unlike the incidents in June, one can achieve short-term financing above Repogeschäfte and catch the crisis in this way. </seg>

<seg id="3"> When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not insist on that at the first phase participate. You reserved yourself the second round. </seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg id="1"> Zapatero and the red line of Germany </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin decided for the Beibehalt of the euro, but made conditions for the entire European Union simultaneously. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tensions on the markets activated a double answer of the government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero presented new adaptation measures, begun with tax reductions for Small- and Kleinstunternehmen, the regulation of time work enterprises or the cancellation of the 426 euros of support for unemployed persons that do not get any unemployment pay, up to the denationalization of 49 percent of AENA, of the administration of the airports Barajas and El Prat as well as 30 percent of the state lottery. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand the deputy head of the government, Elena Salgado, supports the criticism with the aid of the former government president Felipe González at the chancellor Angela Merkel as persons responsible, that the present crisis has sworn. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How are these processes to be understood? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is anticipated, that Merkels is position no error of their public relations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it is a question of a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In this case Germany takes a basically new perspective for the organization of our future which collides with the maintaining of the traditional traditions of a majority of his partners. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Faced with the resistances in Europe one begins more than three possible ways out in Germany from the crisis too spekuliern. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The First: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries during which south would have to leave the euro room. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Second: The Reintroduction of the German Marks - although that rings at the time of rather according to Science Fiction -, supports from a majority of the public opinion, approx. 50 percent of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The third parties: A conversion of the euro according to German proposals. That means: more macroeconomic control; severe housekeeping; Penalization of the countries which infringe the handicaps; möglichereweise the failure of some countries as well as the expansion of the costs of potential adaptation measures onto the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is unequivocal and emerges already for some time. Therefore there are not now any excuses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First 2009, than both the IWF and the European commission created stimuli for deficits and a constitution reform pulled the German government out of the sleeve in order to prevent this from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> That was the first sign for the drifting between the, what Germany held for necessary (severe tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of his European partners, including France. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The Central European country put the second sign when Merkel postponed the decision for the rescue of Greece painfully. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Then that was criticized strongly. But fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public one and the published opinion were absolute against a rescue of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally Merkel comes in the last October days again with an unequivocal position. It demands a reform of the descendants of the European Union in order to facilitate the rescue of a country and to engage the private lenders simultaneously to bear a part of the costs. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position was interpreted as anti-European, there they the Ireland crisis and following everything drove forward. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But their proposal, although something sweetens, was accepted. In the next months we will participate in the reform of the European Union which is supposed to facilitate these measures from 2013. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany drew a red line which proposes not to cross it. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It says it to all of them that - even if now unpopular measures must be taken - there will not be the old mode of operation of the euro from this appointment anymore. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In 2013 the year of birth of a new currency room will be in which the contravening countries in a hard way are punished, can be forced to that to declare oneself in an insolvent way and in this case the private sector must take over a part of the costs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows us that we must break a hard growth course with high saving and investment rates, moderation of the consumption, improvement of the productivity and competitive capacity as well as positive aussen-economical balances. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The other alternative that is based on indebtedness and building trade with gigantic holes in the balance of payments so as it was mentioned by Spain in boom times, will not be accepted simple. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would do badly at not understanding it. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not a question only of driving the state deficit up to the year 2013 on three percent. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much harder. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the worst thing which we could do under these conditions is to deceive us ourselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope for the present turbulences changing into more rest. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And that we will use the possibilities which are offered to us up to the spring 2013. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero understood that also so, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the discussion with the large-scale enterprises on the last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) refers to that, that in spite of the criticism at Merkel the hypothesis, to create order in the own house, their way has prepared. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look like this that something would be changed at that. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Under the possibilities taken into account that one is that we would have to leave the euro room crammed with few serious countries not to exclude. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In This Case Germany could say still to us it warned us. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Sport and rule avoidance </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tricks as those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show invention spirit, however not the will, to avoid a sanction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The exclusion supposedly instigated by two players of the real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of the 23rd November against the Ajax in the champions League led to a lot of ink being spilled about that whether it around an unsporting action or not acted and whether possibly both players of the UEFA should be sanktioniert. </seg>
<seg id="4"> As is generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before time Playing (their team had won already unequivocal) and several fouls played so that the referee showed them the second yellow card. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way, and since the real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will fulfill the stipulated sanction during the next league game against the Auxerre and get so into the next game phase without cards. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Finally the Disziplinarkommitee of the UEFA punished the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the shared players with different amounts of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is to be found rather frequently in the world of the soccer. </seg>
<seg id="8"> You are so widespread, that she is a part of the Ethos - the rules unwritten, but followed in this event. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of the arisen debate around the represented case goes back, that a team of the soccer club played real Madrid (that sets noble-mindedness and honor in his hymn and had punished his players on other occasions for similar incidents) in this case the title role, and onto the dramatization through Mourinho that more added an episode to his long history as a theatrical and provoking technician. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> That is in Any Case the debate turns around whether this behavior not forbidden expressly from the statutes contradicts the principles of the sport, whether these actions represent a rule avoidance. In fact this approach sticks to the statutes of the sport, to seem to avoid his sense, however. </seg>
<seg id="11"> With this matter the damage caused to the sport spirit should be examined. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sport spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect which was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="13"> A further aspect of a clean game consists in avoiding that the contravening players draw an unjustified benefit from the Gegenteam. Also that did not happen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradoxical thing of the action of the players of the real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we usually mean by wrong game or rule avoidance, because the avoidance of the rule was not carried out secret in order to avoid a sanction but it should be as striking as possible so that she is punished by the referee. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players waited and accepted the sanction gladly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is which kind from advantage the contravening ones drew from the deliberate fouls. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Here should be emphasized, that neither the rival was not brought into a more detrimental situation still advantages for the played game were demanded, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to play with less players. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is not also a useful strategy for the next game, because the club is not in charge of these players then. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The advantage consists obviously, that the players begin the next game phase of the champions League without cards that their participation in a future game could threaten. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a question of a long-term one, to advantage uncertain to a certain degree, since the team could also drop out sometime. In addition the players with this approach receive a sanction and change into the second card cycle in which they drop out because of card accumulation with a card less than in the first cycle. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In this way it is not so clear whether it is really a question of an advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Finally direct such approaches not against the sport spirit which also strategic decisions appertain to in order to draw a maximum benefit from the rules. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In This Case the players did not want to avoid any sanction (that would be in fact an unequivocal case of rule avoidance), they rather wanted to choose, when they subject themselves to this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> You made a strategic decision without evading a punishment or fleeing from it. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Although the border is blurred between inventiveness and rule surroundings, I believe that it deals itself with inventiveness with this matter around a clear case. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the polemic arose due to two factors: Because it was a question of two selfexclusions and because of the kind of the intentional rule transfer. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The damage that was added to the principles of the sport by these actions is less ethical as rather aesthetic kind. </seg>

<seg id="4"> As the Turrón and the Christmas lottery there are in the consecrating night time group suppers which provide the restaurant and leisure time trade of Barcelona with oxygen also again. But due to the depression they activate a price offensive in order to catch also the customer segment which represents the big mass: They almost all would like to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a noon or evening food, confirm the consulted entrepreneurs and associations. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way the accountancy still a little complicated becomes, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) made all orders fall into the week of the 13th December, with the result of an avalanche of reservations of suppers onto two Spitzentager (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders weekdays in front of that. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Since 2008, than the bad times began, many enterprises stopped the group suppers for budget reasons. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In order not to have to renounce this tradition, many employees pay these from their own bag. </seg>
<seg id="8"> How the economic situation is ever, Niedrigstpreise are demanded, confirms the chairperson of the restaurant committee of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs. </seg>

<seg id="14"> The group of Soteras says, the demands for this Friday with the intention to spend less than 30 euros would become boomen. The group fit their menus with complete offers to between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> With another leading group, Andilana who maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others) the particularity of the calendar led to preferred reservations, even from beginning of November. </seg>
<seg id="16"> "We made the impossible thing possible in order to maintain the previous year prices with menus for every taste of 19,95 to 30 euros," it declares. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> At AT Grup that guides El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and in total 23 restaurants one does not lose the optimism, after since the second quarter the gains flourish again and good, although onto few days of concentrated prospects for the Christmas business is expected. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Sources of the company group emphasize that also the 18th will be a hyperactive day with friend groups which celebrate Christmas. </seg>
<seg id="19"> A Christmas menu was added to the six group menus for 30 euros or more than price hit. One has to spend 10 percent more the impression that the customers are ready than in the previous year and to want more details in the corresponding train, as for example Cava. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Also in some companies one sees green rungs sprouting, for which the employees are invited again. That provides the impression that the group chimneys are again in the upswing. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The republican leader allows the party a secret vote about his living on in the office. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Huguet suggests a more pluralistic government and the end of the plenary session principle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a prescription, around for the zigsten time one internal riot to avoid in the rows of the ERC direction-free to the loss of 11 representatives and half of the votes. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The party chairperson is conscious that his resignation threat does not suffice to those being close of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is today as weakened as their mentor himself and will not bring him the same head fragmentation as other former currents do. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Therefore the leader of Esquerra attempts with a wink to win the new critics, which would safeguard his position up to the next local choices. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> For the beginning told yesterday at, that the more than 200 regional councilors of ERC could comment on his remaining secretly in the office. </seg>
<seg id="8"> With choice notes, not with higher hand. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If the Carodisten wanted to give a ticket to the Präsidenen, they could do this without having to fear reprisals. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In fact the head would like to avoid both the impression of split and that of subjection under his person. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It strengthened in several interviews, it would not be confirmed with half of the voices plus one feel, and he added without specification of percentages a result "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good either. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Carod Nahestehenden demand more from the president than to provide his office only for the party. An inadequate gesture, since Puigcercós controls the uppermost organ of the congresses. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But since they are not in charge of a sufficient majority for the promotion from resignations, they will agree a procedure plan of now until May with the executive board. </seg>
<seg id="14"> For that they expect, at the preparation of the document about strategic reorientation, that the management will present to the council to be able to participate for the vote at the 18th. </seg>
<seg id="15"> It is your intention to vouch for Puigcercós. In the corresponding train this is supposed to promise, the congress to bring forward into the fall 2011, which the party top already holds for a fact. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The party chairperson of the ERC thinks, the "polyphony" damages the stability and he strives once and for all for washing their dirty laundry behind closed doors to bring the organization into the situation. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In this sense the article which the current Conseller Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Faced with the one that Puigcercós is an ideologist the holder of Innovació held it for a fact that the party chairperson is supported "in the exchange against different objectives." </seg>
<seg id="19"> He counted five from which two stand to the fore. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Firstly, the "restructuring" of the executive board, in this way these at least 90 percent's of the party members represents, that is called the inclusion of new faces from Carods environment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The Second could be the great piece of news. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The second round of 'the' a walk in the case of which the participants made themselves strong for the story was 'pleasure in the language' </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> "I understand that with the sex in the language, however... The finger in the wound? What is "expected" by me"? the writer Luisa Valenzüla asked that should open the second round of 'Lot placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-speaking literature and used the subtitle of their question on this occasion (on another event the Round Table was dedicated to the sex in the language, it declared). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The finger in the wound... "brings us in trouble," the Argentine Schriftstellein spat sweetly towards the public, which mainly consisted of young people that came together on the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) which Valenzüla, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated in in order to attend to rounds moderated to this by Marisol Shultz table. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Luisa Valenzüla read out a text which she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and which Shultz characterized as a splendid story after that. Luisa tells in first person and is the protagonist that on the search it is to find out what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, from which she receives indeed no answer, but tips for the guide of their story. </seg>
<seg id="6"> She leaves the Infektologen convincedly: "Patience is not my strength, maybe that is my wound." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> To the end, after a frustrating approximation to the traumatologist that robbed her of the breath right on the walk, and that declares her, however, that Wunde is not a scientific concept enthült the psychoanalyst the secret: "the wound is the really Open one, the symbolic thing is the scar." </seg>
<seg id="8"> The central figure of the story sighs facilitatedly and closes, that they "of the wound only found out that this is really open and does not "exist." But it is convinced, that the pleasure in the language and their traps mix. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Valenzüla, the writer, played with both of them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez introduced also a delighting story that he mentioned 'Praise of the invention', and that does not mention in that of the fingers in the wound indeed, but that is discovered. </seg>
<seg id="11"> With allusions onto the magic realism it tells about a famous magician that touched the clouds, returned far traveled men or reconstructed the virtue lost by a girl. The story did an about-turn and reported about America, the great novel that from the beginning did not lack his own chroniclers, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo that criticizes the abundance of the histories told by the Eroberen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "Cervantes that invited us all (the writers) mocked the deceived witnesses that emerged in the histories represented as true, however, in another manner the history of Americas would never have been told - with fancy that lost even the shame." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> However, he emphasizes, "it is the madmen and liar, that imagine the things best," and there reality and lie, where one does not know to which page the story belongs anymore, where the fictitious literature reaches the peak, approximate to each other. </seg>
<seg id="14"> He mentions that the 'tradition Cervantes' in fact. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "We inherited from him, to be what is told." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> When it was up to Mayra Montero, she commented and the writer praised the variety of the interpretations which the FIl had contributed the invitation to to the Round table 'The finger in the wound'. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The Cuban and Puerto Rican dedicated their contribution of the large wound of the social power that strikes their country - as whole Latin America - as a result of the fights for the drug traffic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "I believe, that to contain good literature, good poetry, good songs" a silent, deliberately not planned engagement," she declared, after she had emphasized that literature is communication and obligation that builds themselves "up" between the author and the readers as at a "chemical re-action." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The Spanish poet Luis García Montero concluded the evening, whose contribution also this finger of the engaged writer in the wound of the writer hevorhob. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> He noticed that in a short-lived world also the intellectual habits and the control of the consciousness come to dogmatisms, and will forget "that behind every confirmation a small refusal stands and behind every denial a small yes." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> "Around in the possession our thought and the reality be, we must nuance: And nuancing means frequent, to put the finger into the wound and to bother those ones that feel a lot of wohler if they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in preassembled ideas without nuances, and to bother also the powerful ones that prefer it, to divide the world into black and white it noticed and invited to rediscovering the sense of the writing. </seg>

<seg id="3"> In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey during the final two styles different, set by their respective coaches in addition face, and of this meeting characterized from contrasts is reflected in the results. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Rubén Omar Romano looks back upon three defeats in finals, he has on the and Abs in his career experiences, but three times he had decisive games, and up to now it held itself well, for which this occasion of very special importance for it is. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Argentine blew up with the medal to the second champion, he fell behind the winners a step and strange to say he delivered with the same team consecutive finals. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The santistische strategist achieved the first final as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when del Morelia with which he found out a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2 had the reins in the hand; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' it achieved the decisive duel that he lost to Rayados also with 3-1. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010' at which they played against Los Diablos Rubén had to put in a setback again since the game with 2-2 ended undecidedly against Los Choriceros after 210 game minutes, however, during the penalty it got on with 3-1 and got two possibilities to put in his title, however, ultimately three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to one 4-3. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Rubén had lost already two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his tall rival. Therefore he would not like yet to be followed once from the misfortune and to free from the bad charm in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time although he confirms that for it the most important thing is the game itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The helmsman commented, "I would like to become champion, I would not like to break any statistics, that is for a club, for my affection which I devote myself to, and therefore the title to me will come, but what happens before, is the most important thing," when one questions it about the lost finals. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> He had the last final still strongly in the memory, he assures to have learned a lot from that: "The only lesson that we can draw from that is, that until the referee does not whistle the end, we can not celebrate, we are not at the line prepared, the players also, because we were already the last time with two penalties it prepares for that to drop out, and I believe that that is a lesson until the game is not ended, there is not any reason to the celebrating." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Knowing that this series could be decided on by penalty-firing does not worry him, because he trusts in his players: "One never during the penalty-firing wants to arrive, one would like to close in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is not any alternative and one must be prepared for that, above tour were we prepares, however unfortunately the fate prepared a bad game for us, sometimes due to nervousness or the vehement aim to hold the title already in the hands that left something to us for this final, and we hope for its not resulting in that this time." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> It suits in Romanso Macht not to be only a second champion anymore and to taste the fame that the titles with themselves bring for the first time. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The Quebecer radio presenter Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback just the same before the Canadian supervisory board for radio norms (CCNR) because of his controversial comments above social welfare and Haitian as because of his aggressive speech manner above radio. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> FM team represents the opinion, M. Dupont and his CHOI 98,1 to the CCNR indeed the right to own opinion comment would have, however, certain comments would have "inaccurate information about the social welfare and without authorization negative representations of the Haitians as well as also a so rough speech manner that is not measured to the during the day broadcast broadcastings for contain." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The supervisory board had also end-deduced that a discussion about suicide that contains the circulation of the names of two persons that committed suicide offends against the codex of the radio broadcasting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments done during the broadcastings broadcast by 2008 and 2010 in the period. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The first decree was inserted "commun" due to a complaint of the "front the personnes assistées sociales you Québec." </seg>
<seg id="7"> The activist organization had complained, that the amounts mentioned in the broadcasting are inaccurate. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The presenters should give information rather sound than misleading. </seg>
<seg id="9"> With regard to presenter Stéphane Dupont had represented the opinion to the topic's suicide, the suicide is an expression of cowardice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The majority of the supervisory board members had drawn the conclusion, the provided message is at that that suicide must not be regarded as solution of life crises. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "The majority of the supervisory board considers that the consequences of the broadcasting "Dupont le midi" standing into consideration would have touched a sensitive topic in family-oriented and suitable kind and manner." </seg>
<seg id="12"> Therefore it was not reserved with any reproach opposite his person. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The last quarrel point affected the statements that had referred to the earthquake in Haiti. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had given a media-effective quarrel conversation concerning that, that an amount of reactions caused. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The CHOI-presenter had declared not to have donated for the benefit of the Haiti-help since one would not know with security whether the needy also really received the money donations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The supervisory board thinks that these comments of character not improper were, that, however, their cumulative effect presents a without authorization negative representation of the Haitians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "I atoned for already my three day long suspension punishment in this thing." </seg>

<seg id="1"> 450 million in contracts without announcement </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hydro-Québec granted on friendly terms project engineering companies 450 millions dollar at contracts for the waterpower project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Right in this avalanche of more than 100 contracts a consortium stands, existing from the Skilled BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor that received the most important part, that is the one of the project management, for a sum of 295 million dollars without announcement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This consortium, mentionedly "Énergie gérance," überantworten this important, hydroelectric project to the private sector in 2004 as a concomitant of the decision of Hydro-Québec their responsibility at the level of a sum of 5 billion dollars, educated. </seg>
<seg id="5"> At the beginning of 2005 the consortium "Énergie gérance" got the lucrative contract without there having been a public announcement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For the Parti Québécois the going back represents on enterprise consortiums a serious ethical problem which causes the risk of the Wettbewerbsverdrändung as well as a price increase. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "This is a new kind and manner of a fixed game and invalidates the competition." </seg>
<seg id="8"> "That means, that" one instead of fixed games instead of in secret way now in open form carries on," Sylvain Simard, representative of the PQ, declared yesterday, on the press conference. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> On the early morning Simard had raised the question before the national assembly, because it seems hardly understandable to him as the interest of the public can be operated in this way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Resource minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon to that when she vehement denied that it would have been a question of a fixed game with this contract. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "I remain loyal to my line," she cursed in her confirming, the PQ went on "dishonest" and "it lacks hardness." </seg>
<seg id="12"> She said "it is the least thing" that the PQ apologizes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The model of the consortium is worldwide usual practice. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is a question usually of a within a given time so limited alliance that allows two or several enterprises to bundle up their expert opinions with regard to a commandment onto an announcement for a complex project. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The project "Eastmain" shows a high complexity level concerning his work extent. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The construction method is in process and is supposed to be made to 2012. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Nevertheless the contract was assigned without a competition having been able to occur; there had been already negotiations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Furthermore the model of the consortium does not represent an exception by any means anymore in the Quebec even with relatively simple projects. </seg>
<seg id="19"> As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted down last week, object of government investigations is the model of the consortium used in the field of the civil engineer and consultation being. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> A short flying of the Quebecer enterprise register allows it, to designate more than 200 consortiums, from those ones to be some of continuous duration to seem. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In this way the company Dessau cooperates for example with the majority of their nuclear competitors which CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult number among in partnership. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Any linking, and from that there is several dozen, leads back to the very same juridical person, indeed on Dessau. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Concerned something the consortium "Énergie gérance," minister Normandeau stressed so, that "the territory of the Baie James is subjected to a special worker dynamics and that Hydro-Québec expresses bill to this fact since the seventies in special kind and manner." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Réal Laporte, the tall employer of the Société d'énergie de la of Baie James (SEBJ), gave a declaration, that the nose made about the fact that the contract was granted about the project management according to accord turn up. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "When you do an announcement and gives it only few applicants, your prices will shoot up." </seg>
<seg id="26"> "You have therefore two possibilities: either you take the people, which are on this Mart and say to you: one will negotiate a satisfactory accord for a good price." </seg>
<seg id="27"> "The thought is, however, that the price is not decisive but the expertise of the persons," confirmed Laporte. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> This contract granted to the consortium "Énergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts over more than 50,000 of the Parti Québécois preserved dollar. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The contracts were approved either by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> After inspection the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineer and consultant contracts, the companies or their branches, under that in particular resource labs, between 2002 and were granted March 2010. </seg>
<seg id="31"> SNC-Lavalin had gathered 22 contracts onto himself, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without including their participation in "Énergie gérance" at that. </seg>
<seg id="32"> All these contracts were negotiated. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They amount in the Gesamt to 449 783 344 $, locked up in that the contract with "Énergie gérance" above 295 131 564 $. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Sylvain Simard had made be announced, that the four companies, who form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) the "Parti libéral you presumably confessed to Québec" are. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Minister Normandeau had made remember, the PQ is equally united with the companies that "financed" it before she specified that it is rather a question of their managers. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Barometer of verantworungsbewussten consumption - The "green" label is not confidence-raising </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Greener, but frankly sceptical. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The Quebecer consumer has little confidence in the main protagonists of the lasting growth, however, in the same way little for the labeled brands or the eco-markings which are supposed to control his choice. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Damage although it swims in a media-effective universe, where it teems from information for the benefit of a more responsible consumption only so: the barometer of responsible consumption has to lament a lack of credible information, an inadequacy showed that looks recognizable as a brake of his engagement as the first reading that yesterday was kept off. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Although they drove forward the consumption of the so called socially compatible products in the year 2010, nevertheless the Quebecer seem to express credit little to those ones which these attempt to sell. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Two thirds the Quebecer population admits to give little belief to the environmental engagement of the companies just the same in fact as to the green enterprise advertising so the instrument worked out from the responsible consumer center of the university Sherbrooke betrays. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Another discovery: half of the consumers doubts about the trustworthiness of the certificates official, added to the supposedly fair products, but also the plausibility of the products and brands which declare themselves as ecology-minded, so the barometer. </seg>
<seg id="8"> To same pattern the discourse of the politicians is taken on this topic only by 14,6% of the Quebecer of population seriously. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The information with regard to responsible consumption shines nevertheless importantly for the stimulation of this consumption segment which is stimulated in approximately only a third's of the Quebecer consumers times. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In Fact emptiness and doubtful character of the information subdued the eagerness of 46% of the consumers. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is the second according to the higher price of the products, on the part of the barometer brake identified. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition a third of the Quebecer of the indicated efficiency of the green products and services that one is bothered to them to put onto the hand stands mistrustfully opposite. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to another communication over half of the consumers their habits had already changed in the year 2010 and changed mainly the brand of a or several products in order to give Ausdruck to their conviction. </seg>
<seg id="14"> According to barometer they had favored also to 61% of purchases with traders of their quarter and favored the purchase of food built on in their region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Greener and more responsible - the index of the ecology-minded consumption had reached this year one 64 of the maximum value of 100 - the homo consumus the Quebec's loves it, to present oneself as a king of the recycling that attempts to reduce his tracks left behind in the environment in his seeing to the animal protection. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Nevertheless the social and ecological consciousness seems nevertheless to stop for his car, so the barometer: just once 28% of the Quebecer declared to have used 2010 public means of transportation in the year or to have preferred the going-headquarters in order to demonstrate their ecological interest. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Quebecer government that was asked to participate in the takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris financially by the Société Angus as well as the enterprise Parallèle declares itself with a cooperation understood, however, only in shape a competitive loan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The developer society Angus as well as the enterprise Parallèle that eXcentris had hoped for a donation of cinema complex belonging from the Ministry of Education at the level of seven million dollars for the takeover of the Daniel Langlois on the boulevard Saint-Laurent around this again his actual cineastischen function überantworten, do not receive apparently, which they demanded. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The government accepted indeed to involve oneself, however, in this thing for their own conditions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Instead of the expected donation offers the Quebecer government rather a loan in smaller than the height initially hoped for that could start up a viable solution to useful conditions at least in opinion of the sources entnehmbaren from the state rumor kitchen. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A first plan as well as an inquiry for 12,8 million were rejected already last spring by the Quebec, the petition was corrected since that renewed sum-moderately down. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Was sent already onto minister St-Pierre that leads the acts eXcentris a proposal together with a plan from the president of the "Société de développement of the entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Several days ago he had made a last feature be attributed their. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The counterproposal of the cabinet was sent to the SODEC, however, on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Parallèle and Angus answered now this up to the 31st December. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Anyway the premise of the state donation seems to really have been pushed to the page. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> We call ourselves into memory, that the Quebecer owner community of the cinemas and cinema complexes had revolted against a direct state investment to the support of the takeover of eXcentris when she put forward the argument, the cult minister does not have to give any financial help for immovable projects there, that it has been able to receive cinema halls not also other. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Several other market participants of the segment demanded, however, in contrast substantial, economical help. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Cinema leader Daniel Langlois had presented the author cinema to the construction of the cinema in an own way financed for more than ten years under great difficulties in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exception position on the part of the treasury. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The lack of cinema halls which show independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to hold his clientele near the pole. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The Société Angus as well as the enterprise Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top of, head for her part for a privately financed Campagne, of which they a sum 700 000 $ to hope in order to stimulate the acquisition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Since the spring 2009 only a single canvas leaves with showing films in eXcentris Le Parallèle indeed. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Secret of the in a complex way joggled Canada ventilated </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new, American diplomat lines that were spread by WikiLeaks ventilate the secret about what the United Nations judge under the inferiority complex of the Canadians opposite the Americans; they lay, however, the superiority feeling with the same stroke last-named open opposite Canada. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Subsequently the American diplomats were amazed about the Canadian voter not having the Canadian-American relationships during the ballot in the sense, and they believe, that the visit of president Obama would have helped the conservative government with putting through their budget of 2009! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The four new communications between the American message in Ottawa and Washington that yesterday was spread in public, still more piquant details as the bare substantial contents offer which one has to puzzle over. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One of the 22nd September 2008 connection dating back, that is reported in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage was contained in the full walk over from which point the United Nations do not participate in the actions discussed by their political heads anymore. </seg>
<seg id="6"> For the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the ambassador's employed in Ottawa, American. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Mr Wilkins offers different declaration possibilities of this situation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "One the Canadians almost inherent inferiority complex necessitates arranges possibly the Canadian, political managers a lot rather in order to talk about internal disputes of the everyday life as the United States during this choice the black Peter shut (as 1988 during the campaign about the free trade) ," so he describes. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The United Nations, so he concludes, is "the proverbial Goliath of this choice" thus: omnipräsent, but potentially too alarming, in order to speak of it." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" even less since the two countries have intense political and economical relationships. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Logically," so assessedly it, "it "should be the ability of a candidate, a party and still much more a party leader for the leading of one such essential relationship, that of the voters with the urn walk as a key factor in the sense has." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The other expression of this feeling of importance reads itself in that on the 22nd January 2009 of Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, sent communication, that is supposed to prepare president Barack Obama for his first visit in Ottawa. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Your journey will help with guaranteeing the wide heir stand of the government with the vote of confidence about the federal budget at the beginning of February in the case of which Canada" will announce" "his first deficit after more than one decade to arise due to a stimulation program in the height of 30 to 40 billion dollars," Breese describes. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Nowhere he had not mentioned that the government had had to adjourn the sitting of parliament before Christmas in order to prevent that the parliament would be flung from the coalition and the so conditional wide heir stand of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the suggested stimulation program. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Another, communication dating back of January 2008 and written on the part of the ambassador Wilkins notifies to Washington of the always negative becoming picture, that the series radiated over CBC, dramatic spread from the United States. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The ambassador is worried about broadcastings as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one can observe few subtle allusions at Maher Arar, the "No-Fly cunning" or also payments for the purpose of through muscleman of the CIA of examinations carried out. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Again another communication reports to receive certain prisoners fully about that as Hillary Clinten asked with their French colleagues Bernard Kouchner during their first bilateral meeting for whether Europe is ready from Guantanamo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Mr Kouchner should the question with yes have answered, however on the basis one individual "case to case" decision. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Àm at the end of the meeting, so described, "Omar Khadr gave a paper as regards to the state secretary it, to one 15-year old Muslims of Canadian origin." </seg>
<seg id="20"> "The state secretary promised to check the acts once again." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Finally still let's say that the feelings are aroused with regard to the web page WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Tom Flanagan, an old one and Stephen Harper of consultants standing very closely, had declared over CBC that those ones should "be killed" to persons responsible for this massive leakage. </seg>
<seg id="23"> He had reported here on Mike Huckabee from the United States. </seg>

<seg id="6"> This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the waste gases of the worldwide vehicle fleet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In Copenhagen last year had themselves the tall waste gas emitters as the United States, China, Europe and others under which also Canada counted, obliged to voluntary reduction plans that 49 Gt should turn down the global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt. </seg>
<seg id="8"> From this balance one would have to deduct, however, another 5 Gt in order to stabilize the climate rise from today up to the year 2020 around 2 degrees centigrade in order to prevent that this gets out of control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the white-hot pears escapes from 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light. </seg>
<seg id="10"> With the compact phosphor pears the energy consumption reduces by 75%, with the new LED electric bulbs one reduces this energy demand again around the twofold thing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The compact phosphor pears hold on average between 6000 to 10,000 hours. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The new LED electric bulbs, as for example the ones that the manufacturer Philips launched this week - this society participated after all in the UNO study - have a durability of 25,000 hours and 80% of little energy use as a white-hot pear, which a hint of the saving-possibilities of the exchanging plan provides that is supposed to be used in 100 countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Next to the fact, that iese completely novel electric bulbs only to give very little heat, they can function also with a rheostat. </seg>
<seg id="14"> And they do not contain any mercury. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Several specialists showed that compact phosphor pears show reserves since they contain mercury and that one must dispose it therefore as a requires special disposal, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except for to set the producers a counter availably. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The compact phosphor pear does not represent the main sources at mercuric emissions on the planet, however, according to the report, but rather the coal-fired power stations that emit more mercury considerably in order to produce the electricity wasted by the white-hot pears. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Only in the United States these coal-fired power stations emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The report explains in detail the profits which every country would erwirtschaften thanks to this international program. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Indonesia would save so for example a billion dollars annually CO2 during the purchase of electricity and eight million tons, that means an equivalent of 3,5 coal-fired power stations whose edification Indonesia would cost 2,5 billion. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Within more than six months, of July 2009 until May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher that was held in Iran because of "espionage," the French public in breath held, the diplomacy moved into alert and the deterioration of the relationships between Paris and Tehran accentuated. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This all among the attentive looks of the diplomats of the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The American documents received by WikiLeaks and checked from the newspaper "Le Monde" give away some backgrounds of this crisis. </seg>
<seg id="5"> You describe advice for the contact with their own crisis of "taking of hostages" to these as the Elysée had explained the Americans his strategy that went so far in Iran (a small group of hikers) give. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> You show how the French persons responsible attempted to convince Washington of that that the liberation of the young Frenchwoman not the release of Majid Kakavand, a detained in France and from the American justice of Iranian searched due to trade with material for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program to the Gegeleistung has. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Finally they set the kind and manner with which attempted to manipulate the French executive committee the media for the purpose to do to these the idea plausible the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad played a central role during the liberation from Clotilde Reiss, into a garish light. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In truth he had not done anything in this respect. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> One on the 12th August 2009 into Paris' revised diplomat telegram carries the title "Iran: French comments on the kind and manner of the contact with taking of hostages." </seg>
<seg id="10"> François Richier, Elysée-consultant in strategy questions, talked in company of Patrice Paoli, director of the quay d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle Orient with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> You explained her the French method. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Those ones recommended the Americans to plant everything daran in order to reduce their own citizens that would be held violently in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Noise does," they said, clearly and incessantly" the words "Basic human rights," "innocence," "immediate release" in the media, "articulates. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime which pays attention to his image very sensitively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> "Practices this all the more more especially as you the Iranians ask for not doing that." </seg>
<seg id="16"> Because "Remaining silent does not dissolve anything," past the discussion attempts over on inconspicuous way, the Iranians are "Masters in evading manoevre." </seg>
<seg id="17"> Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "common, Iranian tactics": "Taking of hostages for the purpose of political blackmail." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> It announces, the release of Clotilde Reiss from the prison (that should be achieved on 16th August, on the day at which she flees into the French message) "the payment of a great sum of money demands onto the Iranians" (230,000 euros of bail). </seg>
<seg id="19"> And he lets verlautbaren, the Elysée anticipates further taking of hostages, a phenomenon that will intensify. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The Iranians could arrest "in near future another of the about 1,800 French citizens, that live in Iran," so he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> 28th August 2009. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Clotilde Reiss was released from the prison twelve days ago, keeps on being held, however, in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="23"> An information was circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand whose delivery the United states demand due to illegal trade with sensitive electronics material onto Iran was released from the custody according to decision of a judge in Paris. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The American message surrenders, as numerous other observers, questions about this worrying coincidence. </seg>
<seg id="25"> For Washington, that the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of that for the nuclear program pursues designated material, the release of Majid Khakavand represents a bad piece of news. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Did France accept a horse trading? </seg>
<seg id="27"> The liberation of the Iranian against that one of the Frenchwoman? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> On the occasion of a renewed conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on 4th September François Richier assures that this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The Elysée, so he says, was only "completely does not surprise from the decision of the judge," but attempted also to revolt against that. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "It moved one exchange between the French executive committee and the French Minister of Justice given (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie) ," however "the French government can not change the judicial decision" declares, it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Mr Richier would like to refer also to Majid Kakavand keeping on standing under "severe" supervision of the French secret service. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The Elysée consultant chooses a telephone number, hangs up again, the American diplomat informs then, the Iranian "would be at the time of in the buildings led from the Iranian message in Paris." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran the Elysée does not protect his efforts to make to believe by means of announcements and "attempts to escape" organized by the media, the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential mediator role." </seg>
<seg id="34"> The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and state that the manipulation fruits supports since several press articles reflect the official French version. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> One of the 25th August 2009 dating telegram causes "the media flash of the French authorities." </seg>
<seg id="36"> What is "thanks evidence" based on so much opposite Mr Assad, wonders the Paris message. </seg>
<seg id="37"> "In spite of their declarations fuller Lobpreis the French authorities admit secretly that they have only a vague presentiment of that which in fact the Syrians did." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The document deals then with the reasons which brought the Elysée for this purpose to succumb to this fiction. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The intense communication efforts "it aims at that to confirm Sarkozys to politics of the opening opposite Syria" it analyzes. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A politics launched in 2008 which then was perceived from numerous critic voices in France as well as in the exterior as too early and undeserved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> "The Syrian role blowing up" attempts "to make" to Paris "Syria which commendation one can achieve when one plays a constructive role in the region clear." </seg>
<seg id="42"> It is an objective in addition "To sow discord between Syria and Iran." </seg>
<seg id="43"> The American message knows this from good source. </seg>
<seg id="44"> On 11th August François Richier had entrusted her: "as a matter of course we do not know, whether to ever have worked the Syrians something." </seg>
<seg id="45"> "But we thanked them for all that." </seg>
<seg id="46"> "This should bring about confusion at least with the Iranians." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Clotilde Reiss returns on 16th May 2010 to France. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Elysée. </seg>

<seg id="2"> In bright excitement due to corruption suspicion the executive committee of the FIFA appoints on Thursday the aligner countries of the world championships 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice in the case of which the Rangeln around influence as well as the Lobbying tend to push the technical criteria into the background. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A thing is, however, secure: the edition 2018 of the royal discipline of the FIFA will occur in Europe, their traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spanien-Portugal, Niederlande-Belgien). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The edition 2022 will turn out then a little more exotically; the International Soccer Association hopes for being able to win 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) for themselves after the premiere on the African continent in the year, or keeping on pursuing his subsidiary in the United States or in Far East (Japan, South Korea). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The list of the personalities, that to the delegation correspondingly (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of the government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) the measure of the economic and political use of a world championship pre-sets. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The machinations behind the scenes tend therefore up to the last minute to last. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In a difficult way otherwise, to make a hierarchy of the candidates. </seg>
<seg id="8"> According to the evaluation report of the FIFA, offer the English, Spanish-Portuguese one (2018) and American (2022) acts bessseren arguments as those of their competitors. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees to the hour of the choice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The Sunday Times that stood with the arranging of the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the disclosures could have ruined the chances just as well for their own country, cradle of the soccer, that was allowed to deliver the world championship only an only time 1966 indeed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The BBC had given to the renewed on Monday fertile soil, when it had radiated a documentary, that three influential members of the Kommitees, that is Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under bombardment takes. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Reason enough, to annoy the FIFA and to embarrass the English persons responsible that in the first place had practiced an intense Lobbying with David Cameron in these last weeks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The head of the government hopes for a reprint of the move succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair that had achieved the organization of the Olympic Games 2012 in the year 2005 for London. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="14"> Would this intense use suffice in order to increase the value of the image of England again before the Kommitee? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Nothing is less secure, because the duet Spanien-Portugal does not lack trumps with his already ready stadiums, his expert opinion (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and his soccer culture. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Nevertheless the economical and financial dark sides of the two countries could subdue their aspirations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The possible reprisals against the English as well as the doubts above solvency of Spain and Portugal make the chances of Russia, which became the important outsider in spite of his gaps in the dossier (Stages, hotels, transportation), go up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Prime minister Vladimir Putin decided, however, that frank hint onto the imputations of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" denounced on the part of the Kommiteemitglieder. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> "One throws dirt at it, attempted one to compromise her," Putin cursed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> For 2022 the United States seem, strengthened through the experience by 1994 to be the logical favorites. </seg>
<seg id="21"> First economic world power, seat of the FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to show a long list of advantages opposite Japan and South Korea that made a very beautiful project separately. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="22"> Nevertheless these new candidacies seem too early for two countries which had organized the competitions in the year 2002. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Another threat: the approval of the WM 2026 for China that makes the Asiatic chances on 2022 become frail ardently desired of the FIFA. </seg>

<seg id="6"> The next one calls a mandate in the Elysée. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The current head of state will be a candidate ergo in the year 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> But the obviousness does not stand to the page of the mystery which sticks to the premiership function well to face. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Therefore one must do as if the doubt would exist from now on. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In the one, as also in the other sense. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In 2006 Jacques Chiracs set the supporters, a third mandate is not impossible without believing even in that. </seg>
<seg id="12"> On 15th November Nicolas Sarkozy assured in serious clay to make his decision "sometime in the fall of the year 2011." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> That it remember at the Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of that one UMP parliamentarians the perspectives of "two mandates" would let, feverishness had spread accordingly a little bit. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Was that the official announcement of his candidacy? </seg>
<seg id="15"> Far lackedly. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The president made be reminded only of the constitution change of 2008 restricting the number of the five year long terms of office only to two. </seg>
<seg id="17"> It did not do a determination, any announcement. </seg>

<seg id="19"> "You have in the worst case another seven and a half years with me, or at best," it declared to them in July 2009. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Onto a new one in May 2010: Does not "believe that I do not think about the phase after that." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> His words of the day before yesterday do not turn him more into the candidate than on day before; but neither little. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The acceleration of the race around the candidacy with the hp on a page. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The photo of the competition with Ségolène Royal, who drives Nicolas Sarkozy for this purpose, is not to be revealed, however, itself. </seg>
<seg id="25"> On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in the year 2012, that many members of the hp earlier than accepted exhort to the challenge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The bad inquiries on the other hand. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The voters would prefer to the first Male the rights a candidacy of François Fillon that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to inquiry of the BVA-L'Express). </seg>
<seg id="28"> "We have a candidate, and there are not with the UMP any discussions about that," immediately and cautiously the environment of the prime minister reacted. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Euro: the EZB is forced to retain their purchases of state papers </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The last meeting of the central bank council of the EZB in the last year should offer occasion to show possibilities, as one from the crisis comes out, or to announce at least the order of a great number at unconventional measures of the monetary policy that is supposed to come at the end of the year to their end. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The crisis of the European state indebtedness engages, the central bank in Frankfurt can not afford it undoubtedly, in order not to cause their aggravation, also the present, more than strained situation on the European loan markets too verwirken. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The political costs in this case would be by far too high. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The French finance minister Christine Lagarde had welcomed yesterday the role taken by the EZB, active on the occasion of a press conference for the benefit of the solution of the national budget indebtedness of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="6"> She did not dare to say, whether she thinks the central bank can do still more for example through boost of their program of the purchases of state loans. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "I keep my considerations for my European trading partners before (...) ." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the EZB had not shown himself very volubly on day before in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing through the economic and currency sow shot of the European parliament concerning his intentions, but had rather been satisfied, to refer to that, that the program of the purchases of state papers on the secondary market "would be practiced" and that we "will see" with the meeting on Thursday, "as the decisions turn out." </seg>
<seg id="9"> Only certainty: The EZB will leave their leading-interest at 1% as before, the historically lowest level since May 2009. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In the practice the obligation purchases of the treasury were doubled by the EZB last week on about 1,35 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And according to indiscretions of some traders she is supposed to have made yesterday new purchases at Irish and Portuguese state papers. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In total the central banks of the euro system since May carried out 2010 purchases at the level of 67 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Among the traders the Antizipation of a follow-up of the buying rate is not doubted under any circumstances (see page 29). </seg>
<seg id="14"> The economists do not expect already any remarkable course change anymore. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> If the loan businesses will already have disappeared from more than three months from the arsenal of the EZB, does latter still to get in free way at the unlimited resource reserves, and indeed over a period of a week up to three months. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The economists already set themselves off grabbedly today on that that this measure will still spread around some months. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "I can not imagine that the EZB will change their program in essential way." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "Otherwise she would accept the risk, to provoke new tensions in the short term," so Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank, presumes. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "An exit planned for the course of the first quarter 2011, progressive seems more probable to me," Norbert Bräms, economist, anticipates for his part at Sal. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Oppenheim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> In the field of their interventions on the market of the state indebtedness "the EZB should maintain such purchase volume at obligations that stimulates the sluggish market," Norbert Bräms adds. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In view of the relevance of the exposed position of the European banks on the markets of the state indebtedness in the euro zone the central bank does not have any other choice than to retain their presence on the market. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "It must go for every price onto the Steller of the lacking investors on the market and act in such a way in order to prevent the rash enthusiasm about the net yields paid to the weakest states," testified an important obligation holder yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Because when the interest rates prepare for the high-altitude flight, the states would be hindered that still more, to reduce their indebtedness or only also to stabilize. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This is the price to the protection of the euro. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The government Berlusconi takes cover in Italy </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to a week beginning worrying for Italy the situation relaxed yesterday a little with the drop of the corner interests onto 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="3"> A return to the treacherous silence. </seg>
<seg id="4"> At the end of the meeting with the minister for economic affairs the region chairpersons Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indecipherable" and to have it with an "unpredictable" weekend reckon to hear what that Affecting, however, denied immediately. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On Tuesday anyway the scissors with the German interest rates would have achieved his record of 210 base points, and the prices of the contracts to the cover of the bankruptcy risk went up onto 263 points, which had caused a certain rash in Rome. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Silvio Berlusconi had referred near his Council of Ministers to the discrepancy of Spain for the German interest rates being near 400 base points. </seg>
<seg id="7"> His right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed itself, however, than "hardly gotten" by the "market turbulences" and a possible danger of infection from direction Ireland. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "The good information is that Italy, the third national economy of the euro zone, is not as Greece or Ireland." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "The bad piece of news is that Italy as Portugal is," declares Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson institutes. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In the plain text that is called, his problem is not to be able to cover his financing need anymore the Absenz of economic growth and the accompanying, schwindsüchtigen control inputs that get the state into danger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The last Brussels predictions were a cold shower for the government. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In the future an Italian growth is expected of 1,1% in the year 2011 and of 1,4% in the year 2012... although the budget budget present with the senate for the examination reckons 1,3% and/or 2%. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Under these conditions, so the EU commission calculates, the budget deficit will form in the next year another 4,3% of the BIP (towards that of the governments' predicted 3,9%) and 3,5% in the year 2012 (instead of 2,7%). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Therefore also the riot around a new budget collective that could be fit in from 7 billion euros after the holidays for a sum. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "When force, new economy measures must "be taken," auditor Olli Rehn means. </seg>
<seg id="16"> To the hour Italy receives the support of international institutions. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Is the foundation of Italy's economy all right and his accounts are controlled, we already since long time repeat that," Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund insures, who is entrusted with Italy near the IWF. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "At the moment there are not any problems, neither on short-term, still onto long-term view, there of Italy in spite of his high indebtedness (119,2% of the BIP in the year 2011, A. through R.) to be demanded smaller stabilization progress than of other countries," pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD, observes. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The question about the political unsteadiness remains. </seg>
<seg id="20"> On 14th December Silvio Berlusconi will gegenübersehen to a motion of no confindence of the chamber of deputies, due to which the preferred choices already at the end of March could be organized. </seg>
<seg id="21"> A little favorable period approaches therefore for a decision with regard to a hard crisis. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Europeans think about the expansion of the anticrisis measures </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Christine Lagarde had still highlighted it explicit yesterday within the framework of a press conference in Paris: "I believe, one proved it still in the Sunday afternoon as well as also at the evening: The Europeans stick together unequivocally, are ready and engaged, to defend their currency as well as their currency area." </seg>
<seg id="3"> Although completely relative - the yesterday noted withdrawal with the interest rates of the European state obligations was water onto the mills of the governments as well as the EZB. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It can not be talked about a normalizing beginning, however, yet. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The rating agency standard & Poor's had announced, they can the fault note of Portugal, the presumably most effective target of the speculators nowadays, to reduce. </seg>
<seg id="6"> "As in May a real lack withstands the opinion of the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas so at clearness and political perceptibility which burdens especially the banking systems." </seg>
<seg id="7"> Particularly, especially as "the political time goes by much more slowly than those of the markets." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The European countries which are presumably conscious of both this fissure and the danger which hides itself in that to themselves intensify the discussions for the strengthening of the already available anticrisis measures. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The informal consultations between the most directly affected Ministers of Finance and broadly speaking precede with their vis-a-vis of the G20 well. </seg>

<seg id="13"> What concerns the EU stability grounds, so their executive director Klaus Regling already on Tuesday in Singapour began his Asia-tour in order to inform the investors of the developments in Far East with regard to the crisis in Europe. </seg>

<seg id="18"> Reforms which are supposed to be added to the economy measures, yet show effects in nearer future. </seg>
<seg id="19"> To walk Lisbon and Madrid another way along than this Greece and Ireland did. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both one, than it suits also to the other one for every price at that to avoid to have to ask for international support before they made their own budget correctives and decided on unavoidable structural reforms that in the long run the confidence returns them. </seg>
<seg id="21"> To maintain the European investors in turn about the available options, in order to speed up the normalizing process of the markets of state loans. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Axel Weber had produced, who was on 24th November in Paris on the journey, when first the idea, that if the 750 billions of euros mobilized through Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, so the union would not hesitate, to grasp the own bag renewed. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The economists of Barclays Capital, with regard to the market of the European state indebtedness very to the fore standing protagonist, judge, a prolongation of around the 100 billion euros would suffice, "preferably" in shape a direct liquidity syringe. </seg>
<seg id="24"> This means exists: the European mechanism of remunerated finance stabilization that is in 60 billion euros times. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Since the debate is on the Ile-de-France in full progress around the modernization of the traffic economy, it rains billions. </seg>
<seg id="3"> At least in the discussions. </seg>
<seg id="4"> One calls in particular the 23 billion at that into memory for the metro gravel of Paris, that of the Société you are supposed to be built gravel Paris. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In order to lead the start of building of the SGP into the ways, the state called out a capital donation of 4 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the theoretical pattern this is the sum which would make to give their twofold one a part of the finance sum too on the markets for the SGP possible then. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Finally today it resulted in first projections. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The supplement budget of 2010 ones, checked by the finance commission of the national assembly this morning, contains the planned measures in order to raise the first part of this money. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is a question at that of two kinds of measures: the creation of a special tax to the Erschliessund and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Erstere, so one takes articles 15 of the draft, goes "for the benefit of the public-legal institution Société du Grand Paris." </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is numbered: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per annum." </seg>

<seg id="13"> How much would be that worth? </seg>
<seg id="14"> A puzzle. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This sum is not numbered in the text. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> From the 4 billion one is far away. </seg>
<seg id="17"> It is exported that the tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the capital donation that are annoyed through the state and that Société are achieved you" gravel of Paris little by little for the project," so is to understand from the explanatory explanation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> At the SGP one does not find this system offensive at all. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "Since the moment in which one credits gains (the two taxes, through R.) one can cover the project planning for more than three years and draw it then first from the 4 billion," so is declared. </seg>
<seg id="20"> "This is noted down in the budget and deducted little by little." </seg>
<seg id="21"> The SGP estimates, that in 2013 will be begun, to note down the 4 billion for the budget 2014. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1"> Vindictive hacker and busy spies </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Affaire WikiLeaks has a twofold importance. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On a page it turned itself out as an obvious scandal, a scandal that only a scandal is hypocrisy that governs the Beziehunge between the states, the citizens and the press in the Sinner one. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the Other Hand it announces far-reaching changes on international level, and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But let's go ahead in turn. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file constructed by a secret service (a x-beliebigen nation) consists of press clippings exclusively. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "exceptional," American disclosures about the sexual habits Berlusconis do not pass on anything from when that, what to read one over months in any case in every x-beliebigen journal got (except for those that owner Berlusconi is), and that frightening karikaturierte profile Gaddafis offered cabaret artists already since long time material for their sketches. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule according to which the secret dossiers may consist only of already known news is not essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and that before in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go into a library which dedicates itself to esotherischen publications, you will recognize that every work (about Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) repeats exactly what already in previous works was written. </seg>
<seg id="10"> That does not come only of the author of occult texts not wanting to publish any investigations (nor of his not knowing where news about the non-existing-end was to be found) but because those ones that dedicate themselves to the occultism at nothing different than what they already know and what confirms that they already learned believe. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In the same way the secret files'. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informant is lazy, and also the head of the secret service is lazy (or restricted spirit) (otherwise he could be something ever, for example editor at Libération), that takes only as true, which he acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Top-Secret information about Berlusconi that had sent the American message to the state department in Rome the same ones were as those ones, that Newsweek had published already the week before. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Why therefore was done such a cancelling's around the disclosures of these dossiers? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On a page these say what every educated person already knows, and indeed that the messages - at least since end of the Second World War and since then also the heads of the government can call themselves mutually or can take an airplane in order to meet for the supper - to have lost their diplomatic function and, except for some small representation tasks, to have changed into espionage centers. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Every arbitrary spectator of investigation films knows this very exactly, and it does not happen from hypocrisy, that one does so, to ignore this. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Nevertheless: the fact to repeat it in public hurts the task of the hypocrisy and is used for putting the American diplomacy in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> At second place: The idea that a x-beliebiger hacker can tap the most secret secrets of the most powerful country of the world contains the considerable stroke against the prestige of the state department. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Furthermore the scandal brings the victims less, as rather the "sharp judges" in distress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But let's dedicate ourselves to the tiefgründigen nature of what happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Formerly, at Orwells times, one could bundle up all power as a Big Brother that controlled every gesture of his subjects. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwells prophecy, where one can control every movement thanks to the telephone, could have turned out since then as completely correct every made transaction, the gone hotel, the chosen motorway and so forth; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of the power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> If one keeps oneself what ends today in mind, however, that even the secret crypts of the power of no more the control of a hacker can escape, so the control walk stops, to be unidirectional and becomes circle-shaped. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power controls every citizen, however every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as an avenger of the citizen -, can find out the secrets of the power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> How can a power which is not to keep their own secrets anymore in the situation hold itself, however? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is right, Georg Simmel said already that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true, that any knowledge about the character Berlusconis or Merkels basically is a secret freely from Geheimis, since it gives away the public sphere; disclosing, however, in the style of WikiLeaks that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to rob her of any power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> WikiLeaks did not do either Sarkozy or Merkel Unrecht, on the other hand, however, Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What will the consequences of this offense be that a so tremendous power was added to? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the states in future will not set any information reserved to more online - that would amount to a bulletin stuck up at the street corner. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is just as obvious, to hope for being able to keep confidential reports about telephone a secret that it is with the current technologies in vain. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is simpler than to find the way out, and when a head of state moves himself in an airplane and contacted one of his colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could relationships private and certain only for certain ears be maintained in future? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know very presumably that my forecast at the moment according to Science Fiction and novelistically rings, but I see myself forced to introducing the government agents to me in secret way busily on uncontrollable routes moving, their communications nowhere differently wearing than in the bare memory with themselves, and in addition the few written information that they got hiding in the heel. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information would be stored in single copy in shut drawers: basically the espionage attempt of Watergate had to record less success, as WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the occasion to write that the technology strides nowadays as a cancer backwards indeed. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A century after the radio-controlled telegraph had revolutionized the communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The (analogous) video-cassettes had made for the film researchers possible, to spy out a film band for band when one could wind from behind forward and ventilate all secrets of the Mondays, during the (numeric) CDs nowadays nothing else facilitate, than to jump from chapter to chapter, therefore in macroportions. </seg>
<seg id="39"> With the high-speed trains one brings from Rome within three hours Milan, while this is requiring three and a half hours by airplane including the change. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It is not therefore extraordinary that politics and communications system come back to car and horse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> A last observation. </seg>
<seg id="42"> In Former Times the press attempted to understand which secrets were forged between the messages. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The messages that require confidential information of the press are it current. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Climate: how France talks his finance promises beautifully </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A year according to the Copenhagen contract is it time, the compliance of the quickly solved financing promises (also "Almost start or mentioned too early financings) " examine, that were realized by the developing countries. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And already the coarse French beautiful chatter is uncovered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With the Copenhagen contract the developing countries committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars in between 2010 and 2012. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The EU promised 7,2 billion euros over three years, France 1,26 billion euros (that is 420 million per annum). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On the occasion of the opening of the COP16 the EU drew all registers in order to convince their partners of the fact of their engagement concerning the fasting-start-financings: detail-true procedure report of their member states, press conference, great secondary events, brochure distribution. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The operation transparency is estimated remarkably and currently for their actual value: the developing countries and the civil society would see gladly if all developed countries did the same one on the same precision level. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The EU announces to have released 2,2 billion euros in the year of 2010, which gets her onto the correct way to the Respektbezollung of their engagement from 7,2 billion in the year 2012. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If one, however, looks into the detail, the things are a little bit more complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should be "new and additional" according to the Copenhagen contract in order to guarantee that an additional use was brought in without gereichen to the detriment of the Public Development Aid. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately there is not any consensus over what "again and besides" means. </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the EU commission had been suggesting a harmonization, certain member states have, under that France, the procedure jams. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today everyone chooses the standard value which he takes as best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The EU commission has itself for example as a standard value for that one of the year 2009 chosen: keep to becoming the international financings, and contributes within the framework of the financing "Fasting-start" above for three years 150 million. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries chose similar standard values either with regard to year or concerning conditions on level of the public development aid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In the corresponding train for this purpose France thought the financings of "all new projects" of the year 2010 are "new and additional." </seg>
<seg id="17"> Differently squeezed out: There are not any standard values with the editions of the preceded year or on global level of the public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Actually said the total amount of the French support of the developing countries can remain stable (or also to lose weight) - France pretends to keep to his obligation with regard to the "new and additional" financings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> An other, decisive element is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Yet no rule dominates that, and everyone chooses his rake mode. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Unites, as for example France, 1 lent € as equivalent with 1 donated € are. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Obviously this is only hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (projects often tied to the emission embankment that are based on most effective technology) can be justified, it is treacherous to present the euro that one vereinnahmt as an equivalent for a donated euro... Furthermore only the costs of the loan should be charged as engagement for the investor country (that is the equivalent of an interest rate). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France does not have anything differently in the sense as the following consideration: his obligation "respects" it of 420 million euros, when it incorporates 91,5% of loan (389,8 million euros) and he donates 8,5%) 36,1 million euros) - see also the EU document, in order to convince oneself even of that. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only one land the EU that loan starts in great measure. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany demands 46%, during Denmark, that Netherlands or to follow Slovakia (among other things) to their obligations to 100% with donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Differently said if the predominant majority of the European Union 1€ for the fulfillment of their obligations distributes France just gives 10 cents once and means by that a comparable use. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Beautiful hocus-pocus! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> All in all France operates in his fasting-start-financing with a double giddiness: to a part with a Weiterentwicklkung of the action about the time and to the other part with the reality of the financial use. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France succeeds in making believe that it has distributed 420 million "new and additional" millions in agreement with his promises and saves in this case 36,1 million euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the Exchequer could involve (since it presumably seems that it was Bercy that carried out the arbitrage) a twice negative effect; once EU internal (why the other member states leave with the donating if nevertheless it suffices to lend?) and then in the negotiations not completely deceive the developing countries there make... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter of the too early financings only a small question onto relatively short time in comparison with the entirety at discussions about the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Let's hope for this not being the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As is to that ever, it is indispensable to learn his lesson of financings anticipated from this first year. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In the First Place France could announce a change in his posting kind for the years 2011 and 2012, and in the spirit indeed the respect's for his obligations and the balancing justice's with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Particularly, however, France could bring the discussions forward about the quarrel object of the long-term financings (an other, decisive and currently discussed topic): one does not escape the question of the "Verrechenbarkeit" or the posting kind of his loans. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could change his position in order to be just as advanced with regard to the disputes as it is that near other things. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The hope is based therefore on the new environmental minister Kosciusko-Morizet that will arrive next week in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A surprising announcement about the fasting-start of France and his vision of the "Verrechenbarkeit" as well as the use of loans would raise by nature the international confidence basis which is necessary for weiterführende discussions. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Alarm - pesticides taken by children </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A child of 10 years takes 81 different chemical substances over the day, one like that this Wednesday of the union Générations Futures (former movement to the protection of the rights and the respect rising generations') published study. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The union that declares that their results "faced with the small number at analyzed tests do not display any statistically significant value but to represent illustration character of the handled problems," had between July and September the usually within four, from an approximately ten year old child to the meals food consumed plus a Zwischenmahlzeit in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris bought. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1,5 liters of water per day - were examined just the same as nibblings of laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants were. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The plate balance is shattering: 81 chemical substances, under that 42 than possibly or probably krebserregend classified and five than surely karziogen classified, in the same way as 37 substances with Endokrinin disturbance, according to studies of several institutions as for example the International oncology center. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "Even if in the approximate entirety of the cases the legal limits are not exceeded for every chemical, individually charmed substance, nevertheless one understands from this elevation very well so, that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to materials cancer-moving possibly or substances with Endokrinin disturbance concern is exciting," the union notices. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Contained already during the breakfast only the butter and the tea with milk already more than ten the remains cancer-moving possibly and three surely proven as carcinogenic, in the same way as more than twenty remains that can influence the hormone system. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The apple imported from Brazil, designated as a Zwischenmahlzeit for the study, Spuren points from six chemical substances, under that a fungicide forbidden in France. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The same one is valid for the green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, at which one thing found the study tracks in the EU of severely prohibited insecticide. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Further also the cutlet, the tuna from the can, even the French loaf and the chewing gum of pesticides and other chemical materials were larded. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Near the tap water the analyses brought the presence of nitrates and chloroform onto the light. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> During the supper the salmon steak with 34 determined, chemical remains was at the "most extensive," and even the plastic plate used to the warming up of the meal in the microwave was not unloaded. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The end-final risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer "becomes probably undervalued," so the study. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The "Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts" (EE-LV) suggested for her part "faced with the priority of the situation" to introduce a moratorium about the use from pesticides in order to stop the "increase at ailments of civilization." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> In July a study of the European authority had identified reference to the presence of remains for food security (EFSA) in 365 different, pesticides identified in fruit and vegetable, that are consumed in Europe, under that 76 in Getreiden. </seg>
