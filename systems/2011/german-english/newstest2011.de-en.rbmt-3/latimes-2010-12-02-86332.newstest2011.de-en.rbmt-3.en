Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the planning committee 
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous assent of the local planning committee after a 5-hour, often quick-tempered public hearing. 
Critics accused the project of promoting the terrorism as well as traffic rope. 
However, according to a statement of the commission from Wednesday evening, the new religious centre corresponds to the local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher. 
"The project is supported by many good people - tomorrow from Christians, Jews, Bahais, and to many other," explained Hadi Nael, chairperson of the Islamic centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday. 
"As an American this makes me proud." 
"It points, the justice rules." 
"There are only few opponents," he still added. 
"You are only very much loudly." 
"In this valley wonderful people live." 
The meeting began around 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre lasted almost to midnight and the voices on both sides were distributed according to Press Enterprise quite steadily. 
The debate was continued on the web page of the newspaper. 
"There is no more America," a comment was. 
"It is another planet of the monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty lies deadly in the sand." 
"America is at the end." 
Planned Islamic centres have also led in other parts of the country to protests, e.g., close to Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the city of New York on the 11th of September, 2001. 
In the Temecula Valley imam Mahmoud Harmoush has appealed for nonviolence. 
His municipality with approx. 135 families lives for many years peacefully in the Riverside county. However, they wished bigger and better places, than the camp which they have rented together with a manufacturer for water filter arrangements. 
The new, approx. 2,300 m² mosque in the Mediterranean style should have two minarets and become about 13 m high. 
She should originate on the approx. 17,500 m² property to Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School. 
Opponents can insert at the town council still objection against the project.
