The government wants to prevent the torture of "witches" and published a pamphlet 
The women who are stamped in Burkina Faso to witches show as a rule some common social signs. 
They belong rather to the older generation, they find no work - for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children. 
If one of these women "becomes" the witch, it is strictly isolated, so that she cannot become dangerous for the rest of the village. 
"Men are concerned by this destiny rather seldom." 
"Also have young and healthy women this remains saved, because they help at the work and bear children," a sister describes the situation which looks in the capital of the West-African state Burkina Faso at a special home after more than 100 women who were expelled by her communities. 
Now the local government resolved to go forward against this unusual "social measure." 
And if a pamphlet which should prevent the "witch's pursuit" gave change that's why. 
However, the thing has a hook. 
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "derStandard" pointed out to the dilemma of the written clarification. 
However, of the witchcraft is to be accused also in other African countries quite usual ones. 
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, it was tormented the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahov√° by three women and two men to death - they poured over them with paraffin and simply lighted them. 
About this incident the server reported among other things also BBC. 
However, the culprits stated, the thing would have been only one meeting of unhappy circumstances. 
According to your version the oil which is used to ritual Salbungen would be roused. 
Namely, after the group has tried "to drive out" "a bad mind" from the woman. 
The people support the isolation of "witches" here without taking into consideration her education. 
"The standard" cited moreover a 42-year-old enterpriser from Burkina Faso: "Gluttons of human souls are former like today a danger," he said. 
While the government tries in Burkina Faso at least to defuse the witch-hunt, the gambianische president has been involved last year the president substantially. 
"President Yahya Jammeh kindled after the death of his aunt a monstrous witch-hunt, because these had supposedly portion in their deaths and would try now to kill also the president even by black magic." 
"He shouted to it shaman from close Guinea for help, in company of policemen, soldiers and the body guard of the president at random arrested women and men by force from gambianischen villages kidnapped and brought on the farm of the president in Kanilai," the organisation amnesty stated Internationally in her report. 
On the farm the incarcerated people were made drink an Absud from plants with hallucinogenic effect which caused, however, also intestinal problems and nephritic problems. 
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm. 
Only on account of the international pressure nearly thousand prisoners were released again.
