The army has so many fuses that one could completely wrap Czechia you, however, only two years hold 
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometres of fuses, with blasting compositions are lighted. 
In the year the ministry of defence had delivered before already 224 kilometres of fuse to the army camps. 
It is to be known quite reassuringly that the armed forces have for 225 years ausgesorgt. 
The problem is only the durability of the fuses - two, at most, however, four years. 
The army bought the fuses from the corporation STV Group, a. see. for silly 40 million crowns. 
In his grounds for the purchase of this immense amount of fuse answered the general staff MF DNES, the soldiers would use yearly to 60 kilometres of fuse. 
To the searches of Armeepyrotechnikern according to, the MF DNES responded to it, it arises from this information that the whole army would have to finish annually an extremely intensive pyrotechnische education - all generals and officers of the army command, up to the secretaries and cleaning ladies. 
Defence minister Alexandr Vondra and army general Vlastimil Picek not excluded. 
Only so the substantial annual consumption of sixty kilometres of fuses can be justified more or less. 
This length corresponds, by the way, 25,000 detonations. 
But also so these army supplies would reach for more than ten years. 
If, however, still the old rule from experts is valid that to the training of every new regular soldier two metres of fuse are completely sufficient, then the army by this new shopping - also under the point of view of the risen need of the pioneer's unities and special unities - has created a reassuring stock for already mentioned 225 years. 
Besides, soldiers of the quick application brigade recently complained with the defence minister Vondra, they would have almost no cartridges for hand-held weapons more, so that shooting exercises of the missing means are limited because of strongly. 
To be quiet completely from the underpants lack. 
"To me also does not come, why they buy such vast amounts fuses from us." 
But at last this is her decision, they will already know to what they need them." 
"For us the army is a good customer whom we would like to meet as a trader as much as possible," says the distribution manager Jan STV Group Děck ý. 
Jan Pej š ek, the speaker of the ministry of defence founds the purchase hundred kilometre of fuse with it, the army would have stocked up so at least for ten years with this "ammunition." 
Nevertheless, Jan Děck ý from the STV Group speaks only of a four-year-old use duration of the fuses and police and Armeepyrotechniker even only from two years. 
"With perfect storage are fine also four mentioned years possibly," one of them puts away who wants to remain, however, uncalled not to be accused as a soldier of the criticism of the army. 
At the end of the use duration any ammunition must be tested thoroughly whether it is still reliable and not the life of the soldiers threatened. 
However, these tests are not free of charge, but cost other money. 
Another argument of the ministry of defence is the amount discount for 445 kilometres of fuse. 
"You cost sixty percent less to us than the last year's delivery of 244 kilometres," informs us speaker Pej š ek the position of the buyers of the ministry of defence. 
Only for comparison: The annual consumption of fuses of Pyrotechnikern of the police which liquidate ammunition from the second world war or the Soviet brother's army exceeds already during some years hardly 1,500 metres. 
And the police orders always only such amounts of this ammunition which it can still use before the use duration. 
Already of the security of the Pyrotechniker because of, moreover, one keeps open to himself thus the possibility for adaptable purchases more modern and therefore also of reliable fuses. 
The ministry of defence has already gigantic problems by the liquidation 10 thousand mark note tonnes of ammunition from times of the Warsaw contract when zweihunderttausendköpfige Tschechoslowakische national army prepared for her campaign to the Rhine. 
According to the Pyrotechnikern, the MF DNES responded, the same problem expects the Czech armed forces in a few years by the liquidation hundred kilometre of old fuses which she has bought today so "favourably."
