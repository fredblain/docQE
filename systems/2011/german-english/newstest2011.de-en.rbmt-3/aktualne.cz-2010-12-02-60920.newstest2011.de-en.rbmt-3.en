A tenant of Bakala: Though he heats in the stove - nevertheless, pays higher rent 
An older stocky man leaves just the client's centre of the society RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the biggest private owner of flats in Czechia. 
Under the arm a briefcase with three new hire contracts to three flats: for the own and the flats of his daughters and his son who serves just a prison sentence. 
To all three just the rent was raised within the scope of the so-called "deregulation." 
Instead of from 3500 crowns of month rent the son should fork out 4100 crowns next year for a 2-room flat with kitchen of the second category. 
"And there is not in the flat sometimes fluently warm water and must heat one in an easy coal stove," he taps angry with the finger on the new hire contract of the son for whose signing he has an authority. 
"But what - I have signed" he explains half annoyed and half resigns. 
The civil union BytyOKD.cz which called the new rent terms as "incorrectly and immorally" advises the tenants not to sign the new contracts simply and to wait up to the 7th of December in which she thinks to publish instructions as one goes forward against such contracts. 
But the man only declines. 
"One says this, the other this," makes he a dark face. 
The region of Ostrava becomes thus the big "deregulation lab." 
After New Year this deregulation approaches most flats in Czechia whose tenants pay up to now no rent in line with market requirements. 
Aktuáln ě. hence, cz decided to visit this "lab" personally. 
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is crammed full one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday. 
Immediately beside the door there stand the bodyguards of a security agency and with her a call device. 
"Rent 2011," so there shines a special field Tast on the touchscreen. 
Briefly tapped and already the device spits out a number slip of paper. 
Hardly we have deciphered the number "157" and already it cheeps on the big display in the cover of the waiting room. 
Half a second later one is in the row. 
A little later an older married couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but apparently the rush in the waiting room is not valid at all for the new rent. 
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance problems and the similar. 
From the middle of November flutter in the region of Ostrava the envelope with the new hire contracts to most tenants of a total of 44,000 flats of the port folio of the RPG in the mailboxes. 
A rent rise of approx. 15 to 38 percent suggests the RPG Byty to them in the writings. 
The special counter for the new rents in the client's centre is opened since the 18th of November. 
"The action runs something more than one week, that is this is only the beginning," answer the ladies behind the counter after one moment hesitation when the "client" turns out journalist. 
The deregulation and Bakalas former miner's flats are an explosive subject. 
Before the elections the parliament vice president Lubomír Zaorálek coming from Ostrava of the ČSSD had taken up this subject quite at the top of the voice, no miracle that today the newspapers are fully of it. 
"Twenty years I want from them a new floor." 
"Not sometimes besch. They could exchange WC glasses," the at the beginning mentioned man air comes along. 
Till present stand in a queue according to the employees before all pensioner in the counter to convince itself whether they receive the promised tenant's moderation really which promises to them RPG if they sign the special offer on time. 
The other tenants who sign the new hire contract up to the 15th of December should also come to the pleasure of a February rent reduced half of it. 
Till present, however, "deregulation counter" in Havířov is all other, than overloaded from inquiries. 
"From yesterday's 360 clients from only about 40 to 50 of the rent were in 2011 because of here," estimate the counter officers. 
Besides, RPG offers on her web pages, as well as chalkboards individual rent arrangements where it seems necessary. 
Should the rent parties not agree, however, on the new rent, it is fixed by an independent court. 
"This should be no threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and absolutely legitimate legal approach," explains RPG on his web pages. 
"Here nobody goes in court," believes one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street before the client's centre agrees with her at least partially. 
"I have 13,000 (crowns) of pension, of it 5,000 are left to me for food where I should get the money for a court quarrel," he believes. 
Then, nevertheless, the employee becomes unsafe. 
"Time see." 
"Mr. Zaorálek says them about the media, they should not sign and thus the people still wait," she points out. 
The adjusted rent ends in the biggest part of Czechia at New Year in 2011 and according to RPG Byty the rent rise is an economic need. 
"The existing height of the rents is not sufficient sometimes to the maintenance of the residential fund," Pavel Klime š argues, the manager of the flat sport folio of the society RPG Byty and - just the disregard criticised by the angry tenants of the flat fund is according to opinion of the house-owners the principal reason for the rent rise. 
While RPG could invest four milliards in the flats during the years between 2005 and 2010 from the taken rents, during four years from 2011 to 2014 these should be 5.2 milliards. 
On the large-size LCD display in the cover compared with the upholstered chairs in the waiting room of Havířov some red shining information appears occasionally over and over again. 
"The rent rises in 2011 about 15% and less concern 31 200 flats, that is more than 90% of the flats by RPG." 
"Always means these at most 7.50 CZK per square metre and month," is to be read on the LCD monitor. 
Only with 400 flats from the port folio of RPG the rent increases by 38 percent. 
"In these cases it is about the rise of extremely low rent prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG. 
With 2600 flats the rent remains next year on the same height. 
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation forces up the rents not by leaps and bounds, but gradually occurs within four and eight years. 
What imposes more - the enterprise on itself an other obligation: The enterprise wants to put all income from the rent rise (see diagramme) again in the flats, above all in warm savings - in new windows and in the heat insulation. 
But - with priority these should be of benefit for those people who sign the arrangements about the rent rise.
