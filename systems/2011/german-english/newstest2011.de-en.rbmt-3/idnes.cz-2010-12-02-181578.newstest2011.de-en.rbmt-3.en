An osseous house still fascinates after 100 years. Look the Interieure of fun 
The roof seems like the back of a prehistoric saurian, the stair like the backbone of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn open fish mouths. 
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio fun in Barcelona. 
From the local inhabitants the house by his organic forms got the nickname "osseous house." 
Organic forms, wild colours, the unusual use of stone, tile splinters and Mosaiks, the facades reminding in scales and omnipresent soft lines, all this are typical signs for the Jugendstil of Antonio Gaudi. 
The facade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, affectionate colours and textures which remind of nature and living being. 
Only on looking more carefully one notes that everything is controlled by geometry, rhythm and thought-out order. 
At night the whole facade still looks even more sculptural, more dramatic and the special Anleuchtung increasingly the shine of the colours. 
The same lively lines and winding forms also control the inside of the house. 
Wave-like formed wood copies the window frames, railings, ornamental elements of doors, even peepholes and strips. 
The house Batlló in the quarter Eixample in the animated shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 originated from the rebuilding of a house from 1877 which explained architects Emilio Sala Cortese. 
The reconstruction took up two years and was concluded in 1906. 
The investor, the well-to-do industrial Josep Batlló, existed originally on the demolition of the old one and the construction of an absolutely new building, but at last he agreed to the idea Gaudís on an unusual and also cheaper rebuilding. 
The block of flats Casa Batlló sketched Antoni Gaudí, nevertheless, not only. 
Besides, he worked together with architect Josep Maria Jujol. 
Just on his drawing board the decorations originated for the representative flat of the reality owner and also the use of mosaics in the facade was his idea. 
Nevertheless, in the creation of the facade co-operated also numerous other Bildner and artists. 
The common work on the draughts for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fertile cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí. 
Thus house Casa Milá took part Jujol also in the construction of Gaudís in the park Güell in which also other works of Antoni Gaudí are. 
Already shortly after his completion the house of the local inhabitants of his organic forms agreed because of the nickname "osseous house." 
Other called it again of the special aperture mechanism because of the "yawning house." 
One also says, completely on top on the building is the sword of holy Georg, shown the patron of Catalonia. 
But also other bildhauerische elements symbolise concealed religious motives. 
Gaudí sketched a central heating system unique for the past with ventilation canals and typical chimneys for the house. 
A little bit weirdly her 45-degree inclination already seems. 
With his creating ignored Gaudí strictly all construction specifications at that time and can be disconcerted by no means by these. 
Though before start of construction work he caught up from the town the suitable planning permission, however, the information provided by him about the planned reconstruction were so vague that the town fathers were shocked by the result two years later with the completion so that they required remedy. 
Among the rest, the councillors also knocked themselves against the fact that the construction with his pillars intervened even in the public sidewalk. 
However, for changes it did not come any more, on the contrary - only fifteen days after the relevant request of the town quarter Josep Batlló made an application to the approval of the renting of both höchstgelegenen floors of the house - and it was promptly given to him. 
The house-owner himself entered in the lower floors. 
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a society drawing room, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the flat. 
The ground floor was leased to a jeweller. 
The whole 6-storied building goes through a stair to up to the roof terrace. 
All right corners and straight lines were removed by the basic elements of the rebuilding and were substituted with crooked and curved walls. 
However, Gaudí also worked with a modern draught to the mutual connection of rooms. 
The social part joins by opening the drawing room doors completely and thus a bigger society could chat comfortably without having to renounce in more confidential talks a certain intimacy. 
The house received by Gaudís rebuilding except a new facade also a rather unusual roof and two other floors. 
Impressive it is also Gaudís play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the inner courtyard is dressed up and the patios. 
The play of these both colours lends a maximum to light to all floors of the house. 
Besides, he simply made to himself the principle benefit that white reflects the light better, than dark colours which absorb the sunlight on the contrary in addition. 
Today the house Casa Batlló which was taken up in 2005 in the world heritage list of the Unesco can visit each. 
On the first floor the most spacious and most splendid flat of the public is made accessible. 
The house-owners decided only in the year on this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator. 
When one found out that this is a surely profitable business, one maintained the inspections, one expanded them also on other common ones and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace. 
However, the price to the inspection of the historic architectural monument is no cardboard handle, he amounts to 16.50 euros, to students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist identity cards got 20 percent of reduction. 
This amount excels the entry prices for other Gaudí constructions in the town. 
Who would like to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with his dragon's turrets, should try to close friendship with one of the house inhabitants and visit him at home.
