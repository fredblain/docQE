An electoral setback 
Nobody had expected that the elections would be perfect on the 28th of November in Haiti. 
But the facts excelled the fears of the electoral assistants who hurried to the sieved country for the help, by far. 
Congested electoral urns, several times given votes, polling cards in the gutter, destroyed polling places and intimidations were only one part of the problems. 
Polling places opened with delay of several hours. 
Many Haitians from whom many had become homeless by the earthquake in January wandered around in search of an option. 
Some surrendered, finally, completely. 
One dozen presidential candidates, under it some supposed front runners, required on account of a supposed deception the abolition of the election results. 
In the whole country it came to partly forcible protests. 
Edmond Mulet, the leader of the UN mission still called in Haiti, the choice "rather good in many interests." 
According to a careful statement of observers of the organisation of American States and the Caribbean Community "make these irregularities, so seriously they may also be, the process not necessarily invalid." 
In anderen Worte geht die Show weiter. 
The electoral authority which is obliged supposedly to the unpopular parting president René Préval and his candidate, Jew Célestin, will announce the temporary results on the 7th of December. 
The expected ballot is fixed for January. 
There is still hope in the choice. 
Both leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former ridge lady Mirlande Manigat, have pulled back her initial invalidity complaint. 
If the Jew Célestin who meets with the voters with only low or no approval from which Wahlberhörde explains to the winner of the ballot could lead this to problems. 
On account of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents a low election turnout was feared. 
Many Haitians were hindered in the election day by lacking organisation in the casting of votes. 
Shortly before electoral beginning approx. 250,000 identity cards which are needed for the choice were not not yet distributed yet. 
It gets up a lot. 
The donor countries look at a legitimate, approved government as an important step by the reconstruction of Haiti. 
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
