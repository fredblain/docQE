The nursing home for the elderly confirms that the deaths are not to be led back on "missing measures" 
The owners of the old people's home in Olot do not exclude that her orderly killed more than eleven older people 
Yesterday the people responsible of the nursing home for the elderly La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference in which they put outside which harm the criminal actions Joan Vila Dilmés - the orderlies who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible during his work - had done to the equipment. 
The leader of the nursing home for the elderly, Joan Sala, appeared in company of his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced, "La Caritat would like to accuse the person responsible (for the deaths) ," but "the right and our liability duty make to us the process and the civil law liability" accept. 
The equipment must accept not only a social respect loss because she had ascertained the criminal actions of the orderly not on time, but now also pay a high amount of damages which is calculated by the legal representatives of the members of the family of the victims. 
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime decreases to August, 2009 and that he has further murdered since then. 
The judge arranged the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home for the elderly - because he supposed that no doctor has examined the deads personally, but the formalities were unwound on account of their age and illnesses by telephone. 
The leader of La Caritat denied this point flatly and explained that "being missing measures keinerzeit the reason could have been for the incidents." 
The lawyer of La Caritat added that there would be no clues for careless actions of another person than the culprit "in the lawsuit." 
Already as "a death angel" baptised eleven murders confessed the day before yesterday and explained which commits the first crimes 29th of August, 2009 and one and a half months later the second old lady to have murdered. 
In this case he killed with an overdose insulin, as opposed to the first crime with which he had given a mixture of different tranquilizers. 
The leader of La Caritat explained, the access of the staff to the drugs is only difficult to control. 
The orderly used the insulin injections and the tranquilizer cocktail with six of nine committed crimes to release the patients with the death of her suffering. 
But the results of the lab investigations will put outside whether Vila lies and chose for his first victims really a less cruel death or whether he burnt out this from the inside, while he gave them pale lye as he had done it according to confession with three women whom he murdered between the 12th and 17th of October. 
In La Caritat one gives to the statements of the orderly no faith, not even what concerns the number of the confessed murders which could be absolutely more. This setting is justified with the fact that Vila had made very different declarations in court and that it makes no sense to change his approach after eight successful murders suddenly. 
They say, they made available them to themselves for this reason and to the clarification of the reach of these incidents of the justice.
