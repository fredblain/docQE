Can politeness connect the separating? 
After a campaign in terms of abuse and Negativität this week has broken out little politeness in Washington. 
Is it the omen of a real bipartisan cooperation or one moment of the illusion, before one returns fast again to the fight of the parties in the capital? 
The meeting on Tuesday between president Obama and points of the congress brought no breakthrough in the big questions with which one to yourself during so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government period in which no more decisions are made, had to occupy. 
After all what one hears it was to be governed neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor an attention of her divided responsibilit, but rather an empty episode of a parteilichen point collecting. 
The public meeting of the deficit commission of the president on Wednesday was also civilised, in spite of the political differences which exist between the members furthermore. 
It seems to be clear that a narrow interaction for a period of months lets arise a mutual respect which separates the ideological gap, furthermore the members of each other, veils. 
This hardly is enough to state, it has broken a new era of the cooperation. 
Now both sides are in a test phase - in which one calls in the other sign of the willingness to co-operate and compromise readiness, while one himself tries to weigh the borders of the public opinion and the patience of the voters after a renewed party leading of the war. 
Hence, were limited the meeting on Tuesday and his appraisal by the participants on a minimum of demands or accusations. 
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep, as that one could expect a quick change of the atmosphere which ruled during the past two years. 
No matter whether it is about taxes, donations, health or claims, both sides are kilometre-far removed of each other. 
Finally the November choice has mildly tuned Washington at least for a short time. 
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush's government who works now for the "Ethics and public Policy centre." 
"This is unavoidable after elections. 
Elections wake parteiliche passions which die again. 
And this feels well in such a way." 
In some questions, particularly in those, on the agenda "lame duck session" stand, Republicans and democrats have no other choice, than to find a solution." 
Bush's tax lowerings end at the end of the year, and nobody recommends this. 
Both sides want to find a way, around some or even everybody receives to, now it is passing or lasting. 
Also a compromise is to be expected with regard to the raised unemployment benefits, even if only because the Republicans it cannot afford that one believes, the favoured tax lowerings for the empires, while they refuse a support to jobless workers. 
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House the optimism has risen that one itself in these questions during "lame duck session" to some and at the same time also the new START contract can ratify. 
However, William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent questions lame duck session" not compelling to a lasting cooperation of the parties must lead if the new 112th congress calls up in January. 
Instead, so he says, a phase of the Nichtübereinstimmens is more likely, is maybe even unavoidable. 
"After the things which must be done are done, this short-term psychology will overturn in confrontation," he said. 
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is divided by many - which leads politeness to true cooperation. 
"I see a lot what happens from today till 2012, as a prefight, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said. 
The reasons for this deal a lot with the presentation of the new republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who were useful their education. 
How anxiously the republican leaders may also be about the fact that they play poker too high, they know that they must try, her promises to lower the issues of the government and to cancel the health reform to keep. 
These party lines become already clear in the first reactions with regard to the recommendations of the deficit commission which contain a tax revision and beginning some taxes as well as the increase of the retirement age and the depressions of the state expenses. 
The acting chairpersons Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have pressed, according to her own appraisal, so much to bet the deficit question on the public agenda that these cannot be ignored any more. 
But they need within the commission 14 18 voices to make her plan the official recommendation and they fight very much to come even to the nearness of this number. 
The biggest opposition is found in the elective representatives of the committee, because in finance questions, at least today, only little elbowroom or little sympathy is for compromises. 
Galston forecasts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in the congress. 
The first fight will take place the next year in the form of party collisions if the Republicans Obama challenge concerning the budget, the taxes and the health system, later then followed from a phase of bigger zweiparteilicher cooperation. 
What will lead to this change? 
The public opinion. 
One proves that, in spite of the partiality of the topical choice, the majority of the Americans still wishes that both parties work together. 
If confrontation leads in a dead end how it has happened in 1995, then both parties must pay attention carefully to the public reaction. 
Whoever is condemned to the losing, will change the course and must search the compromise. 
Indeed, this may be an optimistic perception. 
Today partiality and polarisation are bigger than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem to be a bigger ideological gap between Obama and the congressional Republicans than at that time between president Bill Clinton and the Republicans. 
At the same time the activists of both parties see in 2010 as a pure prelude for a choice by far more far-reaching in consequence in 2012. 
Thus seen the politeness which is carried this week to the show may be welcomed by many Americans. 
However, it will require much more trouble on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions which separate the both still of each other.
