Obama stops new oil drillings 
Before the coast of the US federal state Florida in the gulf of Mexico there will be during the coming years no new oil drillings. 
A suitable ban has remitted the government in Washington - and with it has revoked her former plans finally. 
Also before the Atlantic coast new drillings remain for the time being prohibited. 
Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar informed of this on Wednesday. 
Trigger for the strict ban which should be valid at least for the coming five years is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April. 
Before the misfortune which cost to eleven workers the life and led to the biggest environmental disaster of the USA president Barack Obama had signalled his readiness under pressure the opposition and the industry to admit new drillings in the eastern part of the gulf of Mexico. 
The advocates want to reduce with it the dependence of the USA on oil deliveries from abroad. 
Who bears the responsibility for the disastrous oil plague in the gulf, is not cleared till this day finally. 
In the centre of the criticism stands the British energy group BP which is confronted with milliard demands. 
A board of inquiry by order Obamas should present her results in the course of December. 
In October Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the drilling stop covered after the explosion. 
In the connection different oil groups had made straight away applications for new drilling plans. 
With more sharp controls and stricter safety regulations Obama and Salazar want to exclude a recent disaster. 
Currently is basically reformed the responsible controlling authority which had got after numerous corruption reproaches in discredit. 
In parallel in addition Obama has announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil groups and gas groups. 
Now the industry warns publicly about the fact that the output was clearly low than in the gulf by a stricter regulation up to now. 
"The plans of the government are the biggest brake for the growth of the oil industry and gas industry," the result of a topical branch survey is by the firm of consultants BDO - still before the drilling ban of Wednesday. 
Besides, the insecurity deplores the American Energy Alliance in the branch: "Nobody knows what will exactly change with the regulation." 
Investments in new conveyor projects would be pushed open up to next - zulasten of the growth.
