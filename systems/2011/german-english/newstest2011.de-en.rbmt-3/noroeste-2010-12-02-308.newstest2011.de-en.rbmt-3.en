The NASA announces the finding of extraterrestrial life 
The North American space agency called up a press conference, around a finding tomorrow preblocks which will have effects on the search for living being in all. 
Tomorrow the national aerial authority and space agency (NASA) of the United States announces, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery which could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life. 
Tomorrow the finding is introduced at 13.00 o'clock in a press conference in the seat of the NASA in Washington by experts of the astrobiology. Besides, it concerns a science which examines the origin, the development, the distribution and the future of life in the universe. 
By conscription of the press conference assured the NASA, she will introduce "a supervision-exciting finding for the search for extraterrestrial life" what released speculations with experts of other countries. 
The discovery could prove the theory that it can exist in the hostile surroundings which one held up to now for unbwohnbar manlike creatures. The hypothesis was thrown up that these could change into intelligent living beings - as well as people - if her living conditions improved. 
Apparently it concerns a microbe which was found on the basis of the Mono brine in the Yosemite-national park, California. She lives there in surroundings which were held for too toxic for all conceivable life forms, because the lake is very arsenic-containing. 
Somehow the arsenic uses the Mikrobie as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability increase the chances that there could be similar life on other planet which do not dispose of our protecting atmosphere. 
If these organisms the arsenic verstoffwechseln, is proved according to the astrobiologists that "there is actual another life form, the second life form which differs from to us of the known ones." 
Tomorrow the space agency announces, on Thursday, in the press conference the actual reach of her finding. 
In the conference take part the geobiologist Pamela Conrad who examines the possibility of life on Mars, and which studies biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, the titanium (the biggest moon of Saturn) under the question whether his chemical composition resembles that of the earth.
