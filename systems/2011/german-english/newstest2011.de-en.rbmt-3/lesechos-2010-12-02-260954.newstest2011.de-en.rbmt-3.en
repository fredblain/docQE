The second mandate: the Offenkundigkeit 
De Gaulle had really stopped short. 
Centre edge left that he stops short. 
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation. 
And Nicolas Sarkozy still less than this. 
A mandate in the Elysée calls over the next. 
The topical head of state will be therefore a candidate in 2012. 
But the Offenkundigkeit stands to the side of the mystery which sticks to the presidency function, not well to face. 
So one must act in such a way, as if the doubt existed from now on. 
In one, as well as in the other sense. 
In 2006 the followers of Jacques Chirac gave, the third mandate would not be excluded without believing even in it. 
On the 15th of November Nicolas Sarkozy assured in serious tone to make his decision "sometime in autumn of 2011." 
The fact that he would allow to be reminiscent on the Tuesday evening in the Elysée before the UMP parliamentarians the perspective of "two mandates," therefore, had spread a little Fieberhaftigkeit. 
Was this the official announcement of his candidature? 
Far from it. 
The president let merely at the fact remind that the constitutional amendment of 2008 limits the number of the five-year-old terms of office to only two. 
He made a statement, no announcement. 
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidency choice on the occasion of such meetings in an amusing tone. 
"You have if 7,5 more years with me, or at best," he explained to them in July, 2009. 
On a new in May, 2010: "Does not think that I do not think about the phase afterwards." 
His words from the day before yesterday do not make him any more the candidate than the day before; but also no less. 
Should they cause comments, then for double reason. 
The acceleration of the race around the candidature with the HP on a side. 
However, it is not the admission of the competition with Ségolène royal which Nicolas Sarkozy does to reveal himself. 
On the contrary, it is his evident candidature in 2012 which many members of the HP admonish more early than accepted to the fight announcement. 
The bad surveys on the other side. 
For the first time the voters of the rights would become a candidature of François Fillon from Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to survey of the BVA-L'Express) prefer. 
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions about that with the UMP," reacted immediately and carefully the sphere of the prime minister. 
"If he found a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," informs Jean-Pierre Raffarin. 
"He will always believe to be able to win," Alain Juppé who has resigned himself to the Offenkundigkeit corrects.
