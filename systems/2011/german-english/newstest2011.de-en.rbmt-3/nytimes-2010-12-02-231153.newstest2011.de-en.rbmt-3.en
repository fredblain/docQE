Public prosecutor will not accuse senator Ensign 
Public prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have acquitted senator John Ensign of the accusations which were raised after his Affaire with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to get a lobby activity her husband against him, announced the lawyers of the senator on Wednesday. 
This decision finishes the heaviest legal reproach against senator Ensign, to the Republican from Nevada. Up to the scandal which nationally provided for headlines and moved to his career a damper he was valid as a possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012. 
As senator Ensign office announced, he was high pleased with the judgment according to the one-year-old investigation "." 
Nevertheless, the ethical committee of the senate could cover one more Disziplarstrafe. 
After statement of Ensigns to lawyers they were informed by the Ministry of Justice about the fact that the investigations were put against senator Ensign and that in this matter no other accusations are given. 
The Ministry of Justice did not want to express itself to the case. 
The judgment was for many ethical lawyers beyond the Ministry of Justice a surprise. In her opinion there were enough proofs of the fact that Ensign has ignored the lobbying ban. 
Interviews, e-mails and other documents which were disclosed for the first time in October, 2009 in the New York Times gave occasion for the supposition that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, to lucrative orders helped to buy his silence about an Affaire with Hamptons wife Cynthia. 
Cynthia Hampton was active during an electoral campaign Ensigns as a treasurer. 
Ensign got in touch with some political friends to get Hampton work. According to the documents and questionings he took over for them after the setting Hamptons lobby work. 
Because Hampton was an electoral team recently still in Ensigns, it was he might take over during 1 year no lobby work for his former employer or the whole senate. 
According to statement of ethical experts the unusual agreement offended between Ensign and Hampton which were friends before the Affaire closely against the so-called ban of the Drehtür-Lobbykratie. 
According to the published clues "it concerns apparently an arrangement and the offence against the revolving door statutes," according to Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who has specialised in the defence of clients who stand in the visor of the government. 
While the Ministry of Justice refused officially to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, said Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers, the ministry seems very carefully in taking up political accusations after a huge number of defeats which were pursued by the media with big interest, including the decision last year to drop the accusation against the former senator Ted Stevens because of failure on the part of the public prosecutor. 
Public prosecutors "are obviously fright-like," said Melanie Sloan, the chairperson of the union "of Citizen for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organisation whose aim is the fight against corruption in parliament and government circles of the USA), a group of lawyers which has brought different accusations against Mr. Ensign in court. 
"This means basically that government officials of high standing can assume now from the fact that the laws are not valid for them," she added. 
Paul Coggins, main defender of Mr. Ensign, said during an interview, he has received a phone phone call of a public prosecutor on Monday and next the next day in which was informed of him that the ministry will lodge no complaints against his client. 
Of Mr. Ensign defender had co-operated with the public prosecutors to persuade them of the fact that the senator, as his office repeated in an explanation on Wednesday once more, has "according to the law traded." 
Of Mr. Coggin it declined more exactly to explain the juridical arguments which he had brought forward towards the public prosecutors. 
"To me is not about to go to the conversation details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much would be said: We believe to have made the right decision," he said. 
The last month the federal choice commission has decided to put the inquiries because of a separate complaint by the ethical group after which a payment of 96,000$ of Mr. Ensign parents has offended to the Hamptons against the federal choice law. 
The electoral commission said, there have not been enough proofs that the money has been something else than a present. 
NV Energy, a big company in Nevada which supported the senator long time was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign Lobbyisten-Arbeit. 
Eine E-Mail vom Dezember 2008 belegt, dass, sterben nachdem Firma Herr Hampton als Lobbyist weitergebracht Hut, Herr Ensings Stabschef, John Lopez, eine Unterredung mit Herr Hampton hatte, in der er ihm mitteilte, dass er beim Innenministerium wegen einer Sache "anklopfe." 
Krieg von Herrn Ensign außerdem mit Herr Hampton und einem anderen Kunden aus Nevada, Allegiant Luft, zum Mittagessen verabredet und Fledermaus-Bastelraum Verkehrsminister, ein Treffen im Namen der Fluggesellschaft zu vereinbaren, nachdem diese Herr Hampton zwecks Lobbyarbeit eingestellt hatte. 
When the last year for the first time information about this affair penetrated to the public, Mr. Ensign apologises to his voters and gave up his position in the senate where he had stood in the order of rank of the Republicans at the fourth place. 
After he had not struck many months any more, told Mr. Ensign two weeks ago to the reporters at which he aims the third term of office in the senate. 
Not be in the announcement, that Mr. Ensign more investigations longer police the aim, explained his press agent, Jennifer Cooper who hopes senator that the ethical commission follows very fast the example of the Ministry of Justice and puts his inquiries. 
"Senator Ensign is glad to continue his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
