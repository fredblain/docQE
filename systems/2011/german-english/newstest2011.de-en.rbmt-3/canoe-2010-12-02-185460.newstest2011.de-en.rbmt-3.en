The secret immigration could be pursued easily 
The law draught of the conservatives whom according to the government the problem of the ships loaded with secret immigrants should regulate will be pulped in all probability, after three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that they cannot recommend the proposal. 
"I rebel with stress against this charter." 
"I hold with a party which has laid chains to the feet to you," explained Michael Ignatieff, boss of the liberals, at the end of the weekly Caucus meeting before the gathered representative. 
The liberals stated, the law draught which allows to hold on each of one as to the transport of unlawful immigrants identified sea ship the coming person up to during 1 year injures as well as suggested the Canadian legal constitution and freedom constitution. 
Gilles Duceppe, boss of the Bloc Québécois, indicated also not to be able to support the law draught, because he turns against the wrong target group. 
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait what undertakes the government," explained M. Duceppe. 
The criticism concerning the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has dismissed the critics who demand, her party would not behave firmly enough towards the secret immigrants. 
"The neo-democrats agree with the fact that one takes measures against the blind passengers, and just this we try to put through through another law draught, C-35,," Chow stated. 
Hence, we do not recommend the law draught of the conservatives because he searches the guilt with the refugees and holds prisoner children at least during 1 year," explained Chow. 
The immigration minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with the politics and of ignoring the will of the Canadians. 
"The Canadians inform of the representative urgently that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal processes which concern Canada and which treat the country like a foot doormat." 
"You expect that Canada takes hard measures," according to the reaction minister Kenney. 
"The government has announced no vote of confidence with regard to her law draught which could have led the country to elections which would have rejected the government. 
Nevertheless, a conservative has expressed compared with the agency QMI, the government would call up a vote, so that every opposing representative explains himself immediately towards his voters.
