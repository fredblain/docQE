Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens 
The carriages are improved with software on a real-time basis. 
Since Red Bull penetrated in 2004 into the world of the formula 1, her history is marked in this select universe of the speed by surprises and results. 
In the beginning nobody gave to the novice attention and in spite of his precipitously climbing up development during the last seasons everybody placed with the final spurt in the last November on the victory of Ferrari of Fernando Alonso. 
Without wanting to lower the abilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the achievement strength of the engine of Renault, is the "secret weapon" which the multinational Siemens Red Bull laid in the hands, and with it a winner's team created, become to the legend. 
In reality concerns highly competitive software for the simulation of processes which put on the market the German enterprise in 2007 for the purposes which do not deal with car racing. 
This as a PLM called informatics programme was used for the development by assembly chains in factories in the whole world, energy works and highly exact instruments. 
A faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is aimed, before this is really built to avoid thus mistake and superfluous costs. 
PLM has made easier the development of the cameras of Canon, the airplanes of Sukhoi and the most famous utility vehicles of Nissan. 
Siegfried Russwurm, leader of the industrial department of Siemens, explains that with the application of this software in the formula 1 - factory of Red Bull can sketch the changes and improvements which are ascertained on the runnings and with the tests "in few hours, almost on a real-time basis" explain and. 
Soot worm explains that in 1992 in the racing stables on an average ten engineers worked who could introduce at most three or four improvements in a season. 
Today in Red Bulls team 180 highly qualified young people are occupied. With highly competitive EDP arrangements they carry out analyses and all possible changes in the racer. 
The Siemens manager explained, the PLM software is able to analyse all components of the racers of Red Bull and to improve, with the exception of the engine for which explains itself excluding Renault responsibly. 
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the security elements are changed. 
The changes can be transferred thanks to advanced production plants and high-tech autoclaves within less than 24 hours by the virtual reality of the simulator in the reality. 
The only limit which is set to this mad technical perfectionism, are the 40 million dollars which a formula 1 - team may spend on his races in a season. 
Red Bull has built up his high-tech factory for the development and production of his racers in a 50 kilometres of London distant place. 
It concerns two buildings in which visits - are strongly limited particularly by journalists-. 
Everything what happens there is a top Secret. 
The staff encloses 580 people, including two pilots, which world champion Vettel and Mark Webber. 
But Red Bulls of true formula 1 - hero is without doubt the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell. 
Behind the huge technological resources which the Energy drink manufacturer puts in the services of his participation on the racing distances, other protagonists whose support is incalculably and their fame like zero are hidden. 
The Technologichef of the work, Steve Nevey, stresses that one could still say five years ago that the progress contributed in the area F&E for racer with 50 percent to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest. 
Today the portion values have changed. The technology puts out 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent. 
Nevey recognises that Vettel and Webber can be never substituted with EDP, because they "are not predictable gladiators."
