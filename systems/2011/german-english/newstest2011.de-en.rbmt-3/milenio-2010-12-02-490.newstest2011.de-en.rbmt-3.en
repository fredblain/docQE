Obama exerts itself in Twitter for the law in favour of undocumented students 
"If you are for the discharge of the Dream Act - law, call your senators and press for the discharge of this law," twitterte the president of the United States in the popular social net. 
Today the president Barack Obama supported the national mobilisation to the support of the Dream Act - law of the legalisation of undocumented students with news on his personal Blog in the social net Twitter. 
"If you are for the discharge of the Dream Act - law, call your senators and press for the discharge of this law," twitterte Obama. 
His short communication contains a Cyberlink to a more extensive document which asks the public to step unterzüglich with her senators in contact, because the vote of the law approaches immediately. 
"With your voice for which we wait the time has come to listen to you," he stresses. 
The news was spread, after 42 republican senators threatened to block all voice for every law, except the expansion of the tax reductions from the times of Bush and the financing of the government would be expanded. 
Such a blockade which was announced on a letter signed by 42 republican senators could affect the vote of the Dream Act - law and other projects like the ratification of the new start agreement with Russia against the spreading of nuclear weapons. 
About the blockade of the Republicans of the law Dream Act and other projects questioned, said the presidency speaker Robert Gibbs, he trusts in the fact that if once the tax subject is solved a schedule can be put up for the remaining projects. 
"I believe, we still have a lot of time..." 
"Everybody we agree in the fact that the tax matter must be unwound before end of the year..." 
"I think that we can meet about that any time an arrangement and then we can plan the expiry of the rest," he said. 
The chairperson of the democratic majority in the senate, Harry Reid, told on Tuesday in, "he would apply for the vote with end of the debate," so that the Dream Act - the law with which the initiative for the legalisation of undocumented students can be tuned from the next Thursday in the senate although the next week would be more likely. 
The version of the Dream Act - law or the law of the American dream would become about 800,000 young people who immigrated in the United States when they were still sixteen years old none, while to the last five years have lived in this country and into a higher educational institution or with the army are enrolled, legalise. 
But the advocates of the law need for the discharge of the initiative sixty voices, which is why they depend on the voices of a handful of Republicans. At the moment the organisations of the advocates of this project organise an intensive influencing control on the discharge of the law. 
The democrats from whom support the majority the Dream Act order more than 58 seats. 
Indeed, said one of them who would be right senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, he against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, has announced his support of the law. 
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Acts must get several Republicans on her side, if other democrats should decide to turn the back towards the initiative. 
To the mostly sought-after Republicans belong from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the senator George Lemieux from Florida who took over the mandate of the senator Mel Martínez. 
The other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they declared not to support it with another opportunity any more. 
Another Republican who had expressed himself for the law John McCain, has not fixed his position up to now yet. 
Although the House of Representatives has another version, the analysts agree in the fact which stands the Dream Act in the senate before the biggest obstacles.
