Thousands mourn for dead mates 
More than 10,000 people have thought in New Zealand of the buried miners who were explained after several explosions in a mine for dead. 
The corpses could not be still rescued because the security situation is further precarious in the misfortune shaft. 
Just two weeks ago it had come in the pike River mine near the city of Greymouth to a violent explosion. 
29 miners at the age between 17 and 62 years were buried underground. 
A probe had become in the misfortune shaft hinabgelassen, however, no track of survivors had discovered. 
On grounds of the high concentration of toxic gases and the other following explosions no rescue forces could descend for safety reasons.
