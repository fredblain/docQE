Cheshire appeal draws the attention to Twitter 
Half-dozen of them typed themselves in the riots in the courtroom away. 
In the minute tact they sent about Twitter her reports on terrible witness's statements. 
At the end, according to the defence, there were more than 140,000 Twitter announcements about the process around rape and in beds chained children in a house which rose in flames. 
On Thursday becomes the carefully presecuted process of Steven J. Hayes who was accused to have killed three members a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to an official end come if the judgement about the death sentence which has pronounced the jury falls. 
However, of Mr. Haye lawyers applications have already submitted at court which demonstrate reasons for an appeal and which will occupy the courts for years. 
One of the most provoking reasons is that that it has come by the intensive reporting about the process - also by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - to a "circus atmosphere" and an immediate penetration widespread so far of riotous details, so that the jury has been influenced in inadmissible manner by the public indignation. 
This objection could arrange the Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question whether the new technologies make new rules in the courtroom inevitably. 
"As well as I have experienced it during this process, I think that it is really a danger if the move of the new technologies influences the right of every singles on a fair process in the courtroom," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye main defender. 
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the uppermost chamber court, rejected the last week the applications by decision concisely when he said that the new media are controlled "carefully" would become, and that there would be no proof of the fact that the jury has been done by passions. 
However, this was not with certainty yet the last word in this thing. 
Since decades court objections have found out that the reporting about famous-infamous cases lets arise doubt about the fairness of a process. 
In his historical decision of 1966 the Supreme Court of the United States has lifted the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, to an Osteopathen from Cleveland who should have killed his woman and said in his decision that there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media. 
Some one thinks that the TV serial and the feature is based "on the run" on this crime. 
Some lawyers say, court objections which look at Mr. Haye conviction half a century later could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication ways from the courtroom which were still inconceivable at the moment of the case Dr. Sheppard. 
"There is a good reason, about the influence of the new media in processes which are pursued by a wide public, disturbs to be," said John J. Donohue III, professor to Stanford Law School who has examined the capital punishment in Connecticut. According to his report it is covered arbitrarily. 
Professor Donohue said, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of an immediate communication from the courtroom could bring the actions more fairly. 
The Twitter matter is only one of many which the lawyers of Mr. Haye demonstrate to discuss for years and to put off therefore a conviction. 
The defenders also state, for example, that of Mr. Haye could have been already precondemned when judge Blue had not allowed to them to test the reactions of potential jurors, while one showed them during the juror's choice terrible scene photos. 
Some of the jurors have said, they would have fulfilled photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and her TÃ¼chter, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, with loathing. 
The defenders say, they would also question the constitutional moderation of the capital punishment constitution, and argue that the judge has exchanged falsely a juror who has been a critic of the public prosecutor's office, and that he would have exercised inadmissible Wise pressure on the judgment when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury about the week-end. 
The jurors were not isolated. 
However, the biggest interest on itself pulls her arguments about the influence of the detailed reporting about the process maybe. 
In a judgment challenge which they have submitted the last month they found out that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American senate by the candidates. 
They argued that the new media would continuously have anew kindled the flames of the emotions about the case. 
"One has not experienced such a day-to-day Andrang of the media beepers, cameras and reporters beyond the courtroom," wrote the lawyers, "before still in New Haven and maybe even nationally yet." 
Their main focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial. 
During interviews some journalists said that the assertion, this direct news are incendiary as reports which are made more slowly, a technology-hostile look is which becomes impoverished the reporting about future processes. 
However, some lawyers said, Appelationsgerichte would be often confronted with the argument, social and technical changes would need the adaptation by the courts. 
Of Mr. Hayer lawyers strengthen this assertion. 
In her objection they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 in which the conviction was lifted by Dr. Sheppard on account of the reporting and made clear that the new media require new rules. 
"This case," so they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
