From the new members of the state congress it is expected that they make a clean work, feel to the society and the different social groups obliged which depend on a responsible parliament work, and that the same patterns of partiality and Paternalismus do not recur. 
Eduardo Dávalos, chairperson of the enterpriser's coordination advice CCE, suggested, the new representatives should take over the big responsibility, a model for a better Sinaloa which is before many challenges to deliver. 
"We hope that the representatives really use her right to act freely from arrangements between the parties, because it is usual that they meet arrangements with which they represent her own interests with which they change into carnival extra of the governing and the leaders of the parliamentary groups." 
He spoke of the fact that they should prove her engagement to the construction of the necessary bridges to the Unterstüztung of the present government. 
"We look after the fact that they explain a trustworthy work and exert themselves before all things for the society and their groups, because these were the inhabitants of Sinaloa who pronounced her trust to them by the last elections." 
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairperson of the hotel association of Tres Islas, means, one of the big challenges to which 40 representatives of the people face is the impulse and the common works for the economic growth of the state, because nowadays the economic situation extreme ones would be complicated. 
"The most important is that they drive the economic growth, investments incentives and infrastructure measures create what will promote the creation of jobs in a manner at all." 
In view of the tourism branch he demanded of the new representatives, they should assign for the support to the tourism ministry the necessary value in the state household. 
"I have understood that it is the ministry with the second-least means. This is incompatible with an important economic activity which brings foreign currency and investments in the country and stands in direct competition to the agroindustry." 
Money must be assigned to the tourist projects, the state security must become support and the alcohol law which was not caught in the preceding legislative periods anew, must be brought on the newest state.
