With literature lay the finger in the wound 
The second round of the 'desire in the language' was a walk with which the participants made themselves for the story strong 
"With the sex into language I understand, yes, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected from me?," asked the author Luisa Valenzuela who should open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle which celebrated the Spanish-speaking literature and used with this opportunity the subtitle of her question (on another event was dedicated the round table to the sex into language, she explained). 
The finger in the wound... "brings us in difficulties," spitted the Argentine written steles sweetly to the audience which consisted primarily of young people who gathered on the international book fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to be present at this round table presented by Marisol Shultz, in the Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero took part. 
Luisa Valenzuela read out a text which she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and marked the Shultz afterwards as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is to be found out on the search what is a "wound," and from doctor to doctor goes from which she receives though no answer, but tips for the guide of her story. 
She leaves the Infektologen persuaded: "Patience is not my strength, is maybe my wound." 
In the end, after a frustrating approach to the Traumatologen which robbed of the breath her in the middle on the way, and to which you explain, however, that wound is no scientific concept, enthült of the psychoanalysts the secret: "the wound is the really open, the symbolism is the scar." 
The central figure of the story sighs made easier and closes which she only found out "from the wound that this is really open and does not exist." But she is persuaded that the desire in the language and their traps mix. 
Valenzuela, the author, played with both. 
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also introduced a delightful story which he called 'praise of the invention' and in which the finger does not mention in the wound though, but is discovered. 
With allusions to the magic realism he tells about a famous magician who brought back the clouds touched, widely travelled men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made an about-turn and reported about America, the big novel which did not lack from the outset his own chroniclers, and he cited Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticises the abundance of the stories told about the conquering. 
"Cervantes which invited everybody (the authors to us) mocked feigned witnesses who appeared in as true shown stories, but in other manner the history would never have been told America - with the imagination which got lost even the sense of shame." 
Indeed, he emphasises, "these are the lunatics and liars who fancy the things best of all," and there reality and lie approach to each other where one does not know any more to which side the story belongs where the fictive literature reaches the summit. 
He calls really the 'tradition Cervantes'. 
"We have inherited from him to be this what is told." 
As a Mayra Montero in the row was, commented and praised the author on the variety of the interpretations to which the invitation of the FIl for the round table 'of The fingers in the wound' had contributed. 
The Cuban and Puertorikanerin dedicated her contribution of the big wound of the social power which strikes her country - like completely Latin America - as a result of the fights for the drug trafficking. 
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent not deliberately planned engagement," she explained, after she had emphasised that literature is a communication and obligation which are based between the author and the readers like with a "chemical reaction." 
The Spanish writer Lui García Montero, contribution decided the evening also "this finger of the engaged author in the wound of the author" hevorhob. 
He noted that in a fast-moving world also the intellectual habits and the control of the consciousness run out to dogmatisms, and will forget, "that behind every confirmation a small no stands and behind every denial small Yes." 
"To be our thought and the reality in the possession, we must nuance: And nuancing often indicates to lay the finger in the wound and to bother those which feel much finer if they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in precast ideas without nuances and also of bothering the powerful figures who prefer to divide the world into black and white he noted and loaded in addition the sense to rediscover of the writing.
