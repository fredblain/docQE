Weak applause for China 
Voters of Taiwan slowly approach a narrower connection with the mainland. 
What does Taiwan of his big brother hold beyond the strait? 
On the 27th of November started more than 7.5 million voters, these are 70% of all voters, to choose mayor and town councils in five town districts. This is evaluated as a wide assessment of the president mA Ying-jeou. 
By the construction of pioneering business relations, incl. a partial free trade agreement, there is mA itself a symbolic figure for the relations with the mainland. His politics has changed the relation to the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949 with lasting effect. 
MA has passed the check, however, only scarcely. 
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) three five mayors puts, she received no voice majority. 
Instead, received the democratic progress party (DPP) which recommends a bigger independence of Taiwan, nearly 50% of the voices, the KMT received 45%. 
By a presidency choice this would have meant for mA of problems. 
Since his choice two years ago the percentage of votes of his party has liked about approx. 8%. 
For the first time drew the DPP even together with the KMT in the town councils. 
During the choice it came to the incidents usual in Taiwan like truck convoys with riot doers, flag-swinging mass moves and only meagerly dressed dancers. 
There was even the compulsory, mysterious murder attempt. 
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honourary chairperson of the KMT made in the eve of the choice a speech on a KMT candidate, 
when to him a man from the amount shot in the face. Lien was wounded and a next spectator was killed. 
Weird-wiser it is not clear whether the shooter Lien wanted to kill or settle a dispute with the candidate. 
No matter the poster according to Tsai has affected engineer-whom, to the leader of the DPP which choice has moved and the DPP in a bad light what has given more voices of the KMT. 
China was possibly the biggest winner of the campaign. 
Remarkably it was not picked out as a central theme the relations with the mainland. 
Instead, the candidates debated plans to social flats and the creation of jobs. 
The Taiwanese love her actual independence and reject military menace of China. 
That's why does not place special emphasis on the KMT her relations with the government in Peking with pleasure. 
However, this time also avoided the DPP to poke the anti-Chinese feelings too much. 
She reacted with it to the new consciousness that economy of Taiwan cannot survive without China. 
MA on his part would like to be confirmed that the majority of the Taiwanese recommends his China politics. 
The government in Peking will pursue furthermore his strategy to lure back Taiwan with economic stimulating in the community. 
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipeh to prepare a summit to investment security and medical cooperation. 
Absolutely it also wishes a political integration. But the most important first. 
It waits with it rather to the presidency elections in 2012. 
The DPP has anew invented itself, in the meantime. 
Two years ago it was strongly weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat because of corruption in the prison. 
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008 he entered vehemently for the absolute independence. 
However, under Tais Regentschaft a new generation of temperate politicians and the DPP developed fights for the voices of the working persons and the youth. 
Tsai met as a presidential candidate of the DPP with big approval, how Su Tseng-chang under Chen. 
Now their party does everything to show that also it is able to build up close relations with Peking. 
Tsai plans idea smiths as a contact point between the DPP and China. Nevertheless, this assumes unprejudiced discussions. 
Tsai explained publicly that her party a "trustworthy alternative" offers to Mas of rash approach to China. 
Chen seems very much angry about this change. 
From his cell he explained, the candidates of the DPP would have done better to exist on independence of Taiwan. 
He even asked the pragmatist Su to renounce the presidency candidature. 
Also without Chens interference does to itself the DPP hard to choose her possible candidate. 
The KMT will have to undergo own selfanalysis. 
Mas values are bad, in spite of the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run her election campaign without him. 
The principal reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the other and other scissors between arm and empire. 
According to statement of a KMT speaker he will reshape his cabinet as well as the local facilities. 
The strong appearance of the DPP lets assume that Taiwan recommends a reapproach only restrictedly. 
At the same time most Taiwanese see the economic cooperation with China as inevitable. 
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already nobody Back more."
