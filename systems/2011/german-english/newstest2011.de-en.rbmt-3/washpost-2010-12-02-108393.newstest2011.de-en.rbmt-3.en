Khmer blusher ex-servicemen to the confrontation with the past constrained 
In a weakly illuminated, concreted classroom with dirty and defoliating walls, the manager of the Anlong Veng reminds High School of the man to whom him has built, to the later Khmer blusher leader Ta Mok. 
"Here everybody loves Ta Mok." 
"He was a good leader and he has looked after his people," said Sreng Choosing mA, 42 years. 
Because of his brutality during the Khmer blusher rule famously as the "butcher," the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in the northwest of Cambodia where he has developed hospitals and bridges built, which infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live. 
However, this year, 12 years after the capitulation the Khmer blusher compared with the government, are challenged long-standing followers in Anlong Veng. 
In April a local truth and reconciliation forum permitted the public confrontation with the people who have supported once the regime to the victims. 
In June the government distributed a school book which tells the history the Khmer blusher for the first time children of former soldiers. 
And in July a communal tribunal of UN and Cambodia condemned for the first time a former member the Khmer blusher when it condemned the former boss of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known than Duch, to 35 years of prison. 
With each of these developments the fear grew under the Khmer blusher ex-servicemen Alnlong Vengs, complicated her efforts towards reconciliation and Reintegration in the society of Cambodia. 
"There is still refusal and fear in the former Khmer blusher, but they deal no power, something," said Chhang Youk, leader of the documentation centre of Cambodia, an independent organisation which investigates the regime. 
"For them the life was glorious under the Khmer blusher, but the regime has become a symbol of the bad person." 
"It splits itself families." 
While the Khmer blusher rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, were executed approximate 1.7 million people or they died of illnesses, reworking or before hunger. 
When the Vietnamese occurred and overthrew in 1979 Pol Pot-Ied government, the Überbleibsel of the regime and his military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand. 
Here they spread till December, 1998 when the last movement capitulated, restlessness. 
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war of her base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta pulled up Mok the next generation in Anlong Veng. 
But in the middle of the 1990s when a peace agreement promoted by UN led in 1993 to the first democratic elections of the country big groups of Khmer began blusher to fighters to overrun to the government what led to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998. 
Pol Pot died in 1998 a natural death, and Ta Mok which had not given way was arrested in 1999 by government forces with the Dangrek Mountains. 
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh where he waited for his process. 
When her Gönner did not protect them any more longer, fighters fled most former Khmer blusher in the backbreaking poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic recollection. 
Even if some elitist official the Khmer blusher kept her local government posts because they laid down her weapons, the easy soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers. 
"These people have profited only a little from the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the centre for justice and reconciliation which holds in completely Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng, public forums 
"Sie sind verankert in die utopische Agrarideologie des Regimes." 
"You grew up without any occupational knowledge." 
Sor Lim, 55 years which had joined in 1974 as a teenager the Rhmer blusher fought in the jungle for concerning Veng, before he sat down in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer. 
"The life under the Khmer blusher felt well," he said. 
"Ta Mok has to eat to everybody something given." 
"But now the life is difficult because we must look after ourselves." 
The running Khmer blusher tribunal has also roused here worries. 
In the beginning of the next year the court will try to put blusher minister, Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his woman as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer in court. 
It is the order of the court, the old leaders and those who are responsible primarily for the atrocities for condemning, but it is not said whether it pursues other actions after these four cases. 
This has served a little to reduce the fears in Anlong Veng. 
Topical media speculations have concentrated on in the Chaem, 64 years, which had been a blusher rule in the late 1970s years district boss in the province of Manteay Meanchey during the Khmer. 
In 2007 she had told representatives of the documentation centre about Cambodia, she has escorted the construction of the Trapeang Thma of dam, a project with which thousands of forced laborers presumably died. 
In a hot evening came back in the Chaem of the work on the fields to her timber house in a dirty street outside from Anlong Veng. 
As the sun long shades on the withered grass threw it refused in the Chaem to discuss blusher her past with the Khmer. 
Should the court summon them, it would to go for herself deny, she said. 
"Cambodia lives in peace and in stability," she said. 
"If there was no more pursuit, would be here war." 
Moreover, prime minister Hun the sen which has fled in 1878 from the Khmer blusher has warned repeatedly about the fact that the situation became unsafe, the court would accuse more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this. 
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said. 
But the confrontation with the past is that what must do Cambodia to be able to advance, said Chhang Youk of the documentation centre. 
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times meant Gather of the broken pieces," he said. 
"It is our duty to compose these broken parts, so that can understand like everything." 
The centre created the first school book approved by the government about the Khmer blusher, the 75-sided "history of democratic Cambodia." 
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the history book for the High School of the ministry of education which contains blusher less than four sides about the Khmer. 
How often in Cambodia the young people know blusher, in spite of the connections of the town with the regime in Anlong Veng only a little about the Khmer. 
Air Valeak, 19 years, a student in the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps the students to understand an important part of her history. 
But his parents reacted doubtfully when he brought the book with home to read it. 
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said. 
"You are distrustful because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court." 
Such an opposition brings the reconciliation action complicated and complex, said Sok Leang. 
But the public forums, the school book and the court attain bit by bit influence," he said. 
The Khmer still owns blusher here a powerful attraction. 
On top in the Dangrek to mountains one of shrubs overgrown and with plastic garbage muddy way leads to a rectangle of black soot, covers with a rusty metal roof. 
Pol Pot's body had been burnt here after his death in 1998 on a tyre heap. 
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a mobile phone shop assistant in the street edge, said, she does not know a lot about the man who had been burnt here. 
"But he has a strong mind and here many people go to him to pray," she said. 
It was Nuom Sotheas a birthday and later on the day it wanted to go to the Pol Pot's last place of rest where she will file a bush of ripe bananas - in hope that he brings her luck.
