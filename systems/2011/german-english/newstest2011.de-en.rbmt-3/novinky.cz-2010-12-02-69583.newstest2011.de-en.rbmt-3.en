Two training airplanes L-159 for the first time in foreign hand - in Spain 
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 of a total of five which has exchanged the Czech ministry of defence for the transport plane Casa C-295M have flown on Tuesday in the Spanish city of Seville where the Spanish airplane manufacturer Casa - EADS settles. 
It is the first time that machines of this type are in possession of a foreign army. 
Up to now abroad they were to be seen merely with manoeuvres or flight shows. 
It is, on this occasion, about the airworthy two-seater version L-159T1 which was pursued by the Czech army. 
Remaining three airplanes are einsitzige L-159. 
These stand currently still einkonserviert in the Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over them the last week. 
When she the airplanes physically from Vodochody expediert, is not Jan Pej š ek, according to the speaker of the ministry of defence yet famously. 
The einsitzigen fighter aircraft L-159 again were selected from in the long term stored airplanes and this without other inserts and investments on the part of the department of the ministry. 
"Double-seater L-159T1 were exchanged in present state and appearance," said Pej š ek of the newspaper Právo. 
He added, the army will have to get by not without twoseater fighter aircraft, because signed the ministry of defence in May, 2009 with Aero Vodochody a 200-million contract about the rebuilding of four superfluous L-159 to the twoseater version. 
A new airplane has taken over the army in July, the second one wants to take over them till the end of this year. 
Pej š ek according to has undertaken EADS to put through the fighter aircraft in the equipment one of the NATO countries. 
"In the contract is stated plainly that the enterprise EADS is a buyer of the airplanes L-159 and that these should serve for the education of pilots of the NATO countries. 
"Hence, it is a thing of the buyer in which manner he realises the thing," Pej š ek stated. 
The economic newspaper (HN) had reported before that the Spanish government has no interest to L-159. 
The barter of five L-159 against a transport plane Casa and the purchase of other airplanes for 3.5 milliard crowns had been approved last year still by the government of Mirek Topolánek. 
At that time the ministry of defence had written out no advertising procedure to the purchase, but appealed to EADS directly. 
The defensive velvet at that time argued, this exchange will support the future export L-159 abroad. 
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines from which she uses only 24, she wanted to dispose of the rest. 
The purchase of the airplanes Casa might have, by the way, still a judicial sequel. 
The European commission sued the Czech ministry of defence because in the European Court of Justice. The reason? It would have had to select the airplanes on account of a whole-European advertising and by no means by appealing one single manufacturer. 
The army has already taken over three airplanes Casa, the last should land within fourteen days on the airport Kbely.
