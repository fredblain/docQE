The government Berlusconi goes in Italy to cover 
Yesterday after a weekly beginning disturbing for Italy the situation has relaxed with the decline of the basic interest rates for 10 years a little. 
A return to the delusive silence. 
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs the region chairpersons Giulio Tremonti had the situation as "indecipherable" qualify and heard to calculate him on an "unpredictable" week-end what the person concerned denied, nevertheless, immediately. 
On Tuesday, in any case, the scissors with the German interest rates would have reached his record from 210 base points, and the prices of the contracts for the cover of the bankruptcy risk have risen on 263 points what had caused a certain rash in Rome. 
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his council of ministers to the fact that the discrepancy of Spain lies to the German interest rates with 400 base points. 
Nevertheless, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed itself as "difficult anxiously" from the "market turbulence" and a possible infection danger from Ireland. 
"The good news is that Italy, the third national economy of the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland." 
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist in the Hudson institutes. 
In plain English this is called, his problem is the absence of economic growth and the schwinds√ºchtigen tax entrances walking along with it which endanger the state not to be able to cover his financing need any more. 
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government. 
In future an Italian growth of 1.1% is expected in 2011 and from 1.4% in 2012... although at the senate to the check present budgetary budget on 1.3% or 2% counts. 
Under these conditions, so the EU commission calculates, the budget deficit next year will still put out 4.3% of the BIP (against 3.9% predicted by the governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%). 
Hence, also the turmoil around a new budgetary group which could be used after the holidays to a sum of 7 milliard euros. 
"If necessary, new economy measures must be seized," believes chartered accountant Olli Rehn. 
At the moment Italy receives the support of international institutions. 
"The basic parties of economy of Italy are in order and his accounts are regulated, we repeat this already since long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the international monetary fund who is entrusted with the IWF with Italy. 
"At the moment there are no problems, neither on short-term, nor on long-term view, there from Italy in spite of his high indebtedness (119.2% of the BIP in 2011, A. d. R.) lower Stabilisationsfortschritte are demanded than of other countries," observes pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD. 
If the question remains after the political unsteadiness. 
On the 14th of December Silvio Berlusconi will be up against a motion of no confidence of the representative's chamber as a result of which early elections could be already organised at the end of March. 
A little favorable period approaches for an adoption of resolutions concerning a heavy crisis.
