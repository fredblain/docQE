No objections of the Spanish government against CIA flights 
The Spanish government had no objections against the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda-caught about Spanish state area to Guantánamo as it arises from a telegramme of the ambassador of the USA in Madrid. 
This reflect from Wikileaks enhüllten and to the newspaper "El País" (by cable) to passed on documents. It is added that the former acting head of the government María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded, the Spanish government should be informed "to prove that the foreign airplanes which fly over Spain appropriately are supervised." 
In June, 2006, after the publication of a report of the Council of Europe in which the aid to human right-despising methods was accused in a Saying 'du' country, under it also Spain, former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega consulted. 
The acting head of the government admitted, the report of the advice "has met Zapatero in the offside" and confirmed, Spain has to hide in this matter nothing. 
"De la Vega underlined, Spain has no objections against the Secret Service flights about Spanish state area." 
"You would just like to be informed" not to be surprised unpreparedly "," reports Aguirre by cable. 
Also the former foreign minister, Miguel Á ngel Moratinos, pointed out the ambassador to the fact that the Spanish government "wants to give to this matter no big attention, although the government has only little influence, because these would lie in the hands of the judges." 
The public prosecutor Vicente González gave on his part in January, 2007 of the message to understand that he would not block the judicial initiative to apply for the Deklassifizierung of the documents of the Spanish Secret Service headquarters (CNI) and the defence minister about the CIA flights. 
"These reports contain no incriminating or sensitive information," explained the ambassador after a conversation with the public prosecutor. 
Nevertheless, the USA about the "ostensible coordination were concerned between the Spanish public prosecutor and the German public prosecutors" than about the deklassifizierte information of the CNI and the ministry of defence. 
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our strains to the discreet use between governments," deplores Aguirre.

The ambassador also expressed his concern about the approach of the PP in this matter. 
"In spite of her generally proamerican position our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from a tip that the government of Zapateros actions of the USA which could be laid out as possible human rights abuses, have tolerated or have ignored deliberately capital will hit, even if these exposures could affect negatively the government of the USA," he emphasises.
