The studio needs in addition a separate loan between 265$ million to 275$ million for his financial portion in these both films which should originate under the direction of Peter Jackson. 
The investor Carl Icahn who has financed approx. 18% of the MGM advance tried a coalescence of the studio with Lions gate entertainment whose biggest stockholder is he. 
However, the last negotiations between both enterprises led to no result.
