The new unity finds no unanimity 
In spite of the announcement of the possible foundation of a new, standing unity to the fight against corruption and collusion on the part of Jean Charest numerous observers demand furthermore the education of a public committee of inquiry on this subject. 
Robert Dutil, minister of the public security, states, this idea does not come from yesterday: Quebec would already have consulted the last January the New York Department of Investigation with regard to this subject. 
The metropolis disposes since 1870 of a standing unity against the corruption. 
Still, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than only one. 
One must say to the fact that this measure on the occasion of the meeting of the constant committee of the Quebecer police service was discussed on the 29th of October of the last year in spite of the presence Robert Dutils not in the slightest. 
There was also not enough that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, this announcement qualified tinkered solution" in punkto public security as a "rabbit conjured from the hat" as well as "in a serving rightly. 
Minister Dutil had turned on his part again to those which fear that the political power has too much influence on the standing, future unity. 
"You will see the result if we announce it," he was content to confirm himself. 
"One is aware of this problem." 
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can substitute for the realisation of a public survey. 
"The more M. Charest persists to want to prevent the education of this committee of inquiry, the more the people will think like you and me that he has to hide something," he explained. 
"To be able to form the only means, a committee of inquiry, is the resignation of Jean Charest," Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and politics systems explained on his part in the ENA (staatl. College to the education of high administrative officials). 
To come out of this dead end, he suggests to Quebec putting away a special mandate for the finance check control, so that this can make suitable inquiries about corruption and confidential arrangements. 
"One should be able to expand the mandate of the exam control," he decided. 
He represents also the opinion that Quebec of the exam control could put away the same power like commissioners what would also allow to her to oblige the people to the statement. 
The education of a standing unity is not the only project in the drawers of the government of Charest. 
Quebec will also require from Ottawa to change from that point of view the penal law to be put better in this way by crime. 
This inquiry comes from the upper public prosecutor of the operation Marteau who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier about the fact that the administration of justice is not unequivocal in this kind of the criminal proceedings. 
Vic Toews, Minister of State for public security confirmed on his part, his colleague of the justice, Rob Nicholson, at the moment argues with determined, this dossier to concerning amendments. 
During the operation Printemps in 2001 which concerned the groups of the motorcycle policemen 131 people had been arrested, although the penal law had not been amended. 
Ottawa has put through the law against world of gangsters as a result of that.
