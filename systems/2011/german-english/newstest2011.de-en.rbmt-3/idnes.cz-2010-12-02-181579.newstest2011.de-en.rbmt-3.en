The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have other wishes than men 
Not of the most great bed frames, but the quality of the couch surface - mattress and rust put out the good bed. 
However, these must be complementary harmoniously to do justice to the wishes of the concrete user. 
With the choice many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and not least also the gender of the Schläfers. 
The interior in which mattress and rust have to submit is as important also. 
Typical example? 
In a country house in which is heated not regularly latex mattresses are not well suitable, because they need much longer to become warm "." 
In addition, they are clearly heavy as usual polyurethane mattresses. 
And - they should be turned regularly. 
If they do not have enough little ventilation canals in the core because and lie on top of that on a firm record, humidity accumulates: It is not excluded that forms under her mould. 
With a choice of a role also plays of course to what one is accustomed. 
Who was a longer time abroad where very high mattresses with soft layer are usual, will hard be able to get used to a low mattress with hard surface. 
"Probably all ice hockey players who have come back from the NHL have complained with me that they cannot properly sleep here any more." 
"For her abgeschundenen shoulders, heels and hips they simply need a soft layer from Visco foam (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)." 
"I recommend this, among the rest, also to diabetic people who suffer from a disturbance of the nervous system, so that they can badly receive the "information" from the joints and the skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková which specialises in upholstered furniture. 
Therefore, I have already procured years ago for many ice hockey players, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam). 
"Today this is no more problem, because such mattresses offer among other things the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico." 
And one must not necessarily be a famous ice hockey player to come to appreciate the advantages of the Visco foam. 
This "miracle" quite simply functions, actually. 
The foam optimalisiert his hardness and form according to the absorbed warmth, in other words, he properly nestlles up in the warm body. 
It nowhere presses, at night one does not roll himself like after a heavy fight. 
One simply sleeps much better. 
In addition, the viskoelastische foam also offers protection from Dekubitus (gangrene). 
With a choice of the mattress size one should include to the body height still the length of the soles, so approx. 21 to 34 cm. 
Man like woman who are 180 cm to them need thus a 210 to 220 cm long bed. 
At least 90-cm couch width should be available to each of the Schläfer, together 180 cm. 
By single beds, for example, by singles, 120 to 140 cm are right. 
Of the comfort half and also for possible visitors. 
Otherwise the following rule of thumb is valid for the ideal bed width: "If one lies on the back, still enough place should be for the slightly bent arms," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, the guild master craftswoman of the upholsterers and interior decorators who devotes herself quite for years to the problems of the healthy sleep and the ergonomics of pieces of furniture and reports this subject also on technical schools. 
By a double bed every one own rust and his own mattress needs, but pay attention with the purchase, so that the mattresses are also equally high. 
Otherwise nothing else is left, than to mount the grates by different height and this is not possible long ago with every bed frame. 
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, of it should be cancelled at least three centimetres to the form layer and the fine upholsterer. 
"With the hand or while putting one may feel the feathers by no means," warns Helena Prokopová. 
Every mattress requires a special rust type. 
Whole-upholstered beds with mattress and base like grown together Siam twins have to search in the bedroom nothing. 
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and one cannot wash the relation what is quite quite usual today. 
And because one loses at one single night between from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat, is clear that the mattress becomes after from five to seven years slowly gigantic (and congested sieve). 
Also so the experts reject advertising slogans who promise with mattresses a life span from up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee. 
Every thing has to her If and, However. 
And, therefore, a practical advice of the traders: With mattresses of 120-or 140-cm width one should not avoid the hygiene of the washable, drawable off relations, still it is advisable to use a mattress schooner which one can easily draw off and wash. 
Even if today as a rule mattress relations with all-round zipper are produced, so that one gets two halves (immensely importantly for the washing process and the washing machine size after opening!), the manipulation with bigger mattresses, above all only explained, often like the unequal fight seems between David and Goliath. 
Do they have in the bed instead of a rust a firm record? 
Out with it! 
Or at most for a bed for unbeloved guests and for one single night. 
Also so they should provide the record rather with airing holes (provided that already none is in it) and mattresses with feather skeleton and 15-cm least with sucked. Pocket feather core and fine upholsterer use. 
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a base. 
For not adjustable duckboards with from 14 to 18 feather strips (lamellae) latex or sandwich mattresses (if necessary also combinations of latex and coconut palm) are likely, always pay to themselves, besides, grates with a bigger slatted number, so from 28 and more feather strips, with Lordosenstütze in the lumbar vertebra area and the possibility to adjust the slatted hardness. 
On adjustable lamella grates belong no mattresses with feather skeleton, because they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment. 
Beside the setting the stiff of the feather strips special adaptable shoulder modules are also offered. 
On this occasion, it is about a special connection of the feather strips which enables to push in the feather strips or so very to verwinkeln that they allow selective sinking of the shoulder of the Schläfers. 
In particular for men with wide shoulders an important thing. 
There is even mattress manufacturer who have started using soft zones for the shoulder area with "man's mattresses." 
Also to the ladies is intended - one grants to them these soft zones in the hip area. 
For the most demanding customers are point-elastic wing feather systems (Lattoflex) or grates with point-elastic Kontakt-Pads with sucked. Multitorsionsfederung determines. 
The pressure is distributed to several points by which the tension decreases. 
But - if one uses pillow to the right mattress and right rust bad (to big and corpulent), most advantages get lost again. 
Also here a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, his points should reach only up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax. 
Hence, ideally appears a 50 x 60 cm cushion how it, for example, the Scandinavians may. 
In the side situation the pillow (together with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should compensate the shoulder height. 
Our modern mattresses have something have with former (with hay full) to straw bags, nevertheless, commonly. 
Modern manufacturers use more and more often natural materials or at least their admixtures. 
Also with mattresses the new magic word "biology" is called. 
Instead of oil raw materials one uses to the production of polyurethane effervescence more and more often naturelle oils - for example, castor oil and soy-bean oil. 
Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers. 
"Biology is called with mattresses which passes her core of materials of purely natural origin," Petr Va š íček from the company Tropico explains plus. 
However, physical materials are also used in the production by mattress relations - besides, one of the first ones was an aloe Vera. 
However, one can also allow himself microcapsules which spread while sleeping fresh forest smell or lavender smell. 
Also here one makes a difference between man and woman. 
While with the men a "cooling" plant essence from birch sheets is used, so that the mattress relation can absorb the warmth and cool the body, the relations for women have "warming" effect. 
Essences from red peppers stimulate the blood circulation, to the weaker gender becomes while sleeping pleasantly warm. 
Und sterben heutigen Favoriten? 
Mattresses from cold foam (he has bigger pores with destroyed cell structure and, hence, is more cellular than customary polyurethane and also is much more adaptable). 
From the combination the different stiff (hardness) of cold effervescence and Visco effervescence originate more zonal mattresses which exactly know where head, hip and heels are. 
However, for a high-quality mattress one has to fork out 7000 crowns and more. 
However, health mattresses are normally loaded with lower value added tax, because they are valid than medical aid. 
As the first Czech enterprise this advantage was given Gumotex. 
One sees to save in the mattress and in the rust is not so light. 
Every now and then there are special offers of manufacturers and traders who offer two mattresses at a price of one. 
Thus the brand Magniflex offers the mattress Duofreeze with Visco foam verstepptem in the relation Memory for 11,990 CZK. 
One gets the second one free in addition. 
It was the material Tempur which initiated the era of the viskoelastischen foamed plastics with open cell structure and high density in nearly cosmic tempo. 
No miracle, nevertheless, they were developed for the NASA, because the astronauts are put out by the starts to huge overloadings. 
Tempur becomes soft with warmth, in chill environment it hardens again. 
Thus it adapts itself to the human body perfectly and distributes in optimum manner the body pressure. 
Hence, it is not only ideally for the prevention of pressure fire, but raises in general the sleeping comfort. 
Viskoelastische foamed plastics become not only with mattresses, but also uses with other health products, as for example with special foot upholsterers who should get the legs and the vessels of relief. 
For example, the foamed plastics Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products use local manufacturer.
