CECA excludes the second coalescence wave of the savings banks 
Yesterday the general manager of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected the possibility that it can come to a coalescence wave of the savings banks and stressed the quickness with which the branch is restructured. 
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not insist on it in the first phase on taking part. They reserved themselves the second round. 
However, assured the general manager of the Spanish savings bank association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round would not take place. 
"I think that the biggest part of the coalescences is concluded. The inclusion of Cajasol in the group Banca Cívica cannot be looked as the second round, it concerned rather adaptations." 
"The biggest part is concluded. It can be that we have instead of siebzehen thirteen or fourteen, but all important processes are already completed. They were controlled by Banco de España who has strongly supported all processes." 
With one of the association of the managers and manager Aragonien (ADEA) organised breakfast Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process "was carried out as fast as possible and that we must be contented with the expiry appropriate for term which in the former times, not now within the scope of which commercial plans with Banco de España were fixed" he stressed. 
"The crossing of 45 savings banks with on an average 28,000 million property continuances on 17 with 75 500 millions is a historically incomparable process. The number of the financial institutions was reduced about 62 percent and now they are much bigger what we have fulfilled the Basel agreement" with, he emphasised. 
Olavarrieta explained, "there would be a row of undissuaded opinions about the slowness of the process which Unseriösität and Unsinnigkeit" revealed, because "Banco de España admonishes us to conclude in time before end of the year." 
Yesterday the general manager of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that Spain has one of the most severe financing systems of Europe and "maybe" the whole world and complemented, that those which would act anzweifeltenn this "without deeper knowledge." 
The manager noted that we must come along in the present economic economic situation "no worries" about the situation of the financial institutions and the savings banks who have gone through a "very important" concentration process, that is carried out "as fast as possible." 
He also reminded of the fact that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests which the EZB carried out in July very well.
