I wish my successors a quieter year than we had it in Farmet 
The victory euphoria was removed fast from the results of the crisis. 
Thanks to his determination Farmet has the worst behind itself. 
Karel Ž ďársk ý, the owner of the company of Farmet accepted the price of the first rank of the competition Vodafone company of the year in the past year. 
At that time the jury appreciated the strains with which he rammed from the small tool construction in Česká Skalice an enterprise from the ground which makes hundreds of millions turnovers. 
"I can say that this acknowledgment has encouraged not only myself, but also all my employees and has encouraged our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," says the last year's winner. 
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet stood the effort to do something useful. 
And when then the state offered to his father Karel Ž ďársk ý as a compensation for the property confiscated by the communists a small workshop to the lease, he did not hesitate long, scrapped his career in the company in which he was occupied till then, and founded with a few companions of his father own company to the production of plastic tubs. 
Short time later they started to concentrate upon vegetable oil pressing. 
Within 18 years they have climbed up to the biggest manufacturer automatic pressing in completely Central Europe. 
But only by the success in the mentioned competition and his Medialisierung she has also entered into the consciousness of the not professional public. 
"Not only that our customers perceive the brand Farmet now clearly intensive, also our foreign partners began to the fact to be able to work together with a company which has gained the greatest possible success in her country to attach bigger value," says Karel Ž ďársk ý. 
The last year stood with Farmet, however, not only in the sign of the victory euphoria. 
The acknowledgment went out from the economic results of the enterprise in 2008 and a part of 2009. 
And just in 2009 the most difficult year was for the sales of tool building products. 
The crisis which shook at that time still less the citizens, but before all enterprise reached just her climax - many companies were made put her investment projects and limit the purchase of new facilities and technologies. 
"We could also not escape this situation of course." 
"The turnovers decreased about 40 percent, we had to limit the production and reach even for dismissals," explains Karel Ž ďársk ý 
A capable of surviving enterprise must take every now and then also such unpopular measures. 
However, one succeeded in gaining control of the situation and in holding the company in the black figures, even if with lower profits, than before the crisis. 
With one the enterprise was not determined to make deductions - with the investments in the research and development. 
"From the subsidy we built a research and training centre, we encouraged our presentation on international fairs and acquired first prizes from home exhibitions," says Ž ďársk ý. 
Everything testifies of the fact that we have overcome the crisis. 
The turnovers grow again and with them also the number of new employee. 
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in the victory - but in quieter atmosphere," Karel Ž ďársk ý allows to aim.
