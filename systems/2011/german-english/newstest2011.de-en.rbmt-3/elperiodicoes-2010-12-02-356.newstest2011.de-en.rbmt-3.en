Sport and control avoidance 
Tricks like from Alonso and Ramos in the play against the Aiax show invention mind, but not the will to handle a sanction. 
Putatively from two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) instigated exclusion in the play from the 23rd of November against the Aiax in the Champions League led to the fact that a lot of ink was poured about whether it did not concern an unsporty action or and whether perhaps both players should be sanctioned by UEFA. 
How is known in general, both players lost a few minutes before playing (her team had already unambiguously won) time and played several fouls, so that the referee showed them the second yellow map. 
In this manner, and because of Real Madrid would state his group, both players will fulfil the prescribed sanction with the next league match against the Auxerre and get thus without maps into the next play phase. 
Finally, the Disziplinarkommitee of UEFA punished the trainer of the club, Jos√© Mourinho, with two plays and the involved players with different amounts of money. 
The provocation of a yellow map under such or similar circumstances is no new practise, it is to be found rather often in the world of the football. 
It is spread so far that it is a part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport to obeyed rules-. 
Part of the arisen debate around the shown case decreases to the fact that a team of the football club played Real Madrid (which gives generosity and honour in his hymn and had punished with other opportunities his players for similar incidents), besides, the leading role, and on the dramatisation by Mourinho who has added an episode more to his long history than theatrical and provoking engineer. 
Anyway the debate turns on whether this behaviour pattern not expressly forbidden by the statutes contradicts the principles of the sport, that is whether these actions show a control avoidance. Really this approach keeps to the statutes of the sport, however, seem to handle his sense. 
With this matter the damage caused to the sports mind should be examined. 
The sports mind defends the physical intactness of the opponents, an aspect which was not endangered by these actions, because it was no aggressive play. 
Another aspect of a clean play insists in the fact on avoiding that the counteracting players derive an unwarranted benefit from the counterteam. Also this did not happen. 
The paradoxes of the action of the players of Real Madrid are that she does not correspond to him what we ordinarily understand by wrong play or control avoidance, because the avoidance of the rule was not carried out secretly to avoid a sanction, but she should be so conspicuously as possible, so that it is punished by the referee. 
The players waited and accepted the sanction joyfully. 
Another question is which kind of advantage the offenders from the deliberate fouls pulled. 
Here it should be emphasised that the rival was brought neither in a more unfavorable situation, nor advantages were demanded for the played play, because the evident result of this action was that own team with less players weiterspielen had to go. 
It is also no useful strategy for the next play, because then the club does not dispose of these players. 
The advantage consists in the fact obviously that the players begin the next play phase of the Champions League without maps which her participation in a future play could threaten. 
But it concerns a long-term, up to a certain degree of uncertain advantage, because the team could also retire sometime. Moreover, the players with this approach receive a sanction and go over in the second map cycle in which they retire because of map accumulation with a map less than in the first cycle. 
With it it is not so clear whether it really concerns an advantage. 
At last are not directed to such approaches against the sports mind to whom also strategical decisions belong to derive the greatest possible benefit from the regulations. 
In this case the players no sanction wanted to handle (this would really be an unequivocal case of control avoidance), they wanted to choose rather, when they undergo this. 
They made a strategical decision without making way of a punishment or fleeing before her. 
Although the border is blurred between imagination and control surroundings, I think that it concerns with this matter a clear case of imagination. 
I have the impression that the polemic has originated as a result of two factors: Because it was about two selfexclusions and because of the kind of the provoked control transference. 
The harm which was done to the principles of the sport by these actions is of less ethical than rather aesthetic kind.
