Byelorussia agrees not to collect further weapons-grade uranium 
In an astonishing victory for president Obama Kampagne for the worldwide protection of nuclear material the government of Byelorussia has announced on Wednesday that one will not collect any more longer highly fortified uranium which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. 
The deal was announced in a common statement after a meeting of the foreign minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belorussian foreign minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the security summit. 
For years the US government had tried to persuade Byelorussia, not to collect highly fortified uranium any more and seemed to have reached the last spring a hurdle. 
However, official of the US government told Washington Post that during the past two months two secret treaties by Byelorussia were met to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belorussian research institution. 
This prepared the stage for the arrangement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous on account of the sensitivity of the subject, about 500 pounds. 
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obamas "to nuclear security summit of 47 nations" from April, Byelorussia had excluded. 
And it felt well enough obviously to protect the invitation of the former Soviet republic for the next summit in 2012. 
"I was really enthusiastically from the fact that they want a seat in the nuclear security summit (from 2012)." 
"This proves to me that it functions," said Ken Luongo, president of the partnership of global security, a group for the support of the nuclear security. 
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" from Byelorussia. 
Obama promised in April, 2009 in Prague to protect all precarious nuclear material within four years. 
Since then the US government has helped six countries to get rid of her highly fortified uranium. 
Byelorussia will be the seventh one. 
It did one dozen countries under the government of George W. Bush. 
At the moment from Obamas to nuclear security summit the Belorussian president Alexander Lukashenko has explained that give never up the nation her uranium. 
"As kept highly fortified uranium - hundreds of kilos what is basically weapons-grade, and at that time less fortified uranium," said Lukashenko. 
"This is our raw material... We will make from it no dirty bombs and we will sell it to nobody." 
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, this is everything." 
Byelorussia still approached few months ago to the USA when it indicated interest in the meeting of an agreement. 
The first approach, the uranium of Byelorussia in October to remove, was particularly complicated because the material was easily contaminated with radioaktivity, say official. 
It was loaded in a special train, more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say official. 
The second approach was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the official by airplane. 
The US government pays 14$ of millions for these efforts and a large part of the money flows into the Belorussian research with weakly fortified uranium which cannot be used for nuclear weapons. 
"This was co-ordinated extremely carefully and tuned to build up trust" which led to the agreement which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the energy ministry which works on the global danger reduction. 
James Martin Zentrum for Nichtweiterzugebende studies estimates that Byelorussia had at least 88 pounds of waffenf√§hhigen uranium as well as hundreds of pound in highly fortified uranium this year. 
Byelorussia wants to dissolve his camp till 2012 according to the common agreement. 
For years the relations between Byelorussia and the USA were tightened, primarily, because of Lukashenkos harsh disregard of the human rights. 
But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approach. 
"The progress of these global security questions greeting, announce the United States of America and Byelorussia that a raised respect for the democracy and the human rights remains a central subject in the improvement of the bilateral relations in Byelorussia and it is essential for the progress of the country and his citizens" she explains.
