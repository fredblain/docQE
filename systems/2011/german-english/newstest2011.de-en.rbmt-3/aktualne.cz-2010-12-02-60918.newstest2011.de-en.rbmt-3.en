What should she do, the ČSSD? The Czech social democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort, nor the "pastry shop." 
The new councillors of the capital from the rows of the ČSSD will have to overcome obviously certain linguistic barriers to be able to understand her old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague advice and in the town representation generally. 
The newspaper Aktuáln ě. cz has "knocked off" members of the new advice from the ČSSD sometimes a little as they control the notorious slang which has become naturalized during the last years in which the today's coalition partners were in Prague in the oar. 
The coding vocabulary which was introduced in the ex-era by chief burgomaster Pavel Bém of the Prague political élite is borrowed from some of the best known actors, situations and Causae. 
Astonishing proofs appeared that the new councils grope about concerning these new concepts something in the darkness. 
They maintain this at least. 
"Wer ist Voldemort?" 
"No notion." 
"I am rather a novice in the Prague politics," reacted Luká š Kauck ý, the new councillor for culture, on the test of the "godfather's vocabulary." 
But also councillor Karel Březina - a political ex-serviceman - reacted in similar manner. 
For example, on the concept "Gulf hole." 
"This is the only expression of those which you present to me here which I use every now and then." 
"Otherwise I do not hold a lot from slang." 
From the vocabulary, the daily paper Aktuáln ě. cz had published in this year's June before the electoral congress of the ODS, the editorial staff pecked out six concepts, above all those which are connected notoriously with the Prague City Council. 
The social democrats should go the concepts "Voldemort," "the biggest Prague gulf hole," "to the pastry shop" define "bull nape," "betrayal of the capital" and "verblechen." 
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín wagonbuilder, the future boss of the Prague school system - promised first his participation in the conversation, then did not answer, however, sometimes the phone. 
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the start. 
"These things make no difference to me and how the middle-class democrats talk together, about that I do not judge." 
"For me is important as we get on within the scope of our programmes," he countered. 
As already intimated, Luká š Kauck ý would not have recognised in the headline mentioned on top supposedly that from the high-powered enterpriser and friend of the ex-chief burgomaster Bém, Roman Janou š ek the speech is. 
The concept "Voldemort" says Kaucky purely nothing at all and the only concept which he guessed with the test correctly, was "the biggest Prague gulf hole." 
"This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kauck ý, still, however, added to the security: "But I know this rather from the newspaper." 
And jokingly: "I will have to book a linguistic course." 
Then the "gulf hole" is deciphered not only by matador Karel Březina, but also by the councillor for environmental issues Luká š Plach ý properly as a tunnel Blanka. 
However, both social democrats also know for whom the concept Voldemort stands and Luká š Plach ý anticipates even where this figure is to be found and thereby also, what it means, "to the pastry shop to go." 
"I believe to go that is to any Prague catering trade company," Plach ý is quite near in it in the riddle solution if one knows that it concerns, on this occasion, the seat of Janou š eks companies. 
However, agree with Březina he protests to have scooped this knowledge rather from the newspaper, as that this vocabulary would be own to him. 
To judge by the test participants, there seems to be among the social democrats really no similarly established slang. 
"I have also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is not such a thing with us really." 
"We calls us with the name, every now and then we also use abbreviation or nickname," says the chairperson of the Prague Petr ÈSSD Hulínsk ý - from his party members casually "Hulda" called. 
"At school I was called Bříza (birch), but I do not know whether me also my colleagues call so," Karel Březina betrays to us his nickname. 
The newspaper Deník Aktuáln ě. cz has tried out the name and see there - he functions. 
Councillor Weinert is for the party members friendly the "grandpa" or less friendly the "old person," the representative Miroslav Poche who drew the attention before the elections by machination with the party sponsorship to himself, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure). 
Nicknames are thus the only one which the social democrats admit in the inner-party usage. 
Hulínsk ý does not like it supposedly if one calls him "Hulda," but Deník Aktuáln ě. cz registered one more nickname of the Prague chairperson. 
His nickname "doctor of the truncheon rights" deals supposedly with the fact that Petr Hulínsk ý his title Doctor juris has acquired in the Bratislaver police academy.
