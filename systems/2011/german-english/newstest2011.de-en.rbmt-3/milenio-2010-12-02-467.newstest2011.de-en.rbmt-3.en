China holds his aims for the decrease the greenhouse gas straight 
The representative of China explained on the COP16, his country has undertaken huge strains for the reduction of the carbon tracks and it would maintain his offer to diminish 40 to 45 percent of his greenhouse gas till 2020. 
China holds his offer to reduce the issue of hothouse gases up to 2020 about 40 to 45 percent, assures Su Wei, the representative of this country on the COP16. 
In his first public appearance at the 16th world climate summit of the United Nations (COP16) assured Su Wei, his country would have undertaken huge strains for the lowering of the carbon tracks and for the conversion of his industry. 
He explained that during the last four years his country has invested 245 million dollars to lower the issue of hothouse gases. 
However, he explained that China did not change his aims, but together with the international community would work on this matter. 
He explained that the Chinese strategy divides itself into four aspects in the matter of climate change: Dialogue, construction of capacities, construction of institutions and support of pilot's programmes. 
In all aspects one has made progress, he explained including the discharge of a new energy law last year which contains the aims concerning the lowering of the issue of gases. 
On the other hand, he emphasised that in China the authorities of the federal states had worked together with those of the central state and the municipalities to reach the aims to the energy saving, an effective use of the energy and the reduction from issues. 
Moreover, he explained, some several years' plans have already been tackled or been concluded, those which were financed by the Chinese government, as well as those which received money from other countries. 
For example, he referred to the programme to the effective use of energy which was introduced during the last five years and had received investments of the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands. 
A project at provincial level also runs to the climate change, another for the exchange of the traditional light bulbs by energy savings pears and another to the assuagement and adaptation, he explained. 
Martin Krol, scientific government adviser in the matter of climate change in this country, confirmed that the strains of China are by far bigger than generally would be accepted. 
He indicated that the pro-head issue of hothouse gases amounts to six tonnes per person in China, while there are 100 tonnes in the United States. China is responsible for a 9-percent whole contribution to the environmental pollution. 
Also it makes unprecedented progress in the area of the energetic use. The energy effectiveness was raised during the last five years by twenty percent and up to 2020 a next should happen, he explained.
