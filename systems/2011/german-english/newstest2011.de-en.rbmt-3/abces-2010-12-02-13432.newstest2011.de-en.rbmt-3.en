Partido Populärer gewann 4 Sitze im Kongress dazu und PSC verlor 9 
With the results from the 28th of November a determining role could play the PP in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona 
After the important voice increase and delegated increase by the last regional elections directs the PP her look already upon the parliamentary elections - early or not. Their expectations are more than positively, because the voice number which achieves this party by these elections is ordinarily twice as high than by the elections in Catalonia. 
Thus the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 voices at the parliamentary elections from 2008, while this figure amounted to only 316.222 by the regional elections in 2006. 
On the last Sunday the PPC 384.091 achieved voices. 
If this climbing up trend - result of the diversion of the percentage of votes of the PSC and the connection of the electorate of the PP - should stop, forecast the analysts of the PP that at the parliamentary elections the PPC of from 8 to 12 congressmen could climb up, while also CiU four (they has now 10) dazugewinnen and the PSC at least 9 representatives (from 25) would lose. 
These calculations book the basic meaning of Catalonia for PP and PSOE. 
According to the analysis of the People's Party would lose the ERC a representative - currently she has three - while ICV hold her representative or dazugewinnen would be able. 
Should the electoral calendar be maintained, nevertheless, the next appointment with the local elections falls in May, 2011. Also the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue in the scales to put an end to the socialist supremacy, namely in four provincial centres and with her majority in the town council of Barcelona, one of the city administrations with the biggest household: 661 million euros for 2011. 
The nationalists as well as the People's Party agree in the fact that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona in which the socialists can achieve neither a majority, nor fall back on her traditional allies (ERC and ICV). 
After the republican debacle it is not wrong that this party will lose her representation in the district council of Barcelona in which she would have to achieve 5% of the voices. 
However, the PP registered an increase of her percentage of votes in four provincial centres and could become the determining strength in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona. 
The nationalists are persuaded to be able to play the leading role in Tarragonas change. There they had ruled before the present mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP. 
En Lérida lies the PP only 500 voices behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times. 
Also in other important places, as for example in Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus the People's Party could register an important increase. 
Currently is represented the PP in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and aims at the education of lists in so many places as possible.
