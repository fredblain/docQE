Pilsner ground fund - arrests of the police with a public advertising 
In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen the anti-corruption police during the last days carried out arrests. 
Besides, the local media enterpriser and estate agent Lubo š G. was led away from the detectives in handcuffs. 
This had tried supposedly to manipulate a just taking place public competition for the winding up of restitution claims in such a way that the properties offered in the competition closed to a concrete prospective customer. 
This should have paid Lubo š G. for it half a million. 
"At that time I can only confirm that the police pursues a person because of the offence of deceitful machination with a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the boss of the Pilsner public prosecutor's office of the newspaper "Právo," other details cannot grant them in view of the running investigations. 
24 hours later the 46-year-old enterpriser was dismissed by the police again. 
In which manner he could manipulate the public competition, one can only speculate on it in view of the scanty official information. 
The speaker of the ground fund Lubomír Černá stated on the relevant question of Právo, the police has carried out in the Pilsner branch of the ground fund really arrests and this during a public competition. 
"It was about a client and by no means about one of our employees," she concretised. 
The public competition had Mrs. Černá according to the correct name "Request on the offer delivery of claims for the transportation of properties according to the ground law" and would take place in cases in which several applicants show interest in the offered property. 
"These people offer a higher value of her restitution claims to be paid by the transference, than the exclaimed plot value within the scope of the request." 
"Accordingly of the offered claims the order of the potential acquirers is fixed, afterwards the ground fund transfers the property on the person with the highest offer," explains the speaker of the fund. 
Lubo š G. were available obviously information who had announced himself upon the request and because he himself was an entitled person, because he had bought a row from restitution claims to himself, he offered to a property interest that he withdraws from the competition. 
Obviously against a fat compensation. 
This would also be an enough explanation of it, which is why he had such a big amount of money with himself in his arrest. 
Lubo š G. already had in the past much too good contacts with the Pilsner ground fund. 
Thus he also played in the Causa of the former boss of the ground fund Václav Sankota a role who was pursued criminal because he published in spare restitutions properties to which already location decisions had been liked to building project. 
At that time Lubo š G. of the ground fund acquired, for example, also properties which were determined for the construction of public streets, more exactly said, here where the construction of the Zufahrtsmagistrale was planned to the industrial area Borské pole. 
Later he exchanged this very favourably with the City Council for a house directly in the historical centre of the town which exceeded the value of the properties far. 
The city hall had to do of then heavy heart Kleinbeigeben not to endanger the building project by the blocking of the properties.
