Tech Toys holds your gift budget in the balance 
This year's favorite under the presents is possibly followed iPad, by a Microsoft Kinect videoconsole. Both games can tear a substantial hole in your gift budget. 
iPad costs so many like five BMX bikes for 99$, while the price of a Kinect play about 10 classical Springseilen or approx. 48 tins Play-Doh corresponds. 
But you can spare your gift budget. 
Recently I visited in search of three electronics toys under 80$ three national toys traders - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a club BJ's Wholesale. 
To me it became clear immediately that of moor law was come into force. This year the technology toys are more efficient and cost at the same time a little less than last year. 
And although less new toys with own web page appear, is found in the best known this kind, Webkinz and club of Penguin, a broader offer. 
There come more and more button cells pursued toys on the market, and a lot of contain chargeable accumulators. 
Here some recommendations. 
(If differently given, are not all prices of Toys "R" Us.) 
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, for children from 3 years) are plush figures, as largely as guinea pig which sing a mark if one presses her belly. 
Once press corresponds to a mark, by repeated pressure one can play a song. 
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony. 
Attention: If you have started with the pressure once, you cannot stop any more. 
For a combination of Gesand and dance the dance star Mickey (Fisher-Price 60$, for children from 2) is the best choice. 
The animatronische doll interplays like offers 'basis of the Elmo developed last year live technology Simon says', and thanks to the new hinge feet with bicycle blocking she controls the Moon-Walk. 
The children who tested the device use Mickey as a dancing instructor. Nevertheless, their parents complained to the missing volume control. 
If you are a child of the 80th, remember absolutely Alphie, one of the first computerised learning toys. 
Now he is there again (Hasbro/Playskool, 40$, for children from 3), with a whole heap of interrogative maps with which a drive can become one teaching hour with a know-it-all with auto correction function as a teacher. 
If you did not like to entrust with your Smartphone your child with pleasure, are here three independent alternatives. 
MobiGo of VTech (60$ for children of from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. Nevertheless, the plays contained on it are not so instructive as on the Leapster Explorer (70$, for children of from 3 to 12) which is equipped to Leapfrogs of the first big reworking of the Leapster row with a new, brighter screen. 
Keine der Versionen ist mit Ã¤lteren Kassetten kompatibel. 
iXL from Fisher-Price (90$ for children of from 3 to 7) uses for the plays and eBooks a system similarly iTunes, and thanks to the map disk drive SD family photos can be also looked on it. 
Finally there is still Scrabble Flash (30$ of Hasbro, for children from 8). Five blocks are not bigger than a match box and dispose of own LED screen. 
With the play it is a matter of folding up the blocks to words, before the time runs out. It is suited splendidly for an impromptu Buchstabierwettbewerb. 
More and more toys have a sort of on-line connection. 
If one goes alone after the offer in the toys stores, Webkinz and club of Penguin are the most important ones. 
To give an on-line animal in the club of Penguin to your child, you can buy, e.g., Disney club of Penguin 2" mixes ' N match the figure package (5$ for children from 6 to 12) which contains a coin with a confidential code. 
If you give the code to on-line, your child receives enough Credits for two other parts in the club of Penguin net curtain. 
These can be roller skates or a Puffle soft toy. 
Of the newest head cells pursued microrobots, Hexbug Nano (10$ for children from 5) is not bigger than the head of your toothbrush. 
The beetle moves fast on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction. 
It gives pleasure to send him by a crazy garden from blocks. 
And he stands something. 
Ours fell from the culinary table and got over even some time in the mouth of our dog.
