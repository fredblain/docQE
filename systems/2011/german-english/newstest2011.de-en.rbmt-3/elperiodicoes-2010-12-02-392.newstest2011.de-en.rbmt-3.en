Auf der Jagd nach Wikileaks Chef 
Obama appoints a high person responsible for the anti-terrorism fight the prevention of new exposures. 
Interpol spends a red warning to the pursuit and location of Assange. 
Everything what hangs together with Wikileaks and his founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the circumstances can be cleared up only difficultly. 
Yesterday Interpol spent a "red warning" for the "location and pursuit" from Assange. 
Indeed, besides, it does not concern a traditional arrangement to the arrest. 
Moreover, she is not new, she comes from the 20th of November. 
She also deals nothing with the last exposure of more than four millions diplomatic documents from the USA, but with the accusations of sexual abuse to which the Australian must position himself in Sweden. 
Further assures the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police would know about where and how she can get in touch with Mr. Assange." 
Already in 20. the international police authority with headquarter in Lyons (France) at the request of Sweden spent the arrangement, but it was not announced till yesterday on receipt of the competence by the Swedish authorities. 
Thus lie the things. 188 Interpol countries depend to identify Assange and to discover "to arrest him provisionally and to deliver." 
Although Interpol cannot arrange the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member countries after statements of the organisation look at the red warning as a charter for an Arrestierung - which must be carried out by the national police - in particular if they order of a bilateral delivery agreement how it is the case of Sweden and England where Assange presumably stays. 
The action outraged Assanges lawyers who published gesten a letter in which they informed about the fact that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference. 
They also remind of the fact that Assange applied for the crossing the border from Sweden and is compared by the state lawyer, with sagenumwobenen Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security boss of Stalin, which received suitable approval. 
"This is like a hunt, not like a juridical pursuit," it is accused in the writing. 
While the world searches him - and his mother protests the innocence of her son from Australia - Assange stays at an unknown place, indeed, not in silence. 
On Monday he gave to the leader of the magazine Time by Skype of an uncertain place from an interview. In the conversation he applied for the resignation of the Assistant Secretary of the USA, Hillary Clinton. 
"If can be proved that she was responsible for the arrangement of North American diplomats, to spy out UN and with it has offended against international agreements signed by the USA, she would have to withdraw," he said. 
Yesterday his opinion was condemned by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the application for resignation as "ridiculously and absurdly." 
"I am not sure, why we should think highly of the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the transmitter CNN. 
Obama itself has instructed a high person responsible for the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, with the prevention of new document exposures. 
The attempt of the speaker of the Pr√§sidenden Barack Obama to give Assange less attention stands in contrast to the opinions which conservative politicians and annotators announce during these days. 
The congressman Peter King who will be in the chair in the national Sicherheitskommitee of the chamber of deputies from January has asked the state department to examine the possibility, to place Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organisations "to confiscate their money and everybody which supports them or a contribution performs to pursue." 
Tom Flanagan, adviser of the Canadian president Stephen Harper, had still gone on, and he had to revoke his statement, Assange must "be murdered." 
"Obama would have to transform him into a target and use a not manned airplane or something like that." 
Who did not apologise, was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate. 
"Who was it also always which allowed to trickle through in the government information, he is guilty of the betrayal and everything is what no execution, is eiine too mild punishment," he explained to the transmitter fox terrier.
