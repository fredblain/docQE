The dictatorship of the calendar drops this year an avalanche of reservations for the days 16th and 17th of December. 
The celebrations paid-up by employees spread out. They do not want to be economical more than 20 to 30 euros. 
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery there is during the Christmas period also again the group dinner which bring to the catering industry and leisure trade of Barcelona oxygen. But as a result of the economic crisis they release a prize offensive, around the also customer segment which shows the big mass to catch: Almost everybody would like to be economical between 20 and 30 euros on a midday sen or dinner, confirm the questioned enterprisers and associations. 
So that the accountancy becomes still more complicated a little bit, the calendar (New Year's Eve has falls on Friday) all orders the week from the 13th of December drop, with the result of an avalanche of reservations of dinner in two Spitzentager (16. and 17.) and almost no orders in the week before it. 
Since 2008 when the bad times began many enterprises have put the group dinner for budgetary reasons. 
Not to have to renounce this tradition, many employees pay this from her own pocket. 
How the economic situation also lies always, it are demanded Niedrigstpreise, confirms the chairperson of the restaurant committee of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs. 
Till present the representative of the umbrella organisation ventures not to predict himself as the holidays will look this month. 
"The people consider it 'umpteen spots, before they book." 
"You would like to go out with pleasure, but they strongly pay attention to the prices," he stresses. 
The business will go well with those, offer "the quality for good prices with a good service," he adds, and calls us in the memory that the customers save in crisis periods, which is why prices are strongest asked about 25 euros. 
By a survey in various centrally situated restaurants turns out that the evening of the 17th of December leads the suppliers to the collapse. 
The group Soteras says, the inquiries for this Friday with the intention to be economical less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adapted her menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation situation. 
With another leading group, Andilana which maintains 16 restaurants in the town (Hostal de la Rita Market, La Fonda and other), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November. 
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the last year's prices with menus for every taste of 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains. 
With in Grup, the El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 bars leads, one does not lose the optimism, after since the second quarter the income blossoms again and good ones, even if is awaited for few days of concentrated views for the Christmas business. 
Springs of the enterprise group emphasise that also 18. a hyperactive day with friend's groups, the Christmas precelebrates, will be. 
To six group menus a Christmas menu was added for 30 euros or more than prize hit. One has the impression that the customers are ready to spend 10 percent more than in the year before and as a countermove more details wish, as for example Cava. 
Also in some companies one sees green rungs sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. This conveys the impression that group food is again in the impetus. 
Vonseiten of the umbrella organisation Fecasarm (with unions like the bars association, restaurant association and leisure association of Barcelona), the acting chairperson trusts to see Enric Gomà, on it the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are rather "lively all together, although the customers knock out "a maximum." 
However, the fun in the celebration has not decreased, all the same who pays.
