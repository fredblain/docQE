Holy king is searched 
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys wish the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela longingly. 
For the parents it will be difficult on the next Epiphany day to fulfil these wishes, because the household does not consist any more and no less than of twelve people and a billy goat. 
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar give them the toys and the clothes for which they long so. 
The family inhabits a modest house in the settlement Salvador Allende. They live on the hand in the mouth, because the father has no firm work. 
"Hard times are sometimes announced because my husband has no job. But we sell tangerines and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go out into the streets with the little misses to the selling," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones. 
Four-year-old Adelaida would have with pleasure a doll or a bicycle, while her three year-old sister Isabel wishes a Barbie doll. 
Ten-year-old José Alfredo would already like to have since some time a 'monster carriage' and for his eight month-old little brother Jesús Cayetana clothes suggests in the size for one-year-olds. 
" (José Alfredo) said me, 'I would have so with pleasure this monster', but I answered to him, 'lets to us wait, boy', because it was very expensive," remembered Cayetana sadly. 
For the older children who were at school clothes and shoes would be ideal. 
11-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; ten-year-old Isaías the size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel Grösse 8 has. 
14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in the size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful. 
If you liked to help to realise the dreams of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela, you can make a donation in the campaign 'holy king will take part in request', while you toys or cash in the receipt hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
