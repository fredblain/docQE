Ogoniland is burnt down 
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like in the filling station: Milliards litres of run out crude oil have destroyed the nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland. 
The people live on theft, corruption and unlawful oil cooking. 
Celestine Akpobari meint es Eingeweide. 
"Does not struggle to you," the ecological activist calms the journalists: "You will get even today enough oil mud before the lens." 
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to photograph of one up to the breast in the water wading boys with the streaks surrounding him: In the rainbow-coloured water shine the scene looks almost pretty. 
The fact that under the surface brown crude oil swaths float, is not to be seen. 
Here earlier she has collected in bucketfuls shrimps, tells Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo Jetty river. 
In the meantime, the sluggishly flowing waters are completely dead. 
Five years ago vast amounts crude oil poured forth from a cracked conduit to the gigantic humid area. 
Now fishermen from the nearby small town of Bodo must row six hours to reach in fish-containing waters: In the heart of the Niger delta situated Ogoniland is valid as one of the regions polluted most badly of the world. 
On the journey by the mangrove marshes durchzogenen from courses of a river the whole magnitude of the devastation becomes obvious. 
Instead of bright water the motorboat turns up brown broth who dips his hand in the water, pulls out oily fingers. 
The roots of the mangrove small trees rise like black Lakritzstangen from the ground, sadly hang sporadically palms to be found her whisks. 
One searches bird's dreams, as they are usually usual in humid areas, in vain: As soon as the outboard is quiet, eerie rest spreads out in him like a filling station smelling former paradise. 
"What happens here, is ecological leading of the war," says Celestine Akpobari grimly: "We live in constant danger for the health." 
The war comparison is right. 
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battlefield fought since decades: Here the first Explorateure from Europe penetrated more than 60 years ago, here organised in the 80s with the later executed author Ken Saro-Wiwa the first opposition, here the Shell group had to put in 1993 his production because it became too dangerous for his oil workers. 
Still today the return is kept the enterprise to Ogoniland: While from the whole delta region are pumped by the triple size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling springs and 7000 kilometres of conduits daily more than two million barrels of the black gold, the oil fields lie fallow in the Ogoniland, too unstable is to the group the situation. 
Every few hundred metres rise steel racks like weird sculptures from the water: "Christian's small trees" are called too affectionate the heads of the bores. 
They are up to 50 years old, most to the core corroded. 
Over and over again such a drilling head breaks, Akpobari believes, then run a steady stream crude oil in the water. 
More than two milliard litres have flowed according to expert's estimates in 50 years into the ecological system of the delta: Year after year the amount of oil, as it penetrated with the average of the supertanker "Exxon of Valdez" 21 years ago into the sea before Alaska - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of the humanity. 
Who is to be held responsible for the persistent ecological region, about that is argued. 
While the Shell group holds responsible sabotage and the organised oil theft for more than 90 percent of the soiling, environmentalists see cracking drilling heads and leaky pipelines as a main cause. 
Shell puts on in Nigeria substantially lower security standards than, otherwise, in the world commonly, the US scientist Richard Steiner accused the group in 2008: Only the rate of defects in the pipelines is higher "around a multiple than somewhere else." 
At a place which looks from a distance like a desolate, oil-smeared workshop under free sky, figures appear from the mangroves: They are stark naked and are oil-smeared up to the neck. 
Under one of many barrels which are to be put out partly with tubes linked, partly arbitrarily scattered on the area flickers a fire: an unlawful small refinery. 
In the barrel the crude oil about the fire is heated up during several hours, explains Michael, the boss of the group. 
First petrol penetrates by the pipes into the rallying pot, later kerosene and, finally, diesel trickles at the end of the management out. 
Thus Michael and four employees produce daily up to four barrels of diesels à 300 litres: "This introduces us 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars. 
The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel shortage in the biggest oil state of Black Africa. 
Nigeria disposes only of one single refinery. 
With just 40 euro-cents per litre ridiculously low diesel price the unlawful cookers can still underbid: Since they get her raw material free of charge. 
He comes from "Bunkerern" which tap the pipeline net straight through Ogoniland: In this manner at least 16 million litres of crude oil get lost to the country according to expert in the whole Niger delta daily. 
However, only a vanishing small part of the temporarily interstored raw material is improved illegally: The organised criminal networks to which also politicians and the high-ranking military should belong in tankers and verscherbeln him at the world market fill the lion's share. 
The activist Akpobari holds the debate whether the environmental disaster is owed rather to the machinations of the population or the lax production method for purely academic. 
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and had not destroyed them the life basis of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor theft and unlawful refineries." 
In the meantime, the relation of the Ogoni would be destroyed above all to Shell, however, so that only one deduction of the group would be possible: "Maybe other nationality turns out like the Chinese than better." 
Michael gives wird nervös. 
"The highest time that you disappear" says the athletic oil miller. 
"Every minute the soldiers can come." 
If the unlawful Ölveredler are got by the special unity of the armed forces, no arrest, probably, however, a painful bribe threatens them. 
Also the soldiers particularly coming from the land north want to profit - like all Nigerians - from the raw material. 
"This damned stuff has brought our country in every regard to the dog," says Akpobari.
