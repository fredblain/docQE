The USA changes the rules for the preservation of a visa 
The people must fancy before her conversation at the consulate at the service places to the visa application; costs will become waiting periods so shortened. 
From the 10th of January, 2011 the procedures change to the application of a visa in the message of the United States and in the consulates. 
With the new procedure most applicants must fancy before her conversation in the consulate at the service places to the visa application (ASC, the initial letters on English). 
The staff of the ASC takes up the biometrical data of the applicant which are checked by the consulate before the conversation. 
The new procedure has certain advantages for the candidates, count to it: 
The total expenses for the winding up of the visa sink, because it is not any more necessarily the appointment arrangement, the treatment of the visa application and the transport services with which the document is handed over to pay apart. 
The applicant makes only one single payment which covers three services. 
The present price remains unchanged: the Gegenwerit to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for time workers) and 390 dollars for Händer and investors. 
Those which only would like to extend her visa must carry on no conversation in the consulate, they must imagine only with nächstliegenden ASC where they present her documents and her fingerprints are taken. 
Because the biometrical data are caught up in the ASC, the applicants who need the second appointment for the conversation in the consulate remain there less time than earlier. 
Those which apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo must not pay the service impact of 26 dollars any more.
