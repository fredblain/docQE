Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it simply looks too slow 
Fernet, rum and vodka, exceptionally also sometimes a good whisky which one has stolen from the father from Liveable. 
These are the drinks after whose pleasure drunk Czech teenagers must become most often emergency-treated under fifteen. 
No exception are the children who must sleep off her cat repeatedly in the hospital. 
This arises from the experiences of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of the child departments of medical centres. 
"Beer or wine are complete out of fashion because it simply lasts too long, until one is got drunk." 
"The today's trend is unambiguously hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the head of department of the child department in the mittelböhmischen clinic of Hořovice. 
"Whisky if one succeeds in stealing a bottle from to the father Liveable and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka. 
"Vodka has the advantage that one can mix him with Juice, then he does not smell so strongly," explains the head of department. 
The speaker faculty hospital of Motol Eva Jurinová agrees with him. 
"Most often it is about Fernet or rum." 
"This is the today's alcohol trend, in particular in elementary schools." 
"Sporadically it was also about Slibowitz which one takes from home," Mrs. Jurinová stated. 
According to head of department Pelikán 13-year-old or 14-13-year-old alcoholics are no special appearance in the hospital admission long ago. 
Before the clinic in Hořovice on which he works since this year he was active during ten years in the Pädiatrie department of the hospital of Motol where the rescue cars delivered drunk pupils from Near and Far. 
"A girl had to be hospitalised four times." 
"Your career began them with 12 years when it was delivered the first time with 3.5 thousandths alcohol in the blood and on top of that to combination with "Extase"," the doctor described an especially heavy case. 
"She was in the exhibition area in getting š ovice on any dance party." 
"The interesting was present that it seemed to her mother not at all strangely that her daughter came 48 hours not home," the head of department is surprised. 
Just the missing interest of the parents or their unbelievable tolerance while pushing with own sprigs is valid as one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism of children. 
It is not about a real dependence in the true sense of the word according to expert with children. 
"A long-standing chronic dependence on the alcohol is to be understood by alcoholism with all phenomenon hanging together with it and this is with these children not the case." 
With those which enjoy repeatedly alcohol a negative informal-social background is typical mostly," explains head of department Pelikán. 
Of the speaker of the hospital of Motol, according to Mrs. Jurinová, were sent till the middle of November to approximately forty drunk children in the local department for paediatrics and youth medicine. 
However, only the cases with heavy alcohol poisoning which required a hospitalisation come into the statistics. 
The drunk children who are brought after ambulant treatment by the parents or if necessary by the police home are not registered. 
Except the cases in which children just such a bottle of schnapps in the school desk drink up there are according to opinion of Mr. Pelikán three seasonal amplitudes on which by hundred percent reliance is: Whale pure G sharp night, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year. 
"Last-named for two reasons - either from grief because of the bad report or from joy on the holidays." 
"At the whale pure G sharp night I have already experienced seven drunk children all at once in the admission," stresses doctor Pelikán. 
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off, as a child who has to fight the next day only with a disagreeable cat. 
One can expel the headaches in the morning afterwards which are due to the Dehydration and to the glucose lack, in the hospital because with a liquid-making a donation drip with glucose and nutrients which the organism lacks. 
"You are unequivocal better off, because after the "marvellous" experience in the evening, they wake with good mood, without somewhere something hurts." 
"You are only a little bit confused about where they are," doctor Pelikán puts away and he spoils every now and then at least thereby the good mood for the patients, while he enumerates them the costs which it will cost the treatment. 
Since the transport by the rescue car and the night in an acute accent bed come well and with pleasure on a few 1000 crowns. 
"Every now and then I have used as an aid to education if I have reckoned up directly for the children with the round what has cost her drunkenness and that it can absolutely happen that they must work sometimes the whole holidays to earn the money for one single such party," doctor Pelikán added. 
Nevertheless, according to his opinion the health insurance schemes do not reach for recourse procedure around which to the healing of the drunken children to necessary costs call in the parents.
