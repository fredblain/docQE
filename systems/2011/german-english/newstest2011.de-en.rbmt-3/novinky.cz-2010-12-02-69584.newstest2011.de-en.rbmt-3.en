A longer forefinger than ring finger means a lower risk to fall ill with cancer 
The men whose forefinger is long as the ring finger, are put out obviously to a lower risk to fall ill with cancer of the prostate. 
This is the astonishing result of a study which was published on Wednesday by the British journal of Cancer. 
This should hang up together because with the mirror of the male hormone testosterone. 
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as an easy test for the risk of cancer of the prostate and this in particular with men to sixty," explained the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor in the cancer research institute at the university in Warwick. 
The finger could help so to determine which men should absolutely undergo a cancer of the prostate test, above all if genetic risks or other risk factors exist, as for example informal health charges, added of Mrs. Eele. 
In the period of 1994-2009 she pursued with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with cancer of the prostate, at the same time, however, also 3000 healthy men. 
With more than half of the participants of the study the forefinger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger. 
The same likelyhood of cancer of the prostate was valid for these men, like for 19 percent of those men which ring and forefinger were equally long. 
Nevertheless, with men whose forefinger was longer than the ring finger this risk sank by 33 percent, with men to sixty even about 87 percent. 
The relation of the length of the both mentioned finger which already form at the pränatalen age reflects obviously the different mirrors of gender hormones to which the child was put out in the womb. 
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer forefinger. 
Former researches proved that just the testosterone accelerates the growth of cancer of the prostate. 
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticist and former chairperson of the academy of the sciences, said ČTK, to him this study would be known briefly, still he does not hold the relation between the finger length and the cancer risk up to now for "complete proved."
