Secret of complicated-shaken Canada ventilated 
The new, American diplomat's pipelines which were spread by WikiLeaks ventilate the secret about what the United Nations judge under the inferiority complex of the Canadians towards the Americans; however, they disclose the sense of superiority last-named towards Canada with the same blow. 
Consequently the American diplomats have surprised at the fact that the Canadian voter does not have the Canadian-American relations for the purposes of with the ballot, and they think that the visit of president Obama had helped the conservative government to put through her budget of 2009! 
Four new communications between the American message in Ottawa and Washington which were spread yesterday publicly offer even more piquant details than the bare substantial contents at which one has to nibble. 
A connection dating from the 22nd of September, 2008, i.e. in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage were located in the full way reports about that from which point the United Nations do not take part any more in the applications discussed by her political bosses. 
To the big astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador used in Ottawa. 
Mr. Wilkin offers different explanation possibilities of this situation. 
"An inferiority complex nearly being inherent in the Canadians arranges partly possibly the Canadian, political executives a lot rather to speak of internal issues of the everyday life, than leave holding the baby the United States by this choice (how in 1988 with the campaign about the free trade) ," so he describes. 
The United Nations, so he concludes, are therefore "proverbial Goliath of this choice: omnipräsent, but to speak potentially too menacingly, in order of him." 
The ambassador understands this "ear-deafening silence" the less, because both countries look after intensive political and economic relations. 
"Logically," so he values, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and still even more of a party chief for leading of such an essential respect which the voter has with the urn way as a key factor for the purposes of." 
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads in on the 22nd of January, 2009 from Terry Breese, representative in Ottawa, sent communication which president Barack Obama should prepare for his first visit in Ottawa. 
"Your trip will help to guarantee the continued existence of the government with the vote of confidence about the federal budget at the beginning of February with which Canada will announce his first deficit after more than one decade which has originated on account of a stimulation programme by the height of from 30 to 40 milliard dollars," describes Breese. 
He had nowhere mentioned that the government had had to adjourn the parliament meeting before Christmas to prevent that the parliament would be brought down by the coalition and would affect the so conditioned continued existence of the opposition parties the quality of the suggested stimulation programme. 
Next from January, 2008 dating and on the part of the ambassador Wilkin written communication informs Washington of the picture becoming more and more negatively that the dramatic series emitted about CBC of the United States spread. 
The ambassador is disturbed about broadcastings like Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O in which one can observe a little subtle allusions in Maher Arar, the "No Fly cunning" or also payments for the purpose from by musclemen of the CIA of carried out examinations. 
Again another communication reports in detail about how Hillary Clinten has asked with her French colleagues Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting for whether Europe is ready to take up certain prisoners from Guantanamo. 
Mr. Kouchner should have answered the question with, indeed, on the base of an individual "case to case" decision. 
Àm end of the meeting, in such a way described, "he has handed over to the state secretary a paper as regards Omar Khadr, to a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin." 
"The Assistant Secretary has accepted to look through the act once more." 
If we still mark, finally that the minds get hot concerning the web page WikiLeaks. 
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very closely standing adviser, had explained about CBC that for this massive leakage people responsible should be "killed." 
He had reported here on Mike Huckabee from the United States.
