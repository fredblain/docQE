World championship in 2018-2022: the organizer's country appoints the FIFA 
In bright excitement on the basis of corruption suspicion the executive committee of the FIFA on Thursday appoints the organizer's countries of the world championships in 2018 and 2022, an extremely political choice by which tussling about influence as well as the lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria in the background. 
Nevertheless, a thing is sure: the issue in 2018 of the king's discipline of the FIFA will take place in Europe, her traditional stronghold, (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain Portugal, Netherlands Belgium). 
Then the issue in 2022 will be a little more exotic; the international football association hopes to be able to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) for itself after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to follow up his establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea). 
The list of the personalities, to the delegation accompanying (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political application of a world championship. 
The machination behind the scenery threatens to stop up to the last minute. 
To put up difficultly otherwise, a hierarchy of the candidates. 
After the Evaluationsbericht of the FIFA, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts offer to bessseren arguments as those of her competitors. 
But these considerations will not be so weighty for 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees at the moment of the choice. 
The Sunday Times which stood with the causation of the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the exposures could have ruined as well the chances for her own country, cradle of the football, which might deliver only just once the world championship, namely in 1966. 
The BBC had given on Monday once more fertile soil, while it had emitted a documentary report which takes three high-powered members of the Kommitees, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under bombardment. 
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and to bring the English people responsible in embarrassment who had pursued an intensive lobbying, primarily, with David Cameron during these last weeks. 
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the manoeuvre successful by his predecessor Tony Blair which had achieved the organisation of the Olympic games 2012 in 2005 for London. 
Would this intensive application be enough to revalue the image of England before the Kommitee again? 
Nothing is sure less, because the duet Spain Portugal does not lack trumps with his already ready stadia, his expert's assessment (world championship 82 in Spain, Olympic games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and his football culture. 
However, the economic and financial shadow sides of both countries could damp her ambitions. 
The possible repressive measures against the Englishmen as well as the doubts about Solvenz of Spain and Portugal raise the chances of Russia which has become in spite of his gaps in the dossier (stadia, hotels, transport) the weighty outsider. 
Nevertheless, prime minister Vladimir Putin has decided, denounced the open indication of the imputation of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" on the part of the Kommiteemitglieder. 
"One pelts them with mud, one tries to compromise them," railed Putin. 
For 2022 the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, the logical favorites seem to be. 
The first economic world power, seat of the main sponsors FIFA, the country seems to show a long list of advantages towards Japan and South Korea which have put up separately a very nice project. 
However, these new candidatures seem too early for two countries which had coorganized the competitions in 2002. 
Another menace: the approval hotly desired by the FIFA of the world championship in 2026 for China which make the Asian chances of 2022 frail. 
With Australia and Qatar which had put out all the stops with the respects futuristic stadia her expansion pursues the FIFA in the direction of new areas, however, these both countries show a bigger risk, because certainty. 
Australia would be able just as Japan and South Korea under the weakness akquittierten from the European countries of the television rights (on account of the time movement) have to suffer, to the sensitive nerve of the FIFA.
