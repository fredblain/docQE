Dupont partly reprimanded 
The Quebecer broadcasting company presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered before the Canadian supervisory board for broadcasting company norms (CCNR) because of his controversial statements of social care and Haitian just as because of his abusive manner of speech on radio a partial setback. 
The CCNR represents the opinion, M. Though Dupont and his 98,1-FM team CHOI would have the right on own expression of opinion, indeed, certain statements would have contained "inexact information about the social care and unjustified negative representations of the Haitians as well as also a so coarse manner of speech which is not measured for the broadcastings emitted during the day." 
The supervisory board had also final-concluded that have committed a discussion about the suicide which contains the spreading of the names of two people the suicide, offends against the code of the broadcasting. 
The CCNR had received several discomfort concerning during in the period from 2008 and 2010 to emitted broadcastings to made comments. 
The first possession was inserted as a result of a complaint of "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec." 
The activist's organisation had complained that the amounts called in the broadcasting are inexact. 
The presenters should give rather solidly as delusive information. 
Concerning the subject Suicide presenter Stéphane Dupont had represented the opinion, the suicide is an expression of cowardice. 
The majority of the supervisory board members had drawn the conclusion, the provided message is, on this occasion, that suicide may not be looked as a solution by crises. 
"The majority of the supervisory board considers that the standing results of the broadcasting "Dupont le midi" would have broached a sensitive subject in suitable way appropriate for family." 
Hence, he was booked with no reprimand towards his person. 
The last contentious issue concerned the statements which had referred to the earthquake in Haiti. 
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a media-oriented quarrel conversation to themselves concerning this that an amount from reactions has caused. 
The CHOI presenter had declared not to have made a donation in favour of the Haiti help, because one would know not with certainty whether the destitute also received really the cash donations. 
The supervisory board is of the opinion that these comments have not been of abusive character that, nevertheless, her cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians. 
"I have already atoned for my 3-day suspension punishment in this thing." 
"My act is maiden for one and a half years," explained the presenter. 
In all decisions prangert the supervisory board the spreading of a coarse mode of expression in. 
In all cases CHOI FM of broadcasting company announcers has acted "beyond his obligations." 
The consequences for the radio station which should inform, among the rest, of his decisions unique during the prime time within a term of three days are slight.
