The demokatrische routine 
The democracy movement in Latin America becomes stronger, as well as the support of private enterprises. 
Criminal activity is a bigger problem than the unemployment. 
In many parts of the region the influence of Brazil is bigger than that of the United States. 
To these results came the Latinobarómetro survey which was carried out in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist. 
This survey is carried out since 1995 regularly and indicates thus the opinion change in this region. 
Two facts fall in this year's survey from September and October particularly in the eye. 
First the good mood in Latin America 
and secondly the growing interest in democracy and her most important institutions. 
In numerous countries on the South American Pacific coast the democratic movement has strongly increased (see. Table 1). 
In Peru, e.g., where the economy grows since 2002 yearly about approx. 6%, the number of the democracy advocates of 40% rose in 2005 on 61% this year. 
Also in Mexico where the economy recovers since the strong burglary last year again such a trend is to be recognised. 
However, only half of the interviewees in Mexico and Brazil, the countries richest in population of the region, are convinced democrats what lowers the regional average (see. Diagramme 2). 
Approx. 44% of the interviewees explained, that be contented they with the democratic practise of her country. This are so many like last year, however, 25% more than in 2001 (diagramme 3). 
About 34% trust the congress of her country and 45% of her government. Both values correspond to those of the last year, however, show a clear increase towards in 2003 (17% or 24%). 
Decade ago economic crises of Latin America undermined the efforts towards more democracy. 
This also continued during the worldwide economic crisis, is possibly due to the fact that the Latin American countries experienced only one short recession phase and have recovered fast again. 
In addition, the arms were caught by a stronger social net. 
(According to reports of the UN-economic commission for Latin America of this week the poverty rate rose in 2009 in Latin America only slightly and has liked this year again about 32%.) 
However, from country to country there are strong mood differences (see. Diagramme 4). 
Strong economy of Brazil and the popularity of the parting president Luiz Inácio Lula there Silva is reflected in a widespread progress thinking. 
In Mexico and Central America where the recession was stronger perceptible and violent crime have increased, this is less the case. 
Only for the second time since survey beginning many interviewees see a bigger problem than in the unemployment (see in Latin America in the criminal activity in her country. Diagramme 5). 
Approx. 31% state that either they themselves became or members of the family last year victims of a crime. However, compared with 38% last year the values have sunk and reach therefore the lowest state since 1995. 
The rising economic achievement is reflected in the stronger support of the private sector and the market economy: approx. 71% of the interviewees gave national that the private sector is indispensable for the development, in 2007 there were 56% (see. Diagramme 6). 
Approx. 58% explained that only the market economy can bring to her country progress, compared to 47% last year. 
Interestingly 62% of the interviewees in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although her left president, Hugo Chávez, many private enterprises nationalises. 
Brazil has according to 19% of the interviewees (18% last year) the biggest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, consistently since the last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year). 
However, the interviewees in Mexico and most countries of Central America see the most high-powered country in the USA and this role is taken over in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
