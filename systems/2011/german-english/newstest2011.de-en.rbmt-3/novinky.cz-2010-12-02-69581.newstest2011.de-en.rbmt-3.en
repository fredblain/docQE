The residential costs of the households rise by some Hundred monthly 
The households must count from January not only on higher costs for all energy kinds, but also with higher water fees and sewage fees and for district heating and in some places also there grow the rents. 
Families will have to pull thus from January several hundred crowns monthly more from the purse than up to now. 
Stream becomes to at cost of 4.6 percent, one will have to pay gas about 2 percent and more, in some towns up to a tenth more for water deliveries and in some places the district heating deliveries also raise the price of. 
Only the stream price increase costs the flat households yearly to some hundred crowns more. 
Besides, the strong stream prices were lowered by all main suppliers, the clear support of the stream production from renewable springs, in particular from Fotovoltaikanlagen is responsible. 
Though gas will have only moderately more expensive, this, however, exactly when the people must heat mostly and the highest consumption. 
Also here is to be calculated on some hundred crowns more per year. 
While stream and gas become more expensive in completely Czechia, the prices of district heating of town to town have passed away. 
Above all of bigger places to level price increases. 
Thus, for example, the households must pay in Pardubice and Hradec Králové from January for district heating monthly up to 50 crowns more, more than 1000 crowns more per year pay families in Liberec. 
9 percent higher water fees and sewage fees and this threaten the inhabitants of Prague again for the case that the town raises the infrastructure rent. 
If the rent does not change, there are only 6.8 percent. 
The price in Prague belongs in comparison to completely Czechia, nevertheless, also furthermore to the lowest ones. 
In the north Bohemian where the prices belong by now to the highest ones water fees and sewage fees should rise by 7.4 percent. 
Huge rent price increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 flats, with which from January the so-called. Rent regulation is lost. 
Thus plans, for example, the flat enterprise CPI Byty which owns 2500 flats in Ú stí nad Labem to raise the rents from January immediately by hundred percent. 
Who does not agree with this rent rise, those wants to prosecute the enterprise judicially. 
The adjusted rents which one pays even today in roughly 300,000 flats might rise the next year about more than 10 percent.
