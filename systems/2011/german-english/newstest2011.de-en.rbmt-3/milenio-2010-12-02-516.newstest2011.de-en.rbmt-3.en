Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had determining plays, and up to now he has kept himself good, which is why this opportunity of quite special importance for him is. 
The Argentine has himself with the medallion to the second champion hochgespielt, he has stayed behind 1 step behind the winners and surprisingly he has delivered with the same team of successive finals. 
The santistische strategist reached the first final as a trainer with the 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when del Morelia had the reins in the hand with which he got to know against Toluca with a big defeat 4-2; later, with the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the determining duel which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados. 
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010' with whom they played Diablos against lot Rubén had to pocket a setback again, because the play with went out 2-2 against lot Choriceros after 210 play minutes undecided, but with the 11 metre he made progress with 3-1 and got two possibilities to pocket his title, but, in the end, three his players missed eleven steps and the play turned to 4-3. 
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his big rival. Therefore, he would not like to be pursued once again by the misfortune and escape from the bad magic to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he confirms that for him the most important is the play itself. 
"I would like to become a champion, I would like to break no statistics, this is for a club, for my affection to which I dedicate myself, and, therefore, the title will come to me, but what happens before, is the most important," commented the coxswain when one questions him about the lost finals. 
The last final has still strongly been remembered to him, has assured he to have learnt a lot from it: "The only apprenticeship which we can pull from it is that to the referee the end does not whistle, we cannot celebrate, we in the line are prepared, the players also, because the last spot we were prepared with two 11 metres already to retire, and I think that this is an apprenticeship, until the play is not finished, there is no occasion for the celebration." 
To know that this series could be decided by penalty shoot-out, does not disturb him, because he trusts his players: "One never wants to come with the penalty shoot-out, one would like to conclude in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is no alternative and one must be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, unfortunately, the destiny prepared for us a bad play, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the violent aspiration to hold the title already in the hands this something left us for this final, and we hope that it will not come this spot in addition." 
There lies in Romanso power not to be the only second champion any more and to cost for the first time the fame which the titles with themselves bring.
