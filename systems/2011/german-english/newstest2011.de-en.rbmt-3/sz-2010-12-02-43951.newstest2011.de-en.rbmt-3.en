Puzzling earthworks 
The nuclear energy authority IAEA has new tips to a confidential nuclear programme in Syria. 
However, the country defends itself to take stand on it - still it admits controls. 
About midnight of 5. on 6th of September, 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 attack I fighter aircraft a mysterious, cubic building in Syria. 
It stands on the shore of the Euphrates; the next bigger town, 30 kilometres away, is Dair as-Saur. 
Their name appears in documents of the International nuclear energy authority (IAEA) if it is about the reactor which Syria has built supposedly with the help of from North Korea in the ashlar, hides in a valley which goes off from the stream. 
According to a briefing of the US-foreign Secret Service CIA from end of April, 2008 familiar reactor would have well been likely also under the name of the close place el-Kibar to generate plutonium - from which nuclear weapons can be built. 
For other purposes against it the technology from the Fünfzigern is hardly good. 
The CIA led a videopresentation before with blurred satellite pictures. 
By computer animation she faded in where which components of the reactor should have been before the destruction which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the nuclear centre of Yongbyon. 
Besides, she presented the photos which show the building at close range or even the interior. 
The reactor has stood shortly before the introduction, one said, but not yet with fuel sticks been equipped. 
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, is hardly known more than at that time, the riddles became rather bigger with the time. 
The former US-president George W. Bush has revealed recently in his memoirs that the CIA was sure before the attack though surely that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly saw clues for the fact that there was "an active nuclear weapon programme" in the country. 
Some secret service workers in Europe are rather even more careful there and speak only of a "supposed reactor," even if they hold the CIA presentation for "plausible." 
You lack hard proofs, just as the IAEA. 
Asked, how sure he is to have a reactor before himself, a high UN diplomat answered in summer only tersely, the IAEA has "enough material to put questions." 
The Syrians put aside the rubble of the supposed "unused military building" though in a great hurry and levelled the area thoroughly. 
An IAEA team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar still found in June, 2008 tracks of the uranium which had been produced by people. 
Besides, the IAEA about a member state received satellite pictures of commercial suppliers from the time directly after the attack who might be more expressive than those of the CIA presented arms. 
Indeed, these admissions at the market are not to be got because the unknown principal - maybe Israel - has bought them exclusively. 
Hence, the IAEA cannot verify her genuineness independently. 
Syria has always protested, has never pursued a confidential nuclear programme or a reactor to have built. 
The uranium comes from the Israeli weapons, explained Damascus. 
However, this rejected the IAEA according to the analysis of the particle as unlikely. 
Since that time there refuses Damascus to discuss this - just as about the satellite pictures. 
Besides, it keeps the controllers the second inspection in el-Kibar and the access to the remains of the bombed building. 
But also Israel is quiet iron. 
"We will never comment on this," premier Ehud Olmert being in office at the moment of the attack confirmed recently the official position. 
Thus the investigation of the case drags on since June, 2008 unsuccessfully and "develops increasingly to a serious credibility problem for the authority" as a high western diplomat in the seat of the IAEA concedes in Vienna - finally, a heavy offence against the Non-Proliferation Treaty stands in the space over which the IAEA watches. 
As a key to progress with the clarification the IAEA apparently sees three other facilities which should stand "in functional connection" with the supposed reactor - and differently than this still exist. 
Besides, the inspectors have neither disclosed up to now which arrangements it concerns, nor which function they have or what she demonstrates suspicious. 
According to the information of Süddeutsche Zeitung they are called in the IAEA inside Marj ace sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, are derived again from nearby towns. 
The independent institutes for Science and Internationally Security in Washington (Isis) have identified these places and in satellite pictures have found a complex of buildings with Masyaf with which it concerns most probably one of the suspicious objects. 
It is possibly in or immediately beside a military base - exactly with these grounds Syria of the IAEA keeps the access to three places. 
In Vienna one says, the Syrians feared fishing expedition - that the IAEA of the USA is sent forward to spy out military arrangements. 
Since the nuclear detectives had become attentive by a tip of the US Secret Services to the facilities. 
The IAEA has tips, under it satellite photos that between three places and the ashlar on the Euphrates material became there and hertransportiert. 
A high western diplomat in Vienna said, at least one of the arrangements could stand "in connection with the fuel production." 
However, there are "no tips to sensitive activities," so uranium enrichment or reworking; the processes which are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons. 
Though the reactor type is pursued with uranium which is not fortified. 
However, where the uranium should have come and where from it later the plutonium should be separated for the bomb, to these central questions there is at most plausible supposition. 
It is unclear also, whether the remains which could rescue valuable tracks in which to three places were stored. 
As if the hundreds of truck loads from the surface of the earth had disappeared, nobody wants to have information about where the rubble has remained. 
The only few kilometres of el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates the situated salt mine al-Tibni which has examined Syria in 1998 for her suitability as a camp for radioactive garbage is valid for the IAEA as unlikely. 
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had associated them recently in an analysis of satellite pictures for the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor. 
However, admissions from the orbit show that Syria carried out earthworks at three suspicious places and removed big containers, after the IAEA had required access. 
This can be a chance, however, has served hardly to clear the suspicion. 
Besides, one says in diplomat's circles, the IAEA has used several months ago to develop there a plan for inspections which should allow to Syria to protect any military secrets - only the expenditure points, how big the interest of the inspectors is. 
Meanwhile, Damascus also ironed this proposal from. 
If western diplomats had appeased in Vienna still one year ago, the reactor would be destroyed, hence, the thing has no high urgency, possibly US ambassador Glyn Davies brings since a few months of so-called special inspections into the play, one of the most sharp means which has the Viennese nuclear authority to put through controls. 
Though IAEA boss Yukiya Amano who would have to suggest these inspections already has from an "option for which I am open in the future" spoken, still, however, he hesitates. 
A high risk lies in this way: On the one hand, it needs for it a majority in the governor's advice of the IAEA, and several of 35 countries represented there are anything but keen on an escalation. 
On the other hand how a diplomat points out: "What is if they find at the end nothing at all?"
