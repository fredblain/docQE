Amazon sperrt Server - Drohungen gegen Assange 
Wikileaks gets increasingly in distress. 
The Internet service provider Amazon has exiled the exposure platform of his servers. 
Political pressure after the publication possibly puts behind it 100 thousand mark note of confidential diplomat's telegrammes. 
Wikileaks founder Assange stays supposedly in England. 
The exposure platform Wikileaks comes under fire in the United States stronger and stronger. 
The Internet activists lost the access to her present American server and now search an Internet native country in Europe. 
The prominent American senator Joe Lieberman called meanwhile other countries and enterprises for the boycott of Wikileaks. 
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange who stands on the search lists of Interpol should stay according to a newspaper report in Great Britain. 
"Wikileaks of Amazon server edges out." 
"Free speech in the country of the open air," informed the exposure activists by news in brief service Twitter on Wednesday (local time). 
Shortly before the Internet enterprise of Amazon had exiled the Wikileaks documents of his servers. 
The Internet activists had fallen back by the publication of the confidential diplomatic telegrammes on the Amazon web service (AWS) to be able to master the high access figures on the documents. 
By Twitter Wikileaks explained to the step further: "Excellently - now our dollars are given to occupy people in Europe." 
If Amazon has such problem with the freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books." 
Amazon has stopped the use of his servers by Wikileaks, after employees of senator Joe Lieberman would have made inquiries, reported the television broadcasting station CNN with reference to the office of Liebermans. 
The chairperson of the senate committee for home protection had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian." 
"I would have wished that Amazon this measure earlier seizes in view of the previous publications of classed information by Wikileaks," said the senator. 
Lieberman appealed meanwhile for keeping the use to servers the platform also in other countries. 
"Wikileaks' unlawful, prodigious and thoughtless action risks our national security and endangers life all around the globe," were called it in a communication of the independent senator. 
"No responsible enterprise - whether in American manner or foreign - Wikileaks should help in his efforts to spread stolen material." 
The Wikileaks founder Assange who is searched because of rape suspicion by the authorities in Sweden stands on the search list of Interpol. 
According to a report of the London newspaper "The Independent" the 39-year-old Australian stays in Great Britain, the exact place would be known Scotland yard. 
The Internet activist has called the inquiries in Sweden always intrigue of his opponents. 
Wikileaks speaker Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London, there have been threats. 
"There were even calls after a murder of Julian Assange." 
Therefore, Assange fears rightly around his security, said Hrafnsson. 
Therefore, the Wikileaks founder will keep himself further hidden. 
Hrafnsson reacted obviously to statements from North America. 
In America the former republican governor had demanded of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, that the person responsible should be accused for the Wikileaks exposures of betrayal and be executed. 
In Canada said an adviser of head of government Stephen Harper - obviously ironically - on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could use "a drone." 
Between the White House and Assange an exchange broke out meanwhile. 
The speaker of the American president Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, it called "ridiculously and absurdly" that Assange had demanded the resignation of foreign minister Hillary Clinton, if she is responsible for recently known spy requests to diplomat. 
"I am not quite sure, why we look after the opinion of a type with a web page," according to Gibbs. 
"Our foreign affairs and the interests of this country are far significant as his one web page." 
Now the American government puts the protection of her data banks extensively on the test bench. 
As a special representative the vice manager of the centre for anti-terror measures, Russell Travers, has been appointed, the White House informed. 
Travers is responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" which have become necessary after the disclosure of the message reports by Wikileaks. 
The White House also wants to check up the ways as the whole government exchanges information and protects. 
Besides, the American government announced to want to provide for the security of dissidents and most active, they should get by the Wikileaks publication in danger. 
"We have undertaken everything to step with them in contact," said Ministry of Foreign Affaires speaker Philip Crowley. 
"We are ready to protect them if this should become necessary."
