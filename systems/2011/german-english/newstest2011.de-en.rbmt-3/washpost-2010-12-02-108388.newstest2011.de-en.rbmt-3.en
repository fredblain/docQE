Trickled through US document portrays Moscow as a harbour of the corruption 
The control of the town lies in the hands of the "Kleptokratie" and she transmits a part of the bribes and the protection money which she collects, to the Kremlin. Thus the American message reported in February in Russia in a memo. 
Police as well as the state security service blackmail high protection money, so that they can hold her expensive standard of living in Moscow, one says. 
They collect money not only from legitimised shops, but also from organised criminal gangs. 
Every layer of the bureaucracy - what has called prime minister Vladimir Putin "vertical of the authority" - takes his part of the money which walks the leaders upwards. 
The memo which was sent under the name of the ambassador John Beyrle to Washington was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage. 
The memo is based on springs whose names were edited. 
It was written, while Yuri Luzhkov was still a mayor of Moscow, and it accuses him of the corruption. 
He was fired in October by president Dmitry Medvedev, however, there is no proof of the fact that would have been cleared up in the interim. 
Luzhkov and his woman, Yelena Baturina who owns a known construction company have rejected for years corruption reproaches over and over again, and he has won numerous actions for slander against such accusations. 
In September he explained to a Russian television broadcasting station when he was asked for a documentation which suggests, he is corrupt: "It is crazy, it is filthy, it is dirty." 
> Think an incredibly big number in Russian that her society is corrupt. Surveys have proved this. 
But it is unusual that, happen how in the report of the ambassador, single people are called, and it is unheard that this happens by a diplomat of a foreign country. 
"The direct connection of the government of Moscow with the criminal activity has led to the fact that some they call "disturbed" and come to the end that the government acts rather like a Kleptokrat than a government," according to the memo. 
"Criminal elements enjoy "kryshna" (a concept from the world of the criminals / of the mafia, what word for word "roof" or protection meant) which as applies about the police, the state security (FSB), the official supervisory authority (MVD) and the office of the public prosecutor as by the whole Moscow government bureaucracy. 
Experts have discovered a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow. 
"Luzhkov stands at the uppermost place." 
"FSB, MVD and the militia stand on the second step." 
"Last follow the common criminals and the criminal inspectors on the lowest step." 
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the town offers no help." 
The report repeats that the money FSB of the biggest companies takes the money and arrests the businessmen small the police. 
A spring, so is called is, "explained that storekeepers of Moscow understand that it is the best to get the protection of the MVD and FSB (and not from the organised crime), because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law." 
"That's why the protection is not as asked by criminal way any more as earlier." 
The memo notes that, while the collecting of the money is comprehensive, the protection even very much give his nobody; even those who pay are sometimes arrested. 
Which do not pay find her business very fast closed - on account of the one or other pretext. 
Medvedev has spoken several times of fighting against the corruption, however, has marked at the same time that he has made only little progress. 
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go with with suitcases which presumably were fully with money to the Kremlin. 
"In his fight against the corruption Medvedev must count on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, manager from While, a Moscow expert's commission, recently during an interview. 
"But it is a part of this bureaucracy." 
"It is no part of the political class because a political class does not exist in Russia any more." 
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of the powers, so he says, corruption is unavoidable. 
Nationally, so estimates While, the corruption costs Russia more than 300$ of milliards per year. 
The country ranks on place 154 of a newer investigation for the global perception of the corruption by the non-state organisation of Transparence Internationally (countries are performed from "in least corrupt" "too mostly corrupt"). 
The exposure of the memo of the American message which happened after Moscow time late-in the evening will release with certainty displeasure within the Russian government, although, there Luzhkov can be accused for the mistakes of Moscow, it for the Kremlin also a possibility can be to state that one solves the problems. 
During an interview with Larry King for CNN Putin stated that the WikiLeaks documents a forgery could be and reacted furiously to the exposure that American diplomats have called him Batman and Medvedev Robin. 
"The truth is that it is about our interaction which is an important factor of the domestic policy in this country," he said. 
"But to be honest, we would wear not expected that this would happen with such an arrogance, with such a pressure and so unethical way, you know."
