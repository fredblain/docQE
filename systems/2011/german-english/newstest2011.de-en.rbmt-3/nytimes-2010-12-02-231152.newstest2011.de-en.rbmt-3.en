Police applications in China become gentler 
Like an education officer there walked seaweed Shenbin about an urban place, checked his nervous subordinates and gave, besides, with military Authorität and subdued voice orders. 
He wanted, that his female members of the Chengguan - to robust guards of China of the urban order, dreaded and despised for her arbitrary raids and her slope to the power - which spectators impress. 
"Just stand!" 
"Look straight ahead!" 
"Points them," he whispered to them, "as pretty girls are so!" 
Four girls, hardly to the teenager's age grow out, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and trousers stood to attention. 
Four pairs of black pumps stood in straight row. 
Four well-arranged hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white touched loops. 
"For me they look on an average," notes Mr. Tang contemptuous. 
"Models are pretty." 
Several governments have already tried to polish up the image of town inspectors of China. 
In a town all new applicants must have a Master's certificate. 
The province Guangdong introduced a radiant blue uniform instead of the grey-green. 
Wuhan in middle China substituted power by down stiff: In 2009 according to circled reports 50 officials a not properly put up snack carriage and stared at the operator, until this packed after half an hour and left the place. 
Xindu, a town district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, would like to change the image basically. 
Since 2003 13 women strengthen the urban police stripes. They were selected special on account of her appearance, her good figure and her youth. 
They should lend a softer, feminine aspect to the coarse police. 
However, unfortunately, it would hardly also succeed Scarlett Johansson to improve the bad picture which the Chinese of these town commands have. 
Rightly, according to the critics. 
Differently than the police the urban laws may put through this official only help of penalties or other administrative punishments. 
However, the Chinese media show as a matter of routine another picture. 
In January, 2008 officials beat a spectator to death in the province of Hubei when this she filmed with his mobile phone with how they knocked down a protest action against a garbage waste dump. 
Last year a training manual of the Peking officials was stolen and published on the Internet. In it it is described how delinquents can be beaten up without bloodshed. 
This year a Shanghai water melon trader suffered after a brawl with five employed cerebral injuries. 
A video game being full before power that from the Internet can be downloaded shows qualified officials in an attack at street vendor in China. 
"Chengguan makes fear to the government," the national newspaper China Daily moaned last year, after other controversies with regard to the tactics. 
The newspaper required a "really thorough purge." 
Sceptics find the current beginning clearly insufficient. 
When of the Distrik in October by announcement searched eight female recruits, an Editorial in the Beijing Evening put the question to news whether the women had real duties or should serve only as an optical distraction. 
Probably both. 
According to place announcement women were searched at the age of from 18 to 22 with good figure and "to harmonious features." 
They should be big exceptionally - more than 1.5 m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches. 
The employment ends with achievement of the 26th year. 
According to the officials the activity is physically too strenuous for women more than 25. 
"The most important one is her image," bragged an unnamed district official with the virtually government web page Rednet.com. 
"Whether the nominees get the job, depends first on her external appearance, like size, weight, features, etc." 
Then come temperament and "internal qualities." 
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said and added, "nevertheless, in addition, they still have other duties." 
Zheng Lihua, acting leader of the city administration of the district, would not like to agree with this description, 
however, admitted that in China dimensions default is not unusual in place announcements for beiderlei gender. 
The same is valid for steady features. 
Whether is to be equated with good appearance, is argumentative in China. 
But people with impediments or physical distortions do not need to apply. 
"We can use here, unfortunately, no lame or hunchbacks," according to Mr. Zheng. 
"Your image would not feel well." 
Liu Yi, on the place Baoguang near of a cloister patroliert, is 22, has little apple forecastle and a well-shaped mouth. 
They empfindetes not as sexist that so big value is laid on her appearance. 
"Do you find, I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with ironic look. 
Their colleague with the dimples, the 21-year-old Xu yang, comments, "We have the job to represent the image of the town." 
According to your information they do not regret the short setting, because they would have more ambitious career plans, than to shoo away just trader through the lanes to hinder them in the Geschäftemachen. 
Every morning the patrol deals with approx. twelve street vendors who try to sell many bread rolls and Tofugerichte on foot or on the bicycle possibly, before they are chased away. 
"Mr. Wang, disappear here please." 
"We have said you already so often!" explains Frl. Xu to a trader who had fled on foot and had let down, besides, his noodle kitchen fastened on a bicycle cart temporarily. 
According to the officers the activity is rather monotonously as strenuous. 
"It is almost every day the same," explains Huang Jing, 20 which studies distribution being in the spare time. 
"Alles Routine." 
A reason for the fact is that the female officials may confiscate the goods of the traders not, like her male colleagues. 
They can threaten delinquents only to announce them to her male superiors. 
This should protect them against public hostility to which officials are often put out in China. 
This year rioted hundreds of inhabitants from Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, after the rumour circulated, Chengguan official would have killed a trader. 
More than one dozen policemen and Chenguan official were injured in the night incident, 14 government vehicles were upset or set on fire. 
Xindu remained up to now spared from such excesses of violence. 
However, riots are not to be excluded. 
Only two blocks removes from the quiet place Baonguang, in that the female officials in this morning patroulierten, more than 50 people assembled on a street corner. 
Employ had confiscated a motorcycle which was repaired against the regulations on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop. 
The owner screamed blue murder. 
After 15-minute hesitation the officials with fierce face made a way the way to her vehicles and continued by the motorcycle and his owner. 
Li Xuedong, 40, a co-ordinator of the male patrol, stayed behind. Besides, he turned his white nameplate to remain anonymous. 
Like her colleagues the co-ordinators - men play more than 40 - a purely supporting role. 
However, they were not trained to present a clean image. 
"Sometimes we go forward verbally." 
"Sometimes, however, also physically," explains Mr. Li soberly. 
"The people start most time with the quarrel."
