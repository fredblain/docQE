American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon." 
The American troops have used in Afghanistan for the first time a new "intelligent" weapon which is known up to now only under her code name XM-25. 
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon influences the conflict there with the Taliban and shifts the relative strength in your favour. 
The new weapon is such a thing, how a superexact cannon. 
Their projectiles are steered because by laser with an accuracy of only some metres in the aim. 
The special floors of caliber 25 mm which were developed for this gun and contain highly explosive explosive function practically like small shells. 
The floors can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only with the impact on the aim, but in any point of her ballistic flight path. 
That is one can use them against an enemy who is hidden behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench. 
From above he is not protected because normally, from above the murderous steel grit rain can put him easily except battle. 
According to Richard Audett who took part in the development XM-25, the new fight gun is the first infantry weapon which makes "intelligent" technologies on benefit to itself. 
"The soldier goes forward basically thus: he visiert the aim in and sends out a laser beam which determines the distance, he wins an exact visor point after which he corrects the angle of elevation, then he only needs to fire. 
"If We say sometimes, one has measured 543 m." 
"If one fires, the weapon is charged and shoots the floor on the distance 543 metres plus minus one, two or three metres.
