An opinion poll which clears up with senseless regulations 
The opinion poll around the "absurdity of the year" is for the fourth time a part of the enterpriser's competition. 
Some senseless regulations one already succeeded in creating from the world. 
To the dubious winner of the next year of the opinion poll "absurdity of the year" rose the duty to create documents on authorities, the on-line are available. 
Thus decided more than one third of not completely 4000 vocal-delivering enterprisers. 
Thus the social security management required a paper extract from the commercial register, even if him the official could have called away by two mouse clicks. 
Now thanks to the opinion poll this changes. 
"The Czech social security management will require in future with controls of social security payers no extracts from the commercial register more," the speaker of ÈSSZ Jana Buraňová stated. 
Sense and the purpose of the opinion poll "absurdity of the year" is to take all regulations and orders under the magnifying glass which enterprisers have to fulfil in Czechia and the senseless ones to lift. 
This is this year already for the fourth time a part of an enterpriser's competition, from tsch. Economic newspaper (HN) is organised and to itself in public of growing popularity pleased. 
If took part last year in 3000 people in the vote, these were this year already 4000. 
There is no miracle, because still an amount of legal duties which serve solely to hinder the enterprise activity. 
"What concerns, for example, the number of the income tax forms, we take a front rank in the world," notes Karel Havlíček of the union of small and medium constant enterprises and businessmen of Czech Republic. 
The simplification of the enterprise activity is the proclaimed aim of all governments during the last years. 
However, in comparison to the world the situation has hardly made amends in Czechia. 
In accordance with the world bank Czechia takes the 74th rank, in comparison to the year before an order worse about eight places concerning the enterprise terms. 
The competition absurdity of the year was exclaimed for the first time in the year and happens every year after the same scenario. 
Each can announce from April up to the time of going to press of the competition at the end of September administrative and bureaucratic nonsense. 
The web address www.firmaroku.cz serves for the registration. Then the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-price" and puts to the vote the public the Internet on the web pages www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz. 
There wins that absurdity which gets most voices. 
To this year's opinion poll 105 pointless regulations and orders were announced already more than hundred, more exactly said. 
The tips come not only from enterprisers, but also from professional organisations and journalists. 
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are so, for example, also regulations that maintenance vehicles have to pay toll for highways and motorways or that enterprisers with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must prepare all two years. 
The list of this year's "seven" is published on the sides of the competition. 
The proclamation of the competition in each case at the beginning of November on the Prague place Wenzels is a part of a happening in which regularly also personalities of the political and public life take part. 
This year were, for example, Eva Svobodová, the manager of the association of small or medium constant enterprises and businessmen of the Tsch. Republic as well as Petr Ku ž el, the president of the chamber of commerce of the Tsch. Republic with the climax of the competition with from the part. 
"Where the state throws to the enterprisers bat between the legs, there can be no real economic impetus, therefore, it is my aim to lift at least thirty sections every year which still complicate needlessly her enterprises today to the enterprisers," informed Martin Kocourek, the minister for industry and trade. 
The efforts to create senseless orders from the world show effect. 
In 2007 disturbed the people mostly the enterprisers imposed duty to have to announce the intention to the trade office at the place of her constant company site three days in advance, to want to go with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or fair. 
This duty was lifted by virtue of a novella of the trade law. 
The duty which received in 2007 the second largest number of the voices - to have to announce the duty, to the labour office to official journeys of employees in the extent up to 30 days - became by the law about them "green map" abolished sucked. 
And - all good things three are: 
The absurdity of 2009 was chosen the order which imposed it on physiotherapists, in the speech room a mirror, a fridge and two personal scales are to have. 
This order was somewhat reduced by the health ministry this year - the fridge duty was lost.
