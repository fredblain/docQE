Revengeful hackers and industrious spies 
A double meaning has the Affaire WikiLeaks. 
On a side she has turned out evident scandal, a scandal which is only one scandal in the Sinner false holiness which governs the Beziehunge between the states, the citizens and the press. 
On the other side she announces radical changes at international level, and gives a foretaste on the future dominated by regression. 
However, we go forward after the row. 
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every act provided by a Secret Service (x any nation) consists exclusively of press clippings. 
The "extraordinary," American exposures about the sexual habits of Berlusconi throw down nothing else as what one got to read about months away anyhow in every x any journal (except those whose owner Berlusconi is), and the alarmingly karikaturierte profile Gaddafis offered material for her sketches to cabaret artists already since long time. 
The rule according to which the confidential dossiers may exist only of already known news is essential for the dynamism of the Secret Services, and not only this century. 
If you go to a library which devotes itself to esotherischen publications, you will recognise that every work (about the Sangraal, the mystery of running Running Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosenkreuzler) repeats precisely this what was already written in previous works. 
This comes along not only that, hence, still the author of occult texts wants to publish no searches (that he not knew where news about the non-existed would be to be found), but because those which devote themselves to the occultism believe in nothing differently than this what they already know and confirms what they have already learnt. 
This is also the successful mechanism of Dan Brown. 
Also of the confidential acts. 
The informant is decayed, and decayed (or limited mind) is also the boss of the Secret Service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example, the editor with Lib√©ration) who judges only as true what he recognises. 
The Top-Secret information about Berlusconi which the American message in Rome had sent to the state department were the same like those, the Newsweek already the week before had published. 
Why was made of such a fuss around the exposures of these dossiers? 
On a side these mean what every educated person already knows, namely that the messages - can call the heads of government to themselves at least since end of the second world war and since also mutually or can take an airplane to meet to the dinner - have lost her diplomatic function and have changed, with the exception of some small representation duties, into spy centres. 
Every any spectator of inquiry films knows this very exactly, and it does not happen from false holiness that one does in such a way to ignore this. 
Still: the fact to repeat publicly it, the job of the false holiness injures and serves to put the American diplomacy in a bad light. 
Secondly: The idea that x more arbitrarily hacker can tap the most confidential secrets of the mightiest country of the world rescues the considerable blow against the prestige of the state department. 
Besides, the scandal makes less the sacrifices, than rather the "sharp judges" in distress. 
However, we devote ourselves to the profound nature of that what has happened. 
Formerly, at Orwell's times, one could bundle up all power like a Big Brother which controlled every gesture of his subjects. 
Orwell's prophecy could have turned out since then as completely right where one can control every movement thanks to the phone, every effected transaction, the visited hotel, the elective highway et cetera; the citizen would become the complete victim of the eye of the power. 
If, however, one makes clear himself what runs off today that even the confidential crypts of the power any more cannot escape from the control of a hacker, the controlling way stops being directed unilaterally and becomes circle-shaped. 
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - selectedly as an avenger of the citizen - can bring the secrets of the power in experience. 
How can a power keep, however which is not able any more to protect her own secrets? 
It is right, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can be never revealed); it is also true that every knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkels is basically a secret freely from Geheimis, because it reveals the public sphere; but to disclose in the style of WikiLeaks that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, indicates to rob them of any power. 
WikiLeaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, against it, however, Clinton and Obama. 
What will be the consequences of this insult which was added to such an immense power? 
It is evident that the states will put in future no reserved information to more on-line - this would amount to a notice stuck on on the street corner. 
But it is as evident that it is in vain with the topical technologies to hope, to be able to keep secret confidential reports on phone. 
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of state has moved in an airplane and has contacted one of his colleagues. 
How could certain relations be maintained in future private and only for certain ears? 
I know very well that my prediction sounds at the moment after science fiction and novelistic, but I feel forced to fancy myself the government agents, to itself in confidential way busily on uncontrollable march routes motively, her communications nowhere differently than in the bare memory with weight-bearing, and, in addition, few written information which they have got, in the shoe heel hiding. 
The information would be stored in the only copy in close drawers: basically the spy attempt of Watergate had to register less success, than WikiLeaks. 
I had to write the opportunity that the technology progresses nowadays like a cancer, namely backward. 
One century after the wireless telegraph the communication had revolutionised, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire. 
The (analogous) video tapes had enabled to the film researchers to explore a film Tape for tape, while one could reel from the back forwards and ventilate all secrets of the assembly, while the (numerical) CDs allow nowadays nothing else, than to jump from chapter to chapter, so in macroservings. 
By the high-speed trains one goes within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this requires by airplane including the Umsteigens 3,5 hours. 
Hence, it is not unusual that politics and communication technology come back to car and horse. 
The last observation. 
In former times the press tried to understand what were forged for secrets between the messages. 
Presently these are the messages who demand confidential information of the press.
