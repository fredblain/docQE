The chairman of the board of owls contest at the request of his children the companion's meeting of Vega Sicilia 
The storm during the open conflict of the family Á lvarez, owners of the societies owls and El Enebro, flaut not from. 
David Á lvarez, founder of the Unternehmensgurppe, will contest the companion's meeting of El Enebro which will take place at the request of five of his seven children in 16., because he holds them for "absolutely trifling." His children will try to receive a majority to control the administrative organs of the company - owner of the vineyard Bodegas Vega Sicilia-. 
The juridical measures prepare David Á lvarez and his children Jesús David and María José for a new justice chapter in her quarrel around the control of a part of the enterprise group. 
The founder of the biggest holding companies for enterprise services does not seem to be ready to give way in his lawsuit around the control of the organs of El Enebro. 
From the administrative council he became of five of his seven children herausgetrieben. These appointed themselves on the stockholder meeting from the 18th of January of this year which is put down in the commercial register already as contested, to administrative council members. 
The companion's meeting of El Enebro which was called up by the judge of the commercial court number 2 of Madrid for 16. has released a new thunderclap in the lap of the family Á lvarez. 
The invocation of the judge to the setting of the meeting is the only juridical way which guarantees the conscription of the companion's meeting. 
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Á lvarez Mezquiriz is laid out by David Á lvarez as "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to let recognise by means of juridical astuteness, to deceitful machination and legal abuse for trifling explained meeting from the 18th of January" as official speakers explain. 
This argumentation is the basis for the challenge of the meeting afterwards to explain them as "absolutely trifling." 
The same protagonists who wrap themselves in discreet silence tried in June already unsuccessfully to call up a meeting on judicial way. 
With El Enebro - property society and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, beside other assets - seven children 100 percent of the capital control David Á of lvarez'. 
However, the founder of the service group according to family protocols demands the right of use more than 51% of the capital. 
This is the real background of the thing on which the judge has to decide in the hearing to the treatment of the action for nullification for which still no date was fixed.
