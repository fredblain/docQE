Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was distinguished astonishing-wise in the category Newcomer of the year 
If you on inquiry of a president auftritts, the people will note it. 
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to appear with the ceremony on the occasion of the Nobel prize lending in 2009. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer Ã¼berrachsenderweise was nominated for this year's Grammy in the category Newcomer of the year. 
In view of the fact that Spalding is a famed star since her album "Esperanza" in 2008 in the jazz scene already the nomination seems a little unusual. However, she corresponds to the Grammy rules according to which an artist might have published at most three albums before publication of the album with whom he became known in the wide public. 
Their ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society," is absolutely a 1 step forwards. And with her buoyant voice and a good feel for pop, radio and Latin Music, one can compare Spalding quietly to Norah Jones in 2003 whose big success comes in 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category of the nomination most near Spaldings. 
Further the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer trios was nominated in the category Instrumental albums. This darling of the critics thereby experienced a huge success. 
To the competitors Iyers belong among other things "Moody of 4B" of the experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the Keyboarders John Beasley. 
Trombone Shorty, a Rau-legged favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBOs "Treme," was distinguished in the category contemporary jazz in which, otherwise, rather albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber are to be found. 
Probably deserving attention received in the category great group the Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue. He steps therefore in against Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and adventuresome Dave Holland and his octet whose Life-Ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic tape leader.
