Climate: how France his finance promises schönredet 
A year after the Copenhagen contract it is to be examined time, the observance of the fast relaxed financing promises (also "Almost start" or premature financing called) which was realised by the developing countries. 
And the coarse French Schönredereien are already uncovered. 
With the Copenhagen contract the developing countries have undertaken to provide 30 milliard dollars between 2010 and 2012. 
The EU has promised 7.2 milliard euros more than three years away, France 1.26 milliard euros (i.e. 420 millions per year). 
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16 the EU has put out all the stops to persuade her partners of the fact of her engagement with regard to the almost start financing: action report faithful to detail of her member states, press conference, big Nebenevents, pamphlet distribution. 
The operation transparency is noteworthy and estimated just for her real value: the developing countries and the civil society would see it with pleasure if all developed countries made the same at the same precision level. 
The EU announces to have released in 2010 2.2 milliard euros what it brings on the right way to the Respektbezollung of her engagement of 7.2 milliards in 2012. 
If one looks, however, in the detail, the things lie a little more complicated. 
This money should be according to the Copenhagen contract "anew and, in addition," to guarantee that an additional application was introduced, without to the disadvantage of the public development aid to gereichen. 
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what means "anew and, in addition,." 
While the EU commission had suggested a harmonisation, certain member's states, under it France, the procedure have blocked. 
Today everybody chooses the appoximate value which he judges as best. 
The EU commission has itself, for example, as an appoximate value for that of 2009 chosen: the international financing will maintain, and adds within the scope of the financing "almost-start" more than three years 150 millions. 
Other countries have chosen similar appoximate values, either concerning year or with regard to conditions at level of the public development aid. 
As a countermove in addition was France of the opinion, the financing "of all new projects" of 2010 is new "and additional." 
Differently expressed: There are no appoximate values on the issues of the preceding year or at global level of the public development aid. 
Specifically said the total sum of the French support of the developing countries can remain stable (or also decrease) - France pretends to keep to his obligation concerning "new and additional" financing. 
Another, determining element is the classification in donations and advances. 
No rule still rules over it, and everybody chooses his arithmetic mode. 
Some, as for example France, find 1 borrowed € as equivalent with 1 donated €. 
Obviously this is only hardly defensible: the trouble is not comparable. 
If the use of advance can be justified for certain profitable investments (often to the issue containment engaged projects which are based on the most actual technology), it is delusive to present the euro which one takes in as a recompense for a donated euro... Besides, only the costs of the advance should be credited against the sponsor country as an engagement (i.e. the recompense of an interest rate). 
But France has nothing differently for the purposes of than the following consideration: it "respects" his obligation of 420 million euros, while it takes up 91.5% of advance (389.8 million euros) and donates 8.5%) 36.1 million euros) - see the also EU document to convince itself of it. 
France is only land of the EU that advance starts in big measure. 
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark which follow the Netherlands or Slovakia (among the rest,) to her obligations to 100% with donations. 
In other words if the prevailing majority of the European Union spends 1€ to the fulfilment of her obligations, France gives just once 10 cents and understands by it a comparable application. 
Nice abracadabra! 
All in all, France operates in his almost start financing with a double dizziness: to a part with a Weiterentwicklkung of the action for the time away and to the other part with the reality of the financial application. 
France succeeds in letting think that it has spent 420 millions "more anew and, more in addition," millions according to his promises and, besides, saves 36.1 million euros. 
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (there fine seems that it was Bercy which has carried out the arbitrage) a twice negative effect could cause; once EU-internal (why do the other member's states continue with the donation, if to lend it, nevertheless, enough?) and then during the negotiations, because the developing countries do not allow to be completely deceptive... 
The chapter of the premature financing only one small question for relatively short time in comparison to the totality in discussions about the climate. 
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC. 
If we hope that this will not be the case. 
How to him also is always, it is indispensable to learn his lesson from this first year of premature financing. 
Primarily, France could announce a change in his posting kind for the years 2011 and 2012, namely in spirit of the respect for his obligations and the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union. 
Above all, however, France could bring the discussions about the quarrel object of the long-term financing forwards (another, determining and at the moment discussed subject): one does not escape from the question of the "Verrechenbarkeit" or the posting kind of his advances. 
France could change his position to be as advancedly concerning the issues as it is with other things. 
Hope is based on the new secretary of the environment Kosciusko-Morizet who will arrive the next week at Cancun. 
An astonishing announcement about the almost-start of France and his vision of the "Verrechenbarkeit" as well as the use of advance would raise from nature the international trust base which is inevitably for continuing discussions.
