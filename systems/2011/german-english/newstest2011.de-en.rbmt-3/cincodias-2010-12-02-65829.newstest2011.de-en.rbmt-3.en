Sabadell wants to 'pinch' his rival in three years one millions customers 
The managing board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He thinks that in 2001 a hard year is for the banks, a new liquidity crisis rejects first, however, and prophesies the end of the debt war. 
Nevertheless, he foresees a burglary of the interest margins which the banks try to compensate with rises of the fees and the prices of advance. 
Sabadell expects to catch one millions private customers in three years - a still to be passed field. 
Sabadell has found the way to exhaust the coming three years, and to survive thus in a very much complicated economic sphere. 
The bank will introduce in 2011 a new 3 annual leading plan. 
The aim is not only to survive without taking up the public aid from the FROB but to increase, in addition, the share of the market around millions private customers - 700,000 if one draws off the customers whom the bank will lose-. This is the big challenge before which this bank stands, because till present it has dedicated to her clients more attention than her private customer. 
This year she has to do 250,000 private customers and 50,000 enterprises. 
Their share of the market with private customers lies at 3.5 percent, while the clients put out more than 10 percent. 
Another principle of the commercial plan in 2011-2013 is the rise of the productiveness, speak Austerität, cost reduction. She will introduce the challenges to which the bank faces with it together with financial report. 
Only few banks dare in these difficult times to fix aims and to publish, because by the financial crisis worldwide all plans of the banks have got mixed up. 
Sabadell will conclude her leading plan agreed four years ago optima this year. This was laid out at first for three years, but as a result of the market situation he was extended by a business year. 
The customers who are left the savings banks are the principal purpose of the bank. 
With a breakfast organised by the APIE stressed Guardiola, in 2011 would become a "difficult" year "with big reach." 
The manager goes out from it, Spain would come out only "slowly" of the crisis. 
Moreover, it would be "very difficult" to create work in two or three years "" - basically for the survival of the banks. 
Even if he assumes from the fact that the war punishes the interest margins around liabilities - him - will abate, the loadings, the banks and savings banks will have to pay for her issues to the preservation of liquidity, as a balance for dwindling profit margins already on the price of loans shifted. 
"The subjects Liquidity and Financing are of structural kind and they will exert pressure on the loans." 
"We have not turned the cock, but the interest differentials are very high," admitted Guardiola. 
Banesto spent on Thursday already the arrangement to her branch net to limit the assignment of long-term advances and to raise the interest differentials (cf. Cinco Días from the 22nd and 27th of November). 
The manager also admitted, the banks pursued at the moment the Stategie "to raise the fees," indeed, "within a frame stamped by the competition ." 
Sabadells leading plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as usual, corporate shops does not exclude. 
Not free of charge he assures that in Spain "bigger enterprises are necessary." 
"Next year everything will change," he assures. 
He stresses that the need rises in capital at the moment "terrifically" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will slip off in red figures. 
He is of the opinion, the FROB can substitute with Kaptitalaufstockungen for the money market. 
After he assures that Sabadell can also survive a passing closing of the markets, he weakens the argument of some bankers who already prophesy a new liquidity crisis. 
He stresses, one can bring nothing in circulation, but as opposed to the incidents in June, one can achieve short-term financing about Repogeschäfte and intercept with it the crisis.
