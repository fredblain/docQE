Scram here 
Finally, in this evening it runs once more really around for the Irishmen. 
No track of affliction. 
For it the home team dominates his guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much. 
The fans bawl with joy with crash nothing but music, they stamp with the feet. 
The Bailey pub in südirischen Cork shakes because the players throw table-tennis balls about a 3 metre distance in beer mug - and hit. 
"Bierpong" is called the weird spectacle to win there are 500 euros of victory premium plus flight tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong world championships in January. 
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this shrill drinking play and the reserved information scientist, this does not fit really. 
And, besides, nevertheless, the 26-year-old tries to have a good time to deflect himself of the piercing question what will bring the future. 
Play fun does not stand on his plan in Las Vegas, he will carry on application conversations in New Zealand in January. 
"Besides, I have a rotten feeling," he says. 
"It is so far away from home and still I have no work there." 
At least: His friend waits in Auckland already for him - "she had ruck, twitch her desirable job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles. 
Because of bad perspectives at home two of Tanners have already searched for three brothers and sisters her luck abroad. 
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, now his brother Colin has a place as an IT adviser in London. 
The boys go: As it looks to the Tanners on the island in many families. 
100,000 Irishmen will leave the country probably in the next time, experts of the economic research institute and social research institute ESRI forecast in Dublin. 
Till 2015 they count even on 200,000 emigrants. 
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a violent loss. 
If the forecasts prove to be true, it comes to an emigration wave comparably with that from which Ireland suffered in the eighties. 
Now after a decade of the impetus which brought big prosperity with itself for the Irishmen dreariness spreads once more. 
Besides, the economic crisis unnerves above all the young, well qualified Irishmen for whom it went up to now only uphill. 
Job loss and social descent seemed absurd during the boom years. 
Everybody was used, there was money in the abundance. 
In the meantime, however, three of ten women and men are under thirty without work. 
In the Irish Times there is zuhauf the letters to the editor of young emigrants which complain: "Everything goes in Ireland brook under it." 
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who is able, leaves and our country a whole generation loses with it." 
"Then the last puts out please the light." 
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, sees a sombre future gathering because the government pursues only eyewash and offers to the young people no more future prospects. 
"You reduce the minimum wages, but they have no strategy as new jobs should be created," says the 20-year-old. 
She observes how her fellow students to themselves from an unpaid training period work the way along to the next. 
Their biggest worry, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years independently. 
"Dieser Gedanke ist traurig und deprimierend." 
Besides, men like Stephen McLarnon try to take the subject positively. 
McLarnon organises the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a fair which offers an all-round service on the subject Work abroad. 
"Nevertheless, for first-time employees the work is abroad a great chance to take the first steps on the career leader," says the manager. 
On his web page photos show surfer in Australia and Snowboarder in Canada. 
The message is clear: Abroad work is no galley service, but brings also freedom and fun. 
How it feels to build up somewhere else something, Seán O'Donovan knows for half a year. 
Because there was to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland nothing more, now he works with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany. 
In Gelsenkirchen they pull up just a fashion house. 
In January it further goes to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project. 
His native country sees O'Donovan, in the meantime, only rare, because he makes extra layers to be able to pay off the loan for his house at home. 
"The situation is already crazy a little bit," he says when he steps after long time for the first time about the threshold of his house. 
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland in which I practically never again am." 
He laughs something move and goes through cooled down rooms. 
The small house stands in a fine residential area with cultivated front gardens, in the entrances big, expensive cars park. 
Together with a sister O'Donovan has bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent loan-financed. 
"These were mad times, there was an easy money without many questions," he says. 
Does he have fear that it could fail with the loan? 
O'Donovan considers for a while, adds hot tea and says: "I have no children whom I must feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start anew." 
The structural engineer does not like the lamentations which at the moment he often hears. 
"Nobody must starve - nevertheless, our situation is not so dramatic by far as in former times here on the island," he says. 
"For a while abroad work, this is not the worst what can happen - maybe we thereby feel only when Irishmen." 
He laughs and then tells about his father who has gone in the last big economic crisis to England. 
"After seven years he was there again and the life went on in Ireland, quite simply." 
Cian Tanner likes this thought. 
The future leave open and simply sometimes look like it runs with the life somewhere else. 
He has a few years of work in London already behind himself and which is why should it not run in New Zealand also well for him and his friend? 
However, a thing is there still which disturbs him during these days severely: the celebration for his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin. 
He fears that it could degenerate into a farewell party. 
"Only not too many emotions," he says and drinks a big gulp of his beer. 
"Nevertheless, farewell, this sounds frightening." 
"If we call it rather a road walking party, quite laxly, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few plays."
