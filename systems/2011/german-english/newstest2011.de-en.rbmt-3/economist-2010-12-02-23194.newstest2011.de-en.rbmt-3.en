Secretly in the middle 
During the weeks after the sudden death of your man president of Argentina, Cristina Fernández, found out a wave from the sympathy which did her popularity rate about 20 points on more than 50% upwards. This is the highest value since her choice in 2007. 
Whether to her this, nevertheless, next year helps to a reelection, depends on whether obviously mourning Cristina Fernández is more prepared to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor sexton. 
The signs for it are not unequivocal. 
Néstor the sexton who steered the economic policy also to the choice of his wife often put up budgets which considered the inland revenue, the economic growth and the inflation not fully. 
This allowed to the presidential pair to spend the extra income at own discretion. 
On the paper the Fernández government last year lost the majority in the congress. 
However, the opposition is divided and sexton's death after a cardiac infarction on the 27th of October led to other disagreements. 
Some regime critics from the rows of the ruling Peronisten positioned themselves behind Cristina Fernández. 
However, after the chaotic meetings (with which a parliamentarian to another hit in the face and other the government of the bribery accused) the congress did not succeed in dismissing the household for 2011. 
"I will not discuss this," according to the president. 
Now the household in 2010 is also valid for the next year by which the president has even more opportunity to spend money at own discretion. 
The economy overheats: probably she will grow this year around up to 9%. 
The official inflation rate lies at present with 11.1%, however, numerous private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - do the value on nearly 30%. 
The sexton who assumed in 2003 the office as Argentina by economic crises was shaken, explained growth and poverty fight to his principal purposes, and not the inflation lowering. 
He refused the cooperation with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned the national institute of statistics and census INDEC which clarified as a result the official inflation statistics. 
Can Fernández smash now a more moderate way? 
She has called the private sector and the trade union leaders for talks. 
And according to official statements pay raises should be limited next year to 18%. 
The high world prices for agricultural products of Argentina have given a strong impetus to the economy. 
However, the inflation undermined the growth push by a big Devaluation in 2002. 
That's why Cristina Fernández would possibly like to connect Argentina finance-economically again to the rest of the world. 
In the beginning of this year the government concluded an agreement with the security owners who had rejected the former conversion of debts of the country in 2001. 
Now Fernández seems to push the club to which she owes approx. 6,7$ billion for an agreement with the financiers from Paris. 
The sexton had always rejected an examination by the IMF, like elsewhere commonly. 
However, last month the Minister for Economic Affairs Amado Boudou announced that the fund performs "technical support" by the production of a new national consumer price index. It looks in such a way as if this was the first step to the purge of the INDEC. 
It is not known whether Fernández is politically active after ending of her term of office also without support by her husband. 
If so, she needs in addition the support of the middle class, mainly enough has from the Kirchnerismus. 
If the Argentines return in March from her summer vacation, the wave of the Sympatie which was brought to her will have died down. 
If she liked to win an other choice, it must decide whether it lifts many political decisions of her husband quietly and quietly.
