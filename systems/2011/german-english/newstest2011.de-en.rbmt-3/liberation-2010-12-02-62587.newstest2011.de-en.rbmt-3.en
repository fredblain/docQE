Métro Grand Paris: the first financial sketches 
Since the debate is around the modernisation of the traffic economy on the Ile-de-France in full way, it rains milliards. 
At least in the discussions. 
One calls to himself, on this occasion, in particular the 23 milliards for the metro Grand Paris in recollection which should be built by the Société you Grand Paris. 
To lead the start of construction work of the SGP in the ways, the state has exclaimed a capital donation of 4 milliard euros. 
In the theoretical pattern this is the sum which the SGP would allow then to lend a part of the finance sum to her double at the markets. 
Today, finally, it has come to the first projections. 
The supplementary budget of 2010, this morning looked through from the finance commission of the National Assembly, contains the intended measures to raise the first part of this money. 
It concerns, on this occasion, two things measures: the creation of a special tax to the Erschließund and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France. 
Erstere, so one takes article 15 of the law draught, goes "in favour of the public law institution of Société you Grand Paris." 
This is numbered: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year." 
Zweitere is a reorganisation of the already existing enterprise taxation: "to modernise this to increase which from her proving product and this rise of the Société you Grand Paris to überantworten." 
How much would this introduce? 
A riddle. 
This sum is not numbered in the text. 
From the 4 milliards one is far away. 
"It is explained that the tax resources are included to the 4 milliard euros of the capital donation which are raised by the state and are performed the Société you Grand Paris bit by bit for the project," is to be taken from the explicatory statement. 
One finds this system not at all indecent with the SGP. 
"Since the moment at which one registers income (both taxes, d. R.), one can cover the project engineering more than three years and then scoop only from the 4 milliards," is explained. 
"This is taken down in the budget and is drawn off bit by bit." 
The SGP estimates that will be begun in 2013 to take down the 4 milliards for the budget in 2014. 
This measure which for 4 promised milliards one will still be able to look long runs the risk to cause a surely moved, parliamentary discussion. 
The first public meeting takes place on the 7th of December.
