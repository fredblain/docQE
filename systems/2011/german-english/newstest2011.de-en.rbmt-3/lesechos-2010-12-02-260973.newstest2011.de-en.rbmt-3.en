Euro: the EZB is made maintain her buyings of government stocks 
The last meeting of the central bank advice of the EZB last year should offer opportunity to indicate possibilities as one comes out of the crisis, or announce at least the arrangement of a big number in unconventional measures of the monetary policy which should come at the end of the year for her end. 
The crisis of the European state indebtedness obliges, the central bank in Frankfurt cannot afford undoubtedly to forfeit also the today's, more than tense situation at the European loan markets not to cause their increase. 
Besides, the political costs would be too high by far. 
Yesterday the French Minister of Finance Christine Lagarde had welcomed the active role taken by the EZB in favour of the solution of the budget indebtedness of Europe on the occasion of a press conference. 
She does not have to say risqué whether she is to the opinion the central bank can act even more, for example, by boost of her programme of the buyings of state loans. 
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners ." 
The day before Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the EZB had appeared in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the economic committee and monetary committee of the European parliament not very voluble with regard to his plans, but had been content rather to point out to the fact that the programme of the purchases of government stocks at the secondary market "weiterbetrieben" would become and that we will see at the meeting on Thursday "how the decisions fall out." 
The only certainty: The EZB will leave her leading interest consistently with 1%, the historically lowest level since May, 2009. 
In practice the bond purchases of the treasury were doubled by the EZB the last week on about 1.35 milliard euros. 
And yesterday according to indiscretions of some traders she should have effected new purchases in Irish and Portuguese government stocks. 
All together the central banks of the eurosystem since May have carried out 2010 purchases at the rate of 67 milliard euros. 
Among the traders the Antizipation of a Weiterverfolgens of the purchase course is on no account doubted (see page 29). 
The economists already expect no more noteworthy course change. 
If the loan shops of more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the EZB, will potter about latter still in the unlimited finances reserves in freigiebige kind, namely for a period of one week up to three months. 
The economists make themselves calm already today on it that this measure will still extend in some months. 
"I cannot imagine that the EZB her programme in essential kind will change." 
"Otherwise she would take the risk to provoke new tensions in the short period," Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank supposes. 
"One for the course of the first quarter in 2011 intended, progressive climbing out seems to me more likely," Norbert Bräms, economist anticipates on his part with Sal. 
Home Oppen. 
In the area of her interventions at the market of the state indebtedness "such a purchase volume had to do the EZB in bonds aufrechthalten which animates the sluggish market," Norbert Bräms adds. 
In consideration of the relevance of the exposed position of the European banks at the markets of the state indebtedness in the eurozone the central bank has no other choice to maintain as her presence at the market. 
"She must step for every price to the Steller of the lacking investors at the market and act so to prevent the rash enthusiasm about the yields paid in the weakest states," yesterday testified an important bond owner. 
Since if the interest rates begin to the high-altitude flight, the states would be stopped even more from reducing her indebtedness or from stabilising even. 
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
