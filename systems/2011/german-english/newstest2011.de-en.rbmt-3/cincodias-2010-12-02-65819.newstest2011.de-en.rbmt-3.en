Threatening gestures of the European central bank (EZB) 
Yesterday the investors reacted sharply to the threat of the EZB president Trichet who warned, "the markets should not underestimate our reactivity." 
The risk impacts of the Euro-Peripheriländer have dramatically risen and the shares of the European banks by more than 5%. 
Anyhow we had to do the possibility that the EZB can be mistaken and the euro has hardly increased in points what arranges to the worry, do not underestimate. 
The events from yesterday are typical for an illiquid market, to such an extent in which he breaks down to himself again recovered, indeed, as a result of the closing short and highly speculative positions. 
The institutional investor will not still lose long his fear. 
Today one month ago the European central bank asked us to cancel our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen after which the EZB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably still several time must make in the future, a Rückzieher. 
The Central Bank demanded the ending of the plan for the purchase of national debts, because these are ineffective, as well as the abolition of all unusual limited liquidity measures. Only a one-week unlimited access should be maintained. 
After the Ireland crisis we expect that the present liquidity measures are extended "at least till March" and the quarterly advertisings with boundless access are maintained at the quarter end to the guarantee of the liquidity till at least June. 
We also expect that the programme will be economical for the purchase of bonds continuously and a restorative signal. 
If the created expectations are not fulfilled, are thrown back the excellent reaction of the markets from yesterday again and if halstarrig is persisted, to take back our liquidity measures we, only God can help us! 
Just as tomorrow with the EZB meeting in May with which the bank confirmed not to consider the purchase of state debt papers and the markets broke down as a result this story could recur. 
The EZB it must be plausible and pertinacious. 
In May she showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said to have shopped already a lot with which she provoked a new breakdown of the market. 
Yesterday the auction of one-year-old state titles was quite weak in Portugal. 
The state administration of property spent only 500 millions to 5.28%, compared with 750 millions to 4.81% in the preceding auction. 
Nevertheless, the interest rates fell in Portugal about 30 base points in the whole curve and reflected with it a perception change of the markets after the words Trichets. 
In Ireland the figures of the debt hole were published by Allied and bank of Irishman's country. 
The sum is estimated at about 10,000 millions at short notice and possible other 15,000. There is time till February to procure private capital or these banks are nationalised. 
Although Ireland has completely lost his credibility, after it had not recognised the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures are satisfactory within the scope of the rescue plan and help to reduce the uncertainty. 
Indeed, the government on the next Tuesday must receive the parliamentary approval with his new budget. Because she still does not dispose of the sufficient support, Ireland also is furthermore a spring of the uncertainty. 
Angela Merkel has formed her discourse in view of the summit of the heads of state and the government on the 14th of December more mezzo. There political unity is asked to show that we play together them the same score. 
The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven. 
Yesterday the Spanish head of the provincial government introduced the measure plan which should be dismissed on Friday by the council of ministers. 
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions like with the financial institutions, dismantling of the state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job-creating measures. The measures which sound in the ears of the investors like Vivaldis Four seasons. 
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains, why the Spanish stock exchange has increased about 4.5 percent, twice as much like the rest of the European stock exchanges. 
In comparison to February the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and was persuasive, and we profit from the surprise effect. 
Today there is a decisive auction of a three-year-old state loan which will derive benefit from the Trichet effect. Therefore, we place on a strong inquiry which will remove all doubts about our conversion of debts ability. 
For Spain the application of an auxiliary plan would be a self-sacrifice. 
We would receive liquidity which we do not need. The Treasury has at disposal 40 milliard euros, three spots so much like in March. The interest rates are exceedingly expensive and the access to the markets would be closed without notice. 
Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to the motto of Caesar woman: "Now not only the being, but also the light counts." 
We create only courage, this!
