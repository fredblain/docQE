Love in times of the war 
Since Angelina Jolie has begun in summer with the work on her still anonymous directorial debut, there is annoyance. 
She herself has written the screenplay, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man. 
Even more one does not know about that - but already this reaches for restlessness. 
Stubbornly the rumour, the woman, a Muslimin keeps, falls in love during the Yugoslavia war with her Serbian rapist. 
Bosnian women's associations have protested immediately, whereupon some rotary days planned in Sarajevo at short notice to Hungary were moved. 
In the meantime, the film is turned in Hungary and in the postal production, but it it is still protested in Bosnia. 
Bakira Hasecic of the organisation of female war victims wrote about the UN-refugee's charitable organisation UNHCR in Jolie and required a meeting with the actress, now a Bosnian newspaper has reported - Jolie is even an ambassadress of the UN-refugee's charitable organisation. 
She is not diplomatic - she has already offered a meeting in Hungary to the women weeks ago what they rejected, however. 
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, according to Hasecic. 
There have not been love stories in rape camps, and Jolies position towards the victims betrays to her enough about the screenplay. 
Their organisation has recommended according to the UN-refugee's charitable organisation to dismiss Jolie as an ambassadress, reports to the guerrilla warfare. 
What has written exactly, however, Jolie for scenes? 
The Bosnian cultural ministry which got to read her screenplay has given to some and Here a rotary approval for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear, why Jolie did not come then, nevertheless. 
The Jung's author herself protested, they pursues no political intentions with her film, has got used to the work with a lot of trouble in the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the awful results of the war and give a voice to all involved sides. 
However, with the contents she remains vague. 
Thus the second Synopsis still circulates to the film in the net which sounds nevertheless quite different: The lovers knew themselves in it already before outbreak of war and meet again when it, a Bosnian Muslimin, in a Serbian camp is kidnapped in which he works as a guard. 
What sounds, nevertheless, considerably differently than the variation "Rape victim falls for torturer." 
The fact that Jolies film begins really already before the war - so much is sure. 
The pressure on them, according to Jolie, is unfair "and is based on misinformation." 
Now only the hackers of Hollywood can probably get her peace: While they put the screenplay, like already so many before, illegally in the net.
