450 millions in contracts without advertising 
Hydro québec has granted in mutual agreement project planning companies 450 Millions dollars in contracts for the water power project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert. 
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts stands a syndicate, consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe N.M. and Axor which has received the most important portion, namely those of the project management, to a sum from 295 million dollars without advertising. 
This syndicate, called "Énergie gérance," was formed in 2004 as a concomitant of the decision by Hydro québec, the private sector her responsibilit, this important, hydroelektrische project by height of a sum of 5 milliard dollars to überantworten. 
In the beginning of 2005 the syndicate "Énergie gérance" got hold of the lucrative contract, without there would have been a public advertising. 
For the Parti Québécois falling back on enterprise syndicates poses a serious ethical problem which brings on the risk of the Wettbewerbsverdrändung as well as a prize increase. 
"This is a new way of a snare and weakens the competition." 
"This means that one carries out instead of snares instead of in confidential way now in open form," yesterday explained Sylvain Simard, representative of the PQ, in the press conference. 
In the early morning Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems to him difficult to understand how the interest of the public can be served in this way. 
Resource minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon to it, while she denied vehemently that it would have concerned with this contract a snare. 
"I remain loyal to my line," railed them, while it encouraged, the PQ has gone forward "dishonestly" and "she lacks hardness." 
She said, it "is the least" that the PQ apologise. 
The model of the syndicate is worldwide a current practise. 
It usually concerns a chronologically so limited alliance which allows to two or several enterprises to bundle up her expert's assessments concerning an order on an advertising for a complicated project. 
The project "Eastmain" shows a high complexity level with regard to his working magnitude. 
The construction method is going and should be put up till 2012. 
Anyhow the contract was awarded, without a competition had been able to take place; there had already been negotiations. 
Besides, the model of the syndicate in Quebec even with relatively easy projects shows by no means more an exception. 
How the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted the last week, applied model of the syndicate is in the area of the structural engineer and consultation being an object of government inquiries. 
Short flying of the Quebecer enterprise register allows to name more than 200 syndicates from which some of continual duration seem to be. 
In this way, for example, the company Dessau works together in partnership with the majority of her nuclear competitors to whom CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult count. 
Any linking, and of it returns it to several dozens, introduces on and the same legal entity, namely on Dessau. 
What concerns the syndicate "Énergie gérance," minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territory of the Baie James of a special manpower dynamism is subjected and that Hydro québec gives to this fact since the 70s in special way calculation." 
Réal Laporte, the big employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a declaration which has the nose about the fact rümpfen leave that the contract about the project management was granted after arrangement. 
"If you an advertising makes and gives it only few applicants, upwards your prices will shoot up." 
"You have two possibilities: either you take the people who are on this Mart and says you: one will negotiate an adequate arrangement for a good price." 
"Nevertheless, the thought is that not the price is vital, but the expertise of the people," sanctioned Laporte. 
This contract allowed to the syndicate "Énergie gérance" is a part of a long list of contracts about more than 50,000 dollars preserved by the Parti Québécois. 
The contracts were approved either by Hydro québec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert. 
After examination the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineer and adviser contracts, the companies or their branches, under it in particular resource labs, between 2002 and March, 2010 were granted. 
SNC-Lavalin had heaped 22 contracts in itself, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without counting, on this occasion, their participation in "Énergie gérance." 
All these contracts have been negotiated. 
They amount in Whole to 449.783.344$, in it enclosed the contract with "Énergie gérance" more than 295.131.564$. 
Sylvain Simard left that four companies who form the syndicate (BPR are Dessau, Groupe N.M. and Axor) of the "Parti libéral you québec well-known." 
Minister Normandeau left, the PQ would be equally connected with the companies whom they "financed," before she specified that it concerns rather their executives.
