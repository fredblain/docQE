The child-murderer confesses, she has complained on the Internet to the "drudgery" of the maternity. 
The young woman spoke of the child when this was quite dead and she had a Blog: "Terror in Galician kind" 
Mónica Juanatey Fernández ist im Internet "Muki." 
Under this epithet which it leads from an early age she holds with a cousin and at least one friend contact. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña in which it was born. 
The communications are from 2008. 
To understand this, one must know her dear life which reconstructs the newspaper ABC on the basis of witness's statements of her members of the family. 
The 30-year-old Galician woman took up in 1998 a respect with Iván Túñez, an industrialist. 
She held a year. 
Briefly after she had dissolved her respect, became known that she was pregnant. 
He wanted to know whether the baby of him is, but his former never let him carry out a DNA analysis. 
Already shortly after she entered another respect. 
The chosen was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring municipality. 
She lived together with him long time. 
César lived with them. 
When the young woman on the Balearic Islands went to look around on the job market, the little one remained with her partner who accompanied them even during 1 week after Palma. 
But from the contents of her news closes itself that her love relationship broke and they separated. 
In March, 2008 she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very peculiar and sour because I have come for the work." 
"When I informed of this him, he found it good, but now he notices of course what indicates to be alone with the boy the whole day and not to be free, to be able to let able to act and to be able to let what he would want." 
Later she mentions a communication which it has received just on the mobile phone: "I would want that you come back this month or hand over to me an address in which I can send you the boy." 
She complains: "If he does not like it that I leave the boy with my mother, I fetch him if I am back." 
In May she speaks of the return in her village: "This week I drive there, but I will remain only up to 19. there because I must fancy in 20. to a work if I do not want to lose them." 
She explains that she takes her first-born if everything goes well. 
"He will be with that with which he must be, that is with me. In the life I never leave him again at somebody except with my mother," a dubious intention if one considers their bad respect. 
In July there is an other mail. 
When she writes this, it is assumed from the fact that the boy who came in 1. of the month on the island and was murdered supposedly in 10. is dead. 
"On the one hand César is contented, on the other hand, not." 
"On the one hand he is with me and the place likes him a little bit, but then he must go to school every day." 
She speaks of a move to Majorca. 
"There he will visit (the boy) a summer course, I have less issues for the nanny." 
In 17.: Recollections and complaints. 
"A gigantic kiss of César who asks me, when you come." 
"Alberto says, he has sent me some videos on e-mail. If you see if he wants, he finds me, according to a dung." 
In 30. another one: "To The boy it goes well. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan." 
From Víctor, her present partner, there is one: "He shoots money before me." 
On the Internet, in Anime-and Mangablogs, there are communications of her. 
She had even own Blog in MySpace which is closed now and in which she was called "Muki, die Gefängnisentlasserin." 
"Terror a la gallega (heading) ." 
The last man who lived together with her a sworn in gamekeeper, explains pangs of conscience to have because he feels guilty. 
He cannot believe that everything happened because she had not told him that she is a single mother. 
Yesterday Mónica was transferred by the centre for court prisoner on Menorca in the provincial prison of Palma. 
The assigned counsel, Carlos Maceda, explained, she cannot remember the expiry of the circumstances, "and she has not had the intention to add to the small damage." 
However, before she had stood, drowned César in the bath and his corpse in a suitcase to have stowed away. 
Defence and public prosecutor's office applied a psychiatric certificate.
