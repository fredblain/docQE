Worldwide plan to the renewal of the lighting 
Yesterday UN has suggested in Cancun a plan to the renewal of the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in view of the achievement of a reduction of the greenhouse gas (CFC) which corresponds nearly to one third of the additional reduction which must be realised to stabilise the earth climate till 2020. 
This ambitious plan takes his position in the step of the concrete large-scale projects which UN hopes to move in Cancun to compensate for the absence of compelling reduction obligations of the industrial countries. 
After the plan proposed yesterday the main problem would be avoided in the form of 1.8 milliard tonnes (Gt) on account of the lighting on the earth delivered FCKWs if the white-hot pears which show up to now one more monopoly of from 50 to 70% at the market were substituted with fluorescing or better still, by light-emitting diodes (LED). 
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the worldwide issues. 
This corresponds to a recompense of 70% of the exhaust gases of the worldwide vehicle park. 
In Copenhagen the big exhaust gas emitters like the United States, China, Europe and other had themselves the last year under which also Canada counted, obliges to voluntary reduction plans which should screw off the global CFC issues of 53 Gt on 49 Gt. 
One would have to depart from this balance, nevertheless, another 5 Gt to stabilise the climate increase about 2 degrees centigrade from today up to 2020 to prevent that this gets out of control. 
In the white-hot pears 95% of the energy escape in the form of warmth, and remaining 5% produce the light. 
With the compact illuminant pears the energy consumption decreases about 75%, with the new LED light bulbs one reduces this power demand again around the double. 
The compact illuminant pears hold on an average between from 6000 to 10,000 hours. 
The new LED light bulbs, as for example those which the manufacturer Philips has put on the market this week - this society has taken part, by the way, in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and use 80% less energy than a white-hot pear what provides an indication of the saving possibilities of the Auswechselungsplanes which should be applied in 100 countries. 
Beside the fact that iese to absolutely new light bulbs deliver only very little warmth they can also function with a variable resistor. 
And they contain no mercury. 
Several specialists have indicated that compact illuminant pears show reserves, because they contain mercury and that one must decontaminate them so as a hazardous waste what is not always possible in the developing countries, except the producers make available a counter. 
The main spring in mercury issues on the planet shows according to the report, nevertheless, not the compact illuminant pear, but rather the coal-fired power stations which expel substantially more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white-hot pears. 
Only in the United States these coal-fired power stations expel 25,000 tonnes of mercury yearly. 
The report demonstrates in detail the profits which every country would gain thanks to this international programme. 
Indonesia would save, so for example, one milliard dollars yearly by the buying of electricity and eight million tonnes CO2, this means a recompense of 3.5 coal-fired power stations whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 milliards.
