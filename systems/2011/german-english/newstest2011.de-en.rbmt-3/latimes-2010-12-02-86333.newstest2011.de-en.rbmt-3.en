Microbe resistant to arsenic could allow new life forms on the earth or somewhere else 
The discovery of a foreign bacterial kind which can live among other things on arsenic opens new possibilities for new life forms on the earth and somewhere else. 
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on the earth, it is to her view after a sign for the fact that a life is also possible without up to now as of vital importance judged elements. 
"This organism has two possibilities." 
"He needs to the wax either phosphorus or arsenic." 
"This makes it a little bit completely special, although it is nearly one kind of 'foreign' life form," explained Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report who appears on Thursday in the on-line issue of the magazine Science. 
Up to now six main elements were looked as of vital importance - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur. 
However, as the scientists found out, the bacterium grows in the Californian Mono brine also even further if it substitutes for phosphorus with arsenic. 
"Nevertheless, there one asks himself what is else possible," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University. 
The discovery is an important step with the search for extraterrestrial life, because scientists must recognise life and his forms, according to Anbar. 
The study deals with microbes which were found on the earth. 
The announcement of a press conference in which no details were announced for the discovery gave occasion for widespread speculations on the Internet that the report of the discovery of extraterrestrial life could act. 
This is not the case. 
The discovery "shows that in other planet systems organisms can get going biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements' which are absolutely of vital importance according to our opinion are not necessarily firmly given," explained Charles Cockell, professor in the Planetary and Space Sciences Research institutes of the open university of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. 
Cockel was not a part of the research team. 
"This work is a novelty, because she shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures an element can be substituted with another," Cockell added. 
This discovery was not accidental. 
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the astrobiological institute of the NASA which led the study chose the Mono brine on account of the high arsenic salary. 
Because arsenic and phosphorus are alike chemically, she supposed that the microbes which are put out to both can possibly substitute for an element with the other. 
"The poisonousness of the arsenic is based above all on the fact that it behaves chemically similarly like phosphorus." 
"Thereby it is difficult for the organisms to distinguish an element from the other." 
"Nevertheless, the difference is so big that arsenic looks different than phosphorus. It reaches in our biochemical system where it virtually smears everything," explains Anbar. 
The researchers put out the bacterium to GFAJ-1 of a rising arsenic concentration. It adapted itself and grew. 
Though the microbe grows in phosphorus better, however that it can also survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based life form can seem of course, either on the earth or on another planet or moon, on the arsenic it seems more often. 
According to Jamie S. Foster, lecturer in microbiology in the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be substituted with arsenic, not anew. But up to now there was still no functioning example. 
Arsenic seemed during the early earth years more often, she says, therefore, the science has assumed from the fact that early life forms have used it. 
"This gives reason for the acceptance that life could also have developed differently than in the early geological era," according to forester whom member was not in Wolfe-Simons research team. 
The research projects were supported by the NASA, the energy ministry and the national health authorities.
