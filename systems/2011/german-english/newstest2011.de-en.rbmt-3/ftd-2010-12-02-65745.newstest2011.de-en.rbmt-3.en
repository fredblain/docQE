Talentekampf um Hohe Potenziale 
It rules of active Andrang in the refreshment bar. 
16 students crowd around salmon bread roll, tomato soup and sweet. 
The mechanical engineering and design students have invited the University of Technology of Brunswick and the automaker Volkswagen to a Workshop. 
In a sort of idea competition they should get to know together with VW developers over the car of the future fachsimpeln - and completely, besides, Volkswagen. 
In the competition around the cleverest heads many enterprises go meanwhile to the close fight and place, like VW, on cooperations with the universities. 
Their mission: To recruit the most gifted graduates very early in the auditoriums, before they come on the job market and are courted by others. 
And because the universities publish no installations about the achievements of her students, one tries to spot of the special talents in practise projects and to bind to himself. 
On the second day of the Workshops in the University of Technology of Brunswick the autogroup advertises around the talents. 
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pen, little elastic bear and briefcases with VW logo. 
She tells the hopeful Jung's talents about training period programmes and student jobs and indicates to them ways in the group. 
Nico Selle of the University of Technology of Brunswick looks after the project with VW. 
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students step in contact with the industry and collect experiences." 
"VW can get to know at the same time students, look at interesting candidates to themselves closer and consider who would be possible than employee." 
Such cooperations, according to Selle, are not unusual. 
It is new that is courted so offensively the students. 
"Otherwise, the main focus lay rather on the technical project," says Selle. 
The fight for the freshly postgraduates will become even harder fine. 
In many branches the enterprises cannot select to themselves her employees any more from a big crowd of applicants. 
But they must recommend themselves and court particularly around highly qualified manpower. 
Besides, before all graduate from the engineer's disciplines are in an excellent negotiations position. 
According to the association of German of engineers VDI more than 40,000 engineer's places remained in October unoccupied. 
And the so-called engineer's gap will become even bigger according to VDI forecasts. 
For the economic check enterprise and consulting firm KPMG goes Roman Dykta on the talent hunt. 
He organises costly Recruiting-events as for example the KPMG-Race, a sort of modern shred hunt with which the participants must find her way on the basis of GPS co-ordinates. 
The enterprise wants to send eight promising students thus next year straight through the USA. 
Completely, besides, the participants can have a look at KPMG branches and get to know the enterprise. 
Who is allowed with, decides in two choice rounds in the approach. 
Nur die de la Crème der vielen BEWERBER FLIEGT IN DIE USA. 
With the mattock and jump-off around the High potential at the universities the Geschütze become bigger and bigger according to Dykta. 
"We want to contrast with the Race from the mass." 
"Only an easy Segeltörn was to us not enough." 
For talent hunter Dykta the calculation seems to rise. 
"We have till this day with all participants of a similar action last year contact." 
"Some stand shortly before her end and soon want to apply with us," he says. 
Beside the direct paramour in the campus above all small and small and medium-sized companies also go quite classically with occupational measuring on the deerstalking. 
"We try to reach graduates on trade fairs." 
"Possibly on Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, personnel manager with the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld. 
The Bonn enterprise occupies about 1500 employees in Germany. 
Stübe knows around the promising problems. 
Currently 35 places are written out on the enterprise website. 
"It is just very difficult to take vacant positions." 
"This costs a lot of time and money," she says. 
Another way is the contact about the university professors. 
Solarworld co-operates with different colleges, possibly of the university in Freiberg. 
"The professors give instructions that one can make training periods with us or write his dissertation." 
Expensive publicity campaigns are not announced with the solar specialist. 
The enterprise with other advantages tries to advertise to it for itself: Personal atmosphere, level hierarchy and light communication. 
"A great group cannot often offer this," says personnel manager Stübe. 
Money does not play with the job search long ago any more the leading role. 
Adaptable working hours, care of children or good opportunities for advancement are other determining factors. 
Solarworld booked with a study of the Great Place to Work of institute the 55th place among 100 best employers of Germany. 
The institute provides an annual top list of German employers. 
It questions about it employee as contently them with her work and her job sphere are and looks at the basic conditions of the employees. 
Personnel manager Stübe also hopes for pluses with the job-searching from the order. 
"I think that applicants look particularly after external assessments about a potential employer," she says. 
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding academy discusses enterprise which want to be based a good call as an employer with a long-term strategy. 
He advises his customer more authenticity. 
And this means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures. 
"The best way to make itself attractive as an employer leads about own employees," he says. 
In the branch jargon the internal Employer Branding, so employer's brand education within own staff is called. 
"Contented employees are the best ambassadors." 
If one treats his people well and they identify with the enterprise, then they would completely advertise by itself with friends and friends to her employer. 
"This is like a play with gang," says Kriegler.
