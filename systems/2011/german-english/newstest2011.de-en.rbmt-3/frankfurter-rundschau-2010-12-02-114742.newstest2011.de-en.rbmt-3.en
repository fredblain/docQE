Controllers in the twilight 
The European food authority of Efsa would be infiltrated by the industry experimenting with genetic plants. 
Now the expert's group Testbiotech which gets on as an independent institute of the subsequent evaluation of the biotechnology formulates this reproach. 
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have well documented it," said Testbiotech boss Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich. 
The leader of the Efsa-expert's group for genetic-technically changed plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert are for many years also in the lobbyist's association of Ilsi under contract. 
He is paid by groups like Monsanto, Fastening or Bavarian. 
Kuiper has decisively co-operated in the Efsa-test regulations for genetic plants and stands with it in a clear conflict of interests, criticises Then. 
The Efsa regulations are sales-wise word by word with position papers of the Ilsi and deceive with it the manuscript of the industry which should be controlled, actually, by the authority in the Italian Parma. 
It is already the second spot that Testbiotech criticises an interest collision. 
Thus a high-ranking Efsa manager is recently without editions or transition period to the Swiss agrarian group of Syngenta - and has changed with it the sides. 
Also the Medium German broadcasting company (MDR) had recently revealed personnel connections between controlling EU authority and industrial lobby what has made the federal environment office just as EU parliamentarian light dependent. 
The Efsa can recognise meanwhile no conflict of interests. 
One falls back on all serious data, also on such of the industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, one says in a statement. 
From the experts who work for Efsa one does not require that they have no contacts with the industry. 
However, they would have to disclose this. 
Kuiper puts away his work for the Internationally Life Sciences institutes of (Ilsi) in the USA. 
This calls himself neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among the rest, to the risk evaluation for biotechnology without lobby order. 
In the thing independent experts criticise like Then that genetic-technically changed plants are admitted currently without every feeding attempt with animals and the reaction by genetic plants is not tested for environmental factors. 
"We want to know what, for example, genetic-technically changed maize on the field makes," says Then. 
Present practise is to test merely isolated proteins, but not the whole genetic plant what delivers no dependable results. 
"If one does not search the risks, how should one find them then?," asks Then reproachfully. 
This also sees Angelika Hilbeck in such a way. 
The scientist does research since 1994 in the genetic engineering and is active currently in the Technical college of Zurich. 
The industry tries in this area like in the USA now also in Europe more and more to influence critical scientists or to discredit. 
Therefore, there is hardly researcher who are not interwined with groups. 
For enterprise critical studies would not be published as a rule. 
"The industry controls the security research," states Hilbeck.
