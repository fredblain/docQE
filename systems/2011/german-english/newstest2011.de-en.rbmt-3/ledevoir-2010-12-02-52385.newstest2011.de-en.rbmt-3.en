Barometre to verantworungsbewußten consumptions - The "green" label does not inspire confidence 
Green, but point-blank doubtfully. 
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence in the main actors of the lasting growth, however, just as little to the marked brands or the ecological markings which should steer his choice. 
It is a pity, although it has a bath in a media-oriented universe where it is swarming with information in favour of a more responsible consumption only so: the barometre to responsible consumptions has to deplore a lack of plausible information, an inadequacy which marks itself as a brake of his engagement, as the first reading pointed which was held yesterday. 
Although they have sped up the consumption of the so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the Quebecer still seem to those which try to sell this to give little loan. 
Two thirds of the Quebecer population admits giving, indeed, to the environmental engagement of the companies to just as little faith like the green enterprise advertisement, ingenious measuring instrument betrays from the responsible consumer centre of the university of Sherbrooke. 
Another findings: half of the consumers doubts the trustworthiness of the official, to the putatively fair products to added certificates, but also the credibility of the products and brands which declare themselves as environment-conscious, according to the barometre. 
After the same pattern the discourse of the politicians is taken seriously on this subject of only 14.6% of the Quebecer population. 
Anyhow the information concerning responsible consumptions seems importantly to the stimulation of this consumption segment which is animated at the moment by roughly only one third of the Quebecer consumers. 
Indeed, emptiness and dubious character of the information damped the zeal of 46% of the consumers. 
This is after the higher price of the products the second brake identified on the part of the barometre. 
Moreover, there faces one third of the Quebecer of the given efficiency of the green products and services which one tries hard to lay to them to the hand distrustfully. 
According to another communication had already changed about half of the consumers in 2010 her habits and mainly had changed the brand of one or several products to give expression to her conviction. 
According to barometre they had also preferred to 61% of purchases with traders of her town quarter and had favoured the purchase of food tilled in her region. 
Green and more responsibly - the index of the environment-conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value from 100 this year - the homo consumus of Quebec loves to present himself as a king of the recycling who tries to reduce his tracks hinterlassenen in the environment, while he looks after the protection of animals. 
However, the social and ecological consciousness still seems to stop at his car, according to the barometre: just 28% of the Quebecer have bragged, in 2010 have used public means of transportation or the agency for arranged lifts to have preferred to demonstrate her ecological interest. 
The Zufußgehen as well as the bicycle driving were also recommended from 39.1% of the participants of this comprehensive behavioral survey which feeds the stereotype images.
