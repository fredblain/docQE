German bank searches a buyer for her twin's storms 
German bank wants to separate from her landmark: According to a newspaper report the monetary house searches buyer for both office towers in her Frankfurt head office. 
Up to 500 million euros the real estate could introduce. 
Scarcely German bank has made her group seat pretty: The twin's storms in the Frankfurt bank quarter have been modernised; in the meantime, the bankers were allowed back again to her old job. 
However, now the finance group wants to get out the costs for the renovation apparently again - and looks for a buyer for both high rises as the "Financial Times of Germany" write with reference to a speaker. 
The speaker did not call reasons for the planned sales. 
"We always check whether it is more sensible to own real estates independently or to sell and afterwards zur√ºckzumieten," he said. 
With it the biggest loan institute of Germany delivers his company headquarters already after a short time again. 
The bank had taken over the double towers only in the middle of 2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of an in-house fund and afterwards had redeveloped extravagantly. 
The energetic rebuilding devoured to the information after about 200 million euros. 
Sales would probably bring a lot of money to the bank. 
Branch experts estimate the value of the towers renamed in the meantime as "Greentowers" according to the newspaper at about 500 million euros. 
Whether the buildings are disposed once more to a fund in the possession of the bank or to an independent investor, is still open currently, said the speaker.
