To the hell, warrior! 
Does Splatter fit to the art cinema? 
The director Nicola Winding Refn plumbs with his fighter's epic "Walhalla Rising" old genre borders anew. 
To which audience may the Danish director Nicola Winding Refn have thought when he has turned "Walhalla Rising"? 
A caught Viking's warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) escapes from his torturers and puts down with nearly supernatural forces by the dozen his opponents - sounds ideally for young male spectators in search of bloody action, just because our hero helps himself with pleasure of rough homicide methods and tears from his enemies already the intestines from the living body if he has bad mood. 
On the other hand, says Einauge how he is called actual, the whole film about no word, and also the other figures get involved only sometimes to or two sentences or some agonising death yelling thrill. 
But is quiet and indulged itself in the creepily nice hill scenery of Scotland which offers the scenery to the Viking's world from about thousand years ago. 
Ideally rather for adult cineastes with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera journeys. 
Nice if a film has several target groups, a pity only if they exclude themselves mutually. 
Director Winding Refn is valid since his wild and stylish drug dealer's trilogy "pusher" as a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, however, refuses stoic to make his works with a little bit more humor to the mainstream or a little less brutality to the Arthouse accessible. 
Most art cinema friends might be deterred from the around splashing cerebral mass and the intestines. 
The action fans die at the latest before boredom when Einauge for freely interpretable reasons with a troop opens more violently of Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and pins an eternity in stagnation and fog, before the team apparently comes in America and is quiet there further. 
No miracle that "Walhalla Rising" has found no film rental company in Germany and has appeared now only on DVD. 
This is particularly because of the splendid pictures misery, but also because behind pretentious to facade dripping with blood a sometimes exciting piece of cinema hides which has earned some attention. 
In this film it is not about dialogues or a stringent action, it is of all atmosphere, a film-become fever dream. 
And from him there is for the spectator no escape. 
Refn grants no moment of the relaxation to him and knots to him with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack quite slowly the throat, above all, however, with the unfathomable hatred which confronts him from the hearts of the figures. 
Only a small blond boy, the Einauge faithfully aside stands, retains integrity a sort of innocence, all the others are done by rage. 
In the most one the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained who becomes, however, for enemies and temporarily allies sometime the warrior from the hell, possibly to the ambassador of the devil himself. 
He means downfall, maybe, however, even for the anyway spoilt. 
"Walhalla Rising" is a puzzling film which one can hate and admire, for annoying, exciting and amazement. 
An experience.
