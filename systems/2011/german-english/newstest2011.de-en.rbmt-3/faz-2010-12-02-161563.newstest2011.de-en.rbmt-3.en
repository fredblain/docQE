The egg university 
In "Gelato University" near Bologna ice confectioners are prepared for better seasons. 
The 3-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the biggest inflow and visitor from the whole world. 
Where from does the whole ice come, actually? 
From the Gelatiere and from the Gelataio. 
The Gelatiere, on the a little bit ancient ice confectioner in German, produces the cream according to all rules of the Italian ice doer art. 
The Gelataio gets the ice cream from the chill bar with a spatula, strokes them in the waffle and then sells them. 
To know this, one must not go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province Bologna. 
But who would like to know even more about ice, that does not go past to the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani. 
The manufacturer of ice makers has furnished the egg university in 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines does justice everywhere to the high Italian ideals. 
The 3-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the biggest inflow and visitor from all over the world. 
However, there are also special courses of several days all around the chocolate ice cream and training periods in the in-house ice-cream parlour. 
Some dreams in the Midlife-Crisis of a new career, others simply venture sometimes on the smooth ice of her vague longings. 
These are this spot 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil via Hungary to Saudi Arabia. 
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow Food movement and wants to offer in the country of the industrial Ice-Cream in future a European high-class product. 
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and wants to bag after years in a nerve-wracking job something own. 
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice-cream parlour in Cairo. 
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in her bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream. 
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream to the participants first. 
There is vital not only good taste, but also the silky litheness and the good consistency. 
Luciano forgets with his training, however, also not the cream bonnet of the national and generally südländischen superstructure: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then a lot of romanticism is still present." 
The first step to the production seems quite easy. 
Luciano tilts the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a big blender which heats up with an electronic programme everything on 85 degrees and cools then immediately on four degrees. 
Then he turns up in the machine a cock, and out there comes a pasteurised white base cream, basis for all milk ice kinds. 
Immediately the lecturer with questions is stormed: Can one produce ice cream only with natural materials without stabilizer? 
How does one leave to own experimental desire free run? 
Luciano warns against letting mislead from the spirit of the times. 
Who talks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients," has used possibly, nevertheless, stabilizers - mostly a natural product, possibly Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne. 
Of course one can produce ice also without stabilizer, then only it must be sold within one day, but it slumps in itself, and the customer bites on nothing but ice granule. 
Certain variations in the basic mass are permitted. 
More full of suspense it becomes with the aromas. 
For the taste in the ice maestro Luciano makes a distinction between the ingredients which one buys in the fruit department or with the sweets of the supermarket. 
Besides, there is gives powder and pastes. 
"The suppliers will try everybody to turn on dozens flavoured additions to you." 
"Nevertheless, you should simply experiment sometimes." 
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits. 
Or just with the ice cream from the white basic mass which becomes with eggs the yellow cream and with cocoa powder to the basis for all possible chocolate seduction. 
Now the course participants are allowed to the ice makers. 
Luciano lets them in each case produce four different kinds of vanilla egg, chocolate egg, mocha egg and hazelnut egg - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with vanilla aroma more or less or other natural additions. 
The water ice kinds are also submitted to the same experiment. 
More flavouring materials, more fruit puree - are not necessarily better in taste this. 
Of hazelnut egg tastes not necessarily nussiger if it contains more hazelnuts. 
The most popular kiwi egg produces the working group which uses more fruits, less waters and a little less stabilizer. 
Only a well-balanced mixture emphasises the taste of a Gelato properly, says Luciano. 
Ice production is an arithmetic job: If peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar portion must be reduced in the basic prescription. 
An extra serving sugar is necessary for lemon ice. 
Luciano pulls a device out with which he determines the sugar salary of the fruit kinds (winegrowers measure with it the Oechsle in the grape must). 
Luckily tables make easier the Rechnerei. 
To make ice does not require any more so much physical application as earlier. 
Not only the device for the automatic production of the basic mass helps. 
There is also a device in which the ready egg mixture is hit at the same time creamy and is cooled on deficit temperatures. 
Of all automation in spite of small breakdowns are not missing. 
The Brazilian Gustavo bespatters himself and his course colleagues from the top to the bottom with fruit puree when the colossal stick barman gets to him out of control. 
"In every course," believes maestro Luciano, "it is only one matter of time, to such a thing it happens."
