More and more parents want person-supervision devices to have the kids under control 
The fear around own children grows and thus more and more parents consider supervising them by GPS. 
The system which was invented originally to the search after cars can locate because as well people what would be also helpful in such cases, how recently with the disappearance without a trace of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková. 
The device is possibly as big currently as, however, a cigarette box might not be bigger soon it, than a wristwatch. 
The case of the disappeared Anička has moved many people into fear and terror and thus they keep after means and ways a lookout to protect her children better. 
Also for the price of an interference of her private sphere. 
"We try to say all that it is on no account a matter, on this occasion, about Herumspionieren, but to reduce effective means, the likelyhood that it comes to the tragedy," Petr Pilin of the society of Macro Because states, one of the suppliers of GPS-detection devices at the Czech market. 
"I admit that it can come in particular cases to the abuse of such devices, for example if one puts it to somebody in the pocket, without he knows about it, but we had to register up to now no such case." 
"Most customers really buy it for safety reasons to themselves," Pilin adds. 
However, according to his opinion the child should always know which purpose the "box" serves and how one uses them if necessary. 
Nevertheless, the child psychologist Dana Bočková points out to the fact that a child if it may not carry such a thing it simply rids himself his. 
"Also very small children show big creativity if it is a matter of losing intentionally certain things if they do not want to be controlled." 
"In the beginning already the mobile phones woke up big expectations in the parents, but they can be switched off as easily, like these new supervision devices," means Mrs. Bočková. 
In her opinion it is also argumentative whether such an equipment helps in case of an attack really. 
"By planned kidnapping the kidnapper controls practically always whether the child has some electronics with himself with which it could be located." 
"Today it is the mobile phone." 
"If such supervision devices found broader use, they would also search this, because her sales would be certainly accompanied by massive advertisement." 
"In these cases the criminals of the police are always a 1 step ahead," believes the psychologist. 
Nevertheless, she puts away that similar devices can be absolutely helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile. 
Roberta Čech of the society RC according to monitoring, the detection services for cars, as well as for people offers, the existence of such a device can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack. 
"The device is regulated because in such a way that it announces the respective position in certain intervals." 
"Even if it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the affected person is available." 
"By more expensive devices even an inclination knife is integrated, that is if one falls down and remains lying without moving, the device sends immediately a warning under information of the position," states Mr. Čech. 
According to his opinion similar services could also do intelligent mobile phones with navigation, one needs to play in only one special software. 
The problem of the present detection devices consists in the fact that it is, on this occasion, either about devices in match box size which resemble followers or around smaller mobile phones. 
Always so the danger insists that one loses them. 
One tests Mr. Pilin of the Macro Because according to, hence, in the present the devices which look like normal digital watches. 
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker must not recognise at all that it concerns a supervision or detection device. 
"Or he notices only after certain time what gives a time projection to the police," he adds. 
All the same, in which direction the development goes - to bracelets or followers, always is used, besides, the same technology, how with the vehicle detection. 
So around the combination of detection function with the help of the GPS system (just as with the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone which announces the topical position.
