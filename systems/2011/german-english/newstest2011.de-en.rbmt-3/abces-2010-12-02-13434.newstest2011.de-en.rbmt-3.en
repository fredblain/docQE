PP demands of Mas a postponement of the tax arrangement 
Yesterday the chairperson of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, perceived the opportunity to present her conditions to the support of his assumption of office as a Prime Minister of the Generalitat to Artur Mas personally. These do not differ from already during the election campaign put and can be summarised with the priority of the economic reimpetus and omitting by regionalistischen independence adventures, like a financial adjustment arrangement which the regionalistische leader wants to suggest at the height of his mandate. 
The chairperson of the Catalan People's Party turned with the security to Artur Mas which you lent 18 representatives whom she had won on the last Sunday - a figure which is more than enough to feel inalienable. Since the candidate of the middle-class regionalistischen party of CiU depends on the fact that at least one of the opposition parties abstains by the vote with his assumption of office of the voice. 
The future alliances who want to enter the regionalists at the coming parliamentary elections in the congress depend on a possible entente with the PP. The conversations, the Mas at the moment with the remaining party chiefs carries on, however, turn on Catalonia. 
What concerns the party leader of the PPC, she demands that to the support of the assumption of office "all discourses which concern the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as an arrangement about the financial adjustment between state and the autonomous region - like in the Basque Provinces - and which the party chief of CiU wants to subject even to a referendum are done behind. 
To both political leaders it is common that they want to make the blown out political apparatus of the regional management more slender and abolish the death tax and gift tax. 
With the details of the negotiations to the assumption of office of Mas deal vonseiten Jordi PPC Cornet and Dolors Montserrat. 
Mas Hut sich bereits mit Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - der eine harte Opposition ankündigte - und Joan Herrera (ICV) getroffen. Heute wird er mit Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) und Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana) zusammenkommen.
