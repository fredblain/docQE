</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The encoded vocabulary, which was introduced in the verflossenen era of Mayor Pavel Bém Prague by the political elite, some of the best-known actors, borrowed from situations and Causae. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Surprisingly, it turns out that the new councils in relation to these new terminology. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The claim, at least. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Anyone who is Voldemort?" </seg>
<seg id="8"> "No idea." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am a newcomer in the Prague policy", Lukáš Kaucký, the new councillor for Culture, the test of the "Godfather vocabulary." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But also the Council, Mr Karel Březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar way. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example, the term'golf hole ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "This is the only expression of those who put me here, I use now and then." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "I do not think much of slang." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> From the vocabulary, which was published in aktuálně. Cz days in this year's June before the election of the ODS, the editorial pickte six concepts, particularly those that are associated with the notoriously Prague magistrate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Social Democrats, the term "Voldemort ',' biggest Prague golf hole" in the culinary, "bull neck" treason "and" verblechen ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Three Prague gentlemen of the Council approved the test, the fourth - Mr Weinert, the head of the Prague education - promised to begin his participation in the conversation, but not even the handset. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The council, Mr Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "I don't care about these things are, and how the Civic Democrats, I do not." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "For me, it is how we understand ourselves in our programmes" he responded. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> As indicated, Lukáš Kaucký in the abovementioned headline allegedly failed to recognize that the influential entrepreneurs and friend of the former Lord Mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The term "Voldemort" Kaucky says nothing and the only one that he erriet correctly, the test was "the biggest Prague golf hole". </seg>

<p>
<seg id="22"> "This is the Blanka tunnels" says Kaucký, added to safety but added: "but I know this from the newspaper." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> "Golf hole" will not only of matador Karel Březina deciphered, but also by the Council, Commissioner for the Environment Lukáš Plachý right as a tunnel Blanka deciphered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Both Democrats also know, however, for whom the term Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý knows even when this figure is and what it means to "go into the Konditorei". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> ", that is, I believe in some kind of Prague catering operation", Plachý is quite close to the conundrum solution, when we know that this is the headquarters of Janoušeks firms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> In line with Březina claimed, however, this knowledge acquired from the newspaper, rather than this vocabulary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The test participants, there seems to be under the Social Democrats actually no similar naturalisations slang. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I have asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing for us." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "We call upon us, and we also use words or nicknamed", says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - from his party comrades colloquially "Hulda". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "At school I was Bříza (birch), but I do not know whether my colleagues" tells us Karel Březina his nickname. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The newspaper Deník aktuálně. Cz has tried and behold - he works. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Councillor Weinert is for the party of the "grandfather" or the "old", the Representative Miroslav Poche machinations, before the elections, the party's sponsorship attention to some of my colleagues, "Igráček" (Czech Lego figure). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Nicknames are the only one that allow the Social Democrats, whose language. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Hulínský may not claim, "Hulda", but Deník aktuálně. Cz registered another nickname of Prague. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="35"> Gaudí worked but also with a modern approach to mutual combination of rooms. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The social part is by opening the showroom doors completely and while a larger society without having to take vertraulicheren talks on a certain intimacy. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="2"> The tollste bed frame, but the quality of the deck area - the good bed mattress and rust. </seg>
<seg id="3"> These must complement each other, in order to meet the wishes of the specific user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In choosing to play a role - the weight, size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the Schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Equally important is the Interieur, mattress and rust. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a weekend house In which are not regularly, are not Latex mattresses, because they need much longer, "hot". </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition, they are much more difficult than usual Polyurethan mattresses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And, they should be changed regularly. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If they do not have enough Entlüftungskanälchen at its core, and on a hard disk, moisture movement: it is not excluded that tape from it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Of course, also plays a role in the election, which is used to. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Anyone who has been a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with Weichschicht, will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with hard surface. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "All ice hockey players who have returned from the NHL, have complained to me that they cannot sleep properly." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "For their abgeschundenen shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a Weichschicht from Visco sparkling (memory Foam - a form of memory Polymer)." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I recommend including diabetic people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, causing the" information "from the ligaments and skin badly" said Sylva Hadamcziková who specialised in padded furniture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> That is why I have many years ago ice hockey players, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco sparkling (Memory foam). </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Today, it is no longer a problem, because such mattresses provide the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And we must not necessarily be a famous ice hockey players, the benefits of the Visco surfactants, to learn. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" actually works quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The sparkling optimalisiert his toughness and form the heat absorbed, in other words, he schmiegt by a warm body. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Nowhere is there, in the night shifts are not around, after a major battle. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It is simply sleeping much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The viskoelastische sparkling also offers protection against Dekubitus (advising). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In the election of the mattress size should add to body size is still the length of the foot soles, or some 21 to 34 cm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Man and woman who are in the 180 cm tall, need a 210 to 220 cm bed. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Each of the sleepers should be at least 90 cm space available, 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In separate beds, for example, In singles, 120 to 140 cm. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The comfort, and also for any visitors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise, the following rule of thumb for the ideal bed width: "if you on the back, should be enough room for the easy angewinkelten arms" advises every Helena Prokopová, the guild of the Polsterer and Raumausstatter, which for many years the issue of healthy makes and the ergonomics of furniture and at specialist schools. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> In a double bed everybody needs its own rust and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are also high. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise, there is nothing for it, as the Roste in differing degrees to fit and it is not possible for each bed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with the skeleton 15 cm, should account for at least three centimetres in the form of class and fine cushion. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "With the hand or placing may feel the feathers in any case" warns Helen Prokopová. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Any mattress requires a special type of rust. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document as union of Siam twins have to be found in the bedroom. </seg>
<seg id="36"> These mattresses are not and cannot wash, which is already common practice today. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And since you lose in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 litres of sweat, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years, becoming a huge (And congested sieve). </seg>
<seg id="38"> Experts also reject advertising slogans, the mattress with a lifespan of up to 25 years, and even a lifetime guarantee. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Every case has its ifs and buts. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And it is therefore a practical advice from dealers: mattress of 120 or 140 cm width should the hygiene of waschbaren, not abziehbaren salary, however, it is recommended to use a Matratzenschoner, and wash it easily. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even if Rundumreißverschluss usually mattresses salary with Rundumreißverschluss, so you get after the opening two halves (immensely important for the washing process and the washing machines size!), is the manipulation with larger mattresses, above all, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> They are in bed instead of a Rostes a record? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Get Out! </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or, for a bed for undesirable guests and for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> So should the disk with ventilation holes (if not included) use and mattresses with the skeleton and 15 cm minimum level with the Taschenfederkern and fine cushion. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethan mattresses are not in such a document. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For not verstellbare Roste setting with 14 to 18 (Lamellen) are Latex or sandwich mattresses (also combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay Roste with a larger number of standards, from 28 and more to do with Lordosenstütze in Lendenwirbelbereich and the ability to regulate the tough standards. </seg>
<seg id="48"> On verstellbare Lamellen Roste no mattresses with the skeleton, because they do not respond to the workplace ergonomics disguise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> In addition to the suspension of the Steife will be offered special flexible shoulder modules. </seg>
<seg id="50"> This is about a specific fastening the services that makes it possible einzudrücken the pen, or to verwinkeln so that they allow the specific Einsinken the shoulder of the Schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Especially for men with broad shoulders, an important matter. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There are even mattress manufacturers, which have started, "gentlemen mattresses" Weichzonen for the shoulder area. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The ladies - is intended to give these Weichzonen in the Hüftgegend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For ambitious customers are punktelastische Flügelfedersysteme (Lattoflex) or Roste with punktelastischen Pads contact with the Multitorsionsfederung. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure will be distributed at several points, thus reducing the tension. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But - if the right mattress and rust a bad (too large and fülliges) used pillow, spent most of the benefits. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Here, too, a rule of thumb: the pillow to prop up the head, his top should extend only to the shoulders, so that the back muscles relax. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Ideal is therefore a 50 x 60 cm deep cushions, as it may, for example, the Scandinavians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In the pages of the pillow (along with the Schulterentlastungszone in rust or the Weichzone in the mattress) make up the back. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Some of our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (but) straw bags with hay. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern companies increasingly use natural materials, or at least their mixtures. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Also in mattresses says the new magic word "organic". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of oil raw materials used in the manufacture of Polyurethan foaming having increasingly naturelle oils - for example, Rizinus and soya oil. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soya is used well known by all manufacturers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> "Organic mattresses, which says its nuclear materials is purely natural" said Petr Vašíček by the company Tropico Plus. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Naturstoffe but also to be used in the manufacture of mattresses - one of the first was Aloe Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> But one can also micro capsules, which spread the sleeping fresh forest or Lavendelduft. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Here is a difference between a man and a woman. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While the men "kühlender" plant extracts from birch leaves, so that the mattress to absorb the heat and cool the body can have the salary for women "wärmende" effect. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Extracts from red Paprikaschoten stimulate the blood circulation, the weaker sex when the sleeping wohlig warm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> And today's favorite? </seg>
<seg id="72"> Mattresses from Kaltschaum (he has greater Poren with destroyed cell structure and is therefore atmungsaktiver than standard Polyurethan and much more flexible). </seg>
<seg id="73"> Through the combination of the various Steife (severity) of Kaltschäumen and Visco foaming having additional zones mattresses, who know exactly where to head, hip and heels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> For a quality mattress, though, has to fork out 7000 kroner and more. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Gesundheitsmatratzen but usually with lower value added tax, since they apply as medical device. </seg>
<seg id="76"> The first Czech companies was Gumotex this advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> You see, the mattress and not to save the rust is so easily. </seg>
<seg id="78"> And there are special offers from manufacturers and retailers who offer two mattresses for the price of one. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The brand Magniflex the mattress Duofreeze with in relation verstepptem Visco sparkling Memory for 11.990 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="80"> The second you get free. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the Tempur material that launched the era of viskoelastischen sparkling substances with open cell structure and high density in almost kosmischem pace. </seg>
<seg id="82"> No wonder, when they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to the launch of enormous excessive impositions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83"> Tempur will heat in soft, entrenched in a cool environment it again. </seg>
<seg id="84"> So it suits the human body and distributed in an optimal manner the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="85"> It is therefore not only an ideal to prevent fire, but generally increased sleep comfort. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86"> Viskoelastische sparkling substances are not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as the, in particular Fußpolstern, allowing the legs and the factors that facilitate. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Domestic manufacturers, for example, the sparkling substances Eucatherm C, Twin KiwiSaver or similar products. </seg>

<seg id="6"> "At this stage, I can only confirm that the police a person for the offence of fraudulent practices in a public competition" said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner prosecutor of the newspaper Právo ", further details could provide them with regard to the ongoing investigation. </seg>
<seg id="7"> 24 hours later was released the 46 - year-old entrepreneur from the police. </seg>
<seg id="8"> How he was able to manipulate the public competition, we can speculate about the lack of official information. </seg>

<seg id="15"> Obviously against a fat compensation. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It would also be a sufficient explanation as to why he had such a large amount of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Luboš g. had in the past too good contacts with the Pilsner soil fund. </seg>
<seg id="18"> So he played in the issue of the former head of the land fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted because he failed to substitute restitution of properties, which have been passed already location decisions. </seg>
<seg id="19"> At the time Luboš g. acquired the land fund, for example, land intended to build public roads, where was the construction of the access to the area Borské pole was planned. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Later he exchanged this very well with the government against a house directly in the historic centre of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land. </seg>

<seg id="4"> In the audience may have thought the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn, as he "Valhalla Rising"? </seg>
<seg id="5"> A captured Vikings warriors with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) freed himself from his tormentors and with almost superhuman forces multitudes of his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody Action, precisely because our hero like rough killing methods and his enemies the Gedärme from the vibrant, if he has a bad mood. </seg>

<seg id="8"> Ideal for adult Cineasten with interest for Existenzialismus and very calm camera. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="9"> Well, if a film has several target groups, it is a shame, if they are mutually exclusive. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Director Winding Refn since his wild and gestylten drug dealers trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, refuses to stoically, his works with more humor the mainstream or something less brutality, Arthouse accessible. </seg>

<seg id="12"> The latest action fans die before boredom, if Einauge from freely suspensive reasons with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and an eternity in doldrums and fog, before the team apparently in America and silent. </seg>

<seg id="18"> Only a small blonder boy, the Einauge faithful to one side, something like innocence, all others are driven by anger. </seg>

<seg id="6"> Her name appeared in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, built with Syria allegedly with help from North Korea in the Quader, hidden in a valley, the electricity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing of the U.S. foreign intelligence agency CIA at the end of April 2008, also under the name of the near town el Kibar normal reactor to produce plutonium - from which to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes against the technology from the fifties. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA has produced a video presentation with blurred satellite images. </seg>
<seg id="10"> By Computeranimation it, where the components of the reactor fell before the destruction, the copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear centre. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In addition, the show photographs of the building from the vicinity show or even the atrium. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor was just before the operation, it said, but not yet with fuel prongs peppers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more than it was then known, the mystery of the time. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The former U.S. President George w. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack was quite sure that Syria in el Kibar built a reactor, but hardly points of reference to ensure that the country, "an active nuclear weapons program." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some intelligence officers in Europe are still cautious and speak only of a "alleged reactor" even if the CIA presentation for "plausible". </seg>
<seg id="16"> You lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Asked how he was sure to have a reactor, a senior u. n. diplomat in the summer only briefly, the IAEA "enough material to ask questions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The rubble of the alleged "unused military building", the Syrians eager and planierten thoroughly premises. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Nevertheless, took place in June 2008 an IAEA team under former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el Kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Also received the IAEA on a Member State satellite images of commercial providers from the period immediately after the attack, the more meaningful than the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, to get these recordings on the market, because of the purchaser - perhaps Israel - she has bought exclusively. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The IAEA could not verify their authenticity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always claimed that has never been a secret nuclear program or built a nuclear reactor. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium came from The Israeli weapons, said Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then, refuses to Damascus to discuss - as well as on the satellite images. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The inspectors also denied a second inspection in el Kibar and access to the wreckage of the bombed-out building. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But Israel maintains an iron. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We will never comment on" said recently at the time of the attack, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> As the investigation of the case has dragged on since June 2008 fruitless and "becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority" a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - after all, is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is monitored the IAEA. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As a key to progress in the investigation, the IAEA apparently three other facilities, the "functional link" with the alleged reactor - and differently than this. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The inspectors have so far not openly what it is, or what they are or what they seem suspicious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally as Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived from nearby towns. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and on satellite images of a building complex in Masyaf, which is probably one of the suspects are objects. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It is probably in or adjacent to a military base - with this justification, Syria, the IAEA access to the three locations. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The IAEA In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that will be sent on ahead of the United States, military installations, foiling. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Since the nuclear detectives were turned off by the U.S. secret services to the facilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos that was transported between the three locations and the Quader the Euphrates material. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A senior Western diplomat in Vienna, could at least one of the plants' in connection with the fuel production ". </seg>
<seg id="40"> But there was "no evidence of sensitive activities" uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes, which are necessary to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The type of reactor will not enriched uranium, which is. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But where the uranium could have come from and where it should be separated from it later the plutonium for the bomb, on these key issues are there any plausible assumptions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> It is also unclear whether debris that could involve the valuable traces, were stored in three places. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As if the burden of hundreds of truckloads have disappeared, nobody wants information on the ground, where the rubble. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Only a few kilometres from el Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, salt mine al Tibni, has studied the Syria 1998 on their suitability as a camp for radioactive waste, the IAEA as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had it in a recent analysis of satellite images for the venerable magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Started from the orbiting show that Syria to the three places Erdarbeiten and large container, after the IAEA access. </seg>
<seg id="48"> This may be a coincidence, but has little to dispel the suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> In addition, they say in diplomatic circles, have used the IAEA several months to develop a plan for inspections, which should allow Syria to maintain military secrets - shows the amount of how much interest the inspectors. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Meanwhile, Damascus has smoothed this proposal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Had reassured Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, therefore no urgency, as U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months so-called special inspections, one of the harshest means that the Vienna nuclear authority to enforce controls. </seg>
<seg id="52"> IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, these inspections should suggest, has been "an option, for which I am in the future", but he is hesitant. </seg>
<seg id="53"> There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it needs a majority of the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries are anything but eager for an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other hand, as a diplomat: "What if they end up with nothing?" </seg>

<seg id="8"> First, the good mood in Latin America </seg>
<seg id="9"> And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In many countries of the South Pacific coast has increased the democratic movement here (Table 1). </seg>
<seg id="11"> In Peru, for example, where the economy is growing at an annual rate of around 6% since 2002, the number of democracy advocates from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. </seg>

<seg id="15"> About 34% trust Congress and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but a sharp increase from 2003 (17% or 24%). </seg>

<seg id="17"> Also during the world economic crisis, it may be that the countries of Latin America only a brief recession, and have recovered quickly. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, the poor through a stronger social network. </seg>
<seg id="19"> (According to reports from the u. n. Economic Commission for Latin America this week, 2009, the poverty rate in Latin America only slightly, and has fallen this year at 32%.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But there are strong differences from country to country (s. graph 4). </seg>
<seg id="21"> Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread progress thinking. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In Mexico and Central America, where the recession mount was increased violence and crime, this is less the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The rising economic performance is reflected in the strong support of the private sector and the market economy: around 71% of respondents at said that the private sector for the development, in 2007 there were 56% (s. graph 6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can bring their country progress, compared with 47% last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela this view (and 80% are maintained for a private sector), although their leftist President, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private companies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil has had 19% of respondents (18% last year), the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year). </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband, Argentina's President Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, their popularity rate by 20 points to 50%. this is the highest value since its election in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Whether her, but next year to a re-election, depends on whether the visibly in Cristina Fernández may be more willing than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The signs are not clear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Néstor Kirchner, who drew even after the election of his wife's economic policy, often budgets, tax revenues, the economic growth and inflation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This allowed the president to spend the extra revenue at will. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On paper, the Fernández government last year, the majority in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27, leading to further rifts. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten rallying around Cristina Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But after chaotic meetings (where a member of another in the face and others accused the government of corruption), the Congress failed to pass the budget for 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I will not discuss it" the President. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The 2010 budget is now for the next year, which the President has more opportunity to spend money as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy is hot: they probably will grow this year by up to 9%. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official inflation rate is z. z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands from the unions - the value of nearly 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was beset by economic crises, growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not the reduction of inflation. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He refused to cooperate with the IMF, for the private sector and säuberte the National Institute for Statistics and census INDEC schönte then the official inflation Statistics. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Fernández can take a mäßigeren path? </seg>
<seg id="18"> She has called on the private sector and the trade union leaders to talks. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And according to official statements, wage increases next year to 18%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the inflation undermined the growth spurt through a large devaluation in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Perhaps join Cristina Fernández for this reason Argentina economic terms to the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Earlier this year, the government has an agreement with shareholders, who had rejected the previous rescheduling of the country in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Now seems to push Fernández on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which it owes about $6.7 billion. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Kirchners had a review by the IMF, as elsewhere, rejected. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But last month, the Economics Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund in the drafting of a new national consumer price index "technical assistance". It looks as if this is the first step towards the cleansing of the INDEC. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not known whether Fernández after leaving office without the support of her husband politically active. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which have had enough of kirchnerism. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the Argentines in March from their summer holidays, the wave of sympathy, which has been shown to be fizzled. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If they want to win another election, must decide whether to lift many political decisions of her husband quietly. </seg>

<seg id="4"> On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all eligible voters in the city's five districts to elect mayors and city councils. This will be seen as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying jeou. </seg>
<seg id="5"> By building cutting-edge business relations, einschl. A partial free trade agreement, Ma is itself a symbol for relations with the mainland. Its policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mainland for the first time since 1949. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Ma has passed the test, but only just. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Although his Kuomintang party (KMT), three of the five mayors, they received a majority of votes. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the vote, the KMT was 45%. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In a presidential election would mean for Ma problems. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Since his election two years ago was the vote of his party by around 8%. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For the first time, together with the KMT, the DPP even in town councils. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as convoys of lorries with rioters, flags schwenkende mass parades and only scantily clad dancers. </seg>
<seg id="13"> There were even compulsory, mysterious assassination attempt. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, on the eve of the election in a speech to a KMT candidate. </seg>

<seg id="16"> Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter Lien kill or wanted to settle a dispute with the candidates. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Regardless of the attack, according to Tsai every whom, the leader of the DPP, the election and the DPP in a bad light, which has brought the KMT more votes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> China was perhaps the biggest winners in the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It was not the relations with the mainland. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Instead, the candidates have plans for social housing and job creation of jobs. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat. </seg>
<seg id="22"> For this reason, the KMT their relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But this time, the DPP, the Chinese feelings too much. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Ma, for its part, would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese its China policy. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy to attract Taiwan with economic incentives in the community. </seg>
<seg id="27"> China sent a negotiator in Taipei, for a summit to investment security and medical cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Certainly wants a political integration. But first things first. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is therefore prefer until after the presidential elections in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The DPP has reinvented itself now. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Two years ago, it was weakened sharply: the former party leader Chen Shui bian sat in jail for corruption. </seg>
<seg id="32"> During his presidency from 2000 to 2008 he stood for the complete independence. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But under Tais reign, a new generation gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the professionals and the youth. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Tsai was adopted as the DPP's presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng chang under Chen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Their party is doing everything to show that they, too, is in a position to build close relations with Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Tsai is planning a tank as a contact point between the DPP and China. However, this requires broad discussions. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Tsai stated publicly that their party a "credible alternative" to Mas • rapprochement with China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Chen seems very angry about this change. </seg>
<seg id="39"> From his cell, he said, the candidate of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence. </seg>
<seg id="40"> He urged the pragmatists Su even to renounce the presidential candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even without interference, the DPP to choose their possible candidates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The KMT will have to undergo its own introspection. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Ma's values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidate wanted to campaign without him. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The main reason for his unpopularity seem unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="45"> According to a KMT spokesman will transform his cabinet and the local institutions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> The strong performance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan a rapprochement only limited. </seg>
<seg id="47"> At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese economic cooperation with China as inevitable. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The discovery of an alien species of bacteria, which can live of arsenic, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is a sign that a life without the previously deemed as vital elements. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="4"> "This organism has two options." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="7"> So far, have been six main regarded as vital elements - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="8"> But the scientists figured out how, the bacterium in mono Lake even further when it replaced phosphorus, arsenic. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="11"> The study deals with microbes, which have been found on Earth. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The announcement of a press conference in which no details were given to the discovery of known, led to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report by the discovery außerirdischen life. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "shows that can put in other Planetary systems, with the help of other elements biochemical processes and that the standard elements that are absolutely essential in our opinion, are not necessarily clear" said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. </seg>

<seg id="21"> "This is the organisms are difficult to distinguish one from the other." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers, the bacterium GFAJ- 1 arsenic concentration. It suited and grew. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The microbe grows in phosphorus better, but that they can survive in arsenic, shows that the way of life, of course, either on the ground or on another planet or moon, on the arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> According to Jamie s. Foster, President of microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that can be replaced phosphorus, arsenic, not new. but so far there has been no functioning example. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Can combine courtesy that which divides us? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> After a campaign of dirty words and negativity has erupted this week little civility in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It is the sign of a real Zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion, before returning to the struggle of the parties in the capital? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and Congressional produced no breakthrough in the big issues, during the so-called "lame duck" session, the meeting at the end of a government, in which no decisions had to be. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After all, what we hear, it was neither to govern a polite discussion between two sides of a consideration of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partisan collection points. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meeting of the deficit commission's president on Wednesday was very civilised, despite the political differences between the members. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months a mutual respect obtained of the ideological divide that separates the members. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> This is hardly enough to claim that it has entered a new era of cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise, while trying to weigh up the limits of public opinion and the voters' patience following a new parties warfare. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants at a minimum requirements or accusations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep for a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, might have been expected. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or benefits, the two sides are miles apart. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Last but not least, the November election, at least for a short time mild. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "No question, the tone has changed" said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, which is now for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center" works. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "This is inevitable after elections. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elections give partisan passions. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And that is a good thing. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In some areas, particularly In those who are on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. " </seg>
<seg id="19"> Bush's tax cuts end up at the end of the year, and no one advocates. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, either temporarily or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is expected to reach a compromise over the increased unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that supported the idea of tax cuts for the rich, while denying them unemployed workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House has increased optimism that these issues during the "lame duck" session and at the time to ratify the new START treaty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But warns William glass tone of the Brookings Insitution that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation between the parties, if the new 112th Congress convened in January. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead, he says, is a period of Nichtübereinstimmens likely, perhaps even inevitable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "After the things that need to be done, done, will turn this short-term psychology in confrontation" he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - the courtesy to gain their cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "I do not see much of what happens between now and 2012, when preliminaries, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012" he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Teeparty voters who were their education. </seg>
<seg id="29"> As the Republican leaders may be concerned that they vie too high, they know that they must try to their promise to cut government spending and to repeal the health care reform. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> This party lines are already in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include a tax reform and raising some taxes and raising the retirement age and reduce government spending. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have assumed that one of the toughest jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, so that the deficit issue on the public agenda that can be ignored no longer. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need within the Commission in 14 of 18 votes, in order to make its plan to official recommendation and they are struggling to come even close to this figure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The biggest opposition in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters, today at least, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Galton says two phases in the battle between the White House and Republicans in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The first battle will be held next year in the form of party clashes, if the Obama Republicans in the state budget, defying the taxes and the health system, then followed by a phase of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> The public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It is shown that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties together. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If confrontation in a cul-de-sac, as happened in 1995, both parties must have a careful look at the public reaction. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Whoever is doomed to lose, will change the course and must seek compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> This may indeed be an optimistic view. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Partisanship and polarization are greater today than in the mid-1990 s, and they seem more ideological divide between Obama and congressional Republicans than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a much broader election in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> So it may be that the courtesy which will be taken this week, will be welcomed by many americans. </seg>
<seg id="45"> But it will require both sides very much more difficult to find a common denominator in the issues that divide the two still. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide has announced the government of Belarus on Wednesday that will collect no longer highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting between the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The U.S. government had tried for years to persuade Russia to collect The more highly enriched uranium and seemed achieved last spring a hurdle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But the U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that were taken in the past two months, two secret agreements with Belarus to remove about 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research Institute. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This was the scene for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material, according to an official staff, which is due to the sensitivity of the issue of anonymously, about 500 pounds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuklearem security summit of 47 nations" in April, the had ruled Belarus. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And it was obviously well enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I was really excited by the fact that they have a seat on the nuclear Security summit (2012)." </seg>
<seg id="10"> "This proves that it works" said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Partnership, a group for the promotion of nuclear safety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, to secure within four years all vulnerable nuclear material. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since then, has helped the U.S. government six countries, to be its highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Belarus will be the seventh. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A dozen countries did so under the administration of George w. Bush. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At the time of Obama's Nuklearem security summit, the White Russian President Alexander Lukashenko said that the nation will never give up its uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally waffenfähig, and less enriched uranium" Lukashenko said at the time. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "This is our commodity. We are not dirty bombs, and we will sell it to anyone." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We use it solely for research purposes, that is all." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Belarus approached, however, a few months ago, the United States, when it signaled interest in meeting an agreement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The first attempt to remove the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly difficult because the material was easily contaminated by radiation, officials say. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It was loaded into a Spezialzug load, the more than 1.300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal of, say officials. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the officials by plane. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The U.S. government is paying for this $14 million, with much of the money flowing into the research with low-enriched uranium, which can be used for nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "This was a coordinated and, in order to build confidence" to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, which is working on the global threat reduction. </seg>

<seg id="6"> "De la Vega, Spain have no objection to the secret flights via Spanish territory." </seg>
<seg id="7"> "They want to be informed simply", not "unprepared to be surprised" said Aguirre via cable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the ambassador pointed out that the Spanish government "did not want to pay great attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, since these are in the hands of the judges." </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday dismissed the possibility that there could be a wave of merger savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry will be restructured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> When the concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several savings banks, in the first phase. They held on the second round. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish savings banks Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round would take place. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "I believe that most of the merger. The inclusion of Cajasol in the group Banca Cívica cannot be considered a second round, it was rather adjustments." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "The biggest part is completed. It may be that we have in place of siebzehen thirteen and fourteen, but all major processes are completed. They were of Banco de España, which has supported all transactions, controlled." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="7"> In a group of business leaders and managers Aragoniens (ADEA) organized breakfast Olavarrieta said that the concentration process "as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timetable, which in the past, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España" he said. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="8"> "The transition from 45 savings banks with assets of 17 with an average of 28 000 million per 75 500 million is a historically incomparably process.

<seg id="1"> Zapatero and the red line of Germany </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin has opted for the keeping the EUR, but at the same time, conditions for the whole of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tension on the markets have triggered a two-fold response from the government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand, has produced José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and micro enterprises, the regulation of temporary work agencies or the lifting of the EUR 426 of support for the unemployed, not unemployment benefits, to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of airports and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible for the current crisis herausbeschwört. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How to understand these events? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is anticipated that Merkel's position is no fault of their public relations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the EUR. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is Germany a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future, with the maintenance of the old traditions of much of its partners. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In the face of resistance in Europe begins to spekuliern in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first, a strong EUR with Germany, austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south to leave the EUR area. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Second: the reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - though it sounds like science fiction - supported by a majority of public opinion, approximately 50 percent of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The third: a restructuring of the EUR under German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict financial management; penalties for countries that exceed the targets; möglichereweise the default of certain countries, as well as the extension of the costs of potential measures to the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is clear and has been for some time. Therefore, there is now no excuses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission incentives for deficits and the German government came up with a constitutional reform, in order to prevent this from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It was the first signs of the polarisation between what Germany (strict fiscal plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second sign, the Central European country, as hinausschob Merkel's decision to rescue Greece. </seg>
<seg id="18"> At that time was heavily criticised. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion totally opposed to a bailout of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally, Merkel in recent days of October with a clear position. It calls for a reform of the European Union, in order to facilitate the rescue of a country and at the same time, the private lenders to pay a portion of the costs. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position has been interpreted as anti-European, since the Ireland crisis and everything. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But their proposal, if somewhat sweetened, was adopted. In the coming months we will be in the reform of the European union, these measures from 2013 to participate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has drawn a red line, not to exceed. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It says all that - even if It must be taken now unpopular measures - there will be no of this date the functioning of the EUR. </seg>
<seg id="24"> 2013 will be the year of birth of a new monetary area, in which the offending countries be severely punished, may be forced to declare itself insolvent and, in this case, the private sector must play a part of the costs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows us that we must take a strong growth rate, high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as she was led by Spain in boom times, will not be tolerated. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would do poorly, not to understand it. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not only about runterzufahren the government deficit by the year 2013 to three percent. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much tougher. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, is to cheat ourselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the current turbulence in more calm. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And the opportunities that will be offered, And will use the spring of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that, despite the criticism of Merkel's hypothesis, to their own house in order, had their way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But the Germany of red line is there, and it does not seem that would change. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Among the possibilities is that we should leave the countries with little serious cramped EUR area, cannot be ruled out. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In this case could say Germany still, it warned. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Sport and usually bypassing </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tricks like Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the desire to avoid a sanction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The alleged by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos), launched in the game of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League meant that much ink has been spilled about whether it is an unsportliche act or not and whether it should be sanctioned possibly both players by UEFA. </seg>
<seg id="4"> As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes (her team had already clearly) time and played several fouls, so that the referee showed them the second yellow card. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way, would give the Real Madrid and his group, the two players the sanction next League game against the Auxerre meet and without cards in the next phase of the game. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Finally, punished the Disciplinary Committee of the UEFA club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different sums of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow card under these or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is so widespread that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport followed rules - is. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of the debate about the case that a team of football clubs Real Madrid (in his anthem precious courage and honour and on other occasions his players for similar incidents had punished) played the main role, and the proportion of Mourinho, the episode has added a more to its long history as theatralischer and provocative technicians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case, the debate about whether this is not explicitly prohibited by the statutes behaviour contradicts the principles of sport, that is to say whether these acts of circumvention rule. Indeed, this approach to the statutes of the sport, but seem to circumvent its meaning. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this matter should be examined In the spirit of sport. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the offending players an unfair advantage from the opposing team. That did not happen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradox is the act of players of Real Madrid, that they do not correspond to what we normally under false game or rule, because the way in which the rule was not secretly, in order to avoid a penalty, but they should be as visible as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players and the sanction happily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is, what kind of advantage the offender from the deliberate fouls. </seg>
<seg id="17"> It should be emphasised that the rival in a disadvantageous position were still erheischt advantages for the feigned game, was the obvious result of this action was that their team played out with fewer players. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is also an useful strategy for the next game, because the club is not about these players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The advantage is that the player the next phase of the Champions League without cards, which could threaten their participation in a future game. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree of uncertainty, which could leave the team at some point. Moreover, the players with this approach a sanction and go in the second cycle of cards, the accumulation of cards with a card less than in the first cycle. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is not clear whether it really is an advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Ultimately, such practices against the spirit of sport, including strategic decisions, in order to derive maximum benefit from the regulations. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case the players wanted no sanction (that would be a clear case of circumvention rule), they wanted more, when they do this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They took a strategic decision, without a penalty or to flee before her. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Although the border between imagination and regulatory environment, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because there are two exclusions and because of the nature of the Regelübertragung provoked. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The damage was caused to the principles of sport through these actions, is less ethical than aesthetic. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hydro Quebec has approved by mutual agreement project planning firms $450 million in contracts for the hydroelectric project Eastmain- 1 A Sarcelle Rupert. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consisting of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, the most important, namely the management of the project, has received a total of $295 million without tender. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The consortium, called "gérance Énergie", was 2004 as a corollary of the decision of Hydro Quebec, the private sector accountability, this important to entrust hydroelectric project amounting to a sum of $5 billion, formed. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In early 2005, earned the consortium "gérance Énergie" the lucrative contract, without a public tender. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For the Parti Québécois is resorting to business consortia a serious ethical problem, raising the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung and a price increase. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "This is a new way to a conspiracy and refuted the competition." </seg>
<seg id="8"> "This means that instead fixes rather than on the way to open in form" said yesterday Sylvain Simard, member of the PQ, at the press conference. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The model of the consortium is common practice. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is usually a time such temporary alliance, which allows two or more companies to pool their expertise on a requirement on a tender for a complex project. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The project "East Main" has a high level of complexity with regard to his work. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The construction is under way and should be drawn up until 2012. </seg>
<seg id="17"> However, was awarded the contract without a competition could take place; it had already negotiations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Furthermore, the model of the consortium in Quebec, with relatively simple projects no longer an exception. </seg>
<seg id="19"> As the newspaper Le Devoir "last week has pointed out, is the model used in the field of civil engineer and advisory services of the consortium of government investigations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> A brief overflying the Quebecer company register allows more than 200 consortia, which appear to be some of steady. </seg>

<seg id="25"> "If you are an invitation to tender, and there are few candidates, will your prices soar." </seg>
<seg id="26"> "You have two options: either you do the people who find themselves in this, and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price." </seg>
<seg id="27"> "The idea is that the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people" said Laporte. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The consortium "Énergie gérance" approved contract is part of a long list of more than 50.000 of the Parti Québécois received $. </seg>

<seg id="5"> On Tuesday, however, the gap with the German interest rates his record of 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain Kopflosigkeit in Rome. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out in his Council of Ministers that the discrepancy of Spain to the German interest rates by 400 basis points. </seg>
<seg id="7"> His right hand, Gianni letta, had "seriously concerned" by the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of contagion from the direction of Ireland. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the EUR zone, is not as Greece or Ireland." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "The bad news is that Italy and Portugal" said Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In other words, the problem is the absence of economic growth and the attendant, schwindsüchtigen tax receipts, the state is In danger of not being able to meet its financing needs. </seg>

<seg id="4"> On the other hand, it has announced major changes at international level, and is a foretaste of the regression, future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But we are moving in the right order. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each of the intelligence produced acts (x) exclusively from any nation Zeitungsausschnitten. </seg>
<seg id="7"> For months, American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi's "extraordinary" nothing more than what we read in each x Journal (except for those whose owners Berlusconi), and the appalling karikaturierte profile Gaddafi's Kabarettkünstlern already for a long time for their skits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule, not the secret files from previous news, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go into a library dedicated esotherischen publications, you will see that each station (via the Grail, the mystery of Rennes le Chateau, the Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) repeated exactly what has been written in previous works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is not, therefore, that wants to publish the author occult texts (no research yet that he did not know where news about exist), but because those who dedicate themselves to the Okkultismus, nothing else than to believe what they already know and what they have learned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> As the secret files. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informant is lazy, lazy (or limited mental) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise could be, for example, editor of Libération), the only by what he considered a true. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Top Secret information on Berlusconi, who had sent the U.S. embassy in Rome, Staatsdezernat, were the same as those who had published Newsweek published the week before. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> So why was such a fuss about the revelations of this dossier? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On one side are those that know any educated person knows, and that the messages - can call at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the Government each other or take a plane, in order to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small tasks, have turned into espionage centres. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that pretend to ignore it. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Nevertheless, the fact that to repeat it publicly, the task of hypocrisy and serves the American diplomacy in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Second: the idea that can tap a x any hackers geheimsten the secrets of the most powerful country in the world, poses a significant blow to the prestige of the Staatsdezernats. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, the scandal less victims, rather than the "executioner". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we are giving the profound nature of what happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Formerly, to Orwell's time, all power as a Big Brother, every gesture of his subjects are controlled. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwell's prophecy could prove as absolutely right, where every movement, thanks to the telephone, each made transaction, visited the hotel, the elected motorway and so on; the citizens would become the victims of the eye of power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But if you consider what is happening today that can escape the secret Krypten power over the control of a Hackers, listening to the control of, unilaterally and will zirkelförmig. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power controlled every citizen, every citizen, or at least the hackers - chosen as an avenger of the citizen - can bring the secrets of power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> How can a power that is no longer able to maintain their own secrets? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is true, Georg Simmel said that is a real mystery a hollow secret (and an open secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's basically a secret free of Geheimis, because it exposes the public sphere; in the styles of Wiki Leaks openly that the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty secrets, to deprive them of power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> WikiLeaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wronged, but Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What will be the consequences of this grievance, which has caused a huge power? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the Member States in future no longer reserved information online - which would amount to angeklebten posting on the street corner. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is also clear that the current technologies is to be able to keep confidential reports on telephone. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is easier than figuring out whether and when a head of state in a plane and has contacted one of his colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could be maintained in future private and only for certain ears relations? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know very well that my prediction on science fiction and romanhaft sounds at the moment, but I am compelled me to imagine the government agents, on secret way actively to uncontrollable march routes moving their communications than anywhere else in the mere memory in order, and the few written information that they, in the footwear (verbergend. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically the espionage attempt by Watergate had less success, as wikileaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity to write that the technology is like a cancer, namely backwards. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A century after the Telegraph wireless communications, reconstructed the Internet with A Telegrafen (telephone) wire. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The (analogue) video cassettes had the film, a film for auszukundschaften enabled researchers spulen and reveal all the secrets of the assembly, while the (digital) CDs nowadays nothing other than to jump from chapter to chapter, macro portions. </seg>

<seg id="8"> The EU announced, released in 2010 2.2 billion EUR, what they are on the right path to Respektbezollung its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you look in the detail, things are a little more complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should, according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new and additional" to ensure that has been tabled an additional commitment, without having to the detriment of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means. </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the EU Commission had proposed a harmonisation, certain members states, including france, blocked the procedure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today, everyone chooses the benchmark, which he believes is best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The EU Commission has chosen, for example, a benchmark for the year 2009: the international financing will be retained, and within the framework of the "fast start" funding over three years to 150 million. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries have similar standards, either on or about conditions at the level of public development aid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In return, France was of the opinion that the financing of new projects, "2010" new and additional ". </seg>
<seg id="17"> In other words, there are no benchmarks In the spending of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In practical terms, the total amount of French support for developing countries remain stable (or decrease) - France, his commitment to the "new and additional" funding. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is still no rule, and each elects its calculation method. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, such as France, 1 Euro borrowed the equivalent of 1 Euro donated. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This is hardly defensible: the trouble is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to the emission reduction projects, which are based on maximum technology) can be justified, it is wrong to present the EUR, the captured as equivalent to a donated EUR. They should be counted only the cost of borrowing for capital commitment (i. e. the equivalent of an interest rate). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France has nothing other than the following observation: "respected" its commitment of EUR 420 million, 91.5% of loans (389.8 million) and donates 8.5%) 36.1 million EUR) - see also the EU document, in order to convince themselves. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only country in the EU that loans to a great extent. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among others) to 100% with donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union In 1 Euroto fulfil their obligations, France just 10 cents and means, a comparable effort. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Beautiful hocus-pocus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> All in All, France in his fast start funding with a double deception: part with a Weiterentwicklkung the action over time and partly with the reality of financial support. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France will succeed, believe that there are 420 million "new and additional" has spent millions in accordance with its promises and save 36.1 million EUR. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it appears that it was Bercy, who carried out the arbitrage) could be a double negative effect; once the EU (why the other member states with the donations, if there is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries are not completely fooled. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter on premature, only a small issue on relatively short time compared to the entirety of discussions on the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it could be the straw too much in the vast machinery of the UNFCCC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> We hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Whatever the truth of the matter, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year premature funding. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Primarily France could announce a change in its accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, and in a spirit of respect for his commitments and the redistributive justice with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Above all it could bring the discussions on the subject of long-term financing forward (another, decisive and currently topic): you can escape the question of "Verrechenbarkeit" or the recording its loans. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could change its position, in order to be in the same way progressive issues, as it is in other areas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The hope is based on the new environment minister Kosciusko Morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A surprising announcement on the fast start of France and his vision of "Verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loans would inherently increase the international trust, which is necessary for further discussions. </seg>
