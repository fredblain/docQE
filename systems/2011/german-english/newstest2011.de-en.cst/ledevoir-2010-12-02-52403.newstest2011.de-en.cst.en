Secret of Canada lifted komplexgeschüttelten 
The new American diplomatenleitungen by WikiLeaks were spread to reveal the mystery about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of the Canadians, with regard to the Americans; they, but with the same blow the superiority the latter to Canada. 
Consequently, the American diplomats astonished that the Canadian constituents in the ballot, not the kanadisch-amerikanischen relations in the interests, and they believe that the visit of President Obama, the conservative government helped its budget from 2009. 
The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington, the public have been disseminated yesterday, still offer more juicy details than the mere substantial content, which has a very bad outcome. 
One of 22 September 2008 carved link, i.e. in the period in which the Federal wahlkampage are in full swing, reported on the point at which the United Nations is no longer in their political leaders discussed operations. 
The great astonishment of David Wilkins used in Ottawa, the American Ambassador. 
Mr Wilkins offers various erklärungsmöglichkeiten this situation. 
"The Canadians almost innewohnender inferiority complex, prompted the Canadian, political leaders are much more likely to internal disputes of everyday life, when the United States in this election pass the buck (as in 1988 during the campaign on the free trade)," he describes. 
The United Nations, so he schlußfolgert are thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially to threatening, in order to talk about him." 
The Ambassador understands this' deafening silence "even less, when the two countries intensive political and economic relations. 
'logically', he should assess the ability of candidates, a party and much more of a party to hold such an essential relationship that the voters at the ballot box as a key factor in the sense. " 
The other manifestation of this sense of importance reads on 22 January 2009, by Terry breese geschäftsträger in Ottawa, sent communication, the President Barack Obama on his first visit to prepare in Ottawa. 
Your visit will help the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, in Canada, his first deficit after more than a decade to announce, is the result of a belebungsprogrammes in the level of 30 to 40 billion dollars ," describes breese. 
Nowhere, he had mentioned that the government had to postpone the sitting before Christmas, in order to prevent Parliament from the coalition were overthrown and this conditional continuation of opposition parties on the quality of the proposed belebungsprogramms. 
A further, from January 2008 and carved from the ambassador Wilkins authored communication agreed by the ever growing image of Washington, on CBC broadcast, dramatic series of the United States. 
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts, such as border, little mosque on the prairie, intelligence and H2O, where little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly-list" or contributions for the purposes of the CIA conducted by muskelprotze interrogations can monitor. 
Yet another communication reported in detail on how Hillary remarked in their French counterparts, Bernard Kouchner, in her first bilateral meeting asked whether Europe is prepared to include certain prisoners in Guantanamo. 
Mr Kouchner, the answer is' yes', but on the basis of an individual 'case-by-case' -entscheidung. 
Àm at the end of the meeting, "he has described the Mrs a paper in terms of Omar Khadr handed over, a 15-year old Muslims of Canadian origin." 
"The State Secretary has promised that the acts once again durchzusehen '. 
Finally, we note that the mood in the website WikiLeaks. 
Tom flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very closely inundated consultants, on CBC declared that this massive leak killed 'responsible'. 
He was here to Mike Huckabee CITES from the United States.
