This is the Casa batlló of Catalan architects Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. 
Of the local inhabitants experienced the House with his organic forms been nicknamed "knochenhaus'. 
Organic forms, wild paints, the unusual use of stone kachelsplittern and jigsaw creating to shed "facades and ubiquitous soft routes, all of these are typical features of the jugendstil of Antonio Gaudi.

In the night, the whole facade or plastic, dramatic and the special anleuchtung reinforces the glory of the colours.

Wood creates ripple geformtes imitates the window frames, support, zierelemente doors, even gucklöcher and afford. 
The House batlló eixample the quarter of crowded einkaufsstraße passeig de grácia no 43 was created by the reconstruction of a house from the years 1877, the architects Emilio sala cortese pointed out. 
The reconstruction, two years and was detailed. 
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep batlló was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately it agreed the idea gaudís in an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction. 
The Casa outlined mietshaus batlló Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone. 
He worked with the architects of José Maria jujol together. 
Just on the drawing board, the dekorationen for representative apartment of realitätenbesitzers and the use of mosaiken of the façade was his idea. 
In shaping the façade was, however, also many other bildner and artists. 
The joint work on the drafts of the Casa batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation of jujola and Gaudí. 
As participated jujol on the construction of gaudís House Casa milá güell in the park, in which further work by Antoni Gaudí. 
Shortly after his completion, the House of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the nicknamed "knochenhaus'. 
Others have called it the specific fensteröffnungsmechanismus because of the "yawning House '.

But even further bildhauerische elements symbolise hidden religious motives. 
Gaudí outlined in this House for the time with unique zentralheizungssystem entlüftungskanälen and typical kaminen. 
It seems a little bizarre 45-grad-neigung already.

Gaudí worked but also with a modern approach to mutual interconnection of spaces. 
The social part can be achieved through the opening of salontüren completely, and this has led to a more comfortable plaudern society without compromising vertraulicheren talks on a certain degree of privacy. 
The House has received through gaudís restructuring but a new facade of a very unusual roof and two other floors. 
It is also impressive gaudís game with the light and the blue and White glasierten kacheln with which the courtyard dressed and lichthöfe.
