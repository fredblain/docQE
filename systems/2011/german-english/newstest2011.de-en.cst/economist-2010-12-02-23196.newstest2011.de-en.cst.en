Weak applause for China 
Taiwan's voters are becoming a closer link with the continent. 
What does Taiwan of its big brother across the strait? 
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the electorate, in the five city mayors and councillors. This is as broad evaluation of President Ma Ying-jeou. 
Through the construction of cutting-edge business contacts, einschl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland, and its policy, the relationship with the Chinese Motherland, for the first time since 1949 sustainably changed. 
Ma has the test, but only just. 
Although his Kuomintang Party was split (KMT), three of the five mayors, it received a majority. 
Instead, the democratic fortschrittspartei (DPP), the greater independence of Taiwan, almost 50% of the vote, the KMT was 45%. 
In a presidential election, this would have for Ma problems. 
Since his election in two years, indeed, his party at around 8%. 
For the first time, the DPP, together with the KMT in the councillors. 
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as convoys of lorries, with krawallmachern flaggen-schwenkende massenumzüge and rarely active dancers. 
There were even compulsory, mysterious mordversuch. 
Sean LIEN, the son of Lien Chan and ehrenvorsitzender the KMT, on the eve of the election of a speech on a kmt-kandidaten, 
As a man from the amount in the face of fold. LIEN was wounded and killed umstehender viewers. 
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter LIEN kill or settle a dispute with the candidates. 
Regardless of the attack tsai ing-wen according to the leader of the DPP, the election and the DPP in a bad light, as the KMT has benefited more votes. 
China was perhaps the biggest winners of the campaign. 
Remarkably, relations with the mainland was not discussed. 
Instead, the candidates are debated on plans to housing and the creation of jobs. 
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's militärbedrohung. 
This is why the KMT their relations with the government in Beijing to the fore. 
But this time, avoiding the DPP, the anti-Chinese feelings too much. 
You responded to this new awareness that Taiwan's economy without China cannot survive. 
Ma, in turn, would like to confirm that the majority of the Taiwanese its China policy. 
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy, Taiwan, with economic incentives to attract the Community. 
China sent a negotiator in Taipei, at a summit on investment and medical cooperation. 
Certainly, it also wants a political integration, but the most important first. 
We therefore prefer to wait until after the 2012 presidential election. 
The DPP is now reinvented. 
Two years ago, it was severely weakened: the former leaders of Chen Shui-bian sat for corruption in prison. 
During its Presidency, between 2000 and 2008, he was strongly for the absolute independence. 
But under tais reign spans a new generation gemässigter politicians and the DPP is grappling with the voices of the professionals and the young. 
Tsai found as a candidate of the DPP consensus as Su tseng-chang under Chen. 
Your party is doing everything to show that it is capable of close relations with Beijing. 
Tsai is planning a ideenschmiede as a contact point between the DPP and China. This, however, presupposes open-minded discussion. 
Tsai stated publicly that your party is a trustworthy "alternative" to offer MAS vorschneller rapprochement with China. 
Chen seems very annoyed about this change. 
From his he declared that the candidates of the DPP would have done better to Taiwan's independence. 
He urged the pragmatists Su even, to run for president. 
Even without Chen's interference is the DPP, their potential candidates. 
The KMT will of their own selbstanalyse must undergo. 
MAS values are poor, in spite of rapid economic growth; kmt-kandidaten wanted their campaign without it. 
The main reasons for his unpopularity, unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor. 
According to one kmt-sprechers it will be cabinet and the local institutions. 
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is a rapprochement, limited. 
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese economic cooperation with China as inevitable. 
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnists, "there is no going back."
