NASA announces the Fund außerirdischen life 
The North American space agency threw a press conference to a fund vorzustelle tomorrow, the impact on the search for life in all. 
The national aerospace raumfahrtbehörde (NASA), the United States will take place tomorrow, Thursday, a astrobiologische discovery that the theory of existence außerirdischen life could confirm. 
The fund will be taken tomorrow at 1.00 p.m. at a press conference in the seat of NASA in Washington of experts astrobiologie. It is a science, the origin, the development, distribution and the future of life in the universe. 
In convening the press conference assured NASA that it will be a 'aufsichtserregenden fund for the search for außerirdischem life' Imagine speculation with experts from other countries. 
The discovery of the theory shows that in hostile environments that are currently on unbwohnbar, menschenähnliche creatures. It has raised the hypothesis that these are intelligent beings, as people, to transform, if their living conditions are improved. 
Apparently, it is a microbe at the bottom of the lake in mono yosemite-nationalpark, California, has been found. They live in an environment which is too poisonous for all possible forms of life has been reared, as the sea is heavily arsenhaltig. 
In any way using the mikrobie the arsenic than überlebensressource. With this ability increases the chances that it on other planets, which do not have our protective atmosphere, similar life. 
If these organisms the arsenic verstoffwechseln, in accordance with the astrobiologen proven that "it is actually a different way of life, a second way of life, which is known." 
The space agency is tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference the actual scope of its funds. 
At the conference, the geobiologin pamela Conrad part of the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven benner, one of the scientists, the titan (the largest moon saturns) in response to the question of whether the chemical composition of the earth is studied.
