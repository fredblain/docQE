Inspectors in zwielicht 
The European food authority is the EFSA with crops experimental industry. 
This accusation formulates the expert group testbiotech, as an independent institute for the assessment of biotechnology. 
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well documented," said testbiotech-chef Christoph then on Wednesday in Munich. 
The head of the efsa-expertengruppe for genetically modified plants, Harry kuiper, and another efsa-experte were for years in lobbyistenverband ilsi under the Treaty. 
The will of groups such as Monsanto, nestle or Bayer. 
Kuiper have been instrumental in the efsa-prüfvorschriften for crops and is involved in a clear conflict of interests, then. 
The efsa-vorschriften are absatzweise word for word, with the position papers of the ilsi and deceive the imprint of the industry, in fact, of the Italian Parma will be checked. 
It is already the second time that a interessenskollision testbiotech share your criticism. 
It is a high-level efsa-managerin recently without conditions or transitional period for the Swiss agrarkonzern Syngenta - and that the sides. 
The mitteldeutsche broadcasting (mdr) had recently human links between kontrollierender EU authority and lobbies, reveals what umweltbundesamt, as EU parliamentarians sympathetic. 
EFSA can, however, see no conflict of interest. 
We would like to all serious data, including those of industry, as long as they are of a high technical quality are, in an opinion. 
The experts who work for EFSA, for it is not that they have no contact with the industry. 
They should disclose this, however. 
Kuiper gives his work for the international life sciences Institute (ilsi) in the United States. 
This describes himself as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics - including the risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbyauftrag. 
In the matter of independent experts to criticise how then that genetically modified plants are currently without any fütterungsversuch for animals to be authorised and the reaction of crops to nurture, will not be tested. 
"We want to know what, for example, of genetically modified maize on the field of power," says then. 
Current practice is only isolated proteins, but not the whole genpflanze to test which no reliable results liefere. 
"If the risks, as they should be then? ', then done. 
It also envisages Angelika hilbeck. 
Since 1994, the academic research in genetic engineering and is currently in the technical university Zurich. 
The industry attempts in this area, as in the United States now in Europe is becoming more and more critical scientists to affect or to discredit. 
There is, therefore, hard researchers, corporations are intertwined. 
For companies, critical studies would not usually published. 
"the industry to monitor the security research," claims hilbeck.
