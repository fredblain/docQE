The army has so many zündschnüre that we could keep the Czech Republic umwickeln but only two years 
The Czech army has 445 kilometres zündschnüre shop, with explosives to be released. 
In the previous year, the Ministry has 224 kilometres of powder to the armeelager. 
It is reassuring to know that the forces for 225 years ausgesorgt. 
The only problem is the durability of the zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years. 
The army bought the zündschnüre of the company stv group, including S. for a mere 40 million kroner. 
In his explanatory statement for the purchase of this huge amount of powder replied the General Staff mf dnes, the soldiers would annually to the 60 km powder. 
The sourcing of armeepyrotechnikern mf dnes according to the point that came from this indication that the whole army every year an extremely intensive pyrotechnics training should, from all the generals and officers of the armeekommandos, to the secretaries and Putzfrauen. 
Defense minister Alexandr Vondra and army general vlastimil picek not excluded. 
Only in this way can the considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometres zündschnüren reasonably justified. 
This length is also actually 25,000 detonationen. 
But if these armeebestände for more than ten years. 
But if the old rule of experts is that the training of any new professional two metres powder is quite sufficient, then the army by these neueinkäufe, also from the point of view of the increased needs of the key and special units - a soothing stock for the above-mentioned 225 years. 
It complained soldiers of the Defense Minister Vondra schnelleinsatzbrigade recently, they have almost no patronen for small arms register, so that the lack of resources for severely constrained. 
The unterhosenmangel. 
'I am not, why we are buying such huge zündschnüre. " 
But that is your decision, you will already know what they need it. " 
For us, the army is a good customer, which we want to achieve as much as possible as traders', says the vertriebsmanager of Jan děcký stv group. 
Jan pejšek, the Department of Defense spokesman establishes the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of powder, the army would be so for at least ten years with the "ammunition" heckle him. 
Jan děcký of the stv group is, however, a four-year gebrauchsdauer the zündschnüre and police and armeepyrotechniker only two years. 
'With perfect storage are the four aforementioned years possible', one of them, but turns wants to remain as a soldier, not the criticism of the army to be accused. 
After the expiry of the gebrauchsdauer any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether they are reliable and not the lives of soldiers. 
These tests are not in vain, it costs money. 
A further point is the Department of Defense mengenrabatt for 445 kilometre powder. 
"They cost us 60% less than the letztjährige delivery of 244 kilometres', tells us pejšek einkäufer spokesman, the position of the Department of Defense. 
Just by way of comparison, the annual consumption of zündschnüren pyrotechnikern of the police, the ammunition from the second world war, or the Soviet bruderarmee than they have been for a number of years, barely 1 500 metres. 
And the police state, only such quantities of these munitions which it before the end of the gebrauchsdauer can consume. 
The safety of pyrotechniker because, in addition, be able to make purchases more flexible and hence reliable zündschnüre openly. 
In any case, the Ministry has huge problems with the winding-up of tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, as the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak people " s army continuously in their campaign on the Rhine prepared. 
According to the pyrotechnikern mf dnes, awaits the Czech forces in a few years, the same problem with the winding up of hundreds of kilometres of old zündschnüre today as' beneficial 'shop.
