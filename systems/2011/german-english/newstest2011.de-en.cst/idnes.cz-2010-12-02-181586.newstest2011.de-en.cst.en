More and more parents want menschen-überwachungsgeräte kids under control, in order to have 
The fear for one's children is growing, and so are considering more and more parents, by GPS. 
The system that was originally to searching for cars was invented, namely people, as well as in such cases would be helpful, as recently in spurlosen disappearance of the nine-year anička janatková. 
This is about the same size as a packet but soon it will be no more than a wristwatch. 
Many people, the case of the disappearances anička horrified and so you are looking at ways and means to bring up their children to be better protected. 
The price of a deterioration of their privacy. 
"We are trying to say that it is not in any way herumspionieren, but an effective means to lessen the likelihood that the tragedy is, Petr pilin society macro because, and one of the suppliers of gps-ortungsgeräten on the Czech market. 
"I admit that in the case of the misuse of such equipment, for example if there is someone in the bag, without knowing, but so far we have had no such case." 
"The most customers buy it really is for reasons of security ', adds pilin. 
In his opinion, should the child but always know what purpose the "box" is and how it can be used in the event of an emergency. 
The kinderpsychologin Dana bočková notes, however, that a child, if there is such a thing, it does not bear its simple pace. 
"very small children show great creativity when it comes to certain things deliberately to lose if they are not supervised." 
"The phones awoken initially with the parents have great expectations, but they are just as easy to shut down, as this new überwachungsgeräte," says Mrs bočková. 
In your opinion, is also questionable whether such a body in the event of an attack, actually helps. 
'planned kidnappings controlled the kidnappers virtually always whether the child in any electronics, which could be located. " 
"Today it is mobile phone." 
"If such überwachungsgeräte broader use of publicized, they would also seek them, since their sale surely accompanied by massive advertisements." 
In these cases, the perpetrators of the police always one step ahead, "says the psychologist. 
It acknowledges that similar devices with a sudden attack by a paedophile can be extremely helpful. 
Roberta čech society RC monitoring - ortungsdienstleistungen both for cars, as well as for persons, can the existence of such a appliance can also help if it immediately after the attack will be destroyed. 
"The machine, so that the respective position in some intervals." 
"even if it is immediately destroyed, at least the final position of the person involved. ' 
"in more expensive equipment is even a neigungsmesser integrated, in other words, if we are being left bewegungslos hinfällt and sends the device immediately a warning for the position," claims Mr čech. 
In his opinion, could similar services also smart phones with navigation, we only have a special software einzuspielen. 
The problem of the current ortungsgeräte is that it is either in order to appliances in streichholzschachtel-größe, the supporters are similar or smaller mobile phones. 
There is always the risk that it loses. 
Mr pilin of the macro testing because, in the present equipment, such as normal digitaluhren. 
This has the advantage that the possible attackers did not realise that this is a monitoring and localisation device which makes it possible. 
"or he realises that only after a certain time, as the police is a zeitvorsprung ', adds it. 
No matter what direction the development - towards armbändern or supporters, are still the same technology, such as the fahrzeugortung. 
Therefore, the combination of ortungsfunktion through the gps-systems (just as the navi in the car) and the role of a mobile phone, which is the current position.
