Belarus is in agreement, not to accumulate weapons-grade uranium 
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to global security of nuclear material, the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that they no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. 
The deal was in a joint statement following a meeting with the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister, Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the sicherheitsgipfels. 
The US Government has for years sought Belarus to persuade, not more highly enriched uranium to collect and last spring seemed a barrier. 
But official of the US administration told the Washington Post that in the last two months, two secret agreement with Belarus have been taken 187 pounds weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian forschungsanstalt. 
This was the platform for the agreement on Wednesday, the rest of the material to be removed, according to an official staff, because of the sensitivity of the issue of anonymous, roughly £500. 
The agreement is one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear summit on security of 47 nations' in April, the Belarus had excluded. 
And it was obvious good enough, at the invitation of the former Soviet Republic of the next summit of 2012. 
'I was truly thrilled about the fact that it has a seat in the nuclear summit on security (2012). " 
'This shows me that it works, "said Ken luongo, President of the partnership of global security, a group on the promotion of nuclear safety. 
Clinton called it "a very significant step" of Belarus. 
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, within four years precarious nuclear material. 
Since the US administration has six countries helped their highly enriched uranium to get rid of. 
Belarus is the seventh. 
A dozen countries did under George W. Bush's administration. 
At the time of Obama's nuclear summit on security, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that the nation will never abandon their uranium. 
"How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally waffenfähig, and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko at the time. 
"This is our resource... we will not derive dirty bombs and we will not sell." 
"We use it solely for research purposes, that is all." 
Belarus approached, however, a few months ago, the United States, as there is interest in the meeting of an agreement anzeigte. 
The first round of the uranium in Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was easily verstrahlt say official. 
It was a spezialzug load, the more than 1 300 miles to a Russian factory for the storage and disposal of, say, official. 
The second attempt was decided on Monday and, according to the official by plane. 
The US government pays for this effort $14 million, with a large part of the money in the Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which will not be used for nuclear weapons. 
'this was extremely careful and coordinated in order to build confidence "to the agreement which has been signed by President Clinton, said Andrew bieniawski, a representative of the department, the global gefahrenreduzierung works. 
The James Martin centre for nichtweiterzugebende Studies calculates that Belarus this year at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium, and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus is, according to the joint agreement camp in 2012. 
The relations between Belarus and the United States for years been tense, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh respect for human rights. 
But the statement on Wednesday suggests a possible rapprochement. 
"the progress of this global security welcome heißend, the United States of America and Belarus known that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus is a central theme in improving bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," says it.
