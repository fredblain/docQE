Mr Zapatero and the red line of Germany 
Berlin has for keeping the euro, but at the same time, conditions for the whole of the European Union. 
The tension on the markets have a dual response from the government. 
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation measures, starting with reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of work agencies or the lifting of 426 euro support for the unemployed, the no unemployment benefit, to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of airports Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the national lottery. 
On the other hand, it supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the aid of the former regierungspräsidenten Felipe González, the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis herausbeschwört. 
How are these events? 
It is anticipated that Merkel's position no mistake of their public relations. 
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro. 
It is Germany a fundamentally new prospects to shape our future, with the preservation of ancient traditions of most of its partners. 
In view of the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis spekuliern. 
The first: a strong euro, with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries in the South to leave the euro area. 
Second: the reintroduction of the German mark - even though it currently looks more like science fiction sounds - supported by a majority of public opinion, approximately 50% of the population. 
The third: a transformation of the euro in accordance with German proposals, which means: more macroeconomic control and strict financial management and punishment of the countries which are crossing the guidelines; möglichereweise the default of some countries, as well as the extension of the cost of potential adjustments to the private sector. 
The German position is clear and has been for some time now, which is why there is now no excuses. 
First of all, in 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission for the deficits, and the German Government, a constitutional reform fairly, in order to prevent it from 2016. 
That was the first signs of the polarisation between what Germany was thought necessary (strict steuerpläne and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. 
The second signal, a central European country, as Merkel, the decision to save Greece's painful hinausschob. 
At that time it was strongly criticised, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published absolutely opposed to the rescue of Greece. 
Finally, Merkel in the past oktobertagen anew with a clear position, and it calls for a reform of the Treaties of the European Union, to the rescue of a country and, at the same time, to enable private lenders to commit to a part of the cost. 
This position was interpreted as anti-European as irlandkrise and all the following. 
But your proposal, although somewhat sugared, has been accepted in the next few months we will be on the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures from 2013. 
Germany has a red line, it does not exceed. 
It says all that - even if now unpopular measures must be taken, from that date, the old workings of the euro will no longer be available. 
2013 will be the geburtsjahr of a new currency zone, in which the zuwiderhandelnden countries be severely punished, this can be forced to declare itself bankrupt and, in this case, the private sector is a part of the costs. 
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard economic growth, with high savings and investment, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances. 
The alternative to the indebtedness and construction of massive holes in the balance of payments is based, as was led by Spain in boom times, is simply not acceptable. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would be wrong to do so, it is not understood. 
It is not just a question of the deficit until the year 2013 to 3% runterzufahren. 
The demands are much harder. 
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, we were to cheat. 
I hope that the current turbulence more calmly. 
And that we take the opportunities offered to us by the spring of 2013. 
It seems that Zapatero has taken this so well, and his dual announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies, last Saturday, and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, its own house in order to create their way it has been. 
Nevertheless, Germany drawn red line is here, and it does not seem that change. 
In contemplating means is that the countries with little serious fully gestopften euro area, cannot be ruled out. 
In this case, Germany might still say that it has warned us.
