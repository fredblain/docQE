Red Bull prevails in the F1 with a geheimwaffe of Siemens 
The car with a software in real time. 
Since Red Bull in 2004 in the world of Formula 1 eindrang, is your history in this splendid universe of the speed of surprises and successes. 
Initially, no one paid the newcomer and despite a steeply rising background during the recent seasons, the final spurt last November, all to the victory of Ferrari's by Fernando Alonso. 
Without the skills of the German pilots and weltmeisters Sebastian vettel or leistungsstärke the motors of Renault to belittle is the "geheimwaffe" that the multinational Siemens Red Bull in the hands, and thus siegerteam created on the legend. 
In reality, is a powerful software to simulate processes, which the German company 2007 for purposes other than motor race, on the market. 
This has been described as plm informatikprogramm for the development of montageketten in factories around the world, energiewerken and precise instruments used. 
There is an exact reproduction or simulation of a product or process, before it is built, so as to avoid errors and unnecessary costs. 
Plm, the development of the cameras of canon, the aircraft Sukhoi and the most famous vehicles of Nissan easier. 
Siegfried russwurm, chief industrieabteilung of Siemens, declared that the use of these software in the Formula 1 - factory Red Bull 'in a few hours, almost in real time, "the changes and improvements to the race and the tests are discovered, to devise and implement. 
Russwurm contends that in 1992, in the rennställen an average of ten technicians worked in a season of a maximum of three or four improvements have been able to introduce. 
In red bulls team today are 180 skilled young people, with powerful do they lead analyses and all sorts of changes to the rennwagen. 
The siemens-manager plm-software was declared that all the components of the rennwagen of Red Bull to analyse and improve, with the exception of the motors, is solely responsible for the Renault. 
The materials, fuel, the aerodynamik and the safety elements will be changed. 
The changes, thanks to advanced factories and hightech-autoklaven in less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of simulators in reality. 
The only limit this crazy technical perfectionism is set, the $40 million, which is a Formula 1 - team for his race in a season can spend. 
Red Bull has its hightech-fabrik for the development and manufacture of his rennwagen in a 50 kilometres from London off the ground. 
There are two buildings in which visits, particularly by journalists - very circumscribed. 
What is happening is top secret. 
The workforce is 580 persons, including the two pilots, the World Cup vettel and mark webber. 
But red bulls genuine Formula 1 - hero zweifelslos the latest world champions Sebastian vetell. 
Behind the enormous technological resources, the energy-drink-hersteller in the service of its participation in the race tracks, there are other protagonists, whose support invaluable and their fame is nil. 
The technologichef the site, Steve nevey, stressed that five years ago could say that the progress made in the area of R & D for rennwagen with 50% of the victory and the pilots contributed to the rest were responsible. 
Today, the anteilswerte changed. The technology makes 85% of the success, while the contribution of pilots to 15%. 
Nevey recognises that webber vettel and never can be replaced by computer, because they are not "voraussagbare gladiatoren '.
