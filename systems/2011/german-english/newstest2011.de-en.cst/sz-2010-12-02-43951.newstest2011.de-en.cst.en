Puzzling erdarbeiten 
The International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria. 
The country, but to comment - nor is it controls. 
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter, a mysteriöses würfelförmiges buildings in Syria. 
It is on the shores of the Euphrates; the next major city, 30 kilometres away, is dair as-saur. 
Your name comes up in the documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor is that Syria supposedly with aid from North Korea in the quader built hidden in a valley of the electricity. 
According to a briefing of us-auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA by the end of April 2008 is also under the name of the near town el-kibar normal reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which to build nuclear weapons. 
For other purposes against the technology from the fifties. 
The CIA led a videopräsentation with by means of fuzzy satellitenbildern. 
By computeranimation blendete it, where the components of the reactor before the destruction have been a copy of the North Korean model fell from the atomzentrum Yongbyon. 
Moreover, it presented photographs, the building of the vicinity or even innenraum. 
The reactor is on the verge of operation, it was said, but not yet with brennstäben have been drawn up. 
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more aware than it was at the puzzle with time, a greater. 
The former US President George W. Bush has recently in his memoirs, reveals that the CIA before the attack was quite sure that Syria el-kibar a reactor built, but little evidence that the country's nuclear weapons programme 'active'. 
Some intelligence officers in Europe are rather more cautious and only talk of a 'alleged reactor', even if the cia-präsentation for 'plausible'. 
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. 
I am sure he was asked as a reactor, replied to have a high un-diplomat only flat in the summer, the IAEA, "enough material to put questions." 
The rubble of the so-called 'dormant militärgebäudes "surpassed the Syrians are in a hurry aside planierten the terrain thoroughly. 
Nevertheless, in June 2008, a iaea-team under the former chief inspector Olli heinonen in el-kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by the people. 
Moreover, the IAEA on a Member State satellite pictures provide commercial operators from the period immediately after the attack, which should be stronger than the CIA. 
These, however, are recordings on the market, because of the unknown client - perhaps Israel - it originates. 
The IAEA can therefore verify their authenticity is not independent. 
Syria has always claimed that never operated a secret nuclear program or a reactor built. 
The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, declared Damascus. 
However, the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely. 
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss - as well as on the satellite pictures provide. 
Moreover, the inspectors denied a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the rubble of zerbombten building. 
But Israel remains silent pugnaciously. 
"We will never comment ', confirmed recently by the time of the attack incumbent Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position. 
It perpetuates the investigation of the case since June 2008 fruitless and "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority ', as a great Western diplomat in the seat of the IAEA in Vienna authorises - after all, it is a serious breach of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area of the IAEA. 
As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA appear to be three other institutions, the 'functional' in connection with the alleged reactor to - and unlike that still exist. 
The inspectors have not disclosed the installations concerned, what role they are or what they seem suspicious. 
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are in the IAEA internally as marj as-sultan masyaf iskandariayah, and that, in turn, are derived from nearby towns. 
The independent institute for science and international security in Washington (ISIS advises) has identified these places and a gebäudekomplex masyaf satellitenbildern to identify, which is probably one of the suspects objects. 
It is probably in or immediately, in addition to a military base - precisely with this justification, Syria, the IAEA denied access to the three places. 
In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA from the United States vorgeschickt will auszuspähen military equipment. 
Because the nukleardetektive were a recommendation by the US secret services to the attention of the institutions. 
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos that between the three places and the Euphrates material quader hertransportiert back and forth. 
A large Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the installations could 'in connection with the brennstoffproduktion'. 
There is, however, no evidence of sensitive activities', i.e. uranium enrichment and reprocessing; the processes for the construction of nuclear weapons are necessary. 
The type of reactor is with uranium, not enriched. 
But where the uranium had should come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated, on these central issues, there are only plausible guesswork. 
It is also unclear whether debris, the valuable traces of mountains, to the three places stored. 
As if the hundreds stands from the ground disappeared, nobody wants to have any information as to where the rubble. 
The only a few kilometres from el-kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, salzmine al-tibni, Syria in 1998 to their suitability as centres for radioactive waste has investigated, the IAEA as unlikely. 
The former iaea-inspektor Robert kelley it had a recent analysis by satellitenbildern for the prestigious journal Jane's intelligence review with the reactor. 
Starting from the orbit show, however, that Syria to the three suspicious places erdarbeiten untouched and large container distant, after the IAEA access had requested. 
This is a coincidence, but hardly contributed to dispel the suspicion. 
Moreover, it says in the IAEA diplomats, have spent many months, a plan for inspections to develop that Syria should allow any military secrets to preserve the burden alone shows how great the interests of the inspectors. 
Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte this proposal. 
Western diplomats had in Vienna a year ago have been allayed, the reactor is destroyed, therefore, the matter is not high urgency, around US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a couple of months' sonder-inspektionen, one of the principal means of the Vienna atombehörde to controls. 
Iaea-chef yukiya Amano, these inspections should propose, has been of "an option, for which I am open in the future ', but then it is dragging its feet. 
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, there is a need for a majority of the Board of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented there are anything other than eager to an escalation. 
On the other hand, as a diplomat to remember: 'what is, if you will, in the end, nothing at all? "
