China considers its targets to reduce greenhouse gases maintained 
The representatives of China, on the COP16, his country have enormous efforts to curb kohlenstoffspuren and it would be maintained until 2020, offer 40 to 45% of its greenhouse gases. 
China believes that his offer the emission of greenhouse gases by 2020 by 40 to 45%, assured Su Wei, the representative of the country to the COP16. 
In his first appearance in the 16th world climate summit of the United Nations (COP16) assured Su Wei, his country would have enormous efforts to reduce kohlenstoffspuren and to convert its industry. 
He said that in the last four years of his country 245 million dollars, in order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. 
On the other hand, he declared that China would change its objectives but, together with the international community to work on this matter. 
He stated that the Chinese strategy on climate change into four aspects unterteile: dialogue, capacity-building, institution building and supporting pilot programmes. 
In all respects, we have made progress, including the adoption of a new energiegesetzes last year, the objectives relating to the reduction of emissions of gases delivers, he said. 
On the other hand, it reveals that, in China, the authorities of the states with which the zentralstaats and the communities working together the targets for energy saving, the efficient use of energy and the reduction of emissions. 
In addition, there are already some multiannual plans to be tackled or completed, both those of the Chinese Government, as well as those of other countries. 
For example, he was referring to the programme for the effective use of energy in the last five years was introduced and investment of the United Nations (UN), the government and private hands. 
It is also a project on provincial level on climate change, a further exchange of traditional light bulbs by energiesparbirnen and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said. 
Martin krol, scientific regierungsberater on climate change in that country, confirmed that China's efforts are far greater than is commonly believed. 
It showed that the pro-kopf-emission of greenhouse gases in China six tonnes per person betrage, while in the United States, 100 tonnes. China is a neunprozentigen total contribution to environmental pollution. 
Similarly, highlight the unprecedented progress in the area of energy use; the energiewirksamkeit in the last five years by 20% by 2020 is another, he said.
