Sport and regelumgehung 
Tricks like the Alonso and Ramos game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will of a sanction. 
The putatively of two players of the Real Madrid (xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) evidenced by the exclusion in the game of 23 November against the Ajax of the Champions League that caused much ink has been spilled about whether it is a unsportliche action or not acted and whether both players of UEFA should be sanctioned. 
As is well known, the two players a few minutes before spielende (your team had already been clearly won) time and played a number of fouls, now that the referee the second yellow card. 
In this way, and as the Real Madrid his group would be that the two players the prescribed sanction against the next ligaspiel auxerre comply with and without cards in the next spielphase. 
Finally, penalising the disziplinarkommitee UEFA the coach of the clubs, José mourinho, with two games and the relevant players with different sums of money. 
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football. 
It is so widespread that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this branch of our rules. 
Part of the debate have arisen in the case to the fact that a team of the club Real Madrid (which in its anthem edelmut and honour and on other occasions its players for similar incidents punished), and the key role played by the dramatisierung mourinho, an episode to its long history and has added theatralischer and provocative technicians. 
In any case, the debate about whether this is not expressly of the statutes of illicit behaviour runs counter to the principles of sport, that is to say whether these actions constitute a regelumgehung. Indeed, believes that this approach to the statutes of sport, but its meaning. 
In this matter, should the sporting spirit ailment be investigated. 
The sporting spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect which is not threatened by these acts, because it was not an aggressive game. 
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid zuwiderhandelnden players an unjustified benefits from gegenteam. This did not happen. 
The paradox of the activity of players of the Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally under falschspiel or regelumgehung understand, because the circumvention of the rule has not been secretly executed, in order to avoid a sanction, but they should be as striking as possible, so that they will be punished by the referees. 
The gambler waited and the sanction one. 
Another question is what kind of advantage the zuwiderhandelnden from the deliberate fouls. 
It should be emphasised that the rival either in a disadvantageous position has benefits for the game erheischt gespielte, because the obvious result of this was that the own team with less players to play. 
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because of the club is not about these players. 
The advantage is that the players of the next spielphase the Champions League without cards participating in a future game could threaten to begin. 
But it is a long-term, to a certain extent, uncertain advantage, because the team will retire. In addition the players with this approach a sanction and, in the second kartenzyklus on, because kartenanhäufung with a card fewer than in the first cycle departure. 
Thus, it is not clear whether it is really a advantage. 
Ultimately, such practices are not against the sporting spirit, including strategic decisions belong to the provisions of a maximum benefit. 
In this case, the players not a sanction to circumvent (that is, indeed, a clear case of regelumgehung), they wanted more choice, when you of this. 
They met a strategic choice, without a penalty or to sidestep it. 
Although the boundary between imagination and regelumgebung blurred, I believe that this issue is a clear case of inventiveness. 
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because there are two selbstausschlüsse and because of the type of provoking regelübertragung. 
The damage to the principles of sport by these acts, is less ethical rather than aesthetic nature.
