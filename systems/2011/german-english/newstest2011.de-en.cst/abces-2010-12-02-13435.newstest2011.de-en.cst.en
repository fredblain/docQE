The head of the altenpflegeheims, Joan sala, in the company of his lawyer, Joan cañada, tried to and announced, "la caritat would like the leaders (for the deaths) indictments', but 'the right and our accountability to compel us to the process and the civil liability'. 
The establishment must not only a social being discredited, because they accept the criminal acts of pflegers not identified in good time, but now also allowed a large numbers of the rechtsvertretern the families of the victims is measured. 
Joan Vila dilmé acknowledged that the first crimes in August 2009 and that it continues to have been murdered. 
The judges ordered the fate through the exhumation of eight bodies - the former patients of the altenpflegeheims - because it is suspected that no doctor, the deceased personally have investigated the formalities, but because of their age and diseases by telephone.

In La caritat listens to the statements of the pflegers not believe that not even the number of gestandenen murders, which may well be more. This attitude is justifiable that Vila very different statements before the Court had been made and there is no point in making its approach after eight successful murders suddenly change.
