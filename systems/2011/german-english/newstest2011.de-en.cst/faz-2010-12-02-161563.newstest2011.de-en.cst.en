The eis-universität 
In the "gelato university 'in Bologna are better prepared eiskonditoren seasons. 
The three days grundkurs for future gelatieri has the biggest rise and visitors from around the world. 
What is actually the whole ice? 
The gelatiere and the gelataio. 
The German gelatiere, something which is old-fashioned eiskonditor flower after all the rules of the Italian eismacherkunst. 
The gelataio is catching up with a spachtel the ice cream from the kühltheke, it abolishes the waffel and sold it. 
In order to do this, we must not anzola Dell Emilia in the province of Bologna. 
But anyone who wishes to know more about ice, which is not in the 'gelato-university' of the Italian company carpigiani over. 
The eis-universität, the manufacturers of eismaschinen in 2003, so that the ice cream from its machinery across the high Italian ideals. 
The three days grundkurs for future gelatieri has the biggest rise and visitors from around the world. 
But there are also mehrtägige spezialkurse around the schokoladeneis and internships in hauseigenen eisdiele. 
Some of midlife-crisis dreams of a new career, other car is simply the treacherous ice of their vague aspirations. 
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries, of all continents, from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia. 
Jacky, kunstlehrer from California, loves the slow-food-bewegung and wants the country's industrial ice-cream in future, a European quality product. 
Anke from Berlin is unternehmensberaterin and after years in a nervenaufreibenden job a little own eintüten. 
Two young ägypterinnen dream of a eisdiele in Cairo. 
A man from Malta and one from Brazil, the quality of the ice cream in their bars improve - and the Canadian housewife Yulia, because their children Italian ice cream. 
Maestro-gelatiere Luciano Ferrari declared the participants, firstly, the ideal characteristics of perfect ice cream. 
It is not only good taste, but also the seidige geschmeidigkeit and the good consistency. 
Luciano forgets in his training, but not the icing on the cake of national and even südländischen überbaus: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still plenty of romanticism." 
The first step to manufacture seems quite simple. 
Luciano dump the grundzutaten milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilisers in a major mixgerät with an electronic programme to 85 degree heated and then immediately to four degrees are cooling. 
Then he is at the centre of a Hahn machine, and it is a white, pasteurisierte basiscreme milcheissorten basis for all. 
It immediately with questions of lecturer bestürmt: we can only ice cream with natural substances without stabiliser? 
How can one's own experimentierlust free rein? 
Luciano warns that the Zeitgeist to be fooled. 
Those of ice cream 'only from natural ingredients' speech, perhaps, nevertheless, stabilisers - usually a natural product, such as guarkernmehl from guarbohne. 
Of course, one can ice without stabiliser, but it must then be sold within one day, otherwise sackt it together, and the client bites on louder eiskörnchen. 
Certain variations in the grundmasse are permitted. 
It is exciting to flavourings. 
For the flavour of the EIS Maestro Luciano distinction between the ingredients in the obst-abteilung or in the sweets of the supermarket are buying. 
Moreover, there are powder and pasten. 
"The suppliers are all trying to foist onto dozens of aromatised additions." 
"but they should simply to experiment." 
Either the fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruits. 
Or, indeed, in the ice cream from the White grundmasse with eggs to yellow cream and with kakaopulver on the basis of all possible schokoladen-verführungen. 
Now the kursteilnehmer to the eismaschinen. 
Luciano, you have four different types of vanille- schokolade- mokka- haselnuss-eis, and to establish, with or without eggs in the grundmasse with more or less vanillearoma or other natural additives. 
The same experiment will also undergo fruchteissorten. 
More flavourings, more frucht-püree -; that is not necessarily better. 
Haselnuss-eis tastes necessarily nussiger if it contains more hazelnuts. 
The favorite kiwi-eis, the working party, the more fruit, less water and less stabiliser. 
Only a balanced mix will lift the flavour of a gelato right, says Luciano. 
Rechenaufgabe eisherstellung is: will pfirsich-püree with sugar used in the sugar grundrezept must be reduced. 
For zitroneneis extraportion sugar is a necessary. 
Luciano prefers a device, with the sugar content of the intended measure fruchtsorten (winegrowers so that the oechsle in grape musts). 
Fortunately, facilitate the rechnerei tables. 
To make ice requires not so much physical use as before. 
Not only the equipment for the automatic manufacture of grundmasse helps. 
There is also a device in which the ready-made eis-mischung cremig beaten, and at the same time minustemperaturen kept cool. 
Despite all the computerized remain small breakdowns. 
The Brazilians Gustavo acquitted itself and its kurskollegen from top to bottom with fruchtpüree, as he überdimensionale hand blenders spiral out of control. 
At any rate, "says Maestro Luciano," it is only a matter of time before that happens. "
