In the middle of the sly 
In the weeks after the sudden death of their man, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy which their beliebtheitsrate 20 points over 50%, which is the highest value since its election in 2007. 
Whether it is in the next year to a re-election gets depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández compromise than their deceased husband, your predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner. 
The signs are not clear. 
Néstor Kirchner, even after the election of his wife, the economic policy was often budgets in the tax revenues, economic growth and inflation is not fully into account. 
This allowed the präsidentenpaar, the extraeinnahmen as it sees fit. 
On paper, the fernández-regierung last year, the majority in Congress. 
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October, leading to further divisions. 
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández. 
But after chaotic meetings (where a parliamentarian, another face, and the Government of the bribery accused), the Congress, the budget for 2011. 
"I will not discuss it," the President. 
The 2010 budget is now for the next year, which makes the President more opportunity to spend money as it sees fit. 
The economy is overheating, it is likely that this year by up to 9% increase. 
The official inflation rate is z.z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and moderation of the trade unions - are the figure of nearly 30%. 
Kirchner, the 2003 the premiership, as Argentina was beset by economic crises, growth and poverty reduction to its primary objectives, and not the inflationssenkung. 
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, has singled out for bullying as the private sector and säuberte the National Institute for statistics and census indec, prompting the official inflationsstatistiken schönte. 
Mr Fernández, now we can follow? 
It is the private sector and the trade union leader to discussions. 
And official statements that wage increases in the next year to 18%. 
The high prices for Argentina's agricultural products have a strong boost to the economy. 
But the burst of inflation undermined by a great devaluation in 2002. 
Perhaps, Cristina Fernández for this reason, Argentina and back to the rest of the world. 
At the beginning of this year, the government an agreement with shareholders holding the former restructuring of the country in 2001. 
Now it seems that Fernández to an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club to which it owes around $6.7 billion. 
The Kirchners had a review by the IMF, as elsewhere, been rejected. 
But in the last month, the Finance Minister Amado boudou aware that the fund in the drawing up of a new national consumer price index "technical support '. It looks as if this were to be the first step towards the cleaning up of the indec. 
It is not known whether Fernández after the end of its term of office, even without the support of your husband politically active. 
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which is largely the kirchnerismus enough. 
If the Argentines from their summer holiday back in March, the wave of sympatie it was shown to be fizzled. 
If you want to win another election, it must decide whether it many political decisions of their man quietly lifted.
