Métro grand Paris: first financial tantalizing glimpses of Europe 
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport industry on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it rains billion. 
At least in the discussions. 
We call on this, in particular, the 23 billion for the metro grand Paris in memory of the Société du Grand Paris is to be built. 
The baubeginn the SGP, the state has a kapitaldotation of EUR 4 billion. 
The theoretical scheme is the sum of the SGP then that would allow the markets of the finanzsumme to their dual. 
Today it is, after all, the first projections. 
The amending budget for 2010, this morning studied by the finanzkommission of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged in the first part of this money. 
We are talking here about two measures: the creation of a special tax on erschließund and a higher taxation of offices on the ile-de France. 
The former funding, so Article 15 of the law, is in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris. " 
This is estimated: 'the product of this tax amounts to EUR 117 million per year. 
Zweitere is reorganizing the existing taxation: "in order to modernise it from their educational product, and this increase of the Société du Grand Paris to entrust." 
How much would it propose? 
A puzzle. 
This amount is not in the text. 
Of the 4 billion is a long way away. 
'It is stated that the fiscal resources to the EUR 4 billion of kapitaldotation be added by the State will be found and Société du Grand Paris and for the project to be done, "is the explanatory statement. 
The SGP will take place this system is not objectionable. 
"since the moment in which the revenue recorded (the two taxes, R.), the studies on for three years, blankets and then from the fountainhead of 4 billion," says. 
"This is noted in the budget and gradually withdrawn." 
The SGP estimates that started in 2013, which will be 4 billion for the budget 2014 to note. 
This measure, whose 4 billion promised we will be able to seek, runs the risk of a law, parliamentary debate. 
The first meeting will take place on 7 December.
