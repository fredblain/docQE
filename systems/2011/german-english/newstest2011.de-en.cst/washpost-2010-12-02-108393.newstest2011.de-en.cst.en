The Khmer Rouge veterans to confrontation with the past forced 
In a weak pointed betonierten klassenraum with dirty and abblätternden walls, the director of the anlong veng high school of the man, it has built in the subsequent Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok. 
"everyone here loves Ta Mok." 
"It was a good leader, and he has focussed its people," said sreng KOR Ma, 42 years. 
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as the "schlachter" remains the commander in this remote former Rouge rouge-hochburg popular in the north-west of Cambodia, where he hospitals and bridges built, the infrastructure has developed and where thousands of former soldiers still live. 
But this year, 12 years after the capitulation of the Khmer Rouge to the government, longstanding supporters in anlong veng challenged. 
In April, a local truth and versöhnungsforum the victims of the public confrontation with the people once the regime. 
In June, the government has circulated a passed official examinations for the first time children of former soldiers of the history of the Khmer Rouge. 
And in July, a gemeinschaftstribunal of the United Nations and Cambodia, for the first time, a former Member of the Khmer Rouge, when the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture centres, Kaing khek iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison. 
With each of these developments, the fear of the Khmer Rouge veterans alnlong vengs, aggravated their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into society in Cambodia. 
"There is still disagreement and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said chhang youk, the head of the documentation centre of Cambodia, an independent organisation that regime. 
'for them, life under the Khmer Rouge glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil. " 
"It divides even families." 
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people have been executed or they died of diseases, revision or hunger. 
When the Vietnamese and 1979 invaded the pole pot-ied Government underwent fled the leftovers of the regime and its armed forces on the border of Cambodia to Thailand. 
This widespread until December 1998, when the final movement kapitulierte, unrest. 
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary the guerrilla warfare of its basis in the west of the mountains and the jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok, the next generation anlong veng. 
But the mid-1990's, when the UN-sponsored peace agreement in 1993 the first democratic elections in the country, began large groups of the Khmer Rouge fighters, the Government is urged to kapitulationen of Ieng Sary 1996 and nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998. 
In 1998, Pol Pot died a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not yielded in 1999 of government in the mountain dangrek arrested. 
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh, where he was on his trial. 
As their patrons they are no longer protected, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters in the exhausting poverty of the rural Cambodia and many retained the movement in nostalgia. 
Even if a few elitist official of the Khmer Rouge their local regierungsposten retained because their weapons niederlegten, the poor, uneducated farmers. 
"they have very little of the capitulation benefited," said Sok leang by the Center for justice and reconciliation, in Cambodia, in anlong veng, public forums, 
"You are enshrined in the utopian agrarideologie of the regime '. 
"they grew without any berufswissen." 
Sor Lim, 55 years, in 1974, a teenager of rhmer Rouge had joined, fought in the jungle at anlang veng before 1998 niederließ to live as poor reisbauer. 
"life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said. 
"Ta Mok everyone has something to eat." 
But it is now, because we are looking after our own. " 
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raises concerns. 
At the beginning of next year, the Court will try to Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister, brought to justice. 
The remit of the Court, it is the old leaders and those who are responsible for the atrocities to condemn, but it is not at all clear whether it is on these four cases further action. 
It has done little to the anxieties in anlong veng. 
Current media speculation, in chaem, 64 years, during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's distriktchefin manteay meanchey in the province. 
In 2007, the representative of the documentation centre of Cambodia told they have the construction of the trapeang thma dam, a project in which thousands of zwangsarbeitern presumably died. 
On a hot night chaem came from the work in the fields on her holzhaus a dirty roads outside anlong veng. 
As the sun long shadow over the desiccated grass, rejected in chaem, about their past the Khmer Rouge to discuss. 
Should the Court vorladen, it would refuse to go, she said. 
Cambodia is living in peace and stability, "she said. 
"There would be no persecution, would be war." 
Prime Minister, Hun Sen, 1878 of the Khmer Rouge has fled, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be unsafe, the Court more suspicious, even though experts and historians to discuss this. 
Cambodia must dig a hole and disregard the past, "he said. 
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to be able to go forward, said chhang youk from dokumentationszentrum. 
"reconciliation with the khmer-zeiten means gathering of the pieces," he said. 
"It is our duty, this broken parts together, so that everything can understand." 
The Centre has created the first of the government approved passed official examinations of the Khmer Rouge, the 75seitige "history of a democratic Cambodia." 
It has circulated the book in June in anlong veng annexed to the history books for the high school of the Ministry of Education, less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge. 
As so often in Cambodia know young people in anlong veng little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the links of the city to the regime. 
Touch valeak, 19 years, a student of the anlong veng high school, said that the new passed official examinations students will be an important part of its history. 
But his parents were sceptical, the book home, to read. 
"My family rejected many parts of the book, and the Court," he said. 
"You are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people will be condemned by the Court of Justice '. 
One such resistance to the process of reconciliation is complex and complicated, said Sok leang. 
But the public forums, which passed official examinations and the Court gradually gain influence, "he said. 
Still, the Khmer Rouge is a powerful attraction.
