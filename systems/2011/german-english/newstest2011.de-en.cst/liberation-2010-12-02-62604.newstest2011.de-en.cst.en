Climate, such as France, its finanzversprechen amount 
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to comply with the financing pledge rapidly resolved ("almost start 'or premature funding) to investigate the developing countries. 
And the gross French vulnerable to blandishments. 
With the Copenhagen agreement, the developing countries are committed to $30 billion between 2010 and 2012. 
The EU has EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France has promised to 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year). 
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has all the partners of the fact of their commitments regarding fast-start-finanzierungen: detailgetreuer vorgehensbericht to convince the Member States to press conference, that great nebenevents broschürenverteilung. 
The operation and extent of transparency is remarkable for its real value is estimated that the developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries do the same for the same präzisionsniveau. 
The EU announced, in 2010, EUR 2.2 billion released to what they are on the right road to respektbezollung commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012. 
But if we look into detail, things are a little more complicated. 
This money should be according to the Copenhagen Treaty 'and', in order to ensure that an additional use has been tabled, to the detriment of public development aid. 
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what 'and' means. 
While the Commission had proposed a harmonisation of certain Member States, including France, the procedure blocked. 
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark that he considers the best. 
The Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those of 2009 for: the international finance are being retained, and within the framework of funding 'fast-start "150 million over three years. 
Other countries have similar benchmarks, either as regards year or in terms of the level of public development aid. 
In contrast, France was of the opinion that the financing of 'all new projects' of 2010 are "new and additional '. 
In other words, there is no indicative in the expenditure of the previous year or at a global level of public development aid. 
Specifically, the total amount of the French support for developing countries remain stable (or discourage) - France gives its commitment to the "new and additional 'financing. 
Another important element is the breakdown in donations and loans. 
There is still no rule, and everyone chooses its rechenmodus. 
Some countries, such as France, have lent €1 as an equivalent to 1 donated €. 
This is apparently difficult to justify that the effort is not comparable. 
If the use of loans for certain profitable investment (and often to the emissionseindämmung tied projects, which actually based on technology) can be justified, it is illusory to present the euro, known as the equivalent of EUR donated to pervade... and only the cost of the loan for the kapitalgeberland be counted as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of interest rate). 
But France has nothing changed in accordance with the following thought: it 'respect' its commitment of EUR 420 million by 91,5% loans (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% donates) 36,1 million euros) - see the document, in order to convince themselves. 
France is the only country in the EU that loans to a great extent. 
Germany is 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands, or Slovakia (among other things) their commitments to 100% of donations. 
In other words, if the vast majority of European Union €to fulfil their obligations, France spends just 10 cents and understands including a similar effort. 
Beautiful hocus-pocus. 
All in all, operated on France in its fast-start-finanzierung with a dual sham: a part with a weiterentwicklkung of action over time, and partly with the reality of the financial commitment. 
France, manages to believe that this 420 million "new and additional 'million in accordance with its promises, and it saves it has spent 36,1 million euros. 
The manipulation of the Treasury (as it appears that it was Bercy the arbitrage has carried out a doubly negative effect) could entail; even internally (why the other Member States with the donations if there is enough to lend?), and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries is not completely misled... 
The chapter of premature finance only a small issue in a relatively short time in comparison with the entirety of discussions on the climate. 
But it may be too much of the drop in the cost of machinery UNFCCC. 
We hope that this will not be the case. 
As always, it is essential that its lesson from this first year of premature funding to learn. 
First and foremost, France may amend its verbuchungsart for the years 2011 and 2012, and in a spirit of respect for his commitments and the counterbalancing fairness with the other countries of the European Union. 
Above all, however, France could the discussions on the subject of a dispute of long-term financing forward (another decisive and is currently discussing): you can escape the question of "verrechenbarkeit" or verbuchungsart its loans. 
France could change its position as progressive as regards the disputes, as it is in other areas. 
The hope is based on the new environment minister Kosciusko-Morizet, next week in Cancun will arrive. 
A surprising announcement on the fast-start France and its vision of the "verrechenbarkeit 'and the use of loans would naturally the international trust to raise the need for further discussions.
