Czech children with the highest Fernet and rum beer is out - it is simply too slow 
Fernet, rum and vodka, just for once, is also a good whisky, the father of the hausbar has stolen. 
These are the drinks, which enjoy drunken Czech teenagers under fifteen most notbehandelt. 
No exception are children, their hangovers ausschlafen repeatedly in the hospital. 
This is apparent from the experiences of doctors, with similar cases in the inclusion of the kinderabteilungen of clinics. 
"beer or wine are completely out of fashion, because it is simply too long before you get." 
The current trend is clearly hard alcohol, "said právo luděk Pelikán, the kinderabteilung chefarzt mittelböhmischen hořovice in the clinic. 
"whisky, if it succeeds, the father of a bottle of hausbar to ours and, if not, then at least Fernet or vodka. 
'vodka has the advantage that it can interfere with juice, then, it is not as strong, "says the chefarzt. 
The spokesman of the fakultätskrankenhauses motol Eva jurinová gives him right. 
"the most concerns Fernet or rum." 
"This is today's alkoholtrend, notably in primary schools." 
"occasionally it was also about slibowitz, we feel at home ', Mrs jurinová. 
Chefarzt Pelikán, dreizehn- or fourteen-year-old drinkers in the krankenhausaufnahme been no exception. 
Before the clinic in hořovice, since this year, he was ten years in the hospital pädiatrie-abteilung motol, where the ambulances angetrunkene pupils from far and wide ablieferten. 
"a girl had hospitalisiert four times." 
"their careers began with 12 years ago, when the first time it with 3.5 mg alcohol in the blood and even in combination with" extase "was" the doctor was described in a particularly serious case. 
"It was in ausstellungsgelände in holešovice on any tanzparty." 
'What is interesting is that their mother is not strange found that 48 hours is not your daughter came home, "is the chefarzt. 
It is the lack of interest of the parents or the incredible tolerance to initiate their own sprösslingen is regarded as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children. 
A genuine dependency in the true sense of the word, according to the experts, in children. 
"alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomenon to understand and that is not the case for these children." 
Those who repeatedly alcohol enjoy is often a negative characteristic familiär-sozialer background, "says chefarzt Pelikán. 
The spokesman of the hospital motol, Mrs jurinová, until the middle of November around forty drunken children in the abandonment of department for child and jugendmedizin trained. 
However, only the cases of serious alkoholvergiftung, in hospital was needed, in the statistics. 
Drunken children who, after ambulatory care of the parents or, if necessary, by the police brought home will not be recorded. 
Apart from the cases in which children only as a bottle of spirits in schulbank austrinken there is the opinion of Mr Pelikán three jahreszeitliche amplituden, to the 100% reliance is: walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year. 
"the latter for two reasons, either from distress because of the poor testimony or joy on the holiday." 
"walpurgisnacht I have seven drunken children in the inclusion of experiences," stresses Dr Pelikán. 
A betrunkenes baby, the night under medical supervision spends, paradoxically, better off than one child, the next day, only with a unpleasant hangover. 
The headaches on the morning after the dehydration and the glukosemangel, in hospital with a flüssigkeitsspendenden infusion with glucose produced and nutrients, the absence of the organism. 
"You are clearly better off, because according to the 'beautiful' experience in the evening, raise it with good humour, without somewhere somewhat ache." 
"You are only a little confused about where they are ', Dr Pelikán, recognising the patients sometimes at least the good humour to perish by giving you the cost of that year, the treatment costs. 
Because of the transport with the ambulances and the night in a akutbett are well on a few tens of thousands of kroner. 
"and I have used this as erziehungsmittel if I directly to the children in the visit meant what their drunkenness have cost, and that it can happen that you all the holidays on working to ensure that the money for one such fete to earn," added doctorate Pelikán. 
In his view, the health insurance funds, regressverfahren in curing the costs trunkenen children from parents.
