A long finger than ringfinger means a lower risk that we will develop cancer 
Men, the finger is long, as the ringfinger, are obviously a lower risk of developing prostate cancer. 
This is a surprising result of a study on the Wednesday of the British journal of cancer has been published. 
This is the mirror of male hormone testosterone. 
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer can be used and, in particular, for men to sixty ', said the mitautorin the study Ros eeles krebsforschungsinstitut, a professor at the university in WARWICK. 
The finger could help to determine which men are necessarily a prostatakrebs-test should undergo, especially when genetic risks or other risk factors, such as, for example, family health burdens, added Mrs eeles. 
In the period from 1994-2009 pursued it with their colleagues in Brittany more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time 3000 healthy men. 
More than half of the participants of the study was the finger of the right hand shorter than the ringfinger. 
For these men had the same likelihood of prostate cancer, as well as for 19% of those men, whose 'ring' and fingers equally long. 
In men, whose fingers longer than the ringfinger was, however, this risk fell by 33% for men and 60 even 87%. 
The relationship between the length of the two aforementioned finger, which is already in the prenatal age are obviously reflects the different mirror of geschlechtshormonen to which the child in the womb was exposed. 
Less testosterone is a lengthy fingers. 
Former research found that the testosterone accelerated growth of prostate cancer. 
Václav pačes, leading Czech geneticists and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said that he was čtk this study fleetingly known, but nevertheless it is the relationship between the fingerlänge and the risk of cancer has not been proven for "no."
