The right matratze and the right bettenrost? women have other desires than men 
Not tollste bettrahmen, but the quality of the liegefläche matratze rost - and make good bed. 
This must, however, harmoniously complement to the wishes of the concrete user. 
The choice to play a role on many issues - the weight, the size of the health and, last but not least, the sex of the schläfers. 
Equally important is the interieur, and subordinate matratze rost. 
Typical example? 
In a wochenendhaus, which are not regularly heated latexmatratzen not suitable for much longer, as they need to be "hot." 
Moreover, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethan-matratzen. 
And - you should regularly be turned. 
If they do not have enough entlüftungskanälchen, in essence, even on a firm plate, staut, humidity, so it is not excluded that their schimmel. 
The choice is, of course, also a role, in which it is used. 
Who, for a long time abroad, where very high matratzen with weichschicht, will be difficult to a low matratze used with hard surface. 
"All an ice-hockey player from the nhl have returned to have complained to me that you are not able to sleep more correctly." 
'for their abgeschundenen shoulders, closely and hüften they need simply weichschicht from visco-schaum (memory foam - a formgedächtnis-polymer) '. 
"I recommend including zuckerkranken people under a disruption of the nervous system, so that the 'information' from the ligaments and skin can receive bad," says Sylva hadamcziková on polstermöbel. 
That is why I voted for several years, many eishockeyspielern, but also other customers with these matratzen visco-schaum (memory foam). 
"Today, this is no longer a problem, because such matratzen offer including the manufacturer, the Italian company tempur magniflex or the Czech manufacturer tropico." 
And it is not necessarily a famous an ice-hockey player, the benefits of the visco-schaums learn to appreciate. 
This "miracle" actually works quite simple. 
The foam optimalisiert its rigour and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, it is downright schmiegt on hot body. 
Nowhere is there, in the night shifts are not around for a serious fight. 
We sleep much better. 
The viskoelastische foam also offers protection against dekubitus (gangrene). 
In the choice of matratzengröße should still be at the height of the length of fußsohlen to, i.e. approximately 21 to 34 cm. 
As Mrs Mann, the 180 cm tall, so a 210 to 220 cm bed. 
Each of the schläfer should at least 90 cm liegebreite available, i.e. 180 cm. 
When einzelbetten singles, for example, 120 to 140 cm. 
The own comfort, and also for any visitors. 
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb for the ideal bettbreite: 'If you are on the back, should have enough room for the easy angewinkelten poor, "advises the ING. Helena prokopová zunftmeisterin the polsterer raumausstatter, and for years the issue of healthy schlafes and the ergonomics of furniture devoted to this issue put on colleges. 
In a doppelbett everyone needs its own rost and its own matratze, but be careful when buying products, so that the matratzen too high. 
Otherwise, cannot do other than roste in different levels to make, and that is not in any bettrahmen possible. 
Schaummatratzen should at least 14 cm high, with 15 cm matratzen federskelett, it should at least three centimeters on formschicht and feinpolster. 
'with the hands or sit down the feathers in no case be felt, "warns Helena prokopová. 
Any matratze makes a particular rosttyp required. 
With matratze ganzgepolsterte beds and documents as zusammengewachsene siamzwillinge have no place in the bedroom. 
These matratzen cannot drop and the respect we cannot wash, which today is already commonplace. 
And as a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the matratze after five to seven years, a huge (and congested sieve). 
That is also why reject experts werbeslogans in matratzen a lifetime of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee promises. 
In any case, your ifs and buts. 
And is therefore a practical advice of traders: matratzen of 120 or 140 cm broad should be the hygiene of waschbaren abziehbaren emolument that, nonetheless, it is recommended that a matratzenschoner, easy to use and wash. 
Even if today in the rule matratzenbezüge with rundumreißverschluss, so it is open to the two halves gets (immensely important for the waschvorgang and waschmaschinengröße!), the manipulation with larger matratzen, particularly, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. 
Have you in the bed rostes instead of a firm plate? 
Out of it. 
Or, at most, a bed of unloved guests and for a single night. 
So they should rather prosaic with lüftungslöchern oversight (if any), and there are already matratzen with federskelett and 15 cm minimum allocation with the so-called taschenfederkern and feinpolster use. 
Polyurethan-matratzen belong in such a document. 
For not verstellbare lattenroste with 14 to 18 federleisten (lamellen) are suitable or sandwichmatratzen latex- (possibly also combinations of latex and kokos), figures are roste with a larger lattenanzahl, 28 and more federleisten, with lordosenstütze in lendenwirbelbereich, and the possibility of the lattenhärte to regulate. 
On verstellbare lamellenroste not include matratzen with federskelett, because it does not respond to the ergonomische verstellung. 
In addition to the cessation of rigid the special flexible schultermodule federleisten will also be required. 
We are talking about a specific integration of federleisten which allows the federleisten einzudrücken verwinkeln or even to the specific einsinken the shoulders of schläfers. 
Particularly for men with broad shoulders an important matter. 
There are even matratzenhersteller which have started in "herrenmatratzen" weichzonen for schulterbereich. 
The President is intended - you off these weichzonen in hüftgegend. 
For ambitious customers are punktelastische flügelfedersysteme (lattoflex) or roste with punktelastischen kontakt-pads with the so-called multitorsionsfederung. 
The pressure will be distributed on a number of points, which reduces the tension. 
But, if the right matratze and right rost a bad (too big and fülliges) kopfkissen used the most benefits are lost. 
Here, too, a rule of thumb: kopfkissen is the head, its leaders should only to shoulder the rich, so that the schultermuskeln relax. 
Ideal is therefore a great kissen 50 X 60 cm, as for example the Scandinavians. 
In the seitenlage should kopfkissen (together with the schulterentlastungszone in rost or weichzone in matratze) schulterhöhe. 
Some have our modern matratzen with the former (with hay EU-US) strohsäcken but in common. 
Modern manufacturers are using increasingly natural materials, or at least their mixtures. 
When matratzen means the new magic word 'bio'. 
Rather than erdölrohstoffen we used to manufacture polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturelle oils - for example, sojaöl rizinus-. 
Soya is known by all manufacturers. 
"bio matratzen, that is to say in their heart of material is a purely natural origin," says Petr vašíček tropico plus of the company. 
Naturstoffe but also in the production of matratzenbezügen - one of the first was aloe Vera. 
We can but also mikrokapseln grant the sleep of fresh forest or lavendelduft. 
Here, too, there is a difference between men and women. 
While the men 'kühlender "pflanzenextrakt from birkenblättern used, so that the matratzenbezug heat and cooling can absorb the body, the salary for women' wärmende" effect. 
Extracts from red paprikaschoten stimulate the blutzirkulation of the weaker sex is the sleep wohlig warm words. 
And today's favourites? 
From kaltschaum matratzen (he has greater poren with devastated zellstruktur and is therefore atmungsaktiver than handelsübliches polyurethan and much more flexible). 
The combination of the various stiff (toughness) kaltschäumen visco-schäumen mehr-zonen-matratzen arise and to know exactly where capita hip and closely. 
For a high-quality matratze is 7 000 kroner and more berappen. 
Gesundheitsmatratzen but are usually burdened with lower VAT, but as a medical aid. 
The first Czech company was gumotex this advantage. 
You see, the matratze and on rost saving is not so easy. 
Sometimes there are special offers of manufacturers and traders, the two matratzen for the price of one. 
The brand magniflex the matratze duofreeze in relation verstepptem visco-schaum memory for 11.990 CZK. 
The second will be free to do so. 
It was the material tempur that the era of viskoelastischen schaumstoffe with open zellstruktur and dense in almost kosmischem pace. 
No wonder they have been but for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to launch huge überbelastungen. 
Tempur in heat soft, in a cool environment to entrench it in turn. 
So it is the human body, perfect and distributed in the best possible way körperdruck. 
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent druckbrand but increased general schlafkomfort. 
Viskoelastische schaumstoffe but not only in matratzen, but also in other gesundheitsprodukten, such as, for example, in particular fußpolstern used the legs and the gefäßen provide relief. 
For example, the use of domestic manufacturers schaumstoffe eucatherm C twinsaver or similar products.
