The trail of stones 
Uli gsell, which concerned, a total of approximately 400 kg. 
On Monday evening, he was in Stuttgart, which have station tuba on the back. 
It was demo. 
It snowed heavily. 
It is the same old story: in September, the excavators angerückt and had started a large chunk of the nordflügels break off. 
The Stuttgart world was not more of the same: thousands marched against s21 tieferlegung the billions of little station. 
When it came to the settlement freeze, there was a large proportion of the wing in ruins. 
Shattered in 6,000, 7000 pieces. 
Crailsheimer muschelkalk, a soft gross stone, between 1914 and 1920. 
Gsell is sculptor in ostfildern, 43 years old. 
He has a few scraps. 
These obstacles are "reliquien." 
"You must not disappear." 
He schwärmt: 'a cheap and poor Stein, simple and erdenhaft. " 
As he aufsägte, have the following zigarettenqualm gerochen. 
What he will do with the scraps, he knows. 
Stones have time. 
Uli gsell. 
The trail of the Stuttgart stones will result in a forest in Tübingen on a former munitionsdepot the French army, where Manuel rongen stein-reich has to be built. 
The 44-jährige deals with old stones. 
He has bought, the demolition in Stuttgart. 
It would be a disgrace, you would schotter gemahlen or landfill disappearance, "he says in his office, a holzbüdchen, once a wachhäuschen. 
We have named and threatened him, he tells in September in the newspapers that the remnants of the abbruchunternehmer nordflügels bought. 
But he has talked with the s-21-gegnern days. 
And he has declared that he is now nothing for the demolition. 
And if it was happening, then it is the wisest thing if the stones reused. 
Around 200 s-21-gegner, as one of the, on average, 80 kilos of serious quader stückpreis 6,50, up to EUR 14. 
As a memory, but also in the hope that it will be able to return to a reconstruction. 
500 tonnes rongen had bought, 25 large lkw-ladungen. 
About half is still in the forest, the rest is sold. 
Gartenbesitzer, landschaftsgärtner, häuslebauer. 
Everywhere you have weggeschleppt and what boot and supporters were able to bear. 
The Stuttgart stones of contention have long been in "mäuerle" or limits of kräuterbeeten. 
This stone 'actually is nothing special, "says rongen. 
"is not the political component." 
It is rising in his SUVs, makes a tour by 20 hectares large empire. 
In passing, it has studied and terminated later biology, then he is interested in computers and finally steinhändler. 
And steinliebhaber. 
40000 tonnes of stones stored it. 
From Germany karrt its value. 
He says that he is the biggest altsteinhändler the Republic. 
It stifles. 
In the snow, skilful behauene sandsteine. 
"They belonged to Dresden marienbrücke," he told. 
Elbsandstein, amber, warm, he schwärmt. 
"My lieblingsstein." 
This is the way to highly by the forest. 
It shows a bunch: red sandstein, formerly part of the Karlsruhe little station. 
And further. 
Beautiful travertin. " 
Once the quader belonged to the gallery of the Stuttgart neckarstadions. 
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories cannstatter travertin from the Stuttgart, bringing rötlicher stone is complemented with the cathedral, Saint blasien tuff the Heilbronner hospital. 
The work of the effort, which sweat. 
If rongen to think about how the Stones being used by hand and simple flaschenzügen ochsenkarren budged, and it is quite reverential. 
It would be a scandal if it schreddern. " 
It is not rich, immensely rich. 
However, 14 people employs the steinhändler today, furthermore, the top in the forest steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glasbläser and a gartenbauer settled. 
"We are working hard, but it is satisfactory," says the resteverwerter. 
Soon, it needs to Cologne. 
There, too, there are obstacles to save.
