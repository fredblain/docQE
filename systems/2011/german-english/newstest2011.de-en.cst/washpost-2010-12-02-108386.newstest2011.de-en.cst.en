Can combine the divisive courtesy? 
After a campaign to schimpfwörtern and negativity is this week little courtesy in Washington has erupted. 
It is the sign of a real zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion, before we quickly to the struggle of the parties in the capital return? 
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of the Congress produced no breakthrough in the big issues to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government's policy in which any decision to be taken to deal with. 
After all, what we hear that it has not been a polite debate between two different sides of a further consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of partisan punktesammelns. 
The public meetings of the deficit Commission of Presidents on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences between the members continue to exist. 
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months of mutual respect, the emergence of the ideological divide, which continues to the Members divides, concealed. 
It is not enough to say that it is a new era of cooperation here. 
Both sides are now in a trial - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise, while claiming even tried to the limitations of public opinion and the patience of the voters for a renewed parteienkriegsführung arbitration. 
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants on a minimum requirements or accusations. 
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too low, and that there is a rapid change in the atmosphere in the last two years, might be dominated. 
Regardless of whether we are talking about taxes, donations, health or benefits, the two sides are miles apart. 
Lastly, the novemberwahl Washington, at least for a short time bribed. 
There is no question, the tone has changed, "said pete wehner, an official representatives of the Bush administration, which is now for the 'ethics and public policy center." 
"that is after elections inevitable. 
Elections give partisan passions, die. 
And that is a good thing. " 
In some areas, particularly in those that are on the agenda of the 'lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have no other choice than to find a solution. " 
Bush's tax cuts ends at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it. 
Both sides want to find a way to receive some or all of them, be it temporarily or permanently. 
Similarly, a compromise on the increased benefits to be expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that it believes that the recommendation that tax cuts for the rich, while unemployed workers support. 
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House is the optimism, that it is in these issues during the "lame duck" some session and, at the same time, the New START Treaty, cannot ratify. 
But William glaston the Brookings insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of lame duck session 'is not necessarily a lasting cooperation between the parties must lead, if the new 112. Congress convened in January. 
Instead, he says, is a phase of nichtübereinstimmens likely, perhaps even inevitable. 
"after the things that have to be done is done, this short-term psychology in confrontation reversal," he said. 
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many, the courtesy to real cooperation. 
"I see much of what is happening today in 2012, as a vorkampf or further shadow boxing, for the hauptereignis from 2012," he said. 
The reasons for this have much with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the teeparty-wählern their education served. 
As concerns the Republican leaders, it may be that you too high poker, you know that you must try to their promise to reduce government spending and health-care reform, to be respected. 
These parteilinien are already in the initial reactions on the recommendations of the deficit Commission clear how a tax reform and the raising of certain taxes, as well as the increase in the retirement age and the lowering of spending. 
The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in accordance with its own assessments, pushed the defizitfrage on the public agenda that these could no longer be ignored. 
But they need within the Commission, 14 of the 18 votes with its plan to official recommendation and you are fighting, even in the vicinity of this figure. 
The greatest resistance will take place in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters, today at least, little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises. 
Galston says two stages in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress. 
The first battle will next year in the form of parteizusammenstößen take place, if the Republicans Obama in terms of the budget, the taxes and the health system, then followed by a period of more zweiparteilicher cooperation. 
What will this change? 
Public opinion. 
It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties work together. 
If confrontation is a blind alley, as happened in 1995, then both sides must be prudent to the public reaction. 
Whoever sentenced to lose, will change tack and the compromise must seek. 
This may, in fact, an optimistic view. 
Partiality and polarisation today are greater than in the mid-1990's, and they seem more ideological gap between Obama and the kongress-republikanern than at the time between President Clinton and the Republicans. 
At the same time, the activists of both parties in 2010 as a mere prelude to a far wider choice to 2012. 
So it may be the courtesy of this week on the display of many Americans will be welcomed. 
But it will on both sides much more effort requires a common denominator in the questions, the two are still separated.
