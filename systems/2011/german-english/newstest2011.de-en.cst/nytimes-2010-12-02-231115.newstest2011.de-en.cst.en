Tech toys keeps geschenkebudget balance 
This year's favourite among the gifts is iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft kinect videokonsole. Both games can be a significant hole in their geschenkebudget. 
A iPad costs as much as five bmx-räder for $99, while the price of a kinect-spiel approximately 10 classic springseilen or about 48 doses play-doh. 
But they can protect their geschenkebudget. 
Recently I visited in search of three elektronikspielzeugen under $80 three national spielzeughändler - a Wal-Mart, a toys' r 'us and a bj' s wholesale club. 
I was immediately clear that Moore's law came into force this year was the technologiespielzeuge vibrant and cost at the same time a little less than last year. 
And although fewer new toys with its own website, will take place on the best-known of this type, and club webkinz Penguin a wider supply. 
There are more and more knopfzellen-betriebene toys on the market, and many of them contain wiederaufladbare akkus. 
Here are a few recommendations. 
(if not differently, are all prices of toys' r 'US.) 
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are plüschfiguren, such as guinea pig, the A grade, if you on your stomach. 
Once a button is rated by mehrmaliges button is a song. 
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony. 
Respect for, if they are even started, they can no longer stop. 
For a combination of gesand and dance the dance star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60 for children from 2) the best choice. 
On the basis of the last year developed elmo live-technologie offers the animatronische doll recantations as' Simon says', and thanks to the novel scharnierfüße radblockierung moon-walk dominated by it. 
Children who use the appliance quiet where monetary tanzlehrer Mickey as their parents complained about the lack of lautstärkeregelung. 
If a child of the 1980s, you surely remember to alphie, one of the first computerisierten lernspielzeuge. 
Now it is back (hasbro / playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch fragekarten, with a autofahrt an hour's training delivered, with a besserwisser with autokorrektur-funktion as teachers. 
If you do not like their child smartphone entrust it, there are three independent alternatives. 
Mobigo of vtech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and benutzerfreundlichste solution with a qwerty-tastatur. The point of the Games, however, are not so instructive as the leapster Explorer eliminated ($70, for children from 3 to 12), the following leapfrogs first major revision of the leapster-reihe with a new, helleren screen. 
None of the versions is compatible with elderly cassettes. 
Ixl of Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) is used for the Games and ebooks a system similar to iTunes and, thanks to the family photograph sd-kartenlaufwerks can also be said to be. 
Finally, there are still scrabble flash ($30 from hasbro, for children from 8). The five bloc are no more than a matchbox and have their own led-bildschirm. 
At stake, it is a question of the blocks to pool words before the period expires. It is wonderful for an improvised buchstabierwettbewerb. 
More and more toys have a kind of online-verbindung. 
If you only after the supply in the toy shops are webkinz and club Penguin the most important. 
Your child an online-tier the club Penguin, they can, for example, a Disney club Penguin 2 'mix' n match figurenpaket ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which is a coin with geheimcode. 
If the code online works, receives her child in the club Penguin store enough credits for a further two parts. 
This can rollschuhe or puffle-stofftier. 
The latest kopfzellen-betriebene mikroroboter, hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is greater than the head of their toothbrushes. 
The käfer moves quickly to 12 vibrierenden silikonbeinen in any direction. 
It makes fun by a irrgarten from klötzen. 
And he has quite a lot. 
We fell from the dinner table and outlived even some time in the mouth of our dog.
