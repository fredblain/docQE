What can they do? čssd the Czech social democrats in Prague are neither voldemort, nor the "konditorei '. 
The new ratsherren the capital from the ranks of the čssd will obviously have to overcome certain barriers to their alt-neuen colleagues from the ODS in Prague and in the Council to be able to understand stadtvertretung at all. 
The newspaper has aktuálně.cz members of the new Council from čssd time a little "abgeklopft ', as they dominate the notorious slang over the past few years has naturalised, in which the current coalition in Prague at the helm. 
The encoded vocabulary, in the era of Pavel bém verflossenen mayor of the Prague political elite was introduced, some of the most prominent players, situations and causae entlehnt. 
Surprisingly, the new councils in relation to these new concepts in the dark. 
The claim they at least. 
"who is voldemort?" 
'No idea. " 
'I am a newcomer to the Prague policy', responded lukáš kaucký, the new ratsherr on culture, on the test of the "paten-wortschatzes'. 
But the ratsherr Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way. 
For example, on the concept of 'golfloch'. 
This is the only expression of those present here, I occasionally use '. 
"otherwise, I do not often infiltrated by slang." 
From the vocabulary of the tageblatt aktuálně.cz in this year's June before wahlkongress the ODS had published, pickte the drawing-up of six notions, especially those that are notoriously with the Prague Government. 
The Social Democrats should the concepts of "voldemort ',' greatest Prague golfloch ',' in the konditorei go ',' stiernacken ',' betrayal of capital 'and' verblechen '. 
Three Prague ratsherren voted in favour of the test, the fourth - Mr weinert the future head of the Prague school system - promised firstly of its participation in the talks, but not even the listeners. 
The fifth ratsherr, Petr dolínek, rejected the test from the outset. 
"I am indifferent to these matters and how the Civic Democrats themselves, I do not have sentences." 
For me, it is how we understand in our programmes, "he made. 
As has already been indicated, lukáš kaucký in the above-mentioned headline allegedly not recognised that the influential entrepreneurs and friend of the ex-oberbürgermeisters bém, Roman janoušek. 
The term 'voldemort kaucky "says absolutely nothing, and the only one that he was correct erriet on the test," the biggest Prague golfloch'. 
"This is the tunnel blanka," says kaucký, added to security but added: "But I know that more of the newspaper '. 
And jokingly: "I will probably prove a sprachkurs." 
The "golfloch 'will not only of matador Karel Březina, but also by the Environment ratsherrn lukáš plachý right as a tunnel blanka entziffert. 
Both Social Democrats also know, however, for whom the word voldemort and even lukáš plachý senses, where this figure is to be found and what it says, "in which" konditorei to go. 
"I believe, that is to say, in any way to go," Prague gastronomiebetrieb plachý is fairly close to the conundrum hit solution, when we know that it is the seat of janoušeks firms. 
In line with Březina asserts, but rather that this knowledge from the newspaper accessed, in that it adopt this vocabulary. 
The testteilnehmern is anything to go by, it seems from the Social Democrats, in fact, no similar eingebürgerten slang. 
I have also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is something we really not. " 
"We call on us in the name, and we also use acronym or nicknames, 'says the chairman of the Prague čssd Petr hulínský - of his colleague in colloquial terms" hulda'. 
In school I was bříza (birke), but I do not know whether I am also my fellow Members call ', tells us Karel Březina its nicknames. 
The newspaper deník aktuálně.cz has tried and behold, it works. 
Ratsherr weinert is for the colleague in the kind of "OPA 'or less friendly' old ', the representative Miroslav poche before the elections by machinations in partei-sponsoring vocal, some colleagues' igráček" (known Czech lego-figur). 
Nicknames are the only one that the Social Democrats in whose language. 
It may not hulínský supposedly if it is "hulda ', but deník aktuálně.cz registered another nicknamed the Prague chairman. 
His nickname "of" supposedly gummiknüppel-rechte has to do with the fact that Petr hulínský its title doctor Juris to bratislaver Police Academy.
