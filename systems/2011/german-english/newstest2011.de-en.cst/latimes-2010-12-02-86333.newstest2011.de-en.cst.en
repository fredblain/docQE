Arsen-resistente microbe could new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere, facilitate 
The discovery of a foreign bakterienart, including of arsenic can live, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on earth, and elsewhere. 
Although researchers this unusual bacillus here on earth, is it your view, a sign that a life without hitherto regarded as vital elements is possible. 
This body has two options. " 
"it needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." 
This makes it a very particular, although it is almost a form of 'alien' way of life ', said Paul c.w. Davies of Arizona State University and co-autor of the report on Thursday in the online-ausgabe the magazine Science. 
Six main elements have been regarded as essential - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur. 
However, as the scientists herausfanden, increases the Bacillus in the Californian mono Lake still further, if it has been replaced by arsenic. 
"one wonders what else is still possible," said the co-autor of the report Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University. 
The discovery is an important step in seeking außerirdischem life, as scientists life and its forms must recognise, as Anbar. 
The report deals with microbes on earth have been found. 
The announcement of a press conference, with no details of the discovery, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet, the report by the discovery außerirdischen life. 
This is not the case. 
The discovery 'shows that in other planetensystemen organisms, with the help of other elements of biochemical processes in motion and that the' standardelemente ', which, in our opinion, are absolutely vital, not necessarily firmly indicated, "declared Charles cockell, Professor on planetary and space sciences Research Institute of the University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. 
Cockel was not part of the teams. 
This work is a novelty, because it shows that in basic biochemischen processes and structures element by another cannot be replaced ', added cockell. 
This discovery was not accidental. 
The Institute Felisa wolfe-simon astrobiologischen NASA, the study launched, the mono Lake because of the high arsengehalts. 
Since arsenic and phosphorus chemically identical, that microbes that both are exposed, possibly a element by the other can replace. 
"arsens is based, in particular, were aware of the fact that it is chemically a similar situation as phosphorus." 
"It is the organisms, an element of other." 
"But the difference is so great that arsenic differently as phosphorus. It into our biochemisches system, where almost all verschmiert," says Anbar. 
The researchers, the Bacillus gfaj-1 rising arsenkonzentration. It suited to and grew. 
The microbe is growing phosphorus better, but that it is also in arsenic can survive shows that a arsen-basierte way of life, of course, can occur, either on the ground or another planet or the moon, the arsenic frequency. 
According to Jamie S., Mrs Foster, dozentin for Microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus by arsenic can be replaced, not new, but so far there has been no functioning example. 
Arsenic came in the early erdjahren more, she says, therefore, the science assumed that early life there have been used. 
"There is reason to believe that life is also differently than in the early erdzeitalter," Forster, Member States wolfe-simons forschungsteam.
