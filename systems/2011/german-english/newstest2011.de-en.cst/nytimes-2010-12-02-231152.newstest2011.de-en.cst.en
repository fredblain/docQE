In China deploys soft 
As a ausbildungsoffizier step Tang shenbin on an urban space, the revised its jittery subordinates and issued with military authority and orders gedämpfter voice. 
He wanted his female members of China's robust chengguan - of urban policy, feared and contempt for their arbitrary raids and their tendency to violence - the viewers. 
"are! ' 
'look in front!' 
'you', flüsterte it, "how beautiful girls are! ' 
Four girls, not even the teenager-alter with white gloves and identical olivegrünen jacken and trousers were staunchly. 
Four pairs of black pumps had gerader number. 
Four proper hats were perfect with blau-weiß gestreiften destroy proprietary hair. 
"You see, on average, from ', says Mr Tang contempt. 
"models are pretty." 
Several governments have already attempted to the image of China's stadtinspektoren polishing. 
In a city must all new applicants a university degree. 
The Guangdong province, instead of a leuchtend graugrünen blue uniforms. 
In mittel-china wuhan replaced violence by niederstarren: 2009 umkreisten reportedly 50 officials have a properly established imbisswagen and gaze at the operators, and this after half an hour einpackte and left the room. 
Xindu, a stadtbezirk in Chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants, would fundamentally change the image. 
Since 2003, 13 women to strengthen the urban polizeistreifen. They were specific due to their appearance, a figure and their youth. 
It is a softer, crude police femininen aspect. 
Unfortunately, however, it would also be very difficult scarlett johansson, the bad image that the Chinese of these stadtkommandos to improve. 
Quite rightly, the critics. 
Unlike the police, must these officials the urban laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties. 
But the Chinese media routinely a different picture. 
In January 2008, beat officials in the province authorized a spectator to death, as this with his mobile phone, filming, as a protest against a dustbin still. 
Last year was a schulungshandbuch the Beijing officials stolen and published on the Internet, described as criminals without bloodshed can be beaten. 
This year, a Shanghai wassermelonenhändler after a handgemenge with five officials gehirnverletzungen. 
A violence strotzendes videogame that can be downloaded from the Internet, shows in China trained officials in an attack on straßenhändler. 
"chengguan power of government fear," lamentierte national newspaper China Daily last year, following further controversy regarding the tactics. 
The newspaper called a "really thorough cleansing." 
Skeptics are the current approach is clearly inadequate. 
As the distrik in October by displaying eight female recruits, constituted an editorial in Beijing in the evening news, the question of whether the women real tasks, or only as optical distraction. 
Probably both. 
According to the vacancy notice of women under the age of 18 to 22, with good figure and looking like "harmonious." 
They should be - on average 1,5m or 5, and 2 1 / 2 customs. 
The employment ends with the 26 birthday. 
According to the officials who work for women over 25 physically too demanding. 
The most important is its image, "was a unbenannter distriktbeamter in the almost regierungs-webseite rednet.com. 
"If the candidates get the job depends, first by their appearance, as size, weight, gesichtszüge, etc. ' 
Then temperament and 'internal qualities. " 
"female chengguan are put," he said, and added, "but they also have other obligations'. 
Zheng lihua, deputy head of the municipality of distrikts this description, would not agree 
But made to that in China größenvorgaben advertisements for both sexes are not unusual. 
The same applies to steady gesichtszüge. 
Whether it is in good shape, in China is controversial. 
But people with disabilities or physical plunder do not have to apply. 
"We are, unfortunately, not a lame or buckligen use ', as Mr Zheng. 
"their image would not be good." 
Liu Yi, in the middle of a monastery baoguang-platz patroliert, 22, and probably apfelbäckchen geformten mouths. 
It is not a sexist empfindetes that such great store by your appearance. 
"you, I see this uniform sexy?" asks them with ironischem glance. 
Your colleague with grübchen that 21-jährige Xu Yang, comments, "we have the task, the image of the city to represent." 
You say that you regret the brief attitude is not, as it could have been more ambitious karrierepläne than simply by the alleys scheuchen traders to them on business. 
Every morning deals with the some remarks about twelve straßenhändler trying to foot or bicycle as many rolls and to sell tofugerichte before they fortgejagt. 
'Mr Wang, it would disappear. " 
"We have already said so often," frl. Xu a trader who fled his foot was on a fahrradkarre befestigten nudelküche temporarily in the lurch. 
According to the officials is the activity more monotonous than troublesome. 
"It is almost every day, the same," says Huang Jing, 20 in leisure vertriebswesen studied. 
'Everything routine. " 
One reason for this is that the female officials were not the traders, as their male colleagues, must confiscate. 
You can only threaten offenders, their male superiors. 
This is to protect them from public hostility officials in China, which often are exposed. 
This year, hundreds of people rioted outside, Kunming,, the capital of the province of Yunnan after the rumour chengguan-beamte stock-market boom, have killed a trader. 
More than a dozen policemen and chenguan-beamte have been violated in the nightly incident, 14 regierungsfahrzeuge upset or have been set on fire. 
Xindu remained of such violent incidents have been spared. 
But riots are not carried out. 
Only two blocks away from the calm baonguang-platz the female officials this morning patroulierten, over 50 people on a street corner. 
Officials had a motorcycle confiscated, which is contrary to the rules on the pavement rather than in a workshop has been repaired. 
The owner cried screamed blue murder. 
After 15-minütigem hesitate bahnten the officials with cruel face the way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner. 
Li xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male some remarks, remained. It was his White namensschild, to remain anonymous. 
As your colleagues the coordinators - men over 40 - a supporting role. 
But they have not been trained, a clean image. 
"We are sometimes verbally." 
"but sometimes also physically," says Mr Li well-balanced. 
Most of the time, 'people are with the dispute. "
