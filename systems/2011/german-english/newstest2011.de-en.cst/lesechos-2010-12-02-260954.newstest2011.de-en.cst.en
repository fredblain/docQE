Offenkundigkeit second mandate: 
De Gaulle was really clipped. 
Mitterrand had believed that he stutze. 
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac, not the slightest hesitation. 
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that. 
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next. 
The current head of state is so candidate in 2012. 
But it is the side of offenkundigkeit mysteriums, it cannot have not managed to face. 
We must therefore pretend that the doubts now exist. 
On the one hand, as well as in the other direction. 
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac, a third mandate is not excluded, without even believing. 
On 15 November, assured Nicolas Sarkozy in any serious tone, his decision 'at some point in the autumn of 2011'. 
That on Tuesday evening in the Elysée before ump-parlamentariern the prospect of 'two credentials' full dignity, was therefore a little fieberhaftigkeit. 
This was the official announcement of his candidacy? 
Far from it. 
The President has just to remind you that the Constitution in 2008 the number of five-year terms shall confine myself to just two. 
He has made a statement, no announcement. 
It is not the first time that the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone. 
"You have, at worst, still seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told you in July 2009. 
On a new in May 2010: 'do not think that I am not thinking about the period thereafter. " 
His words from the day before yesterday, not to make it more candidates than the previous day, but also no less. 
They should comment, from a two-fold reason. 
The acceleration of the candidacy wettlaufes with the PS on one side. 
But it is not the incorporation of competition with Ségolène Royal and Nicolas Sarkozy are so desperate to unfold. 
On the contrary, it is an obvious candidacy in 2012, the number of Members of the PS earlier than accepted the challenge admonished. 
The bad surveys on the other side. 
For the first time, the voters of the right to a candidature of François Fillon, of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to a poll bva-l 'express). 
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP," reacted immediately and cautious in the context of the Prime Minister. 
If it is a defeat as possible, it would be not candidate 'shares Jean-Pierre Raffarin. 
"It will always be believed to be able to prevail," Alain Juppé corrected with offenkundigkeit resigned.
