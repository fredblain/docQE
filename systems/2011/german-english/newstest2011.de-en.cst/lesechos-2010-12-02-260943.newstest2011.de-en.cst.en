The FIFA World Cup 2018-2022 appoints in this. 
In a chaotic frenzy because of corruption will appoint the executive committee on Thursday the FIFA World Cup ausrichterländer 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice in the rangeln for influence and the lobbying of the technical criteria to push into the background. 
One thing is certain: the issuing of 2018 the accepted FIFA in Europe, their traditional stronghold, (the four candidates: England, Russia, spanien-portugal, niederlande-belgien). 
The issuing of 2022 will then be somewhat exotic; the international football hopes, the first on the African continent in 2010, new territories (Qatar, Australia) to win, or its establishment in the United States or in the Far East, South Korea (Japan) to pursue. 
The list of figures to the delegation with Mr David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch leader, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) is the level of economic and political commitment of a World Cup. 
The machinations behind the scenes, therefore, face up to the last minute. 
Difficult otherwise, a hierarchy of the candidates. 
After an evaluation report of FIFA, the English, spanisch-portugiesische (2018) and American (2022) acts bessseren arguments than those of their competitors. 
But these considerations for the 22 members of the exekutifkommitees on the hour of the election is not so great. 
The Sunday Times with the achievement of the suspension of two members of the exekutifkommitees (reynald temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations that might as well the chances of their own country, cradle of football, can ruin that only once the World Cup was allowed to thrash out, namely in 1966. 
The BBC was once again on Monday breeding ground by favouring an own colour, the three influential members of the kommitees, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas leoz and Issa hayatou under attack. 
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and the British authorities to embarrass, in the first place, with David Cameron in the last few weeks an intensive lobbying. 
The head of government hopes for a re-run of his predecessor, Tony Blair successful schachzuges, in 2005 for London, the organisation of the Olympic Games in 2012 had achieved. 
Would this intensive use of sufficient to the image of England to revalue kommitee again? 
Nothing is less safe, because the duo spanien-portugal there is no shortage of assets, with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, the Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its fußballkultur. 
However, the economic and financial downsides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions. 
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal the chances of Russia, which, despite its shortcomings in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) to the weighty outsiders, increase. 
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has, however, decided that unumwundenen suggestion on the bezichtigungen the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote by the kommiteemitglieder. 
"You bewirft with dirt, trying to compromise," Putin raged. 
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, the logical favourites. 
First, the headquarters of the economic world power fifa-hauptsponsoren, the country seems a long list of benefits to Japan and South Korea, which is a very good project separately. 
But this new nominations seem premature for two countries, the competitions co-organised in 2002. 
Another threat: the FIFA long-awaited allocation of the World Cup 2026 for China and the Asian chances of 2022 lapses. 
With Australia and Qatar, the stadiums aufwartung futuristischer all, FIFA has pursued its expansion into new areas, but these two countries a greater risk than certainty. 
Australia might as well as Japan and South Korea in the European countries akquittierten weakness of television rights (zeitverschiebung), the sensitive nerve FIFA.
