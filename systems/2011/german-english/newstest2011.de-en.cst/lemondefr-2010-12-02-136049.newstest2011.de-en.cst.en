Affaire Clotilde Reiss: elysée-palast exaggerates its mittlerfunktion for Syria 
In more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, considered the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher in Iran for "spy" was detained, the French public in suspense, left the diplomacy in alert and akzentuierte the deterioration in relations between Paris and Tehran. 
All of this under the attentive gaze of the diplomats of the United States. 
The Wikileaks received and the newspaper Le Monde durchgesehenen American documents some background to this crisis. 
They describe how the Elysée Americans had declared its strategy, so far, this advice to deal with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of wanderern). 
They show how the French authorities have tried to Washington to convince the liberation of young French person, not the release of Majid kakavand, one in France and imprisoned by the American justice because of trade in material for the benefit of the Iranian nuklearprogrammes fugitive iraners to gegeleistung. 
After all, the way in which the French Presidency the media to the purposes to manipulate this credible to the idea that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad have a central role to play in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss played, a harsh light. 
In fact, he had nothing in this respect. 
A on 12 August 2009 in Paris redigiertes diplomatentelegramm entitled "Iran: French comments about the way of dealing with hostage-taking." 
François richier, elysée-berater -- to be accompanied by Patrice paoli, Director of the Quai d 'orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen allegrone. 
You said the French method. 
The advised the Americans to do everything to ensure that their own nationals rückzuführen, the violently held in Iran. 
"power noise ', they said,' articulated, loud and clear, without letting up 'the words' grundmenschenrechte ',' innocence ',' immediate release 'in the media. 
This is necessary in order to the Iranian regime to embarrass the very sensitive to its image. 
," the more so since you ask the Iranians to do." 
Because 'silence solves nothing', passed on to the diskussionsversuche unauffälligem ways, the Iranians are "masters in ausweichmanövern '. 
Mr richier adds that the detention of foreigners, Iranian tactic of a "normal": "hostage-taking for political blackmail." 
It announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which should be reached on 16 August, on the day that they are in the French embassy vanishes) 'demand the payment of a large amount of the Iranians' (230,000 Euro bail). 
And it is known that the Elysée antizipiere further hijackings, a phenomenon that 'will exacerbate. " 
The Iranians could "in the near future, another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens, living in Iran," he said. 
28 August 2009. 
Clotilde Reiss is twelve days been released from jail, will, however, continue to Iran. 
The information was circulated: the Iranians Majid kakavand to extradite the United States due to illegal trade in empfindlichem elektronikmaterial in Iran, is following the decision of a judge in Paris has been released from detention. 
The American Embassy is, like many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence. 
In Washington, the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material for the nuclear programme, is the release of Majid khakavand a bad news. 
France has a horse-trading in? 
The liberation of iraners against the Frenchwoman? 
On the occasion of a further meeting with Kathleen allegrone on 4 September, François richier assured that this was not the case. 
The Elysée, he says, was not just 'completely surprised by the decision of the judge, "but have also tried, against the authorities. 
"It is a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice ' (currently given Michèle Alliot-Marie), but the French Government can the judicial decision does not change," he says. 
Mr richier would also like to point out that Majid kakavand under 'strict' supervision of the French secret service. 
The elysée-berater opts for a telephone number, once again, then, the American diplomat, the Iranians' is currently in the chair of the Iranian Embassy buildings in Paris. " 
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée spare its efforts, not through pronouncements and the Media organized "fluchtversuche 'belief that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad games' important 'and' influential role as mediator." 
The Americans are not without irony of this activity and the manipulation to bear fruit, because several articles of the official French version. 
One of 25 August 2009 datierendes telegram presents "medienblitz the French authorities'. 
What is so much "dankesbezeugung to Mr Assad, the Paris message. 
"despite the statements of the French authorities lobpreis secretly that it is only a vague idea of what the syrier indeed have done." 
The document also deals with the reasons that have led the Elysée this fiction to lapse. 
The intensive communication 'aims, Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria to confirm, "he analysed. 
A policy of 2008, launched at the time by many kritikerstimmen in France and in the outside world as premature and unverdient was perceived. " 
"The Syrian role aufbauschend 'attempts to Paris" Syria, what we can achieve belobigung by a constructive role in the region. " 
The aim is also to 'discord between Syria and Iran is sowing. " 
The American Embassy knows this from good source. 
On 11 August, François richier to her, "of course we do not know whether the syrier whatever '. 
"But we have, in spite of everything, we thank you. ' 
"this should at least try to confusion on the part of the Iranians'. 
Clotilde Reiss, on 16 May 2010 in France. 
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Elysée. 
In a communiqué would like to thank the President of Brazil, of Senegal and Syria for its active role in favour of the release of our compatriot. "
