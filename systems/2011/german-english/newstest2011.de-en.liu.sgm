<seg id="1"> What should they do CSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague-found neither breve Voldemort, or the "Konditorei." </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new Council lords of capital from the ranks of the CSSD will obviously certain language barriers to overcome their old neuen colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and in the city of representation at all to understand. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The newspaper Aktuálne.cz, members of the new Council from the CSSD cats--or a little "hold," as they dominate the notorious slang, which in recent years has naturalisations, in which the current coalition partners were in Prague at the helm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The encoded vocabulary, which elapsed in the era of Mayor Pavel Bém of Prague's political elite was introduced, fact is some of the best-known actors, situations and Causae. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils fall in relation to this new concepts of something in the dark. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At least they say it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Who is Voldemort?" </seg>
<seg id="8"> "No idea." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am rather a newcomer in the Prague policy," responded Lukás Kaucký, the new Council Mr for culture, on the test of the "patent vocabulary." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But also the Council Mr Brezina -- a political veteran - reacted in a similar way. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example, to the term "Golfloch." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "This is the only expression of those that you give me, which I occasionally use." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "I think otherwise not many of slang." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> From the vocabulary, which the next leaf Aktuálne.cz in this year's June before the election Congress of the ODS, anyone had published the editorial six terms, especially those that are notoriously associated with the Prague magistrate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Social Democrats should the terms' Voldemort, "" biggest Prague Gulf hole " in the Champansky Konditorei, "" Stiernacken, "" betrayal of the capital, "and" verblechen "define. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Three Prague Council lords agreed with the test, the fourth --- Mr Weinert, the future leader of the Prague school system -- first promised his participation in the conversation, then, but not even the sound system. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The fifth Council Mr, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "These things are, and I do not care how the Civic Democrats subsidies--the, I do not judge." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "For me is important, as we understand our programmes," he retaliated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> As has been suggested, would have Lukás Kaucký in the above headline supposedly not recognised that the influential businessman and friend of the ex Oberbürgermeister Bém, Roman Janousek the speech. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The term " Kaucky Voldemort says nothing at all, and the only concept, which he was correct on the Test erriet "the biggest Prague golf hole." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "This is the tunnel," says Blanka Kaucký, added to safety but added: "But I know that more out of the newspaper." </seg>
<seg id="23"> And jokingly: "I will be a language course show us'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> "The Gulf hole" will not only matador Karel Brezina, but also by the Council of owner for the Environment Lukás Plachý right as a tunnel Blanka entziffert. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Both Social Democrats also know, however, for whom the word Voldemort and Lukás Plachý even knows where this figure is to find and also what it means, "in the Konditorei to go." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "I believe, that is, in any Prague catering company to go," is pretty close Plachý to the solution to the problem, if you know that it is the seat of Janouseks firms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> However, in line with Brezina, he claimed, however, this knowledge from the newspaper to cooperate rather than that he would this vocabulary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The test, judging by the participants, there seems to be under the Social Democrats actually no similar naturalisations slang. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I have asked my colleagues, but there is obviously something we really not." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "We call upon us by name, and then we also use acronyms or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague CSSD Petr Hulínský - from his party Hulda " loosely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "In the school was I Bríza (Birke), but I do not know whether to call my fellow-Members," he tells us, Karel Brezina nicknamed. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The newspaper Deník Aktuálne.cz has tried to work and behold - it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Mr Weinert Council is for the party of the kind of one's grandfather " or less friendly "old," the representative Miroslav Poche, which before the elections by machinations of the party's sponsorship made by some colleagues' Igrácek " (known Czech Lego figure). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Nicknames are so the only thing that allow the Social Democrats in the Home parteilichen language. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> It may not pseudo-trendy Hulínský if it, Hulda 'names, but Deník Aktuálne.cz registered another moniker of the Prague chairman. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> His nickname "doctor of Gummiknüppel rights' pseudo-trendy has to do with the fact that Petr has acquired its title Hulínský iuris doctor to the Bratislaver police academy. </seg>

<seg id="4"> Of the local residents got the house with his organic forms nicknamed "bone home." </seg>

<seg id="6"> The facade of the House is playing with dream-like lines, zärtlich paints and Textur in nature and living creatures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> First on closer inspection noted that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In the night, the whole façade even closer, more dramatic and the specific Anleuchtung reinforces the glamour of colours. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The same faster valuable lines and tortuous forms also dominate the interior of the house. </seg>
<seg id="10"> A wave shaped wood copied the window frames, Geländer, Zierelement of doors, even Guckloch and own trade. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="11"> The House in the quarter Eixample Batlló on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No 43 was said by the reconstruction of a house from the year 1877, the architects Emilio Sala Cortese. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reconstruction took over two years and was detailed. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The investor, the wealthy industrialists Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but in the end, he voted the idea Gaudís in an unusual and cheaper rebuilding. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The Miet House Casa Batlló Antoni Gaudí noted, however, is not alone. </seg>
<seg id="15"> He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol together. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At the drawing board, the mere decoration for the representative of the housing Realitäten owner and the use of mosaic of the façade was his idea. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In the design of the facade, however, also worked many other Bildner and artists. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The joint work on the drafts of the Casa Batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá Güell in the park, which is also other works by Antoni Gaudí. </seg>

<seg id="21"> Others called it the specific Fensteröffnungsmechanismus because of the "yawning home." </seg>
<seg id="22"> It also says that the top of the building is portrayed the sword of the Holy Georg, the patron of Catalonia. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But also further bildhauerische elements symbolize hidden religious motives. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="24"> Gaudí noted for the House for the time unique central heating system with ventilation channels and typical chimneys. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Rather bizarre is putting its 45 degrees of bias. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> In his creation Gaudí consistently ignored all then building regulations and could not be discouraged by this. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before the start of construction, although he lifted from the city of the corresponding construction permit a but the claims made by him on the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers two years later in the completion so horrified by the result was that they demanded redress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The Council lords, among other things, also found that the construction recently with its pillars, even in the public Bürgersteig. </seg>
<seg id="29"> To change, however, there was no longer, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the neighbourhood, Josep Batlló a request for approval of the rental of two highly devolved floors of the House -- and it was granted him promptly. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="30"> The House owner even drew in the lower reaches. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In the gallery in the second floor was a Gesellschaftssalon, on the third floor were sleeping rooms and Privatraum of housing. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The ground-floor level was leased to a Juwelier business. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The whole sechsstöckig building is going through a set of stairs, right up to the roof Terrasse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> By the fundamental elements of the reconstruction were all right corner and just lines removed and replaced by gebogen and waved walls. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Gaudí but also worked with a modern approach to the mutual combination of spaces. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The social part is explained by the opening of the Salon doors completely and connect as a larger society convenient plaudern without compromising vertraulicheren talks on a certain intimacy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The House received by Gaudís restructuring out of a new facade also an unusual roof and two other floors. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Impressively is also Gaudís game with the light, as well as the blue and white glasiert Kachel with which the courtyard is in disguise and the courts of light. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The game of these two colours gives all floors of the House, a high degree of light. </seg>
<seg id="40"> He made it plain to the principle that White the light reflected better than dark colours, which the sunlight to absorb the opposite. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> The House Casa Batlló that 2005 in the list of UNESCO world heritage site has been included, can visit today everyone. </seg>

<seg id="7"> In a weekend house in which not regularly heated, are not Latexmatratzen good, because they need much longer, "hot". </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition, they are much more difficult than usual Polyurethan-Matratzen. </seg>

<seg id="12"> Anyone who has been a long time abroad, where very high mattress with soft layer, will be hard to get used to a low mattress with hard surface. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="13"> "Good all ice hockey players from the NHL returned, have complained to me that they are no longer able to sleep right." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "For their abgeschundenen shoulders, closely and hip they need simply a soft layer of foam Visco (memory Foam -- a Formgedächtnis Polymer)." </seg>

<seg id="27"> In Einzelbett, for example, in single, are appropriate 120 to 140 cm. </seg>

Helena, the champion of the guild Prokopová Polsterer and Raumausstatter, which for many years the issue of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture presents and devoted to this issue at colleges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> In a double bed needs all its own rusteth and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattress are too high. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise, there is nothing other than the rusteth in different tune assembling and that is not in any Bettrahmen possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Foam Matratzen should at least 14 cm high, mattress with 15 cm skeleton pens, that should account for at least three centimeters in the form of class, and the fine cushion. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "With the hand or sit down with it, the feathers in no case sense," warns Helen Prokopová. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Each mattress makes a specific Rosttyp required. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document as Saeed Siyam zusammengewachst Zwillinge are in the bedroom nothing. </seg>
<seg id="36"> This mattress cannot be met and the reference can wash it is not what we already commonplace. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And since we are in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years of slow to a huge (and clogged sieve). </seg>
<seg id="38"> That is also why reject experts believe sales patter, which in mattress promise a life of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Every cause has its ifs and buts. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And that is why a practical advice from the dealers: In mattress of 120 or 140 cm band should be on the health of the salary abziehbaren waschbar, not shy, however, it is recommended, to use a Matratzenschoner that can deduct leave and wash </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even if today in the rule with'aide Rundumreissverschluss Matratzen salaries, so that one after the opening two halves gets (immensely important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger-mesh mattress, above all, alone, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="42"> They have in bed instead of a firm Rostes plate? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Out of it. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or a maximum for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> So, too, should they prefer the plate with ventilation holes tag (if any) are already in use and mattress with pen skeleton and 15 cm minimum level with the Taschenfederkern and Feinpolster. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethan-Matratzen belong on such a basis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For not verstellbar Lattenrost with 14 to 18 Federleisten (Lamelle) are Latex or Sandwichmatratzen appropriate (possibly also combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay it rusteth with a greater number of bar, from 28 and more pen Leisten, with hurricane Lenden Lordosenstütze in the area and the ability to regulate the Lattenhärte. </seg>
<seg id="48"> On verstellbar Lamellenroste does not include mattress with pen skeleton, because they do not respond to the ergonomische Verstellung. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> In addition to the attitude of the Steife Federleisten will also be specific flexible back Module. </seg>
<seg id="50"> This is a special fortifications of Federleisten, which enables the Federleisten einzudrücken or even to verwinkeln that they will enable the conjunctural Einsinken of the back of the Schläfer. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Role-call for men with broad shoulders an important thing. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There are even Matratzen manufacturers, which have started to use in "soft" Herrenmatratzen zones for the shoulder area. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Also in the ladies is thought - it takes them this soft Hüft zones in the area. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For most demanding customers are certain punktelastische Flügelfedersysteme (Lattoflex) or rusteth with punktelastischen Kontakt-Pads with the Multitorsionsfederung. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure is reduced at several points, making the tension. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But, given the right mattress and right rusteth a bad (too large and fülliges) Kopfkissen used, the majority of benefits lost again. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Here, too, a rule of thumb: The Kopfkissen Delinking the head, its leaders should only up to the shoulders range in order to ease the back Muskeln. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Ideal may seem a 50 x 60 cm big bed, as it is, for example, the Scandinavians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In the situation should back the Kopfkissen (along with the shoulder discharge zone in the rusteth or the soft zone in the mattress) the shoulder level. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Some have our modern mattress, with the former (filled with hay) Strohsack but in common. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials, or at least their mixtures. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Also in mattress means the new magic word "organic". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of oil raw materials to be used in the production of Polyurethanschäumen increasingly temperament oils -- for example Rizinus and soya oil. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soya- used well known by all manufacturers. </seg>

<seg id="65"> "Organic mattress, which is to say their nuclear materials from pure natural origin is," says Petr Vasícek by the firm Tropico Plus. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Natural materials, but also in the manufacture of Matratzen rates used -- one of the first was Aloe Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> But one can also be micro-supervisory Kapseln needed to spread the sleeping fresh forest or Lavendelduft. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Here, too, it makes a difference between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While the men a "postwar air" plant extracts from Birkenblättern used, so that the Matratzen regard the heat and absorb the body can cool, the salary for women " wärmend effect. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Extracts from Red impatient Paprikaschote blood circulation, the weaker sex is so sleeping malheur wohlig warm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> And today's favorites? </seg>
<seg id="72"> Mattress from Kaltschaum (he has greater pore with devastated cell structure and is therefore breathing radioactive than trade Polyurethan and many more flexible). </seg>

<seg id="76"> As the first Czech company was Gumotex this advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> You see on the mattress and to save on rusteth is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="78"> And then there are special offers of manufacturers and dealers offering two for the price of a mattress. </seg>

<seg id="4"> It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have ausgesorgt for 225 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The only problem is the preservability of powder - two, but no more than four years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The army bought the powder from the Company STV Group, including miserable affair for 40 million kroner. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In his justification for the purchase of this huge amount of the General Staff Mapsuta find string MF Dnes, the soldiers would annually to the 60 kilometres use powder. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantitative rebate for the 445 kilometres powder. </seg>

<seg id="15"> Apparently against a fat compensation. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It would also be an adequate explanation of why he was in his arrest such a large amount of money on themselves. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="17"> Lubos G. was already in the past too good contacts on the ground Pilsner Fund. </seg>
<seg id="18"> So he played in the issue of the former head of the soil fund Václav Sankota a role that prosecuted because he finalised in Ersatzrestitutionen land, which had already been passed location decisions on construction projects. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> There is enormous pressure on Buffett. </seg>
<seg id="3"> 16 students are salmon rolls, tomato soup and trick. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The technical Braunschweig University and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have invited the Maschinenbau and design students at a workshop. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In a kind of competition of ideas should they, together with VW-Entwicklern on the car of the future learn jargon -- and incidentally Volkswagen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In the contest for the brightest minds have now gone many businesses in the urban fight and, as VW, in cooperation with the universities. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Your mission: The smartest graduates as early as possible in the hearing rooms to recruit, before they enter the job market and will be pulled by others. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And because the university no data on the performance of their students, will issue is the exception Talente in practice projects to spot and to tie itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> On the second day of the workshop in the Tu Braunschweig, the car company in the talent. </seg>
<seg id="10"> A young lady from the personnel department distributed ball-point pen wine gum and file with VW logo. </seg>
<seg id="11"> They told the hopeful of Jungtalenten Praktikumsprogrammen and student jobs and show them into the company. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Nico Selle of the Tu Braunschweig cared for the project with VW. </seg>
<seg id="13"> He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students come into contact with the industry and experience." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "VW can learn students at the same time, interesting candidates to go and consider as a staff member who came into question." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Such cooperation, Selle, are not unusual. </seg>
<seg id="16"> New is that will be so offensive to the gebuhlt students. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Otherwise, the focus on the technical project," says Selle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The battle for the fresh graduates will be well even harder. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In many industries, the companies of their employees no longer from a large crowd of applicants. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But they must HSA-tied balzen and particularly for highly skilled workers. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Above all graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position. </seg>
<seg id="22"> According to the Federation of German VDI engineers remained in October about 40,000 engineer vacant posts. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And the so-called engineer gap will be loud VDI-Prognosen even greater. </seg>

<seg id="31"> "We want to work with the Race to withdraw from the mass." </seg>
<seg id="32"> "Just a simple Segeltörn was not enough for us." </seg>
<seg id="33"> For talent hunters Dykta seems to be working the bill. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "We have until now with all the participants of a similar action last year contact." </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Some are nearing completion and will soon apply to us," he says. </seg>

<seg id="42"> "It is very difficult to fill vacant positions." </seg>
<seg id="43"> "It costs a lot of time and money," she says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Another way is the contact on the Uni-Professor. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Solarworld is cooperating with various universities, such as the University in Freiberg. </seg>
<seg id="46"> "The professors give evidence that this internships or make his thesis can write." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> Money plays in the job search long is no longer the main role. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The country stayeth but, to take a position -- nor can it controls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At about midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli B1s I fighter-planes a mysterious, würfelförmiges building in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is on the bank of the Euphrates; the next major city 30 miles away, is as Dair Saur. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Your name is in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, which is supposed to Syria with help from North Korea in the Quader has built, hidden in a valley, which is being deprived of the electricity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing of the US Auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA by the end of April 2008 would be the under the name of the near town el Kibar familiar reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium -- which could build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes against the technology from the fifties. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA had a video presentation before with vague satellite imagery. </seg>
<seg id="10"> They ignored by Computeranimation, where the components of the reactor before the destruction, which should have been a pared-down copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In addition, it presented photographs which show in the vicinity of the building, or even the interior space. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor was just before the operation, it would have been entered, but not yet with fuel rods. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more than it was then known, and indeed the mysteries were with the rather more time. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The former US President George W. Bush has recently in his memoirs revealed that the CIA before the attack is fairly certain that Syria in el Kibar a reactor built, but little evidence that it was in the country, "an active nuclear weapons program." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some intelligence officers in Europe, there are still rather cautious and speak of a "alleged reactor," even if the CIA presentation for "plausible". </seg>
<seg id="16"> They lack of hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Asked how sure he was a reactor ahead, a high Mapsuta UN diplomat in the summer of only briefly, the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The rubble of the alleged "unused military building" created the Syrians may be in a hurry to one side and the terrain planieren thoroughly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But they held in June 2008, a IAEA team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el Kibar traces of uranium, which was made by people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, the IAEA on a Member State commercial satellite imagery provider in the immediate aftermath of the attack, which could be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, those recordings on the market, because the unknown client has bought -- perhaps Israel -- they exclusive. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The IAEA can verify their authenticity not independent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always claimed that never a secret nuclear program operated or to have a reactor being built. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium hails from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But that indicated the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then refuses to Damascus to discuss the issue -- as well as on the satellite imagery. </seg>
<seg id="27"> It also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el Kibar and access to the ruins of the only building. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But also Israel zeren silent. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We will never comment on that," recently confirmed at the time of the attack President-in-Office of the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> So dragging the investigation of the case since June 2008 inconclusive and "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority," as a senior Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna denies -- after all, it is a serious breach of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area, about watching the IAEA. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA apparently three other institutions that "in functional link" with the alleged reactor should be -- still exist and differently than this. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The inspectors have so far not disclosed what facilities are, or what role they have, or what they suspect. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they will be in the IAEA internal than Marj as Sultan, and in turn Masyaf Iskandariayah, derived from nearby towns. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS advises) has identified these places and satellite imagery on a building complex in Masyaf tracked down, in which it is one of the most likely suspect objects. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It is probably in or directly next to a military base -- precisely with this argument, the IAEA Syria denied access to the three places. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In Vienna, it says the Syrians feared a rather than fishing expedition -- that the IAEA from the United States will vorgeschickt auszuspähen military installations. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Because the Nukleardetektive had become a bet on the institutions of the US intelligence services. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos that between the three places and the Quader on the Euphrates material was transported to and fro. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A senior Western diplomat in Vienna, said that at least one of the plants could "in connection with the fuel production". </seg>
<seg id="40"> But there is "no evidence of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are on the construction of nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The type of reactor will be operated with uranium, which is not enriched. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But where the uranium would have to come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated, on this key questions, there are only plausible assumptions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> It is unclear whether rubble, which valuable traces could cause, were stored in three places. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As if the hundreds of lorry cargoes of the earth is gone, nobody wants to have information on where the rubble. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The only a few kilometers from el Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates situated Salzmine al Tibni that Syria in 1998 on their suitability as a camp for radioactive waste has investigated, the IAEA as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The former IAEA-Inspektor Robert Kelley put it in a recent analysis of satellite imagery for the prestigious journal Jane's Intelligence Review associated with the reactor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Recordings from the orbit but show that Syria to the three suspected places global work and large containers removed after the IAEA has asked for access. </seg>
<seg id="48"> That may be accidental, but hardly helped to dispel the suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> It also states in diplomatic circles, the IAEA have spent many months, a plan for inspections to develop Syria would allow any military secrets -- to maintain the burden alone shows how large the interest of the inspectors. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Meanwhile, Damascus also iron this proposal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Western diplomats in Vienna had a year ago, placating the reactor was destroyed, therefore, the cause any high urgency, brings some US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a couple of months så Sonder-Inspektionen into the game, one of the strongest productsfalling the Vienna nuclear authority to impose controls. </seg>
<seg id="52"> IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, which would propose these inspections, has already been of "an option, for which I am open in the future," said, but he hesitates. </seg>
<seg id="53"> There is a high risk in this way: It needs for a majority of the board of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented there are anything other than keen on an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other hand, as a diplomat to bear in mind: "What if they find nothing in the end?" </seg>

<seg id="1"> The routine demokatrische </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The democracy movement in Latin America is growing, as the support of private companies. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Crime is a bigger problem than the unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil's larger than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="5"> These results came the Latinobarómetro poll, which was conducted in 18 countries and exclusive published in The Economist. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This survey is being carried out regularly since 1995 and shows the opinions in this region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two facts in this year's survey, especially in September and October's eye. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First, the good mood in Latin America </seg>
<seg id="9"> And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In many countries in the South American Pacific coast has greatly increased the democratic movement (affair table 1). </seg>
<seg id="11"> In Peru, for example, where the economy since 2002, is growing at an annual rate of around 6%, the number of democracy advocates of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In Mexico, where the economy since the sharp fall in the past year recovers, is to see such a trend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (affair graph 2). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Around 44% of respondents said that with the democratic practice their country to be satisfied. These are much like last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3). </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values are those of the last year, but show a sharp increase from 2003 (17% and 24%). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined the efforts for more democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> That this during the Great Depression lasted, is probably due to the fact that the Latin American countries experienced only a brief recession have recovered and fast. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, the poor absorbed by a stronger social network. </seg>
<seg id="19">  (According to reports by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America from this week in 2009, the poverty rate rose only slightly in Latin America and is again this year by 32%.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But from country to country, there are strong mood differences (affair graph 4). </seg>
<seg id="21"> Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread progress thinking. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In Mexico and Central America, where the recession mount, and violent crimes have increased, it is less the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Only the second time since the beginning of poll see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country a bigger problem than in the graph affair unemployment (5). </seg>
<seg id="24"> Some 31% say that they either themselves or a family member in the last year has been the victim of a crime, but to 38% last year, the values have fallen and reached its lowest level since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The rising economic performance is reflected in the greater support for private and the market economy: Approximately 71% of respondents supraregional said that the private sector for the development is essential, in 2007, it was 56% (graph affair 6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> Approximately 58% said that only the market economy in the country can bring progress, compared with 47% last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela maintain this view (and 80% are for a private sector), even though their nationalized left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, many private companies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil has according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared with 11% last year). </seg>
<seg id="29"> The respondents in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, can see in the US, the most influential country, with this role in the Dominican Republic of Venezuela and Nicaragua accepted. </seg>

<seg id="2"> In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband told Argentina's President Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy that their Beliebtheitsrate by 20 points over 50%. This is the highest level since its election in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Whether their next year, but this is a re-election, depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández further compromises than their deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The signs are not clear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Néstor Kirchner, even after the election of his wife drove the economic policy, often budgets, which took into account the tax revenues, the economic growth and inflation is not fully. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This allowed it to spend the presidential couple, the extra revenues on his own. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On paper, lost the Fernández government last year, the majority in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further divisions. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten, behind Cristina Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But after chaotic part-sessions (in which a inter-Parliamentary another face, and other government accused of bribery) failed to pass the Congress, the budget for 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I am not to debate," according to the President. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The 2010 budget applies now for the next year, allowing the President has even greater opportunity to spend money on his own. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy is hot: It is likely to grow this year by up to 9%. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official inflation z.Z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - are pushing the value of almost 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina has been beset by economic crises, said growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not the reduction of inflation. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed him the private sector and purging the National Institute for statistics and census schönte Indec, which followed the official inflation statistics. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Can Fernández now moderating a path? </seg>
<seg id="18"> It has called on the private economy and the trade union leaders for talks. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And, according to official statements are to be limited wage increases in the next year to 18%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the inflation undermined the growth spurt by a large devaluation in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Perhaps would like to add Cristina Fernández for this reason Argentina financial-political economic back to the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Earlier this year, the government has an agreement with shareholders holding the previous restructuring had rejected the country in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Fernández now appears on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to push it owes about $6.7 billion. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Kirchners always had rejected a review by the IMF, as usual, elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But in the last month, the economy Minister Amado Boudou known that the fund in creating a new national consumer price index "technical support". It looks as if this is the first step for the depollution of the INDEC. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not known whether Fernández will be after the end of their term even without the support of her husband politically active. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If so, it needs to get the support of the middle class, most of which has enough of Kirchnerism. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the Argentines in March from their summer holidays, will return to the wave of Sympatie, which has been shown to be largely fizzled. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If they want to win another election, it must decide whether they lift many political decisions her husband quietly. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> What does Taiwan of its big brother beyond the Meerenge? </seg>
<seg id="4"> On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of eligible voters, in order to five counties in the city mayors and city councils to choose. This is seen as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou. </seg>
<seg id="5"> By building a groundbreaking business relations, einschl. of a free trade agreement, Ma is even a figurehead for relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Ma has the test, but just barely. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) three of the five mayors, they received a majority of votes. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is a greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the vote, the KMT received 45%. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In a presidential election would have meant that for Ma problems. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Since his election two years ago, markedet is the voice of his party by around 8%. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For the first time, the DPP even together with the KMT in the city councils. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as convoys of lorries with Wall, wearing a flag schwenkende mass Umzüge and rarely held dancers. </seg>
<seg id="13"> There were even the compulsory, mysterious assassination attempt. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Sean LIEN, the son of LIEN Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT held on the eve of the election of a speech to a KMT candidate. </seg>
<seg id="15"> As a man in the crowd shot in the face. LIEN was killed and wounded a umstehend spectator. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Bizarrer marker is not clear whether the shooter Lien wanted to kill or resolve a dispute with the candidate. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Regardless of the attack, according to the credit rating Tsai Wen, the leader of the DPP, the election and affected the DPP in a bad light that the KMT has brought more votes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> China was perhaps the biggest winner of the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It was not addressed relations with the mainland. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Instead, the candidates on plans to social housing and job creation. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat. </seg>
<seg id="22"> For this reason, the KMT its relations with the government in Beijing does not like to the fore. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But this time also avoided the DPP, which anti-Chinese feelings of stoking too much. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China. </seg>

<seg id="28"> Certainly it wants a political integration. But the most important thing first. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It would prefer to wait until after the 2012 presidential election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The DPP has now invented new. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Two years ago, she was greatly weakened: The former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat in jail for corruption. </seg>
<seg id="32"> During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was strongly for the absolute independence. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But under reign Tais became a new generation of moderate politicians and the DPP is fighting the votes of the worker and youth. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Your party is doing all now to show that they, too, is in a position to build close relations with Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Tsai is planning a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China. This, however, requires open-minded discussion. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Tsai stated publicly that their party is a "credible alternative" to offer Mas rash rapprochement with China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Chen appears on this change very frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="39"> From his prison, he said, the candidates of the DPP would have done better to Taiwan's independence. </seg>
<seg id="40"> He called for not abandoning the pragmatist Su, even on the presidential candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even without Chen's interference is to choose the DPP major-accident, its possible candidate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The KMT will own selfanalysis must undergo. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Ma's values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT-Kandidaten wanted to lead their campaign without him. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="45"> According to a statement of KMT will occupy he transform his cabinet, as well as the local institutions. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Although scientists this unusual bacterium discovered here on earth, it is their view, a sign that a life is also without the hitherto regarded as vital elements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "This body has two options." </seg>
<seg id="5"> "He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "That makes it quite exquisite, although it almost a sort of 'alien' way of life," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and CO2 author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online issue of the journal Science. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> So far, there have been six main elements - regarded as vital carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> But, as the scientists turned out, the bacterium grows in California mono Lake still further, if it replaced phosphorus by arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "One wonders what else is possible," said the CO2 author of the report Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is an important step in the search for by extra-terrestrial life, as scientists and his life forms must recognise, Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study deals with Roben you that have been found on Earth. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The announcement of a press conference in which no details on the discovery, has led to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could act of the discovery by extra-terrestrial life. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "shows that in other organisms Planeten systems with the help of the other elements of biochemical processes can set in motion and that the " Standardelemente, which we believe are absolutely vital, not necessarily firmly stated," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockel was not part of the Forschungsteam. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "This work is a novelty, because it shows that in fundamental biochemical processes and structures an element can be replaced by a different," added Cockell added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> This discovery was not accidental. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Felisa Astrobiologischen Wolfe Simon from the Institute of NASA, which the study Gataev, chose the mono Lake because of the high arsenic content. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> As arsenic and phosphorus chemical balance, they took that microbes, both of which are exposed to replace possibly an element of the other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "The toxicity of the Arsens is based largely on the fact that it is chemically similar behave like phosphorus." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "By the organisms, it is difficult to distinguish an element from the other." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It ends up in our life chemisches system, where almost all verschmiert," declared Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers suspended the bacterium GFAJ of a rising arsenic concentration. It is adjusted and grew. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The microbe grows in phosphorus better, but also that they can survive in arsenic, shows that a arsenic life form of knowledge can happen, of course, is either on the earth or on a different planet or on the moon, arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> According to Jamie S. Foster, Dozentin for microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new, but so far there has been no functioning example. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Arsenic came in the early years of the earth more frequently, it says, that is why the science assumed that early life forms have used it. </seg>
</p>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect Videokonsole. Both games can open a huge hole in your gift budget. </seg>
<seg id="3"> An iPad costs as much as five BMX-Rad for $99, while the price for a game Kinect about 10 classical Springseilen or around 48 cans are play. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> But you can protect your gift budget. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Recently I visited on the search for three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, Toys' R US and BJ's Wholesale Club. </seg>
<seg id="6"> I was immediately clear that Moore's law came into force. This year, the technology toys cost efficient and at the same time, a little less than last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> And although less new toys with its own website, will take place on the best-known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, a wider offer. </seg>
<seg id="8"> There will always be more Knopfzellen powered toys on the market, and many of them contain wiederaufladbare Akkus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Here are a few recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="10">  (If not otherwise indicated, are all prices of Toys' R US.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Sing a-ma jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are Plüschfigur, as large as guinea pig, who sing a note, if one puts pressure on her stomach. </seg>

<seg id="13"> Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Respect: If you with the pressure even started, you can no longer stop. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> For a combination of Gesand and dance is the Dance star Mickey (Fisher Price $60 for children aged 2) the best choice. </seg>
<seg id="16"> On the basis of the last year Elmo Live technology offers the doll animatronische Wechselspiele as Simon says' 'and, thanks to the novel Scharnierfüsse with wheel blocking they dominated the Moon Walk. </seg>

<seg id="19"> Now he is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for children from 3), with a whole bunch Fragekarten, with a car journey to a teaching moment, with a Besserwisser with Autokorrektur function as a teacher. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> If your child does not like to entrust your Smartphone, here are three independent alternatives. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Mobi Go of VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and user friendly solution, equipped with a QWERTY keyboard. To contain the Games, however, are not as instructive as those on the Explorer eliminated Leapster ($70, for children from 3 to 12), the first major overhaul of the everyone-minus-one Leapfrogs Leapster number with a new, brighter screen is equipped. </seg>
<seg id="22"> None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> IXL of Fisher Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) used for the Games and eBooks a system similar iTunes and, thanks to the SD Kartenlaufwerks can also be seen to it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Finally, there are still high Scrabble ($30 by Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no bigger than a Streichholzschachtel and have their own led screen. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In the game, the blocks to words together, before the time is running out. It is great for an improvised book Staff beer competition. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Half a dozen of them put my money in the riots in the courtroom. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In every minute they issued on Twitter their reports on gruesome testimonies. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the end, the defence, there were more than 140,000 Twitter-Meldungen on the process for rape and beds gekettete children in a house that go up in smoke. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Thursday, the process closely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was indicted, three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, killed on an official end if the ruling on the death sentence, which gave the jury. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted applications to court, the grounds for an appeal and explain that the courts will look for years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> One of the provozierendsten reasons is that it through the intensive coverage of the process, even by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - to a "circus atmosphere" and so widespread, immediately penetration inflammatory details, so that the jury had been influenced in an improper manner by the public outrage. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This appeal the lat Appe Ion courts could lead to the question of whether the new technologies to make new rules in the courtroom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "As I have seen during this process, I believe that there is a real danger if the arrival of the new technologies in the courtroom every individual's right to a fair trial influence," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes Hauptverteidiger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue from the Supreme Chamber Court last week, rejected the applications via a referendum succinctly when he said that the new media "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But it was certainly not the last word on the matter. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For decades court Einsprüche noted that the rapporteurship injured on famous cases doubts about the fairness of the process. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States, the ruling against Dr Sam Sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, which have killed his wife, lifted and said in his decision that, because of the new media a "Karneval atmosphere in the courtroom". </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some people believe that based on the television series and the movie "The flight" on this crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some lawyers say court Einsprüche that Mr. Hayes veroordeling half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to channels of communication from the courtroom, which at the time of the case of Dr Sheppard were inconceivable to regulate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "There is a good reason, about the impact of the new media in trials of a broad public, to be concerned," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, the death penalty in Connecticut has investigated. His report that they arbitrarily imposed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor Donohue said that some of the lat Appe Ion courts could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction for immediate communications from the courtroom case--had may make the process fairer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Twitter matter is just one of many of the lawyers of Mr. Hayes in order to discuss for years, and thus to delay a conviction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defenders claim, for instance, that Mr. Hayes has already been these could be, as a judge Blue had not to allow them to test the reactions of potential judges, by showing them during the horrors of the ground Jurorenauswahl Athamna photos. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some of the judges said photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke Petit, 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17 years ago and Michaela, 11 years, they have met with disgust. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defenders say they are also the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution into question, and argue that the judge mistakenly a jury have exchanged a critic of the state prosecutor's office, and that he had been undue pressure on the ruling would have exercised when he had made the unusual decision to call the jury over the weekend. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The judges were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But their arguments about the influence of the detailed reporting on the process is perhaps the greatest interest. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In a judgment challenge, which they have submitted last month, it found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the US Senate of the candidates was discussed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They argued that the new media would have sparked continuing the flames of emotions on the case. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "Such a daily surge of Medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," wrote the lawyers, "has been in New Haven, and perhaps even nationwide is not yet known." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Your focus on the rapporteurship through Twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Some journalists said in interviews that the claim that this direct news reports, which are rabble-rousing but effective than slower are reimbursed, regards a look that is under the rapporteurship verarme on future processes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> But some lawyers said lat Appe Ion courts would often with the argument, social and technological changes lagging Adaptation through the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr. Hayers lawyers reinforce this claim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In her appeal they were based on the decision by the Supreme Court in 1966, in which the condemnation of Dr Sheppard because of the rapporteurship was lifted and made it clear that the new media require new rules. </seg>
<seg id="32"> "This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> After a campaign of negativity Schimpfwort and broke out this week little civility in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It is the sign of a real Zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion, before returning to the fight again quickly of the parties in the capital city? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and Congressional leaders produced no breakthrough in the big issues that will be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government session, in which no decisions had to be taken, employing more. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After all what we hear, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan ecopoint Sammelns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meeting of the deficit Commission President on Wednesday was equally civilised, despite the political differences between the members still exist. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months a mutual respect, which can cause the ideological divide, which remains the members, separating disguised. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> This is hardly enough to say that it was entered a new era of cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Both sides are now in a test phase, in which one of the other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise, while calling itself is trying to measure the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a new party Kriegsführung. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This was why the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants on a minimum requirements or accusations limited. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to be a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, could expect. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Regardless of whether it is taxes, donations or health benefits, the two sides are miles apart. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Finally voted the November election Washington, at least for a short time mild. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, which now for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center works. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "It is inevitable after the elections. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elections give partisan passions that die again. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And that is a good thing. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In a number of issues, particularly those that are on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. " </seg>
<seg id="19"> Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports it. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way to receive some or all of them, whether it is temporary or permanent. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is also a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits to be expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that people think the favored tax cuts for the rich, while they are refusing to give an unemployed workers support. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House is the increased optimism that these issues during the "lame duck" session agreement can be ratified and at the same time the new START treaty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent questions, the lame duck session "not necessarily to a lasting cooperation between the parties must lead if will convene the new 112. Congress in January. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead, he says, is a phase of Nichtübereinstimmens more likely, perhaps even inevitable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "After the things that have to be done are done, this will turn Short-run psychology in confrontation," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - that courtesy to true cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "I see much of what is happening from today until 2012, when Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons for this, many with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and to do with the Teeparty-Wählern, which were their education. </seg>
<seg id="29"> How worried the Republican leaders also may be that they too high poker, they know that they need to seek their promises, government spending and reduce the health reform to be repealed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> This party lines are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the deficit Commission, which has a tax reform and the raising of taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and that sinks of government spending. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, so very pressed the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes with its plan to official recommendation and to make it very struggle to come only in the vicinity of this figure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The greatest resistance will take place in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters today at least, little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Galston says two stages of the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The first battle will be next year in the form of party Zusammenstössen place until Obama Republicans in the state budget, taxes and the health system challenge, then followed by a period larger-mesh zweiparteilicher cooperation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will lead to this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> The public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It is proved that, despite the current partisanship of the election, the majority of Americans are still hopes that the two parties are working together. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If confrontation in a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties need to look carefully at the public reaction. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Whoever the losers will be sentenced to change tack and have to find a compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> In fact, it may be an optimistic view. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Partisanship and polarization today are larger than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem a larger ideological divide between Obama and the Kongress-Republikanern than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> While at the same time, the activists of both parties in 2010 as a prelude to a much broader consequence of 2012 election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> So it may be that the courtesy of this week will be welcomed by many Americans. </seg>
<seg id="45"> But it will be on both sides much more effort, a common denominator in the issues that divide the two still. </seg>

<seg id="7"> In April allowed a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum for the victims of the public confrontation with the people who have supported once the regime. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In June, the government issued a school book, which for the first time children tells the story of former soldiers of the Khmer Rouge. </seg>

<seg id="9"> And in July, a community of the UN tribunal and Cambodia, for the first time, a former member of the Khmer Rouge, than the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, sentenced to 35 years in prison. </seg>
<seg id="10"> With each of these developments, the anxiety among the Khmer Rouge veteran Alnlong Vengs, complicated their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration into society in Cambodia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "There are still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Youk Chhang, head of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "For them was the life under the Khmer Rouge glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "It divides even families." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, review or hunger. </seg>
<seg id="15"> As the Vietnamese invaded in 1979 and the Pol Pot Ied government, fled the remnants of the regime and its military on the border of Cambodia to Thailand. </seg>

<seg id="20"> He died in 2006, waited prison in Phnom Penh, where he found on the process. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> As their benefactors they no longer shielded, fled the majority of former Khmer Rouge fighters in the grinding poverty of rural Cambodia and many maintained the movement in nostalgic memory. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Even if a few elite of Khmer Rouge officials when their local government posts reserved, because they set down their guns, ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="27"> "The life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said. </seg>

<seg id="29"> "But now is the life difficult, because we have to worry about ourselves." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns. </seg>
<seg id="31"> At the beginning of next year, the court to try to Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to court. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The mission of the court, the old leaders, and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities to condemn, but it is not said whether it will follow on these four cases further action. </seg>
<seg id="33"> It has done little to assuage the fears in Anlong Veng. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="1"> Belarus is not agree to continue to accumulate weapons-grade uranium </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to global security of nuclear material, the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it no longer will gather highly enriched uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The deal was in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the security summit announced. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The US government had for years sought to convince Belarus, not more highly enriched uranium to collect and seemed to have achieved a hurdle last spring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But the US government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements with Bailers have been taken to remove about 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center. </seg>
<seg id="6"> That paved the stage for the agreement on Wednesday, the rest of the material to be removed, according to an official employee who, because of the sensitivity of the issue remains anonymous, roughly £500. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear security summit of 47 nations' in April, which had to be excluded Bailers. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And it was obvious good enough to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet republic of the next Summit in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I was really enthusiastic about the fact that they have a seat on the nuclear security summit (from 2012)." </seg>
<seg id="10"> "It shows me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of Global Security Partnership, a group promoting nuclear safety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" of Bailers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Obama promised to secure in Prague in April 2009, within four years of all vulnerable nuclear materials. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since then, the US government six countries, helped her highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Belarus will be the seventh. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A dozen countries did under the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At the time of Obama's nuklearem Sicherheitsgipfel weissrussisch President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never give up its uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "How highly enriched uranium reserve - hundreds of kilos, which fundamentally weapons is capable of, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "This is our raw material... We will make this a dirty bombs and we will sell it to anybody." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We use it only for research purposes, that is all." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Bailers neared a few months ago, however, the United States, as it indicate interest in the meeting of an agreement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The first round of the uranium of Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was easily irradiated, officials say. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It was in a Spezialzug loaded with more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say officials. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the officials by plane. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The US government pays for this effort $14 million, with a large part of the money in the Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which can be used not for nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "This was extremely cautious coordinated and to build up confidence" that the agreement, which was signed by President Clinton, led, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, which operates in the global risk reduction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende studies estimates that Bailers this year at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Belarus, according to the joint agreement his camp until 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The relations between Belarus and the US have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But the statement on Wednesday suggests a possible rapprochement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> "The progress of this global security issues welcome heissend, the United States of America and Bailers known, an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus, a central issue in the improvement in bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin has argued for keeping the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the whole of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tension on the markets have triggered a double response from the government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation, starting with tax rebates for small and micro-entities, the regulation of work agencies or the lifting of the 426 euro support for the unemployed, which no unemployment benefit, referring to the privatisation of 49 per cent of AENA, the management of the Barajas airport and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel, which have herausbeschwört as the head of the current crisis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How are we to understand these events? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It was anticipate that Merkel's position is no fault of their public work. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It adopted Germany a radically new perspective to shape our future, which is at odds with the maintenance of the ancient traditions of the bulk of its partners. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In the face of resistance in Europe is beginning to be spekuliern in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro area. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The second: The reintroduction of the German mark - although this rather poverty-focussed science fiction sounds - supported by a large part of the public opinion, around 50% of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The third parties: A transformation of the euro under German proposals. This means: More macroeconomic control; strict financial management; punishment of countries that the cross premisses; möglichere Solonic the default of certain countries, and the extension of the cost of potential adjustments to the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is clear, and for some time. That is why there is now no excuses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First, in 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government is a constitutional reform from the English in order to prevent this from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It was the first sign of the polarisation between what Germany was necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second sign, the Central European country than Merkel postponed the decision to the rescue of Greece painful. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It was then that strong criticism, but the fact is that the political consensus were in Germany, the public and published opinion absolutely against a bailout of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally, Merkel in the last October days again with a clear position. It calls for a reform of the European Union agreement to the rescue of a country and at the same time to allow the private lenders to implement a part of the cost. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as they embarked on the Irish crisis and all of the following. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But its proposal, although slightly sweetened, was adopted. In the next few months, we will be in the reform of the European Union, which these measures from 2013 to participate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has a red line, which it does not to exceed. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It says everything that, even if now unpopular measures must be taken - will no longer be as of this date of the old workings of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="24"> 2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency zone, in which the perpetrators against countries hard will be punished, this could be forced to declare itself insolvent must take and, in this case, the private sector a part of the cost. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The other alternative on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments based as it from Spain in boom times, is simply unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would do poorly to understand it. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not just a matter of runterzufahren the deficit by 2013 to three per cent. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much tougher. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the worst thing we could do in these conditions, is to cheat ourselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the current turbulence converted into more rest. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And the opportunities that are available to us, will use until spring 2013. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero has understood it that way, and his double announcement (which promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, in order to create their own house, their way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not seem that would change that. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Among the options considered is that we walked away with a few serious countries euro area, not exclude </seg>

<seg id="3"> The alleged of two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) has instigated exclusion in the game of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League meant that much ink has been spilled about whether it is a unsporting act or not acted and whether any two players should be sanctioned by UEFA. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is widely known, lost the two players a couple of minutes to go (their team had already clearly won) time and played several foul, so that the referee showed them the second yellow card. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way, and as the Real Madrid his group would be the two players the prescribed sanction at the next league match against Auxerre when it comes to meet and so without cards in the next stage of the game. </seg>
<seg id="6"> After all, the Disziplinarkommitee of UEFA, the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different sums of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is so widespread that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport followed rules. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of the arisen debate about the case is presented to the fact that a team of the club Real Madrid (which in his anthem Edelmut and honour claims and on other occasions his players for similar incidents had punished) in the protagonist, and on the proportion by Mourinho, an episode has added more on his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case, the debate about whether this is not explicitly banned by the statutes behaviour is contrary to the principles of the sport, that is, whether this is a rule anti-gypsyism circumvention. In fact, this approach to the statutes of sport, but seem to circumvent its meaning. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this matter should be investigated the sport spirit ailment. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sporting spirit defends the physical integrity of the antagonists, an aspect of this action was not at risk, because it was not an aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the perpetrators against players an unjustified benefit from the Gegenteam. That did not happen either. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradox of the act of the players of the Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally under false game or rule bypass, bypassing the rule was not taken secretly in order to avoid sanctions, but it should be so long as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players waited and took the sanction happily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is what kind of took advantage of the offenders from the deliberate foul. </seg>
<seg id="17"> It should be stressed that the rival either in a worse position was still benefits for the game played erheischt, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue to play with few players. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not use these players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The benefit is evident in the fact that the players the next phase of the Champions League game without cards that their participation in a future game could threaten to start. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a long-term, up to a certain extent uncertain advantage, because the team eventually could leave. Moreover the players with this approach a sanction and go in the second cycle on cards in which they have left for Kartenanhäufung with a card less than in the first cycle. </seg>
<seg id="21"> So it is not clear whether it really is an advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sport, including strategic decisions, in order to learn the rules a maximum benefits. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case, the players wanted no sanction to supervent (that is, in fact, a clear case of rule circumvention), they wanted more when they choose this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They made a strategic decision without a penalty to evade or flee before her. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Although the border between inventiveness and regulatory environment blurred, I believe, is that it is a matter of a clear case of inventiveness. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: Because of two independent jams ginge rallies and because of the nature of the Regelübertragung provoked. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The damage to the principles of sport by these actions have caused, is less ethical than aesthetic. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a frenzy on corruption suspicions names the FIFA's executive committee on Thursday the host countries of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a highly political election, in which the Rangeln threaten to push for influence, as well as the lobbying the technical criteria in the background. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> One thing is certain: The 2018 edition of the King discipline of the FIFA is in Europe, their traditional stronghold, held (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The edition 2022 will then be somewhat exotic; the International Football Association hopes, after the premiere on the African continent in 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) for themselves to win, or its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to follow. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The list of people who belong to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) is the degree of economic and political use of the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The machinations behind the scenes are threatening to hold until the last minute. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Difficult otherwise, a hierarchy of candidates. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Following the evaluation report by FIFA, offer the English, Spanish, Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts besseren arguments than those of its competitors. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But these considerations will be of the 22 members of the era of the election Exekutifkommitees not so important. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The Sunday Times, which in reaching the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii) at the start of the revelations, would have been equally good opportunities for their own country, cradle of football, can ruin that only one time the world championship was allowed to wear, namely in 1966. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The BBC had the breedingground again on Monday, giving it a own broadcast, which had three influential members of the Kommitees, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under fire. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Reason enough to upset the FIFA and the English leaders in embarrassment, which primarily had operated with David Cameron in the last few weeks, an intensive lobbying. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The head of government hopes for a new edition of his predecessor, Tony Blair EU-OPS Schachzug, which had achieved a year in 2005 for the organization of the London Olympics in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> This intensive use would be enough to shore up the image of England before the Kommitee? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Nothing is less safe, because the duo Spain, Portugal, there is no shortage of assets, with its already finished stadiums, his expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, the Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to take the suggestion in the English press Bezichtigung of "an unfair competition in the run-up to the vote" on the part of the Kommitee denounced members. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> "One bewirft them with dirt, you try to compromise," Putin lashed out. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> For 2022 seem to be the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, the logical favorites. </seg>
<seg id="21"> First economic world power, seat of the FIFA major sponsors, the country seems a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set separate a very nice project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> But this new nominations seem premature for two countries, which the competitions co-organised kûdoka in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Another threat: The FIFA long-awaited approval of the World Cup 2026 for China, which will allow the Asian opportunities to 2022 lapses. </seg>

<p>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Since the debate about the modernisation of the transport economy on the Ile de France in full swing, it rains billion. </seg>
<seg id="3"> At least in the discussions. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Recall, in particular, the 23 billion for the metro Grand Paris in memory, which is being built by the Société du Grand Paris. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> For the construction of the start of the SGP MEPs, the state capital has called a $4 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the theoretical scheme, this is the amount of money, which would allow the SGP MEPs then to give to the markets in a part of the Finanzsumme on her Zweifachen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Today, it has finally come to first projections. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The addition of the 2010 budget, this morning by see the financial Commission of the National Assembly, contains the planned measures to secure the first part of that money. </seg>
<seg id="9"> There are two ways: The creation of a special tax to Erschliessund and higher taxation of offices at the boredom de France. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The former, one person's Article 15 of the draft law, "is in favour of public service station Société du Grand Paris." </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is quantified: "The product of this tax amounts to EUR 117 million per year." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Zweitere is a reorganization of the existing business taxation: "In order to modernise the resulting from their product and to increase this increase Société du Grand Paris to entrust." </seg>
<seg id="13"> How much it would bring? </seg>
<seg id="14"> A mystery. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This sum is not quantified in the text. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> From the 4 billion is far away. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "It states that the fiscal resources for the euro 4 billion of capital allocation added, which will be paid by the state and the Société du Grand Paris to the project to be done," according to the explanatory statement. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1"> The vengeful hacker and inspired spies. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The WikiLeaks business has a dual significance. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On one side, she is as obvious scandal, turning a scandal, which only a scandal in Sinner hypocrisy is governed by the Beziehunge between states, the public and the press. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level of, and is a foretaste of the future dominated by regression. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But we are going in the right order. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that everyone is made up of a secret service produced Act (of any nation) exclusively from newspaper Ausschnitten. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits Berlusconi's charge nothing more than what one for months in any case in any old Journal --Taiwan was to read (except those whose owner Berlusconi is), and the terrifying Gaddafi's profile karikaturierte Kabarettkünstlern already offered for a long time material for their sketch. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule, after which the secret dossiers only from already known news must insist, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go into a library, which esotherischen publications, you will see that every station (on the grail, the mystery of Rennes le Chateau, or the Templer Rosenkreuzler) exakte repeats what was written already in previous works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is not alone, therefore, that the author occult texts no research (still wants to publish, therefore, that he did not know where news about the failure to find Existierende), but because those who are the Okkultismus, nothing other than what they already know have already learnt and confirmed what they are. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> As the secret files. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informant is bad, and grow moldy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise whatever he could, for example, editor in Libération), which is just as true recognises what he considers. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Top Secret information about Mr Berlusconi, who is the American Embassy in Rome had sent the Staatsdezernat, were the same as those who had already published Newsweek with the week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> So why was made such a fuss about the revelations of these files? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On one side is this what any educated person already knows, and that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the heads of government can call each other or a plane, in order to meet for dinner -- have lost their diplomatic role and have turned, with the exception of some small representativity tasks in espionage centres. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Any viewer of investigation movies knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that we should act to ignore this. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Still, the fact that it violates public to repeat the task of hypocrisy and serves to send the American diplomacy in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In second place: The idea that a business-as-usual hacker the secret mysteries of the world's most powerful country can tap, carries a major blow to the prestige of Staatsdezernats. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, the scandal less the victims as the "executioners' in trouble. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we have to pay the profound nature of what happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Former to Orwell's time, it was all power as a pool of Big Brother, who controlled every gesture of his subjects. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwell's prophecy since then have a completely right, where you can highlight any movement, thanks to the phone can check each transaction made, visited the hotel, the elected motorway and so on; the people would be the total victim of the eye of the power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But if we would result in mind, which expires today that even the secret Krypta of power is no longer the control of a Hackers escape, so, the control by unilateral target-orientated and to be suspended zirkelförmig. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker -- as one of the avenger by citizen - can bring the secrets of power in experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> How can a power that is not in a position to maintain its own secrets? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be unveiled); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's basically free from a secret Geheimis is, as it does the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty-worded secrets, means to deprive them of any power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> WikiLeaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wronged, but against Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What are the consequences of this injury to be inflicted on such an enormous power? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the states in future reserved for any more information will be online -- that would amount to a on the street corner angeklebt form. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is also clear that with the current technologies in vain is to be hoped, confidential reports on telephone secret. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of state in a plane fortbewegt has contacted and one of his colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could be operated in future private and only for some ears certain relations? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know very well that my prediction at the moment for science fiction and romanhaft sounds, but I feel compelled to give me the present government agents in secret way inspired in uncontrollable Marschroute moving, its communications than anywhere else in the mere memory with leading, and beyond the few written information they received in the footwear (masked. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information would only copy in closed drawers stored: Basically had the espionage attempt by Watergate little success, as WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity to write that the technology today as a cancer progresses, namely backwards. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A century after the wireless telecommunications Count had revolutionized communications, reconstructed the Internet with a Telegrafen (telephone) wire. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The (analogue) video had the film scientists enables a film band for gang auszukundschaften by from behind forward spulen and all the secrets of Monday could drop, while the (numerical) CDs nothing other than today, from chapter to chapter to jump in Makroportionen. </seg>

<seg id="40"> It is therefore not exceptional that policy and communications technology on car and horse. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Climate: As France its financial promises of talking </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to comply with the quickly resolved financing promises ("fast start" or premature funding to investigate), which were carried out by the developing countries. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And are already revealed the rough French vulnerable to blandishments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With the Copenhagen Treaty have the developing countries pledged $30 billion between 2010 and 2012. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The EU has 7.2 billion euros over three years, promised to France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> At the opening of the COP16, the EU has all its partners from the fact their commitment to the Fast-Start-Finanzierungen getreuer approach to convince: Detailed report their Member States, press conference, large, Nebenevents Broschüren distribution. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The operation transparency is remarkable and precisely for their actual value estimated: The developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries made the same on the same level of precision. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The EU, announced in 2010 2.2 billion euros to what they have released on the right path to Respektbezollung their commitment of $7.2 billion in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But if you are looking into detail, things are a little more complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should be according to the Copenhagen Treaty 'new and additional "to ensure that an additional use has been tabled, without the benefit to the detriment of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what the "new and additional" means. </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the EU Commission proposed a euro-harmonisation, have blocked certain Member States, including France, the procedure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today, everyone chooses the benchmark, which he considered best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The European Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those of 2009 commentators: The international funding will be retained, and is in the context of the financing start-ups "almost" over three years, 150 million of them. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries have elected similar benchmarks, either in terms of year, or about conditions at the level of public development aid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In return, France was of the opinion that the funding of 'new projects "of 2010 are" new and additional ". </seg>
<seg id="17"> In other words, there is no benchmarks in the spending of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Specifically, the total amount of French support for developing countries remain stable (or even decline) -- France is to keep his commitment to the "new and additional funding." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another key factor is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is still no rule, and everyone chooses its computing mode. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, such as France, 1 Ministers borrowed as equivalent to 1 donated Eurofederalist. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Obviously, this is only acceptable: The effort is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often tied to the emission control projects, which are based on technology actually) can be justified, it is deceptive, the euro to present it as the equivalent of a donated euro pervade... should also only the cost of the loan for the country as Kapitalgeber commitment are counted (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France has nothing else in the sense than the following thought: "Respect" his commitment from 420 million euros by 91.5% loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% accorded) 36.1 million euros) -- see the EU document to see for yourselves. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only EU agriculture that loan engaged in large measure. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany is calling for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands, or Slovakia (among others) their commitments to 100% with donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union 1 Eurofederalist to fulfil their obligations, France has just 10 cents and understands including a comparable use. </seg>
<seg id="28"> More beautiful hocus-pocus! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> All in all, France operates in his fast start funding with a double fraud: A part with a Weiterentwicklkung of the action on the period and partly with the reality of the financial commitment. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France, manage to believe that it 420 million "new and additional" million, in line with its promises and has spent supplemented--and economises EUR 36.1 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems likely that it was Bercy, which has carried out the arbitrage) could be a double negative effect,; even (why the other internally within the Member States with the giving away, but if there is enough to lend?), and then in the negotiations, as misled the developing countries is not complete... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter of premature funding only a small issue in a relatively short time compared to the entirety of discussions about the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it may be too much of the drop in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> We hope that this is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As always, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year premature funding. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In the first place could France a change in his recording kind for the years 2011 and 2012, and in the spirit of the respect for his obligations and equilibrium-restoring justice with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> But especially France could the discussions on the subject of a dispute of long-term financing to bring forward (another crucial issue discussed and at the moment): You can escape the issue of " Verrechenbarkeit or of the charge kind of its loans. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could alter its position as is advanced in terms of disputes, as it on other things. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The hope is based, will arrive on the new environmental Gastinger Kosciusko-Morizet, the next week in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A surprising announcement on the fast start of France and his vision of "Verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loans would inherently increase international confidence base, which is necessary for further discussions. </seg>
