The geriatric care centre confirms that the deaths cannot be explained by "missing measures" 
The owners of the old people's home in Olot do not rule out that her male nurse killed more than eleven older people 
The responsible parties of the geriatric care centre of La Carita in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday in which pointed her out Joan Vila Dilmés - the male nurse who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible during his work - had the criminal actions caused the facilities, which damage. 
The head of the geriatric care centre, Joan Sala, got on in front of court the process and the civil law liability and announced "responsible parties would Laly like to accuse this one of Caritas (for the deaths)", however, " the right and our liability duty force us " to take care in the company of his lawyer, Joan Cañada. 
The facilities must accept not only a social reputation loss because she had not established the criminal actions of the male nurse on time but pay a large amount of compensation now which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims, too. 
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime declines for August 2009 and that, since then, he has further murdered. 
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric care centre - since he suspected that no doctor has examined the decedents personally but the formalities were dealt with by phone due to the age and illnesses. 
The conductor of La Caritas denied this point flatly and explained, that "measures failing to appear could have been the reason for the occurrences at that time" 
The lawyer of La Caritas added, that "would not" give any circumstantial evidence for negligent actions to another person than the accused in the lawsuit 
This one already as christened "angel of death" confessed eleven murders the day before yesterday and explained, the first crime commits on August 29th, 2009 and the second old lady murders one and a half months later to have. 
In this case he killed insulin with an overdose as opposed to the first crime at which he had given a mixture of different depressants. 
The leader of La Caritas explained the entry of the staff to the medicine has to be checked only with difficulty. 
The male nurse used depressant cocktail at six of nine committed crimes to free the patients with the death of her suffering the insulin syringes and this. 
But the results of the laboratory examinations will point out, whether Vila lies and actually chose for his first victims a less cruel death or whether he cauterized these from inside, by giving bleaching lye to them as he had done it according to the confession with three women whom he murdered between October 12th and 17th. 
In La Caritas who could absolutely be more one does not believe the statements of the male nurse, the number of confessed murders does even not concern what. This attitude is justified that Vila had made very different statements ahead of court and that it does not make sense to change his procedure suddenly after eight successful murders. 
You say they provided themselves with her for this reason and to the enlightenment of the reach of these occurrences of the justice.
