Zapatero and the red line of Germany 
Berlin has himself for the keep conditions for the entire European Union built the euros decidedly but at the same time. 
The tensions on the markets have aroused a double answer of the government. 
On the one hand has presented new adjustment measures to José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, these do not buy unemployment benefit begun at tax reductions for Klein and small enterprise, the regulation of temporary work enterprises or the abolition of the 426 euros support for unemployed up to the privatization of 49 per cent of AENA, the administration of airports Barajas and El Prat as well as 30 per cent of the state lottery. 
On the other hand the acting head of the government, Elena Salgado, supports Felipe González with the help of the former district president, which brings about the present crisis the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible parties has. 
How do these events have to be understood? 
It is, anticipated this Merkel's position is not a fault of her public relations. 
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro. 
Germany takes a basically new perspective for the design of our future which collides with the retention of the traditional traditions of a large part of his partners. 
In view of the resistances in Europe one starts with over three possible solutions for the crisis to speculate in Germany. 
The first one: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries during the south must leave the euro zone. 
The second: The reintroduction of the German Deutschmark supports - although this at present rather sounds like science fiction - , of a large part of the public opinion, approx. 50 per cent of the population. 
The third party: A redesign of the euro in accordance with German suggestions. This means: moremacroeconomic control; absolute housekeeping; Punishment of the countries which break the specifications; possibly the stoppage of payments of some countries as well as the expansion of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector. 
The German position is clear and stands out already for some time. Therefore there are no excuses now. 
A constitutional reform pulled himself out of the sleeve to prevent this as of 2016, when first 2009 the IMF and the European Commission made incentives for deficits both and the German government. 
This was the first symptom for it and the methods of his European partners including France diverge between this, what Germany considered necessary (severe tax plans and stable public finances). 
The second sign put the Central European country when Merkel postponed the decision painfully to the rescue of Greece. 
This was criticized strongly at that time. But the political agreement in Germany is fact that were, the public one and this one published opinion absolutely against a rescue of Greece. 
Merkel finally comes out anew with a clear position within the last few October days. She demands a reform of the agreements of the European Union to bear a part of the costs to make the rescue of a country possible and engage the private lenders simultaneously. 
Became this position as interpreted anti European since she advanced the Irland crisis and all following. 
But her suggestion if sweetened also a little was accepted. Within the next months we will participate in the reform of the European Union which shall make these measures possible as of 2013. 
Germany has drawn a red line which does not intend to exceed it. 
It tells everyone that the old operation of the euro will not exist any more as of this appointment even if unpopular measures must be taken now. 
2013 will this one be the year of birth of a new currency room, in which countries are punished hard for offenders, being able to be forced to explain oneself insolvent and in this case must the private sector take on a part of the costs. 
Germany shows us that we must smash a hard expansionist policy with high economize and rates of investment, moderation of consumption, improvement on the productivity and competitiveness as well as positive foreign-trade balances. 
The other alternative which is based on indebtedness and building and construction industry with gigantic holes in the balance of payments, was specified by Spain in boom times like her simply will not be accepted. 
The supply is clear. 
And we would do to this badly not to understand it. 
It is not all about only to power the government's deficit on three per cent up to the year 2013. 
The demands are much more mandatory. 
And it is the worst which we could do under these conditions to deceive us ourselves. 
I hope that the present turbulences change into more leisure. 
And that, until spring 2013, we will use the possibilities which are commanded to us. 
It seems that Zapatero has understood this also that way and rejects his double announcement (the promised reforms according to the meeting with the large-scale enterprises on last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) at this that has establish the hypothesis, order despite the criticism of Merkel in the house of one's own, prepared himself her way. 
But the red line drawn by Germany is there and does not see it so out that something would change to this. 
Under the possibilities taken into consideration this one is not ruling out that we must leave the euro zone crammed full with little serious countries. 
In this case Germany still could tell us it has warned us.
