Euro: The ECB is forced to keep her purchases of government bonds 
The last meeting of the board of a central bank of the ECB last year should offer opportunity to show possibilities which shall come to her completion at the end of the year as one gets out of the crisis or announce at least the order of a large number at unconventional measures of the financial policy. 
The crisis of the European national debt engages, the central bank in Frankfurt undoubtedly can not afford it, also today's more but to forfeit a tense situation on the European bond markets to not cause the worsening. 
The political costs would be far too high. 
The French Chancellor of the Exchequer Christine Lagarde had welcomed the role yesterday on the occasion of a press conference which is taken by the ECB and active in favour of the solution of the national budget indebtedness of Europe. 
She has not dared to say, whether she is of the opinion, the central bank still can do more, for example by pump priming of her programme of the purchases of government bonds. 
"I keep my considerations for my European trading partners in front of ( ... )". 
On the day before, Jean-Claude Törichte, president of the ECB had not rather settled regarding his plan shown but himself very eloquently in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the economy and monetary committee of the European Parliament to point out that the programme of the purchases of government bonds would be on the after market "on-going uses" we "see" during the meeting being on Thursday how the decisions turn out and that. 
Only certainty: The ECB will unchanged leave her key interest rate at 1%, the historically lowest standard since May 2009. 
The purchases of bond of the treasure vault of the ECB were doubled last week on approximately 1.35 billion euros in the practice. 
And according to the indiscretions of some dealers she shall have completed new purchases yesterday at Irish and Portuguese government bonds. 
Altogether, the central banks of the euro system have carried out purchases in the amount of 67 billion euros since May 2010. 
The anticipation becomes follow up the call price doubted under no circumstances (see page 29) one under the dealers. 
The economists already expect no more remarkable change of course. 
If the loan business of over three months will already have disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, gets himself still give the absolute funds reserves no end of trouble in a bounteous way and to be more precise over a period of a week up to three months on the latter. 
The economists brace themselves already today that this measure still will extend by some months. 
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will amend her programme in an essential way". 
"She would otherwise take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short run", suspected for Michael Schubert, economist of Commerzbank, so. 
"An exit which is provided for the course of the first quarter 2011 and progressive" more probably seems to me, anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist with Sal, for his part. 
Oppenheim. 
The ECB should in the area of her interventions on the market of the national debt " such a purchase volume of bonds which stimulates the sluggish market keep up ", Norbert Bräms adds. 
In consideration of the relevance of the prominent position of the European banks on the markets of the national debt in the euro zone the central bank does not have another election but to keep her presence on the market. 
"She must step and act so much at every price to the Steller of the lacking investors on the market to prevent the rash enthusiasm about the returns paid to the weakest states", attested yesterday one important bond owner. 
The interest rates set for the high-altitude flight, the states still would be prevented more to reduce her indebtedness or also only to stabilize because if. 
This is the price to the protection of the euro.
