In the competition around the cleverest heads many enterprises go in the close combat meanwhile and back cooperations with the universities like VW. 
Your mission: Recruiting the most talented graduates in the lecture rooms as early as possible before they come onto the labour market and are courted of other. 
And because the universities do not return any lists about the performances of her students, one tries the exception talents in practice projects to espy and at himself to bind.

He sees the advantages for the two sides: "The students get in contact to the industry and gain experience." 
"VW can get to know students simultaneously, looks at interesting candidates more nearly and wonders who would be considered as employee." 
Such cooperations, are not unusual, so Selle. 
It is that the students are wooed um so offensively new.

The enterprises cannot choose her employees from a large crowd of applicants in many lines of business any more. 
But they must extol themselves and perform the courtship display particularly around highly qualified workers. 
Primarily graduates from the engineer disciplines are at it in an excellent negotiating position.

The internal Employer branding, that is employer brand formation within the staff of one's own, is called in the industry-specific jargon. 
"Content employees are the best ambassadors." 
If one treats his people well and they identify themselves with the enterprise then they completely would of alone with friends and acquaintances advertise her employer. 
"This is like a game with gang", says Kriegler.
