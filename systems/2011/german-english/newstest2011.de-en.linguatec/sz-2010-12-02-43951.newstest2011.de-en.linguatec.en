Mysterious excavation 
The atomic energy authority IAEA has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria. 
However, the country defends itself, to take position as it, it still allows controls. 
At least four Israeli F 15 I fighter planes attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria toward midnight from 5th until September 6th, 2007. 
It is at the bank of the Euphrat; the next larger town, 30 kilometres removed, is Dair ace Saur. 
Your name appears in documents of the international atomic energy authority (IAEA) if it is about the reactor alleged with the help the Syria has built in the cuboid from North Korea, hides in a valley which comes off the current. 
According to a briefing of the U.S. foreign secret service CIA of the end of April 2008 this one also would have been suitable well under the name reactor familiar to the near village of tbsp Kibar to produce plutonium, nuclear weapons could be built from this. 
For other purposes however technology hardly is good from the fifties. 
The CIA demonstrated a business video with blurred satellite pictures. 
She displayed by computer animation, where which components of the reactor have been in front of the destruction shall, the one is reduced copy of the North Korean model from the atom centre Yongbyon. 
Moreover, she presented photos, the interior which shows the building from the proximity or cooked. 
It was said the reactor has stood shortly before the putting into operation but still not with fuel rods equippedly been. 
Today hardly more is known more than three year after the bombardment than at that time, the puzzles got rather bigger with the time. 
The former U.S. president George W. Bush has revealed in his memoirs recently, it was sure that although the CIA rakes herself before the attack, however, hardly clues saw that there was "an active nuclear weapon programme" in the country that Syria in tbsp Kibar built a reactor. 
Some secret service agents in Europe are kind even more careful there and only speak about an "alleged reactor" even if they keep the CIA presentation to "plausible". 
You lack a hard proof just like the IAEA. 
Asked how he assure a high UN diplomat answered summers only succinct, the IAEA in this it was to have a reactor in front of himself enough material has ", to guarantee around questions ". 
The Syrians misappropriated the rubble of the alleged "unused armed forces building" quickly and levelled the area thoroughly. 
Nevertheless found an IAEA team in June 2008 under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in tbsp Kibar traces of uranium which had been produced by people. 
Moreover, the IAEA got satellite pictures of commercial suppliers about a member state directly after the attack, from the time which might be more meaningful than the one of the CIA presented. 
These photos cannot be got on the market because the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - has bought her exclusively, though. 
The IAEA cannot verify her genuineness therefore independently. 
Syria has always declared to have operated a secret nuclear programme or built a reactor never. 
Damascus explained the uranium is from the Israeli weapons. 
But this rejected the IAEA after analysis of the particles as improbable. 
Damascus refuses to discuss it - just like about the satellite pictures since then. 
Moreover, it refuses the inspectors a second inspection in tbsp Kibar and the entry to the ruins of the bombed-out building. 
Israel is but also ironly silent. 
"We will never comment on it", the premier being in office in the time of the attack, Ehud Olmert, confirmed the official position recently. 
So the examination of the case has dragged itself without result to since June 2008 and "develops into a grave reliability problem increasingly for the authority" as a high western diplomat grants the IAEA at the seat in Vienna, a difficult violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty finally is in the room the IAEA watches over. 
As a key for progress in the enlightenment the IAEA still sees apparently another three facilities which shall be "in a functional connection" with the presumed reactor and different from it existing. 
Neither the inspectors have disclosed till now nor which plants it is, which function they have or what she seem suspicious makes. 
According to information of the Süddeutsche Zeitung they are described internally as Marj ace sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived from near situated towns in turn, at the IAEA. 
International Security in Washington (Isis) which it in all probability is one of the suspicious objects has identified these places and found a building complex on satellite pictures at Masyaf the independent institutes for Science and. 
It possibly is in or immediately next to a military base - with these grounds Syria exactly refuses the IAEA the access to the three places. 
It is said in Vienna the Syrians were afraid of a fishing expedition - that the IAEA is sent forward by the USA to //späh// armed forces plants. 
Because the nuclear private investigators had got aware of the facilities by a tip of the U.S. secret services. 
The IAEA has indications, among this satellite photographs, that material was transported to and fro between the three places and the cuboid at the Euphrat. 
A high western diplomat in Vienna said one of the plants could at least stand "in connection with the fuel production". 
However, there are "no indications of sensitive activities", that is uranium enrichment or reprocessing; Processes which are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons. 
Although the reactor type is operated with uranium which is not enriched. 
The uranium would have been supposed to come here and where the plutonium should be divided off for the bomb from this later, for these central questions there are if need be plausible assumptions but where. 
Whether ruins which could hold valuable traces were stored at the three places is also unclear. 
As if the hundreds of truck loads of the ground had disappeared, nobody wants to have information about it, where the rubble has remained. 
The only few kilometres of tbsp Kibar on the other side of the Euphrat situated salt mine al-Tibni which has examined Syria 1998 for her suitability as a store for radioactive rubbish is for the IAEA as improbable. 
She had the former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley brought Intelligence review to Jane in an analysis of satellite pictures for the renowned magazine with the reactor in union recently. 
However, photos from the orbit show that Syria carried out excavation and removed big containers at places suspicious to three, after the IAEA had required entrance. 
This can be chance, however, has hardly contributed to dispel the suspicion. 
Moreover, it is called in diplomat circles, has put the IAEA into this for quite a number of months which should permit Syria, develop a plan for inspections there, to keep possible armed forces secrets, alone the effort shows how big the interest of the inspectors is. 
Damascus ironed this suggestion meanwhile, too. 
High urgency had the thing therefore has no western diplomats in Vienna still a year ago appeased, the reactor is destroyed, U.S. ambassador Glyn Davies has approximately taken so-called special inspections to the game, one of the toughest means which has the Viennese state nuclear authority for a couple of months to succeed with controls. 
IAEA boss Yukiya Amano who must suggest these inspections already has spoken about "an option which I am straight in the future", he still hesitates, however. 
A high risk lies in this way: On the one hand, it needs a majority for it in the governor council of the IAEA and quite a lot of 35 represented there are countries anything but keenly on an escalation. 
On the other hand, how a diplomat points out: "What is if they find nothing at all at the end?"
