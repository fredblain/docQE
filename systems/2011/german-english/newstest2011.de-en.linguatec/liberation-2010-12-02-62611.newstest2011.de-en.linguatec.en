Alarm - pesticides taken by children 
A child of 10 years takes 81 different chemical substances over the day, such a study published by the union Générations Futures (former movement of generations coming to the protection of the rights and the respect) this Wednesday. 
The union which explains this one normally had between July and September within four that her results "do not represent statistically significant value but represent illustration character of the treated difficulties in view of the low number of analysed samples", food consumed plus a snack between meals bought in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris from an approximately ten-year-old child for the meals. 
These typical meals, inclusive of the official recommendations of five fresh fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day, were examined just like nibblings of laboratories on the search for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants. 
The plate balance sheets are shattering: 81 chemical substances, and five carcinogenically classified just like 37 substances with endocrine interference factor loudly when sure studies of several institutions, such as the international cancer research centre, under this 42 as possibly or probably carcinogenic classified. 
"One takes so very well that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to possibly carcinogenic substances with endocrine interference factor is alarming even if the legal limits are not exceeded for every substance in approximate all the cases which is chemical and taken individually from this elevation", remarks the union. 
Already at the breakfast alone the butter and the tea already contain more than ten of the possibly carcinogenic delays and of three for certain proved, just like more than twenty delays which can impair the hormone system with milk as carcinogenic. 
When snack between meals provided for the study the apple imported from Brazil shows traces of six chemical substances, under forbidden to this one in France fungicide. 
The same applies to the string beans at which the study has locked traces of an insecticide forbidden strictly in the EU from Kenya, included in the lunch. 
Furthermore the hamburger, the tunafish from the tin, alone the baguette and the chewing gum were also larded by pesticides and other chemical substances. 
The analyses have brought the presence of nitrates and chloroform to the light at the tapwater. 
At dinner the salmon steak was with 34 determined, chemical delays of the "most extensive" and alone the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave up was not unloaded. 
The end finite risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer probably "is", so undervalued the study. 
"Alliance Europe technology Les Verts" (EE-LV) has suggested "in view of the urgency of the situation" for her part to introduce a moratorium about the use of pesticides to stop the "increase to illnesses caused by civilization". 
A study of the European authority had reference to the presence of delays of 365 different, pesticides identified into fruit and vegetables identified, which are consumed in Europe, among this 76, for food safety (EFSA) into corn in July.
