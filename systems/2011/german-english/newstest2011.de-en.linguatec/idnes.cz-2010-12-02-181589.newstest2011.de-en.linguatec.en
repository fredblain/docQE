The army has so many fuses that could one wrap round whole Czechia think you, however, for only two years 
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometres of fuses, explosive devices are detonated. 
Before, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometres of fuse to the army camps in the year. 
It is already calming down to know that the defense forces have from worried for 225 years. 
The problem is - only the durability of the fuses two, at the most but four years. 
The army bought the fuses of the public limited company STV Group, a. p. for silly 40 million crowns. 
In his grounds for the purchase of this enormous lot of fuse the general staff answered MF DNES the soldiers would use up about 60 kilometres of fuse every year. 
Which asked MF DNES about it, goes out from this detail from all generals and officers of the army command up to the secretaries and cleaning ladies that the whole army must complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic education annually according to the enquiries of army pyrotechnists. 
Not excepted for Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondra and army general Vlastimil Picek. 
The considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of fuses could be justified partly only in such a way. 
This length corresponds by the way to 25.000 explosions. 
This army inventory would suffice for more than ten year but also so. 
If the old rule of experts is, however, still valid that two metres of fuse suffice for the training of every new professional soldier completely, then the army has herself for created the 225 years already mentioned by these new purchases - stock calming one also under the point of view of the increased need of the sapper and special squads. 
Soldiers of the fast use brigade complained to the Minister of Defence Vondra recently, they would have almost no more cartridges for handguns so that shooting practices are limited strongly because of the missing means. 
Completely being silent of the pant defect. 
"Why I not understand, she of us buy such vast amounts fuses either?" 
But this is her decision at long last, they already will know what they need her for." 
For us the army is ", the we as dealers extensive contrary to liked to come ", a good customer the sales manager says to STV Group Jan Decký. 
Spokesman of the Ministry of Defence accounts with that for the purchase one hundred kilometre fuse Jan Pejšek, this one, this one army would have stocked up on this "ammunition" so at least for ten years. 
Jan Decký of STV Group only speaks, however, about a four-year time of use of the fuses and police and army pyrotechnist really only of two years. 
Storage is well possibly " at perfect ", also the four mentioned years one of them which, however, wants to remain unnamed to be not accused of the criticism of the army as a soldier fills. 
After expiry of the time of use must any ammunition be tested thoroughly, whether she is still reliable and does this not endanger lives of the soldiers? 
These tests, however, are legitimately but cost further money. 
Further argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometres of fuse. 
"You cost us sixty per cent less as the last year's delivery of 244 kilometres", speaker Pejšek informs us about the point of view of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence. 
Only for comparison purposes: The annual consumption of fuses of pyrotechnists of the police which liquidate ammunition from the second World War or the Soviet brother army exceeds hardly any 1.500 metre already for some years. 
And the police always order only such amounts of this ammunition which still can consume her before expiry of the time of use. 
Spare because of the safety of the pyrotechnists, in addition, one keeps the possibility for flexible purchases of more modern and therefore also reliable fuses open so. 
The Ministry of Defence has anyway gigantic problems at the liquidation ten thousand tons ammunition from times of the Warsaw contract when the Czechoslovakian People's Army of two hundred thousand prepared for her campaign to the Rhine. 
Which mentioned MF DNES according to the pyrotechnists, the same problem at the liquidation of one hundred kilometre old fuses which she has bought so "favourably" today expects the Czech defense forces within a couple of years.
