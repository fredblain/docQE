Inspectors in the twilight 
The European food and drug administration Efsa is infiltrated by the industry experimenting with gene plants. 
The group of experts Testbiotech which sees herself as an independent institute for the subsequent estimate of the biotechnology is formulating this reproach now. 
"It sounds like a conspiratorial theory but we have documented it well", said Testbiotech boss Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich. 
The head of the Efsa group of experts for plants, Harry Kuiper, changed genetically and another Efsa expert are Ilsi also at the lobbyist association under contract for years. 
This one is paid by groups like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer. 
Kuiper has collaborated in the Efsa test specifications for gene plants substantially and is in a clear conflict of interest with that, criticized for Then. 
The Efsa regulations are in paragraphs identical in word with position papers of the Ilsi and deceive the handwriting of the industry with that which shall be checked by the authority actually in the Italian Parma. 
It already is the second time that Testbiotech finds fault with an inter meal collision. 
So a high-profile Efsa manager is Syngenta without editions or transition period to the Swiss agrarian group recently, and has changed the sides with that. 
Also recently had personnel connections between checking EU authority and industry lobby reveals, what the department of the environment just like EU parliamentarian has made poorly soundproofed for Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR). 
The Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest meanwhile. 
One goes back back, also open such to all serious data it is called the industry in a statement as long as they are of high technical quality. 
One does not ask of the experts who work for Efsa that they do not have any contacts to the industry. 
However, you should disclose these. 
Kuiper grants his work to institute (Ilsi) in the USA for the International Life Sciences. 
This describes itself even as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things to the calculation of risk for biotechnology without lobby order. 
Independent experts like Then criticize in the thing that plants changed genetically are allowed without every feeding test with animals at present and the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested. 
"We want to know what maize changed for example genetically does on the field", says Then. 
It is a present practice to test isolated proteins but not the whole gene plant merely which does not provide any reliable results. 
"If one does not seek the risks, how shall one then find her?", Then asks accusingly. 
This also sees Angelika Hilbeck so. 
The scientist searches in the genetic engineering since 1994 and is at present active at the technical university Zurich. 
The industry tries to influence or to discredit scientists in this field like in the USA in Europe always more, critical now, too. 
There therefore are hardly any researchers who are not interwoven with groups. 
As a rule, critical studies would not be published for enterprises. 
"The industry checks the safety research", claims Hilbeck.
