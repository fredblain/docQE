More and more parents want man monitors to have the kids under control 
The worry about the children of one's own grows and more and more parents consider so to supervise her by GPS. 
The system which originally was invented for the search for cars can just as well locate to people namely, what would be helpful also in such cases like recently at the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anika Janatková without trace. 
At present, the device is approximately as big as a cigarette box but already soon it might not be bigger than a watch. 
The case has given many people to disappeared Anika in fear and frights and they think the lookout to means and ways to protect her children so better. 
Also for the price of an impairment of her privacy. 
Petr Pilin leads "we do our best to tell everyone that it is under no circumstances about snooping about but to reduce the probability around an effective means that it comes to the tragedy" of the society Macro because on, one of the suppliers of GPS locating units on the Czech market. 
"I admit that it can come to the abuse of such an equipment in the individual case for example if one tells it to somebody into the bag without him knowing but we did not have to record such a case till now." 
"Most customers really buy it for themselves for safety reasons", Pilin adds to. 
In his opinion, however, the child should always know which purpose the "box" serves and how one if necessary uses her. 
The child psychologist Dana Bocková points, however, that a child, if it does not like to carry such a thing, it simply rids itself of him. 
"Also very little children show a great creativity if it is all about to lose certain things deliberately, if they do not want to be checked." 
"Already at first great expectations woke the mobile telephones among the parents but let her switch themselves off just as easily like these new monitors", thinks Mrs Bocková. 
In your opinion is also controversial, whether such a facilities actually help in the case of an attack? 
"At planned kidnappings the kidnapper always checks practically, whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located to with it." 
"It is the mobile telephone today." 
"If such monitors were more broadly used, they also would look for these, since her sale would for certain be accompanied by heavy advertising." 
The criminals are " always ahead of the police the psychologist thinks a step ahead ", in these cases. 
You fills, however, that a similar equipment can absolutely be helpful at a sudden attack by a pedophile. 
Which offers locating services both for motorcars and for persons, the existence of such a device then can help, too if it is immediately after the attack destroyed according to Roberta Cech of the society RC monitoring. 
"The device can be adjusted namely so that it reports the respective position in certain intervals." 
"Even if it would be immediately destroyed the last position of the person concerned is at least available." 
"Even an inclinometer is integrated at a more expensive equipment, this means if one falls down and is left motionlessly the device immediately sends a warning under detail of the position ", Mr Cech claims. 
In his opinion similar services could carry out also intelligent mobile telephones with navigation, one needs to play in only a special software. 
The problem of the present locating units consists in the fact that either it is in matchbox size about equipment either which resembles pendants or around smaller mobile telephones. 
There is always the danger so that one loses her. 
One therefore tests equipment Mr Pilin of the Macro in the presence which looks like normal digital watches because according to. 
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognize at all, that it is a supervision or locating unit. 
"Or" he notices only after certain time what gives the police a time lead he adds. 
The same technology is no matter the development goes in which direction - to to bracelets or pendants, always used as in the case of the vehicle locating. 
Therefore around the combination from locating function with the help of the GPS system (just like at the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile telephone which reports the current position.
