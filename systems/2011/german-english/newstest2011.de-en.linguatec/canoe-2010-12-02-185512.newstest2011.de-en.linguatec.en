Reprimanded for Dupont partly 
The Quebecers' broadcast presenter Stéphane Dupont has one partial setback suffered in front of the Canadian supervisory board for broadcast norms (CCNR) because of his controversial remarks over social casework and Haitians just like because of his impertinent talk way over radio. 
The CCNR holds the opinion M. Dupont and his Choi 98.1 cbm team would have the right to an expression of opinion of one's own, would have certain remarks, though the Haitian as well as also such an unplaned talk way which is not adequate to the shipments broadcast during the day "contain" inaccurate information about the social casework and unauthorizedly negative representations 
The supervisory board also had end drawn a conclusion that the distribution of the names two persons contained which has committed suicide violates a discussion about suicide, this one, the codex of the programme transmission. 
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the shipments broadcast in the period of 2008 and 2010. 
This one became the first disposal front common the persons assistées because of a complaint " social you Quebec " inserted. 
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the shipment are inaccurate. 
The presenters should rather assign solidly as a misleading information. 
With regard to the suicide topic presenter Stéphane Dupont had held the opinion, the suicide is an expression of cowardice. 
The conclusion drawn, it is the switched embassy that suicide may not be considered as solution by personal crises, had the majority of the supervisory board members. 
"This one would have stationary results of the shipment Dupont Le the majority of the supervisory board taken into account, that " midi " touched on a sensitive topic in a suitable for families and suitable way." 
He was therefore covered with a no reproach opposite his person. 
Contentious issue concerned the statements which had referred to the earthquake in Haiti the last. 
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a mediagenic debate to himself regarding this, that a set of reactions has caused. 
The Choi presenter had professedly, not in favour of the Haiti help to have donated, since one would not know certainly whether the needy ones also really would get the donations. 
The supervisory board thinks that these comments of not improper character have been, that her cumulative effect presents an unauthorizedly negative representation of the Haitians, however. 
"I have already served my three-day suspension punishment in this thing." 
"My file has been virgin for one and a half years", explained the presenter. 
In all decisions the supervisory board denounces the distribution of an unplaned mode of expression. 
The Choi cbm of radio announcers has in any case acted "on the other side of his obligations". 
The consequences for the radio transmitter which among other things had once been supposed to inform about his decisions during the prime time within a period of three days are insignificant.
