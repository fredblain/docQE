Sports and rule detour 
Tricks like the one of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show ingenuity but not the will to avoid a sanction. 
The champions League was the reason that a lot of ink about this was spilled the putative of two players the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) instigated exclusion in the game of November 23rd against the Ajax in, you should the UEFA sanction whether it was around an unathletic action or not and whether perhaps two players of. 
As is generally known, the two players lost (her team had already won obviously) time a couple of minutes before playing and several fouls played, so that the arbitrator showed them the second yellow card. 
Real Madrid would lead his group this way and there, become the two players the specified sanction at the next league game against the fulfil Auxerre and get in without cards so into the next game phase. 
Finally punished the disciplinary commission the UEFA players involved the coach of the club, Jos√© Mourinho, with two games and these with different amounts of money. 
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, she has to be found rather frequently in the world of the football. 
She is so far common that she is part of the ethos - the rules which are unwritten but followed in this kind of sport. 
Part of the arisen debate around the represented case goes back that a team the football clubs Real Madrid (which in his hymn magnanimity and honour provides and on other occasions his players for similar occurrences had punished) played the leading role in and on the dramatization by Mourinho added an episode more to which for his long story as a theatrical and provocative technician has. 
In any case the debate turns, whether this behaviour not forbidden by the statutes particularly contradicts the principles of the sports, this is said, whether these actions represent a rule detour. However, this procedure actually observes the statutes of the sports seems to avoid the meaning. 
At this matter this one should sporting spirit caused damage examined be this. 
The sporting spirit defends the physical intactness of the opponents, an aspect which was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game. 
Another aspect of a clean game consists in avoiding that the offenders players an unjustified use move from the counter-team. This did not happen either. 
It is Real Madrid the paradoxes of the action of the players that she does not correspond to what we usually understand by wrong game or rule detour, because the avoidance of the rule was not performed secretly to avoid a sanction but she should be as striking as possible, so that she is punished by the arbitrator. 
The players waited and accepted for the sanction joyfully. 
Another question is, which kind of advantage the offenders pulled out of the deliberate fouls. 
Here the rival should be stressed that a more unfavourable position neither you took to nor advantages were commanded for the played game, because it was the obvious result of this action that the team of one's own had to play on with less players. 
It is not a useful strategy for the next game either because the club then does not have these players at its disposal. 
Obviously the advantage consists that the players start with the next game phase of the champions League without cards which could threaten her participation in a future game. 
But it is a long-term one up to a certain degree uncertain advantage, since, sometime, the team also could leave. In addition, the players get a sanction with this procedure and change into the second card cycle in which they leave because of card accumulation with a card fewer than in the first cycle. 
It is not so clear with that whether it is really an advantage. 
Go such procedures not against the sporting spirit at long last of which also strategic decisions are part to profit from the regulations greatest possible. 
In this case the players did not want to avoid a sanction (this actually would be a clear case of rule detour), they rather wanted to vote when they undergo this. 
You took a strategic decision without evading a punishment or escaping in front of her. 
Although the boundary between inventiveness and rule surroundings is blurred, I think that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness. 
I have the impression that the polemics have arisen because of two factors: Because it was all about two self exclusions and because of the way of the provoked rule assignment. 
The damage which was damaged to the principles of the sports by these actions is less more ethical than a rather aesthetic way.
