What shall she do, the CSSD? The Czech social democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor this one "café". 
The new councillors of the capital from the rows of the CSSD will have to overcome obviously certain language barriers to be able to understand her old new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague council and in the city representation at all. 
The newspaper Aktuálne.cz has "knocked" members of the new council off from the CSSD a little once as they master the notorious slang which has become naturalized within the last few years in which today's coalition partners were at the helm in Prague. 
The vocabulary coded, this one of mayor Pavel Bém was introduced by the Praguely political elite, is it borrowed for some of the most well-known protagonists, situations and affairs in the bygone era. 
Surprisingly, the new councils let themselves be seen that with respect to this one these new concepts grope in the dark a little. 
They claim this at least. 
"Who is Voldemort?" 
"No idea." 
"I am rather a newcomer in Prague politics", Lukás Kauck ý, the new councillor for culture, reacted on the test of the "godfather vocabulary". 
But also the councillor Karel Brezina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar manner. 
For example on the concept "putting-hole". 
"This is the only expression of the ones whom you present to me here which I use now and then." 
"I otherwise do not think much of slang." 
From the vocabulary which the daily newspaper Aktuálne.cz had published in this year's June before the election convention of the ODS the editorial staff picked six concepts, primarily such which is put through to the Prague municipal authorities notoriously. 
The concepts "Voldemort", "greatest Prague putting-hole", should "go to the café", "thick neck", "betrayal of the capital", and "flash" the social democrats define. 
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinerts, the future boss of the Prague school system - promised his participation in the conversation but first, did not pick the receiver up then, however. 
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, declined the test from the start. 
"I do not care about these things and as the middle-class democrats talk under each other, I do not judge it." 
He "is important to me how we get on in the context of our programmes", countered. 
As indicated already, Lukás Kauck ý would not have recognized allegedly in the headline mentioned above that the talk is from the influential businessman and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek. 
The concept "Voldemort" says Kaucky nothing at all and the only concept which he correctly guessed at the test was "the greatest Prague putting-hole". 
Kauck ý says "this is the tunnel Blanka", however, still added to safety reasons: "But I rather know this from the newspaper." 
And jocular: "I will have to take a language course well." 
The "putting-hole" then is not only decoded correctly by matador Karel Brezina but also by the councillor for enviromental issues Lukás Plach ý as a tunnel Blanka. 
However, both social democrats also know for whom the concept Voldemort stands and Lukás Plach ý suspects even, where this figure be found can and also through what means it "to go to the café"? 
"I think, this means to go into any Prague restaurant ", Plach ý is rather near to this at the puzzle's solution, if one knows that this is the seat of Janouseks companies. 
Agreing with Brezina, however, he declares rather to have created this knowledge from the newspaper in that this vocabulary would be characteristic of him. 
The test participants do not seem to give any slang naturalized similarly actually under the social democrats after to judge. 
"I also have asked my colleagues but obviously really does not give something like that with us." 
We we call us at the name, use contractions or nicknames now and then, too " ", the chairman of the Prague CSSD says to Petr Hulínský - called "Hulda" by his party members sloppily. 
"I was called Bríza (birch) in school but I do not know, Karel Brezina betrays his nickname to us whether my colleagues also call me so ". 
The newspaper Deník Aktuálne.cz has tried out the name and see there - he works. 
Councillor Weinert is friendly the "grandpa" or less kind of the "altos" for the party members, the representative Miroslav Poche who drew one's attention to himself by wheelings and dealings at the party sponsoring before the elections is called "Igrácek" (known Czech Lego figure) by some colleagues. 
Nicknames are the only thing so which in the inner-party useage the social democrats allow. 
Hulínský allegedly does not like it if one mentions him "to Hulda" but Deník Aktuálne.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman. 
His nickname "doctor of rubber truncheon laws" has to do allegedly with that, that Petr Hulínský has obtained his title Doctor jurist at the Bratislaver police academy.
