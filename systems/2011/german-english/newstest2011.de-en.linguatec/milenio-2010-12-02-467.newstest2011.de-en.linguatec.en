China keeps his aims upright to the reduction of the greenhouse gases 
The representative of China declared on the COP16 his country has made enormous efforts for the diminution of the carbon traces and it would maintain his offer to flag to 2020 40 to 45 per cent of his greenhouse gases. 
China keeps his offer to reduce the emission by 40 to 45 per cent from greenhouse gases up to the year 2020, insured for Su Wei, the representative of this country, on the COP16. 
Su Wei assured of the united nations (COP16) at his first public appearance at the 16th world climate summit, his country would have made enormous efforts for the reduction of the carbon traces and for the rearrangement of his industry. 
He executed, that his country has invested 245 million dollars within the last four years to reduce the issue of greenhouse gases. 
He, however, explained that China would not change his aims but would work on this matter together with the international community. 
He explained that the Chinese strategy subdivides herself into four aspects in the area of climate change: Dialog, construction of capacities, construction of institutions and assistance of pilot programmes. 
One has made progress in all aspects, he inclusively explained the adoption of a new energy law in the last year which contains the aims with regard to the reduction of the issue of gasses. 
On the other hand he stressed that the authorities of the federal states would have in China cooperated with those of the central state and the municipalities to accomplish the aims for the energy reduction, an effective use of the energy and the diminution of emissions. 
In addition, he executed, some plans of several years already have been tackled or locked, both those, these were financed by the Chinese government which monies got from other countries and such. 
He referred for the effective use of energy, to the programme, for example, which was introduced within the last five years and investments of the united nations (UNO), the government and from private hands had got. 
A project is it, a far for the exchange of the traditional light bulbs by energy reduction bulbs and a far one for the drop and customization, going on also onto province level to the climate change he declared. 
Martin Krol, scientific adviser to the government in the area of climate change in this country, confirmed that the efforts of China are far bigger than you would assume generally. 
He showed, that the per capita issue of greenhouse gases is six tons per person in China while it is 100 tons in the United States. China is responsible for a nine per cent complete contribution to pollution. 
It just makes unprecedented progress in the area of the energetic use. The energy effectiveness was increased by twenty per cent within the last five years and he explained a rest shall happen up to the year 2020.
