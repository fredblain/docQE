Two training aeroplanes L 159 for the first time in a strange hand - in Spain 
Two light fighter planes L 159 of altogether five the Czech Ministry of Defence has exchanged Casa C 295 m for the transport aircraft, has Seville flown to the Spanish town on Tuesday, this one, EADS settles where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa. 
It is the first time that machines of this type have been into possession of a strange army. 
They could be seen merely at manoeuvres or flight shows abroad till now. 
It is all about the airworthy two-seater version L 159 T1 which was operated by the Czech army. 
The other three aeroplanes are single-seater L 159. 
These stand one at present conserved still in the Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business, the company Omnipol has she taken on too much last week. 
When she dispatches the aeroplanes physically from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek is, not confessed according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence yet. 
In turn and this without further liabilities and investments got fighter plane L 159 the single-seater on the part of the department of the ministry out of aeroplanes stored in the long run picked out. 
"The double-seater L 159 became T1 exchanged in present condition and appearances", told Pejšek to the newspaper Právo. 
He added, the army will not have to get by without two-seater fighter planes, in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody a 200 million contract over the reorganisation of four superfluous L 159 to the two-seater version signed since the Ministry of Defence. 
A new aeroplane has taken the army in July, the second wants to take her by the end of this year. 
EADS has obliged herself according to Pejšek to succeed with the fighter planes into the equipment of one of the NATO countries. 
"It is specified in the contract frankly that the enterprise EADS buyer of the aeroplanes is L 159 and that these shall serve for the education of pilots of the NATO countries. 
"It is therefore thing of the buyer how he realizes the thing", cited Pejšek. 
The business paper (HN) had reported in days of yore that the Spanish government of none has the L 159 interest to. 
The barter of five l 159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of further aeroplanes for 3.5 billion crowns still had been approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year. 
The Ministry of Defence had not announced any tendering procedure for the purchase at that time but mentioned EADS directly. 
The defence office then argued this exchange will support the future export of the L 159 abroad. 
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which she uses only 24, she wanted to sell the rest. 
The purchase of the aeroplanes Casa also should by the way have a legal sequel. 
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence namely at the European court of justice. The reason? It would have had to select the aeroplanes due to a whole European advertising and not at all by appealing to one single manufacturer. 
The army has taken already three aeroplanes Casa, the last shall land at the airport Kbely within fourteen days.
