The government Berlusconi goes into cover in Italy 
After a beginning of the week worrying for Italy the situation has relaxed a little with the fall in the bank savings rates yesterday for 10 years. 
A return to the deceitful silence. 
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Trade and Commerce had the region chairmen Giulio Tremonti qualify the situation when "indecipherable" and him have heard calculating with an "unpredictable" weekend which the in question, however, immediately denied. 
Anyway the scissors would have achieved his record with the German interest rates of 210 base points and the prices of the contracts for the cover of the danger of bankruptcy are on 263 points risen, what a certain panickiness had caused in Rome on Tuesday. 
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his ministerial committee that the discrepancy of Spain amounts to 400 base points at the German interest rates. 
His right hand, Gianni Letta, had spoken from direction Ireland of the "market turbulences" and a possible risk of infection, however, when "got heavily". 
"The good news is that Italy, the third national economy of the euro zone, not as Greece or Ireland is." 
It "is the bad news that Italy like Portugal is", explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson institute. 
This in plain language means his problem is being able to cover the absence of economic growth and the control inputs which are accompanying with that and consumptive which take the state to danger his financial requirement no more. 
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government. 
In future, an Italian growth is expected from 1.1% in 2011 and from 1.4% in 2012...although the household budget being at the senate for the examination expects 1.3% or 2%. 
The EU commission calculates so, and 3.5% in 2012 ( instead of 2.7% the budget deficit will make up 4.3% of the GDP next year certainly (contrary to the one of the governments' predicted 3.9%) under these prerequisites).

R.) ", demanded pier watches Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD, than of other countries. 
The question about the political discontinuity remains. 
On December 14th Silvio Berlusconi is, because of which himself a motion of 'no confidence' of the representative chamber against overlooked this one elections could already preferred be organized at the end of March. 
So it a little convenient period stands for a decision making before with regard to a serious crisis.
