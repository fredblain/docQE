Nothing like away here 
In this evening it runs correctly around for the Irishmen finally again. 
No trace of grief. 
For this the home team dominates his guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much. 
The fans howl at with joy music, she more loudly stamp crashing with the feet. 
The Bailey pub in the south Irish Cork shakes because the players table tennis balls throw, and meet three metre distance about one into beer cups. 
"Bierpong" calls itself, the bizarre show to win there is 500 euros winning bonus for the Bierpong World Cups plus plane tickets to Las Vegas in January. 
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this does not really go together this shrill drinking game and the restrained computer scientist. 
And the 26-year-old tries himself anyway what will get the future amuse, turn himself away of the piercing question. 
On his plan game fun is not in Las Vegas, he will lead job interviews in New Zealand in January. 
"I have a rotten feeling", he says. 
"It is so far away from home and I do not have work yet there." 
After all: His friend already waits for him in Auckland - "she had in no time her wish job as an event manager, perhaps one good sign", the young man says and smiles. 
Having at home already two of Tanner's three brothers and sisters sought her luck because of bad prospects abroad. 
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin has a place as an IT adviser in London now. 
The boys go: As in the case of the Tanners it looks in many families on the island. 
experts of the economy and social research institute predict 100.000 Irishmen will well leave the country in the near future for ESRI in Dublin. 
They even count on 200.000 emigrants to 2015. 
For the little country with only 4.5 million inhabitants an intense loss. 
If the forecasts prove well-founded, it comes to an emigration wave comparably with that one which Ireland suffered from in the eighties. 
After a decade of the upswing which brought about a great prosperity for the Irishmen sadness spreads out now once more. 
The economic crisis makes primarily the Irishmen uncertain who are young and trained well for whom it only uphill was till now. 
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd within the boom years. 
Everybody was used, there was money in the abundance. 
There are three of ten women and men under thirty without work meanwhile, however. 
There are in throngs letters to the editor of young emigrants who complain in Irish Times: "Everything goes the brook down in Ireland." 
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - , however, who can, does a whole generation go away and our country lose." 
"The last one then turns off the light, please." 
Law female student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, sees a gloomy future pulling up because the government does only sham and offers young people no more future prospects. 
"You reduce the minimum wages but they do not have any strategy as new jobs shall be created", says the 20-year-old. 
She observes how her fellow students move themselves hand over hand from an unpaid traineeship to close to it. 
She says, it is your greatest worry to have to emigrate within four years. 
"This thought is sad and depressing." 
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the topic positively. 
The "WorkingAbroadExpo" organizes McLarnon, offers work a fair, these comprehensive services to the topic abroad. 
"The work is an excellent chance, the first steps to make career ladders to it open, for beginners abroad anyway", says the manager. 
Photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders on his web page in Canada. 
The message is clear: Is not a galley service but takes liberty and fun also abroad work. 
Se√°n O'Donovan has known to build something up somewhere else for half a year as it feels. 
Because there was nothing more to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is working with 15 Irish colleagues on the making in Germany now. 
They just pull up a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen. 
It goes on to Hanover or Berlin to the next project in January. 
Meanwhile, his native country only seldom sees O'Donovan because he makes extra shifts to be able to pay the loan for his house off at home. 
"The situation is already a bit crazy", he says when he kicks out over the threshold of his house at long time for the first time. 
"I earn money for a house in Germany in Ireland in which I am as good as never again." 
He laughs a little in embarrassment and goes by from chilled rooms. 
The little house is with neat front gardens, in a fine residential area into which entries park big, expensive cars. 
In common with a sister O'Donovan has the house in common four years ago for 380.000 euro bought - 100 per cent credit-financed ago. 
"These were crazy times, there was simple money without many questions ", he says. 
Is he afraid that it could go wrong with the loan? 
O'Donovan wonders a while pours out hot tea and says: "I do not have any children, I feed which must and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can begin once more." 
The civil engineer does not like lamenting, at present, he often hears this. 
Nobody can be hungry " - is not anyway by far as dramatically as in earlier times our situation here on the island ", he says. 
"Works a while abroad, this is not the worst which can happen, perhaps we feel through this only as Irishmen." 
He then laughs and tells stories of his father who has gone in the last great economic crisis to England. 
"After seven years he was there again and the life went in Ireland further, very simply." 
Cian Tanner likes this thought. 
Leaves the future open and simply looks, how it runs with the life somewhere else. 
One couple of years work in London does he already have behind himself, too and why should it not run also well in New Zealand for him and his friend? 
A thing which terribly worries him within these days still is there, however: The celebration for his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin. 
He is afraid that it could degenerate into a farewell party. 
"Merely not too many emotions", he says and drinks a large drink of his beer. 
"This sounds alarming farewell, anyway." 
"We prefer to call it a way going party quite loosely with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
