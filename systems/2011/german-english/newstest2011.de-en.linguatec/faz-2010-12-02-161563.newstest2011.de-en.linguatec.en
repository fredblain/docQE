The ice university 
Ice pastry-cooks are prepared for better seasons at the "Gelato University" near Bologna. 
The three-day elementary course for future Gelatieri has the biggest draw and visitors from the whole world. 
Where does the whole ice come from actually? 
Of the Gelatiere and of the Gelataio. 
The Gelatiere, in German something produce the cream ancient the ice pastry-cook, according to all rules of the Italian ice doer art. 
The Gelataio fetches one spatulas, the ice cream from the refrigerated display counter she paints into the waffle and she then sells. 
To know this one does not have to Anzola dell ' to drive Emilia in the province Bologna. 
But who to know more still over ice would like, this one does not pass the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani. 
The manufacturer of ice-cream machines has set up the ice university in the year 2003 so that the ice cream does justice to the high Italian ideals out of his machines everywhere. 
The three-day elementary course for future Gelatieri has the biggest draw and visitors from all the world. 
However, there are also several days of special courses around the chocolate ice-cream and traineeships in the ice-cream parlour of his own. 
Some dream in the midlife crisis of a new career others simply venture on the smooth ice of her vague longings. 
There are 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents of Brazil via Hungary to Saudi Arabia this time. 
Jacky, art-teacher from California, loves the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial intercity express train cream in future. 
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and wants to bag something own in a nerve-racking job after years. 
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice-cream parlour in Cairo. 
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in her bars, and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream. 
Maestro Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream next to the participants. 
Only good taste but also the silky suppleness is not decisive and consistency the good. 
However, Luciano does not forget the cream topping of the national and at all southern superstructure at his training either: "Italian Gelato is simply the best, and any amount is then still Romanticism." 
The first step towards the production seems very simple. 
Luciano dumps the basic ingredients milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and antiroll bars into a great mixer which heats everything up to 85 degrees and then immediately cools down on four degrees with an electronic programme. 
He then turns the machine a tap, and a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all milk ice cream types, comes out. 
The assistant professor is immediately bombarded with questions: Can one make ice cream only with natural substances without antiroll bar? 
How can one let the experimenting desire's of one's own free run? 
Luciano warns to have himself led astray of the Zeitgeist. 
Who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" has nevertheless used antiroll bars possibly - most natural product, approximately guar gum from the Guarbohne. 
Loud little ice pellets of course one can produce ice also without antiroll bar, it then must be sold within a day only, otherwise it sinks into himself together and the customer bites on. 
Certain variations at the matrix are permitted. 
It gets more thrilling with the flavours. 
For the taste in the ice maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients which one buys in the fruit department or at the sweets of the supermarket. 
Moreover, gives there are powder and pasta. 
"All the suppliers will try to palm dozens of aromatized additions off on you." 
"But simply you should experiment." 
At the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits either. 
Or just at the ice cream from the white matrix which becomes the yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder to the basis for all possible chocolate seductions. 
The students may to the ice-cream machines now. 
She lets Luciano produce four different types each of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice-cream with or without eggs in the matrix with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural additions. 
The fruit sundae types are also subjected to the same experiment. 
More flavors, more fruit purée, as regards taste this is not better absolutely. 
Hazelnut ice-cream does not taste nuttier absolutely if it contains more hazelnuts. 
The most popular kiwi ice restores the working group to health who uses more fruits, less water and a little less antiroll bar. 
A balanced mixture stresses the taste of a Gelato correctly first, says Luciano. 
Ice making is a sum: If peach purée is used with much sugar, the sugar amount must be reduced in the basic recipe. 
For lemon ice-cream an extra portion of sugar is necessary. 
Luciano draws a device out, with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit types (winegrowers measure the degrees Oechsle in the grape juice with that). 
Tables the calculation fortunately make easier. 
It requires physical use to make ice no longer as much as in the past. 
Not only the device for the automatic production of the matrix helps. 
There also is a device in which the ready ice mixture is beaten creamily and cooled on minus temperatures at the same time. 
Small breakdowns do not fail to appear Aller automation to this despite. 
The Brazilian Gustavo spills from above to below fruit purée over themselves and his course colleagues when the colossal staff blender turns out for him out of control. 
"Maestro Luciano thinks, in every course ", " it is only a question of time until something like that happens."
