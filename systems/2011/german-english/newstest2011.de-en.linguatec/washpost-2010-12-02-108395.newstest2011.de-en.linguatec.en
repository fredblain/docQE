White Russia agrees not further to accumulate uranium capable of bearing arms 
In a surprising victory for president Obama's campaign to the worldwide safeguarding of nuclear material the government of White Russia has announced on Wednesday that one will collect highly enriched uranium no more which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. 
The deal was announced to the Foreign Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton in an additional article of the safety summit in a common statement after a meeting with the Belorussian Foreign Secretary Sergei Martynov. 
For years, the U.S. government had tried to convince White Russia to collect no longer highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring. 
The U.S. government told the Washington post that two secret agreements with White Russia were reached within the last two months to remove 187 pounds of uranium capable of bearing arms from a Belorussian research institute official. 
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material, approximately 500 pounds, this one anonymously has left according to an official employee due to the sensibility of the topic. 
The agreement seems one of Obamas most important results "to nuclear safety summit of the 47 nations" to be of April which had excluded White Russia. 
And obviously it was good enough to safeguard the invitation of the former Soviet republic for the next summit in 2012. 
"I was really enthusiastic about the fact that want her a seat in the nuclear safety summit of 2012) (." 
"This proves me that it works", told a group to Ken Luongo, president of the partnership of global safety, for the promotion of the nuclear safety. 
Clinton mentioned the agreement "a very important, important step" of White Russia. 
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to safeguard all precarious nuclear material within four years. 
The U.S. government has helped six countries since then her highly enriched uranium to get loose. 
White Russia will be the seventh. 
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush. 
The Belorussian president has explained to Alexander Lukashenko in the time of Obama nuclear safety summit that the nation will never give up her uranium. 
"How hundreds keep highly enriched uranium - of kilo which basically is capable of bearing arms, Lukashenko said and less enriched uranium ", at that time. 
"This is our raw material ... 
We will not make any dirty bombs from this and we will sell it to nobody." 
White Russia approached nevertheless the USA few months ago when it reported interest in the meeting of an agreement. 
Attempt was particularly complicatedly the first say official to remove the uranium of White Russia in October because the material was contaminated by radiation easily. 
It got special train loaded, the more than 1.300 miles to one Russian factory for storage say official into one and disposal for. 
The second attempt was decided on on Monday and was carried out according to the official ones by aeroplane. 
The U.S. government pays $ 14 million for these efforts, in which a large part of the money flows in the Belorussian research with weakly enriched uranium which cannot be used for nuclear weapons. 
"This which led to the agreement which was signed by Clinton was coordinated and coordinated extremely carefully to build up confidence", said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the department of energy which works on the global danger reduction. 
James Martin Zentrum estimates this, that White Russia had at least 88 pounds of uranium capable of bearing arms this year as well as hundreds of uranium enriched pound highly for Nichtweiterzugebende studies. 
White Russia wants to dissolve his store according to the joint agreement to 2012. 
Harsh disdain of the human rights was hard, primarily the relations between White Russia and the USA because of Lukashenkos for years. 
But the statement of the Wednesday suggests a possible approach. 
An increased respect for the democracy and the human rights remains a central topic in the improvement in the bilateral relations in White Russia and it is essential for the progress of the country and his citizens " welcoming the progress of these global safety questions announce the United States of America and White Russia, that ", she declares.
