On the hunt for Wikileaks boss 
Obama appoints a high person responsible for the anti terrorism fight prevention of new uncoverings. 
Interpol distributes a red warning for the following and discovery from Assange. 
Everything which is connected with Wikileaks and whose founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts can be cleared up only difficult. 
Interpol distributed a "red warning" for the "discovery and following" of Assange yesterday. 
This is not a traditional order for the arrest, though. 
In addition, she is not new, she is of November 20th. 
Nothing also has to do with the last uncovering of over four millions diplomatic documents from the USA but you must face those of the Australians in Sweden with the accusations of a sexual abuse. 
Furthermore the advocate of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, insures " the police would know, where and how she can make contact with Mr Assange." 
The international police authorities distributed the order with seat in Lyon (France) on application of Sweden already on 20th but she was not announced until yesterday upon receipt of the authority by the Swedish authorities. 
So the things lie. The 188 interpol countries are instructed to identify and to find Assange "to arrest and deliver him for the time being" 
Although interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning many member countries regard the red warning as royal charter after saying the organisation for an arrest - this one must particularly be carried out by the national police, if they dispose how it the case of Sweden and England is of a bilateral delivery agreement, where Assange stays presumably. 
Assanges Anw√§lte filled with indignation proceeding, the gestures published a letter in which they informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference. 
You also remind that Assange applied for the departure from Sweden and the corresponding one received approval from the public prosecutor who is compared with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, chief safety officer of Stalin. 
"This is like a hunting, not like a legal following", is accused in the letter. 
While the world is looking for him, and his mother declares the innocence of her son from Australia, Assange holds on to an unknown place open, being not silent, though. 
On Monday he entered the head of the magazine time an interview by Skype from an uncertain place. He applied to the conversation for the resignation of the permanent secretary of the USA, Hillary Clinton. 
Can that she was responsible spy diplomats, UNO out more North American for the order and has violated international agreements signed by the USA with that " if be proved ", he said do she must step down. 
His opinion was sentenced yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the application for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd". 
He explained "I am not sure why we should attach importance to the opinion of a type with a web site" to the transmitter CNN. 
Obama himself has engaged a high person responsible for the anti terrorism fight, Russell inhabitant of Trave, to do the prevention of new document uncoverings. 
The attempt of the spokesman of the president Barack Obama to give Assange less attention conflicts with the opinions which announce conservative politicians and commentators within these days. 
The state department has asked the congressional representative Peter King who will lead the chairmanship in the national safety committee of the parliament as of January to examine the possibility of setting Wikileaks organisations on the list more terroristly " to confiscate around the monies and everybody, which supports her or makes a contribution to pursue " 
His statement Tom Flanagan, adviser of the Canadian president Stephen Harper, had gone still further and he must, Assange must "be murdered" revoked. 
"Obama should convert him to a target and use a not manned aeroplane or something like that." 
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency. 
Who it always was, too, this one let information leak out in the government and everything is " what no execution is, a too mild punishment is ", he guiltily of the betrayal he explained Fox to the transmitter.
