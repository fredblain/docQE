Climate: As France is a smooth talker his finance promises 
It is time a year according to the Copenhagen contract to examine the compliance with the financing promises (also called "almost start" or premature financings) solved fast which were carried out by the developing countries. 
And the rough French whitewashings are already uncovered. 
With the Copenhagen contract the developing countries have themselves obligedly to provide 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012. 
The EU has 7.2 billion euros over three years promised, France 1.26 billion euros, (i.e. 420 million per annum). 
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16 the EU has pulled all the stops to convince her partners of the fact of her engagement regarding the almost start financings: Procedure report of her member states, press conference, great side events, booklet distribution, true to detail. 
The operation transparency is remarkable and degrees valued for her real value: The countries developing and the civilian company would like to see it if all developed countries made the same on the same precision standard. 
The EU announces, released in 2010 2,2 billions euro to have got done what she sets on the right way to the admiration of her engagement of 7.2 billion in 2012. 
If one, however, looks into the detail, the things lie a little more complicatedly. 
This money should be "new and additional" according to the Copenhagen contract to ensure that an additional use was brought in without doing the public foreign aid the disadvantage. 
Unfortunately, there is no agreement about what "newly and in addition" means. 
Having certain member states, among this France which blocks methods, while the EU commission had suggested a harmonization. 
Everybody chooses the reference value today which he considers when at the best. 
The EU commission has herself for the one of the year 2009 as a reference value chosenly, for example: The international financings will keep and "almost start" over three gives in the context of the financing 150 million for years to this. 
Other countries have similar reference values, elected either with regard to year or regarding conditions on level of the public foreign aid. 
France thought in return to it "newly and in addition" the financings of "all new projects" of the year are 2010. 
Expressed differently: There are no reference values at the versions of the year gone in front or at a global level of the public foreign aid. 
Said concrete the grand total of the French support of the developing countries can remain stable (or also decrease) - France pretends to observe his obligation with regard to the "new and additional" financings. 
Another, decisive element is the itemized breakdown in donations and loans. 
About this there is no rule yet and everybody chooses his computing mode. 
Some, such as France, are lent € 1 as equivalent with donated € 1. 
Obviously this is only heavily acceptable: The effort is not comparable. 
If the use can be justified by loans for certain profitable investments (often projects bound to the issue checking which are based on the most effective technology), it is deceitful to present the euro which one takes as an equivalent for a donated euro... Moreover, only the costs of the loan for the capital owner country as engagement should be imputed, (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate). 
But France has nothing according to consideration following as this one differently: It "respects" his obligation of 420 million euros by convince oneself of it around himself) it 91.5% loans (389,8 millions euro takes and % donates to 8.5 ) 36,1 millions euros), see the EU document also. 
France is the only one the EU land, that loan starts in large measure. 
Germany demands 46% the Netherlands during Denmark or (among other things) Slovakia follow her obligations to 100% with donations. 
If the vast majority of the European Union spends € 1 for the fulfilment of her obligations, France gives 10 cents just once and understands a comparable use by it differently, said. 
Beautiful hey presto! 
France all in all operates in his almost start financing with a double dizziness: To a part with a further development of the action over the time and on the other hand part with the reality of financial use. 
It is France successful to let think that it has distributed 420 million of "new and additional" millions in agreement with his promises and saves 36.1 million euros. 
This one seems that it was Bercy, (the manipulation the Treasury since it well the arbitrage has carried out), one could draw twice negative effect after himself; the other member states continue once EU internal (why, if with donating it suffices to lend anyway)?and then in the negotiations, since be able to not to deceive the countries developing completely ... 
The chapter of the premature financings only a small question until relatively short time in comparison with the totality to discussions about the climate. 
But the drop could be too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC. 
We hope that this will not be the case. 
Like this also, always is, it is indispensable to learn his lesson from this first year of premature financings. 
France could primarily announce a change in his booking way for the years 2011 and 2012 and to be more precise in spirit of the respect for his obligations and the compensating justice with the other countries of the European Union. 
France could primarily bring about the discussions about the matter in controversy of the long-term financings forwards, however, (another, decisive and short-term discussed topic:) One does not escape from the question of the "chargeability" or the booking type of his loans. 
France could change his position to be just as progressive with regard to the points at issue how it is this at other things. 
So the hope is based on the new minister of the environment Kosciusko-Morizet who will arrive in Cancun next week. 
A surprising announcement over the almost start of France and his vision of the "chargeability" as well as the use of loans would raise the international basis of trust from nature which is necessary for secondary discussions.
