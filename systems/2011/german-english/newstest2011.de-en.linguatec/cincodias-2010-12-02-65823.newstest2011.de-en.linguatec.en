The chairman of the executive board of owls contest the general meeting of Vega Sicilia on application of his children 
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, owner of the societies owls and El Enebro, does not drop. 
David Álvarez, founder of the consortium, will contest the general meeting of El Enebro which will take place on application of five of his seven children on 16th, since he regards her as "absolutely trivial". His children will try to get a majority to check the administrative bodies of the company - owner of the wine-growing estate Bodega Vega Sicilia. 
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new justice chapter in her quarrel about control of a part of the consortium. 
For enterprise services the founder of the greatest does not seem ready to be, in his lawsuit holdings to give in control of the organs of El Enebro. 
He was expelled from the administrative board of five of his seven children. These appointed themselves on the shareholders' meeting of January 18th this year which is already listed in the register of companies as contested to members of the administrative board. 
The general meeting of El Enebro which was called by the judge of the commercial court Nummer 2 of Madrid for the 16th has triggered a new thunderclap in the lap of the family Álvarez. 
The appeal to the judge to the setting of the meeting is the only legal way which ensures the convention of the general meeting. 
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is of David Álvarez a desperate means of the applicants - his five children - paid, around by means of legal over-subtlenesses, deceitful to let wheelings and dealings and abuse of the law appreciate the meeting declared trivial of January 18th ", declare how official speakers as one ". 
This argumentation is the basis for the contestation of the meeting afterwards to declare her "absolutely trivial". 
The same protagonists who remain silent tried already without success in June to call a meeting on a judicial way. 
Children sift 100 per cent of the capital at El Enebro - fortune company and owner of Bodega Vega Sicilia besides other assets - check David Álvarez '. 
The founder of the service performance group, however, demands the usufruct according to the family protocols more than 51% of the capital. 
This is the real background of the thing about that one of the judges in the hearing for the treatment of the action for the invalidation for which no date was fixed yet, to decide has.
