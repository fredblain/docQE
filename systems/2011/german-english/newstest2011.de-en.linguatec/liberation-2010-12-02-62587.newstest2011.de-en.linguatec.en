Métro grand Paris: First financial outlines 
Since the debate is in full swing around the modernization of the traffic economy on the Ile-de France, it rains billions. 
At least in the discussions. 
One calls himself particularly the 23 billion for the metro grand Paris in memory, the one of the Société you grand Paris shall be built. 
To arrange the start of building of the SGP, the state has exclaimed a capital donation of 4 billion euros. 
This is the sum in the theoretical scheme which would make it possible for the SGP thereupon to award a part of the finance sum to double to hers on the markets. 
Today, it finally has come to first projections. 
The addition household of 2010 contains the scheduled measures to find the first part of these monies, had a look by the finance commission of the National Assembly this morning. 
This is two lei measures: The creation of a special tax for the opening up and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France. 
You one takes article 15 of the law outline, goes the former, " in favour of the institution under public law, Société, grand Paris " so. 
This is figured: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per annum". 
A reorganization of the enterprise taxation already existing is second: increase you by the product arising from her to modernize these " and this rise of the Société grand Paris to over-answers ". 
How much would this bring in? 
A puzzle. 
This sum is not estimated in the text. 
One is far away the 4 billion. 
It is executed that the tax resources are added to the capital donation to the 4 billion euros " this one be found by the state and the Société little by little is done to grand Paris for the project ", you have to be gathered from the explanatory exposition so. 
One does not find this system offensive at the SGP at all. 
"One can cover more than three years for a long time and then create only from the 4 billion the project planning since the moment at which one credits takings (the two taxes, d. R.)", is explained so. 
"This is noted down and removed little by little in the budget". 
The SGP estimates, that it will be started with in 2013 to note down the 4 billion for the budget 2014. 
This measure one still will be able look for the 4 promised billion for a long time, runs the risk of causing a quite busy, parliamentary discussion. 
The first public meeting takes place on December 7th.
