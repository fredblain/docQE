The national air and space authority (NASA) of the United States announces an astro-biological discovery tomorrow Thursday which could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life. 
The find is introduced to NASA in Washington of experts of astrobiology at a press conference in the seat tomorrow at 13.00 clock. It is this one the origin the development it a science, the distribution and the future of lives in the universe examined.

The microbe puts the arsenic as an over-life resource into any way. The chances increase, that under consideration of this ability there could be similar life on other planets which does not have our protective atmosphere. 
If these organisms metabolise the arsenic, it is proved in accordance with astrobiologies, that " actual another life-form, a second life-form which is different from the known one to us gives " 
The space agency announces the actual reach of her find at the press conference tomorrow on Thursday.
