Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum is beer outly, it simply seems too slow 
Fernet, rum and vodka, for once also one good whisky which one has stolen the father from the home bar. 
These are the drinks after whose pleasure drunken Czech teenagers under fifteen must be most frequently need treated. 
Children who must sleep off her hangover repeated in the hospital are not an exception. 
This results from the experiences of doctors which are confronted with similar cases in the photo of the children's departments of clinical complexes. 
"Beer or wine is complete out of fashion because it simply lasts too long until one is drunk." 
"Today's trend is obviously hard alcohol", said Právo Ludek Pelikán, the senior consultant of the children's department in the central bohemian clinic Horovice. 
"Father steals a bottle from the home bar whisky, if it turns out well, this, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka. 
Vodka has " he then does not smell the advantage so strongly that one can mix him with Juice ", the senior consultant explains. 
The spokeswoman of the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him properly. 
"It most frequently is all about Fernet or rum." 
"This is today's alcohol trend, by name to primary schools." 
"Felt" occasional also around slivovitz which one takes along from home, Mrs Jurinová led. 
According to senior consultant Pelikán thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers are not an exception in the admission to a hospital already. 
For ten years, in front of the clinic he was the hospital Motol in the paediatrics department in Horovice on which he has worked since this year active, where the ambulances handed in inebriated pupils from far and wide. 
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times." 
"She started with your career with 12 years when she was delivered to combination with "ecstasy" the first time with 3.5 alcohol levels of alcohol in the blood and still to this", the doctor described a particularly difficult case. 
"She was in the exhibition grounds in Holesovice on any dance party." 
"The interesting did that it did not seem strange to her mother at all, the senior consultant is surprised that her daughter did not come home for 48 hours ". 
Definitely the missing interest of the parents or its unbelievable tolerance when clinking glasses with the offspring of one's own is regarded as one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism of children. 
About a real dependence in the true sense of the word it is not according to experts with children. 
"Under alcoholism it is a long-standing chronic dependence of the alcohol to understand phenomenon with all thus coherent ones and this is not the case with these children." 
At the ones who enjoys alcohol repeated a negative family social background is ", characteristic mostly senior consultant Pelikán explains. 
According to the spokeswoman of the hospital Motol, Mrs Jurinová November was introduced to the local department of children and youth medicine about forty drunken children by middle. 
However only the cases with a heavy alcoholic poisoning which required a stay in hospital have influence on the statistics. 
Drunken children who are taken after outpatient treatment of the parents or if necessary of the police home are not registered. 
There are in opinion of Mr Pelikán three seasonal amplitudes on which relying one hundred per cent is apart from the cases in which children only finish such a bottle of schnapps in the school desk: Walpurgis Night, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year. 
"The last-named for two reasons either out of sorrow because of the bad testimonial or out of joy until the holidays." 
"I have already experienced seven drunken children in the photo" in the Walpurgis Night suddenly, too, emphasizes Doctor Pelikán. 
It is turn of a drunken child who spends the night under a medical supervision paradoxically better than a child who only has to fight with an unpleasant hangover the next day. 
One can sell the headaches in the morning after that namely which are due to the dehydrogenation and due to the glucose defect with a liquid donating infusion with glucose and nutrients which the organism lacks in the hospital. 
"You it is obviously better because wake after the "marvellous" experience in the evening, her up with a good mood without something being aching someplace." 
"You are only a little confused about it where they are", Doctor Pelikán fills, in which he spoils the patients' good mood through this at least from time to time by listing the costs for them which she will cost the treatment. 
One because the transport with the ambulance and the night in an acute bed like to come well on couple of umpteen one thousand crowns. 
"I have used this as an education means now and then which, if I have reckoned up for the children directly at the visit, her drunkenness has cost Doctor Pelikán added and money earn around which for one single such party that it can absolutely that they must work over all the holidays happen ". 
Gripping the health insurance companies however not according to recourse methods in his opinion, calling in the inebriated children's necessary costs of the parents around which for the cure.
