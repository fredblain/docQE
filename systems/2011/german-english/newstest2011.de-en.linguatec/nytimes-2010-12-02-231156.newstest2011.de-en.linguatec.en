Cheshire vocation draws one's attention on twitter attentively 
Half a dozen typed himself of them in the riots in the courtroom away. 
Her reports on horrible testimonies sent her out about twitter in the minute interval. 
Gave this end, so the defence more than 140.000 twittering reports to over the process around rape and children bound to beds in a house which went up in flames. 
On Thursday the process pursued attentively will find an official end of Steven J. Hayes which was accused to have three members killed a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, if the judgement falls about the death sentence which has said the jury. 
Applications already have Mr. Hayes Anwälte submitted to court, which explain reasons for a vocation and which will employ the courts until years. 
This one is one of the most provocative reasons that by average reporters - has come to a "circus atmosphere" and such a far common, immediate penetration of rabble-rousing details so that the jury has been influenced by the public indignation in an inadmissible way - it twitter of also by the extensive use - by the intensive reporting about the process. 
This objection could induce the appellation courts to deal with the question, whether the new technologies let new rules become necessary in the courtroom. 
"I have experienced it like me during this process, think that it is really a danger, Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes Hauptverteidiger, said if the move of the new technologies influences the right of every individual to a fair process into the courtroom ". 
The chairman judge, Jon C. Blue of the colonel Supreme Court, rejected the applications by decision laconically last week when he said that the new media would be "carefully checked", and that there would be no proof of it, that the jury has been driven of passions. 
But this was not the last word in this thing certainly yet. 
For decades court objections have noticed that the reporting lets doubt about the fairness of a process arise about famous notorious cases. 
In his historical decision of 1966 the supreme court of justice of the United States has the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who shall have killed his wife, lifted, and said in his decision that there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media. 
Some think that the television series and the feature film is based on this crime "on the flight". 
Some lawyers say court objections, which Mr. look at Hayes Verurteilung half a century later, could around the communication channels from the courtroom follow the argument that new rules have become necessary, these in the time of the case Dr. Sheppard were still inconceivable to regulate. 
"There is a good reason to be worried about the influence of the new media in processes which are pursued by a broad public", said John J. Donohue III, professor at the Stanford Law School who has examined the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report she is imposed arbitrarily. 
Professor Donohue said some appellation courts could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of an immediate communication out of the courtroom could make trials fairer. 
Only one is the twittering matter of many which explain the lawyers of Mr. to Hayes to discuss for years and one therefore delay Verurteilung. 
The defenders also claim for example that Mr. Hayes could already have been in front of sentenced when judge had not permitted them Blue to test the reactions of potential jurors, by one showing them horrible scene of the crime photos during the juror choice. 
Some of the jurors have said, photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and her daughter, Hayley, 17 years and Michaela would have fulfilled her with disgust for 11 years. 
The defenders say they also would question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution and argue that the judge has exchanged a juror wrongly which has been a critic of the public prosecutor's office and that he would more inadmissibly have performed way pressure on the verdict when he had taken the not usual decision to put the jury freely over the weekend. 
The jurors were not isolated. 
But perhaps the greatest interest draws her arguments about the influence of the detailed reporting about the process on itself. 
Has this one submitted her in a verdict contestation last month, stated her that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and lasting the election campaign was discussed by the candidates for the office of the governor and for the American senate. 
You argued that the new media would have kindled the flames of the emotions about the case continuously newly. 
"The lawyers wrote, ", " such a daily crowd the medium bleepers cameras and reporter outside the courtroom one has not experienced even nationwidely in New Haven and perhaps before yet yet." 
Your main emphasis on the reporting through twitter is controversial. 
In interviews some journalists said that the assertion this direct news is more seditious than reports which is reported more slowly, a technophobic look, is this one the reporting becomes impoverished about future processes. 
But some lawyers said appellation courts would be often confronted with the argument, social and technical changes bedürften of the adaptation by the courts. 
Mr. Hayers lawyers make this assertion grow. 
In her objection they referred, in which to the decision of the colonel court of justice of 1966 the Verurteilung of Dr. Sheppard was lifted due to the reporting and made clear, that the new media require new rules. 
"They wrote, ", " so this case Sheppard performs official duties toward Maxwell of the 21st century."
