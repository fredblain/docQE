Before the beginning of the introduction meeting in the 60th legislative period cursed for Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo against the reform of the organ law, since they would be excluded by it. 
With this reform they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because these would be two persons, the same number as parties which checked the convention, now. 
These four representatives together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the committee led by the pianist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cardenas Fonseca in his quality as an acting chairman. 
Corvera Quevedo explained that the parties PRI and pan would have introduced her political edge position institutionally with these reforms. 
He executed, that they would talk to the representatives of pan and PRI within the next days to change the scheme. The opposition coalition they started out from the political will and, if they did not have this one, they would be subjugated by the two parties again, with what an end would be set.

Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained there would be agreements with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed. 
It can not be allowed, he continued that the convention, after he was monopolistic, shall be "duopolistic" now. 
"It is not the spirit of the law reform that in the convention an eternal two-party system shall be." 
"For the beginning this group starts with five representatives and they talk to further colleagues so that they get more", explained the Convergencia member. 
The PT executed Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of, that in allusion to pan and PRI the convention has converted himself to 'spoils' for two at present. 
"It was only a party before, they are sharing these in a twosome open now." 
Patrón Montalvo applied to respect the representatives and to assign her place to them at the negotiating tables. 
"It you may not let go in front on the outside due to top decisions five which probably will be nine representatives. The five have decided to unite to take our seat at the negotiating table, this one felt at present split up than in different parliamentary groups be, we have with reform which was carried out and arranged by the others stayed outside and we are not agreeable to this reform because due to he."
