A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the stove - nevertheless pays higher rent 
An older stocky man just leaves the client centre of the society RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakala, the tallest private owner of rented flats in Czechia. 
Under the arm a briefcase with three new leases to three flats: For the own one and the flats of his daughters and his son who just serves a prison sentence. 
All three just became increases the rent in the context of the so-called "deregulation". 
The son shall pay 4100 crowns instead of of 3500 crowns monthly rent for a 2 room flat with kitchen of the second category next year. 
"And" there is not fluently warm water in the flat and one must heat in a simple coal stove there he guesses annoyedly the new lease of the son to whose signing he has a power with the finger. 
I have signed " but what - ", he explains half disgruntledly and half resigns. 
The citizen union BytyOKD.cz which described the new letting conditions as "incorrect and immoral" advises the tenants not to sign simply and to service until December 7th on which she intends to publish instructions the new contracts as one proceeds against such contracts. 
But the man only puts off. 
One says " ", this, the different one this he makes a dark face. 
The region Ostrava becomes the large "deregulation laboratory" so. 
After New Year this deregulation is still to come in Czechia for most rented flats whose tenants do not pay rent in conformity with the market till now. 
Aktuálne.cz decided therefore to go to this "laboratory" personally. 
The RPG waiting room in Havírov is breaking for one of four in the region Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday full. 
The bodygards of a safety agency stand and at her a call device just next to the door. 
"2011 rents", a special feeling field shines on the touch screen so. 
Tapped briefly and the device already spits a number piece of paper out. 
We have hardly decoded the number "157" and she already cheeps on the big display at the ceiling of the waiting room. 
Half a second later it is his turn. 
An older married couple enters the waiting room a little later to ask for the rent but the rush in the waiting room is not apparently for the new rent at all. 
Repair applications, insurance matters are here most people to solve the usual problems - and similar. 
As of the middle of November flutter the envelope with the new leases most tenants of the altogether 44.000 flats of the portfolio in the region Ostrava the RPG into the post-boxes. 
The RPG Byty suggests them a rent increase of approx. 15 to 38 per cent in the letters. 
The special switch for the new rents in the client centre is opened since November 18th. 
"The action is going on a little over a week, this means this is first the beginning " the "client" turns out, the ladies answer hesitation behind the counter after a moment, to be a journalist as himself. 
Former miner flats are an explosive topic the deregulation and Bakalas. 
In front of the elections, the parliament vice-president Lubomír Zaorálek being from Ostrava of the CSSD had taken up this topic rather at the top of the voice, no wonder that the newspapers are full of it today. 
"For twenty years I want a new floor of them." 
"She no could not replace certificate toilet glasses", the man mentioned at the beginning gives vent to himself. 
Up till now pensioners queue according to the employees primarily at the switch to convince oneself, whether they really receive the promised renting reduction which promises them RPG, if they sign the special supply on time. 
February rent reduced one in the pleasure half being supposed to the other tenants also come, this one sign the new lease until December 15th. 
Up till now "deregulation switch" is all other things than overtaxed by demands in Havírov, however. 
"About 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 only were from the yesterday's 360 clients because of here", appreciate the counter clerks. 
RPG offers, and blackboards individual rental agreements both on her web pages, where it seems necessary. 
If the tenant and families, however, should not agree on the new rent, she is fixed by an independent court. 
This "shall not be a threat but is understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure", explains RPG on his web pages. 
"Nobody goes here in front of court", partly one of the employees of RPG Byty thinks and a man on the street in front of the client centre gives her at least properly. 
"I have 13.000 ( crowns pension), I have 5.000 left for the meal of this, where I should get the money for a court quarrel ", he thinks. 
The employee then gets insecure anyway. 
We'll see. 
"Mr Zaorálek tells their attention they shall not sign and people still wait for so over the media", draws to her. 
The regulated rent ends in the largest portion of Czechia at New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty the rent increase is an economic necessity. 
The existing amount of the rents "does not" suffice for the maintenance of the living fund the neglect criticized by the outraged tenants of the flat fund is just the main reason for the rent increase in opinion of the house-owners and - , argued for Pavel Klimeš, the director of the flat portfolio of the society RPG Byty. 
Being supposed to it be 5.2 billion within the four years from 2011 to 2014 while RPG could invest four billion in the flats from the earned rents within the years between 2005 and 2010. 
Some couple of red shining information appears on the large-sized LCD display at the ceiling opposite the armchairs in the waiting room of Havírov in between times again and again. 
"The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31 200 flats, this is called more than 90% of the flats of RPG." 
"This always means not more than CZK 7.50 per square metre and month", has to be read on the LCD monitor. 
Only for 400 flats from the portfolio of RPG the rent increases by 38 per cent. 
"It is all about the rise of extremely low rents from 19,66 CZK per square metre in these cases", argues RPG. 
The rent stays with 2600 flats next year on the same level. 
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not drive the rents by leaps and bounds in the height but is gradually carried out within four and eight years. 
The enterprise imposes another obligation on himself what more - : The enterprise wants to invest all takings from the rent increase (see diagram) in the flats primarily in warmth savings into new windows and into the insulation again. 
But these shall as a matter of priority people be of benefit to the ones, this one sign the agreements on the rent increase.
