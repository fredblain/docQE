Public prosecutor will not accuse senator Ensign 
Public prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have acquitted senator John Ensign of the accusations, these to his Affaire with a former election campaign helper and his attempt to provide her husband with a lobbying of members of parliament were lifted up against him, announced the advocates of the senator on Wednesday. 
This decision concludes the most difficult on the right reproach against senator Ensign, the republican from Nevada. Which nationwidely headlines provided and a silencer gave to his career, he was regarded as a possible candidate for the presidency of the republicans for 2012 until the scandal. 
As senator Ensigns announced office, he was "highly pleased" with the verdict after the one-year examination. 
The ethic committee of the senate still could, however, impose a punishment. 
According to statement of Ensigns advocates they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the examinations were stopped against senator Ensign and that in this matter no further charges are available. 
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case. 
The verdict was a surprise for many ethic advocates outside the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion there was an adequate proof that Ensign has disregarded the lobbying ban. 
Interviews, e-mails and other documents which was disclosed in the New York Times for the first time in October 2009, admitted reason for the assumption that helped Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his polling officers, to get lucrative orders to pay for his silence about an Affaire with Hampton's wife Cynthia. 
Cynthia Hampton was workingly as treasurer Ensigns during an election campaign. 
Ensign made contact to some political friends to provide Hampton with work. According to the documents and interrogations he took on lobby work for her after Hampton's employment. 
Since Hampton recently still was in Ensigns election team was he was not allowed to take on lobby work for his former employer or the entire senate for one year. 
According to the statement of ethic experts the unusual agreement violated between Ensign and Hampton who were close against the so-called ban on the revolving door lobbycracy in front of the Affaire. 
In accordance with the published circumstantial evidence "it is an arrangement and the violation of the revolving door statutes by all appearance", so Stanley Brand, a Washington advocate which has specialized in the defence of clients who are in the visor of the government. 
The reasons for the decision in the Ensign case public prosecutor which was pursued by the media with great interest, told Mr. Brand and other ethic advocates the ministry seemed very carefully in taking political charges after a variety of defeats, including the decision last year announce Stevens because of misconduct the fall while the Ministry of Justice said no officially, the charges against the former senator Ted, on the part of to drop. 
Melanie Sloan, the chairwoman of the union, told obviously public prosecutors are "easily startled" (to "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" an organisation, her aim the fighting corruption is the USA in parliament and governmental circles this one), a group of lawyers which has brought different charges against Mr. Ensign ahead of court. 
"In principle, this means that government officials of high standing can assume now, she added that the laws do not apply to her ". 
Paul Coggins, leader for the defence of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview he had a telephone call of a public prosecutor got and another day next the on Monday in which that the ministry will not take any proceedings against his client was informed about him. 
Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with the public prosecutors to convince her that the senator has "sold the law in agreement" as his office repeated in an explanation on Wednesday once more. 
Mr. Coggins declined to explain the legal arguments more exactly which he had put forward opposite the public prosecutors. 
"I am not into the bargain well to go into the conversation details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much is said: We think to have taken the right decision ", he said. 
The federal electoral commission has decided to stop the inquiries because of a separate complaint last month by the ethic group after which the Hampton has expelled a payment of $ 96,000 from Mr. Ensigns parents against the federal electoral act. 
The electoral commission said there has not been enough proof that something else than a present has been the money. 
The long time supported the senator, NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign was. 
An e-mail from December 2008 covered, that, when lobbyist has advanced, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a discussion had with Mr. Hampton in which he informed him that he "knocks" for the Home Office because of a thing after the company Mr. Hampton. 
Mr. Ensign in addition had an appointment with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to agree on a meeting in the name of the airline company, after Hampton had taken on this Mr. for the purpose of lobby work. 
When information about this affair penetrated into the public last year for the first time, Mr. Ensign excuses himself with his electors and his position gave up in the senate, where he had been at fourth place in the ranking of the republicans. 
After he had not stood out many months any more Mr. Ensign told reporters, two weeks ago which strives in the senate for a third period of office stories. 
His press agent, Jennifer Cooper who hopes for senator, explained that the ethic commission follows the example of the Ministry of Justice and very fast stops his inquiries in the announcement, that Mr. Ensign no more be the aim of police investigations. 
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada", she said.
