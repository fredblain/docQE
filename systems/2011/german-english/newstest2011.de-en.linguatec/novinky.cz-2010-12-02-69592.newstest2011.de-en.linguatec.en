American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon". 
The American troops have for the first time used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan which is well-known to XM 25 only under her code term till now. 
In her favour balance of power moves to the conflict there with the Taliban influenced and this hope for the generals that this new automatic weapon. 
Something like that, like a super exact cannon, is the new weapon. 
Your projectiles are steered by only some few metres namely by lasers with an accuracy in the aim. 
The special projectiles of calibre of 25 mm which were developed and contain a highly explosive explosive for this gun work practically like little shells. 
The projectiles can be programmed so that they cannot only explode at the impact on the aim but at an arbitrary point of her ballistic flight path. 
This means one can use her against an enemy behind an obstacle - a wall this one or himself hides in the trench. 
From above he is so rain of steel splinters of above usually cannot easily set him protectedly, the dreadful one namely out of action. 
Which participated in the development of the XM 25, the new fight gun is the first infantry weapon which makes use of "intelligent" technologies according to Richard Audett. 
"The soldier proceeds basically so: He envisages the aim and sends out a laser beam, which determines the distance, does he win an exact visor point so after which he corrects the rise angle, then needs to squeeze he only. 
"We say one has measured 543 m." 
"If one pulls the trigger, the weapon becomes charged one, two or three metres and the projectile shits on the distance 543 metres plus minus.
