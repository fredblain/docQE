The F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens speaks Bull wins in 
The cars are improved with a software in real time. 
Talk since Bull 2004 penetrated into the world of the formula 1, her story in this exquisite universe of the speed of surprises and successes is marked. 
At first nobody gave the newcomer attention and despite his steeply ascending career during the last seasons everyone set at the final spurt in last November on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso. 
Without wanting to reduce the abilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the high performance of the engine of Renault the "secret weapon" is, this one talk the multinational Siemens Bull put in her hands and a winner team created with that, become a legend. 
In reality is an efficient software for the simulation from processes which the German enterprise put 2007 on the market for purposes which do not have to do with motor racings. 
This computer science programme described as a PLM was used for the development of assembly chains in factories at the whole world, energy works and high-precision instruments. 
Aimed there is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before this is actually built to avoid faults and superfluous costs so. 
PLM has made the development of the cameras of Canon, the aeroplanes of Sukhoi and the most famous commercial vehicles of Nissan easier. 
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industry department of Siemens, professed, talk that, "within few hours, almost in real time", Bull can factory - with the use of this software in the formula 1 design and execute the changes and improvements which is established on the runnings and at the tests. 
Russwurm takes out, that on an average ten technicians who could introduce not more than three or four improvements in a season worked in the racing stables in 1992. 
Talk into 180 highly qualified young people are busily Bulls team today. They would drive analyses and all possible changes with efficient EDP equipments through to the racing car. 
The Siemens manager explained the PLM software is able of talk analyse and improve Bull with the exception of the engine for which responsible to exclusively Renault explains oneself, all components of the racing cars. 
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are changed. 
The changes can be transferred thanks to progressive production plants and high tech autoclaves within some as 24 hours of the virtual reality of the simulator into the reality. 
The 40 million dollars, the one formula 1, are the only limit which is set to this crazy technical perfectionism - race may distribute team for his in a season. 
Talks Bull has built up his high tech factory for the development and production of his racing cars in a place 50 kilometres remote from London. 
It is two buildings in which visits are localized strongly particularly of journalists. 
Everything which happens there is top Secret. 
The staff embraces 580 persons including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber. 
But talk a true formula 1 Bulls - hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell. 
Behind the enormous technological resources put that one of the Energy drink manufacturers into the services of his participation on the racetracks, further protagonists hide, zero is the support incalculable and the fame at once. 
The technological the work, Steve Nevey, emphatic, one, that one still could say five years ago, that the progress contributed to the victory for racing cars with 50 per cent in the area of F & E and the pilots were responsible for the rest. 
The share values have changed today. The technology makes up 85 per cent of the success while the contribution of the pilots is valued at 15 per cent. 
Nevey appreciates that Vettel and Webber can be never replaced by EDP, because they "are not predictable gladiators".
