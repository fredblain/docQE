Putting the finger in the wound with literature 
'The desire at the language' was a walk at which the participants made themselves strong for the story the second round of 
"Yes, I understand this with the sex in the language, but ... The finger in the wound? What is expected by me?", a cycle asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela who should open the second round of 'lot placeres de of La lengua', which the Spanish speaking literature celebrated and on this occasion the subtitle of her question used (she explained the round's table was dedicated to the sex in the language on another event)? 
"The finger in the wound...takes us to difficulties", the Argentine spat document putting one sweet contrary to the audience, around this which mainly consisted of young people who came together at the international book fair in Guadalajara (FIL) of Marisol Shultz in whom Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero took part, Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, to be present at presented rounds table. 
Luisa Valenzuela read a text which she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and indicated the Shultz after that as an excellent story. Luisa who is the search to learn what is a "wound" and goes from doctor to doctor on tells stories in first person and is the protagonist although she receives no answer but notes which for the guide of her story. 
She leaves the infectiologists convincedly: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps this is my wound." 
For the end after a frustrating approach at the traumatologists which robbed her of the breath in the middle of the corridor, the psychoanalyst and, however, you explain to it that wound is not a scientific concept, revealed, the secret: "the really open ones, this are the wound symbolic is the scar." 
The main character of the story sighs relievedly and closes, this she only "learned from the wound that this is really open and does not exist". But she is convinced that the desire at the language and its traps mix. 
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both. 
The Nicaraguans' Sergio Ramírez also introduced a delightful story which he called 'praise of the invention' and although is not mentioned but discovered in that one of the fingers in the wound. 
With allusions to the magical realism he talks about a famous magician who touched the clouds, far brought travelled men back or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a three-point turn and reported of America, the big novel which did not lack his own chroniclers from the beginning, this one, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo of the conquer the abundance this one stories told stories criticized. 
"Cervantes who invited all of us (the writers) mocked the story of America, however, would have never been told to the feigned witnesses who appeared in the stories represented as true in another way with imagination which lost even the sense of shame." 
He stresses, though, "it is the crazy and liars which imagine the things best" and reality and lie approach each other there, where one does not know any more of which side the story is part, where the fictitious literature reaches the summit. 
He actually calls this the 'tradition Cervantes'. 
"We have inherited from him what is told to be." 
When it was Mayra Montero's turn the writer commented on and praised the variety of the interpretations to which the invitation of the FIl for the round table of 'the fingers in the wound' had contributed. 
The Cuban and puerto rican dedicated her contribution of the big wound of the social force which affects her country - like whole Latin America - as a result of the fights for the drug traffic. 
"I think that good literature, good poetry, she explained good songs contain an engagement which is silent and not planned deliberately ", building this one up between the author and the readers as in the case of a "chemical reaction" after she had stressed that literature communication and liability is. 
The Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose contribution also stressed "this finger of the dedicated writer in the wound of the writer" concluded the evening. 
He remarked that the intellectual habits and control of the consciousness also come to dogmatisms in a fast-moving world, a small yes that and will forget, " behind every confirmation a small no stands and behind every denial " 
"To our thoughts and be the reality in the possession, we must give nuances: Frequently indicates to put the finger in the wound and to annoy those which feels much well and give nuances, he noticed and loaded to rediscover the meaning of the letter if they think in the form of caricatures in black and white in prefabricated ideas without nuances and also the powerful one annoy, this one prefer it, the world in black and white, to divide up.
