The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and published a booklet 
As a rule, women who are labelled as witches in Burkina Faso show some common social features. 
You rather belong to the older generation, they do not find work for example for physical reasons they are single and no children have. 
If one of these women "turns" witch, she is isolated strictly, the rest of the village cannot get dangerous so that she. 
"Men are quite seldom concerned by this destiny." 
Also young and healthy women this "remains" saved since they help and give birth to children at work, a nun describes the situation which takes care of more than one hundred women who were ejected by her communities in a special home in the capital of the west African country Burkina Faso. 
The local government decided "social measure" to proceed against this abnormal one now. 
And a booklet which shall stop the "witch-hunt" published for this reason. 
However , there's a rub in it. 
"More than 70 per cent of all adults in Burkina Faso can not read", the newspaper "the standard" pointed to the dilemma of the written enlightenment. 
However, it also is to be accused of the sorcery in other African countries a matter of course. 
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year Ammy Hemmahov√° was tormented by three women and two men to death - they poured paraffin over her and simply switched her on. 
The Server BBC also reported about this occurrence among others. 
The perpetrators claimed, though, the thing would have been only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances. 
According to your version oil which is used for ritual unctions has caught fire. 
And but after the group has tried "to exorcize" "an evil spirit" from the woman. 
The people here support the isolation of "witches" without consideration for her education. 
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso to this: "In the past like today, eaters of human souls are a danger", he said. 
In Burkina Faso therefore the Gambian president has at least done the government his best during himself the president been involved himself properly to defuse the witch-hunt last year. 
"President Yahya Jammeh kindled a monstrous witch-hunt after the death of his aunt since these made allegedly a contribution to the death and would try now to kill the president even by black magic also." 
He exclaimed it " shaman from the near Guinea to help which women and men arrested at random in the company of policemen, soldiers and the bodyguards of the president forcibly from Gambian villages carried off and in Kanilai brought about to the farm of the president ", the organisation cited Amnesty International in her report. 
The incarcerated people were forced to drink an Absud from plants with a hallucinogenic effect which, however, also caused intestines and kidney problems on the farm. 
Two of the locked people did not survive the stay on the farm. 
Only due to the international pressure the almost one thousand prisoners were released again.
