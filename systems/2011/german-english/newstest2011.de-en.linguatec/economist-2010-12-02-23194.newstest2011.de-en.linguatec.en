Secret to the middle 
Within the weeks after the sudden death of your husband Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, learned a wave from liking which drove her popularity instalment around 20 points on over 50% up. This is the highest value since her election in the year 2007. 
Whether this helps her to get a re-election, however, next year depends on it, Cristina Fernández is willing to compromise than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner whether this one obviously mourning. 
The signs for it are not clear. 
Néstor Kirchner who steered the economic policy also after the election of his wife frequently built budgets which fully did not take into account the inland revenue receipts, the economic growth and the inflation. 
This permitted the president couple to spend the extra takings after a discretion of his own. 
The Fernández government lost the majority on the paper in the convention last year. 
But the opposition is and sexton split death after a heart attack on October 27th led to further disagreements. 
Some critics of the regime from the rows of the ruling peronists went and stood behind Cristina Fernández. 
But the convention did not manage after chaotic meetings (during which a parliamentarian beat another into the face and others accused the government of the bribery) to say goodbye to the household for 2011. 
"I will not discuss it", so the president. 
The household 2010 is necessary to spend money after a discretion of its own now for the next year through which the president has still more opportunity, too. 
The economy runs hot: She probably will grow this year by up to 9%. 
The official rate of inflation is 11.1% at present, but numerous private valuations and wage claims of the trade unions drive the value on almost 30%. 
Kirchner who assumed the office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises explained the inflation reduction to growth and poverty alleviation to his primary objectives and not. 
He refused the cooperation with the IMF, the national institute for statistics and national census INDEC which embellished the official inflation statistics after that harassed the private sector and cleaned. 
Can Fernández take a more moderate way now? 
She has called upon the private industry and the trade union leaders for conversations. 
And according to official statements increases in pay shall be limited next year on 18%. 
Argentina's agricultural products have the high world market prices given the economy a strong impetus. 
But the inflation undermined the growth push by a great devaluation in the year 2002. 
Cristina Fernández would possibly like to attach Argentina to the rest of the world for this reason financial world economically again. 
The government reached an agreement with bond-holders at the beginning of this year which had declined the earlier funding of the country in the year 2001. 
These seem now to press Fernández on an agreement with the sponsors from the Paris club, her approx. $ 6.7 bn owes. 
The sexton had always declined a check by the IMF as elsewhere usual. 
But the Minister of Trade and Commerce Amado Boudou announced last month that the fund will do a national cost-of-living consumer price index "technical support" at the construction of a new. It looks as if this were the first step towards the cleaning of the INDEC. 
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active also without the support by her husband after completion of her period of office. 
She needs the support of the middle shift which has for the most part of the Kirchnerism enough if yes, to this. 
If the Argentines return from her summer holiday in March, the wave of the sympathy which was shown for her will have faded away. 
If she liked to win another election, she must make up her mind, whether she cancels many political decisions of her husband quietly and quietly.
