Can politeness do this dividing connect? 
After a campaign at swearwords and negativism this week little politeness has broken out in Washington. 
Is it the omen of a real cooperation between two parties or a moment of the illusion, before one returns fast again to the fight of the parties in the capital? 
The meeting on Tuesday between president Obama and tops of the convention did not bring about any breakthrough lame in the great questions one himself duck session the meeting at the end of a government period in which no more decisions are taken, with which during the so-called " ", to employ had. 
All this what one hears, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor an attention of her split to rule over responsibility after, but one rather empties episode of a biassed point collection. 
The public meeting of the deficit commission of the president on Wednesday was likewise civilized despite the political differences which there furthermore are between the members. 
It the ideological ravine seems to be clear that a narrow interaction over a period of months lets a mutual respect arise, furthermore to it the members of each other this one separate veiledly. 
This is hardly enough to claim it has opened a new era of the cooperation. 
Both sides are in a test stage now - in this one the one of the other sign of the cooperation and willingness to compromise calls in while one is trying to weigh up the bounds of the public opinion and the patience of the electors after a renewed party warfare himself. 
Were therefore the meeting itself on Tuesday and to demands or accusations his assessment by the participants open limits a minimum. 
The philosophical differences between Obama and the republicans are too big and too deep in that one could expect a fast change of the atmosphere which prevailed within the last two years. 
It is about taxes, donations, health or candidacies, the two sides are for miles and miles remote from each other identical whether. 
The November election has in the end Washington for short time at least mild voted. 
No question, the intonation have changed " " which works, Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, said, for the "Ethics and PUBLIC Policy centre" now. 
"This is unavoidable after elections. 
Elections arouse biassed passions which die again. 
And this is so well." 
This one duck session " lame " in some questions particularly in these, this one on the agenda, stand, have hardly another election republicans and democrats but to find a solution." 
Bushs tax reductions end at the end of the year and nobody approves this. 
Both sides claim to find a way, around some or even everyone to gets, it to be temporary or durable now. 
A compromise has as well to be expected regarding the increased unemployment benefit, if also only lasting because the republicans cannot afford it that one thinks these favoured tax reductions for the rich they refuse unemployed workers a support. 
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House the optimism has increased, that in these questions during this one " one duck session " reach an agreement himself and lame can ratify the new start contract also. 
The Brookings institution warns but a successful cooperation in urgent questions of the lame does not " that, have William Glaston duck session to lead to a durable cooperation of the parties mandatorily, if the new 112th convention is called in January. 
He says so, a phase of the non-compliance is more probably, perhaps even inevitable instead. 
He "will after the things which must be done are done turn this short-term psychology over in confrontation", said. 
Wehner is also sceptical, and this scepticism is shared by many - this leads politeness to a real cooperation. 
I see much which happens from today to 2012 him when pre-fight or shadow-boxing said for the main event of 2012 " ". 
For this many have to do with the presentation of the new republican majority in the White House and the reasons with the tea party electors these were useful to the education. 
Being allowed to be the republican leaders also about this as got that they too highly play poker, they know that they must have a try to observe her promises to cut the expenses of the government and to suspend the health care reform. 
These party lines already get clear in the first reactions regarding the recommendations of the deficit commission which contain a tax reform and the raise some taxes as well as the increase in the retirement age and the cut the public expenditure. 
The acting chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have pressed in accordance with her own assessment so much to put the deficit question on the public agenda that these cannot be ignored any more. 
But they need within the commission 14 of the 18 votes around her plan to make an official recommendation and they fight very much to this one to also only come this number into the proximity. 
The greatest resistance is found in the representatives of the committee voted for since only little room to move or some are liking in questions of finance, at least today for compromises. 
Alston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the republicans in the convention. 
Later, the first fight then will followed by a phase's greater bilateral cooperation take place in the form of party collisions next year if the republicans challenge Obama with regard to the national budget, the taxes and the health care system. 
What will lead to this change? 
The public opinion. 
It is proved that the American still wants the majority despite the partiality of the current election that the two parties work together. 
If confrontation leads into a dead end as it has happened in 1995, then both parties must pay attention to the public reaction carefully. 
Who is always condemned to losing, too will have to change the course and to seek the compromise. 
This may be an optimistic position indeed. 
As at that time, partiality and polarization are greater than in the middle of the 1990s years today and they seem between president Bill Clinton and the republicans to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the convention republicans. 
2012 consider the activists of both parties 2010 a pure prelude for one to consequence of far further-reaching Wahl at the same time. 
So seen the politeness which is carried this week for the show may be welcomed by many Americans. 
But it will require very much more effort on the two sides to find a common denominator in the questions which the two still separate from each other.
