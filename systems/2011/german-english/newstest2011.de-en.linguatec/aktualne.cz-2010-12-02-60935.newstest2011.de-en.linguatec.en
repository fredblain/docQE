The architects saw, a nursery school also is part of the office 
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the enterprise Arch.Design. 
But who would expect a mini-nursery school here already, what is included with everything: Colourful walls, creative furniture, a crowd's toys and even a mini-playground on the outer terrace. 
For last year this nursery school is at the employees' of Arch.Design disposal. 
The project planning and architectural office Arch.Design from whose studios a whole number of well-known Brno buildings is imputed of the first outlines for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for his company mini-nursery school. 
Has lain that the designers and architects return as fast as possible to her job in baby boom old age and the company in a wise foresight, because most of his 90 employees are (inside). 
The nursery school is another bonus which Arch.Design has to offer his employees in the concept of her fair deal, shortened together with the possibility working. 
The civil engineers and architects have it so more easily to bring her demanding profession and the childcare under one roof. 
An original idea of the employees is (inside) the mini-nursery school of Arch.Design and they managed to win promoting monies of the European Union and the ministry with the support of the management for her project for work and social. 
The operational mini-nursery school is financed by the operation programme humane resources and manpower policy from means of the European social fund and from the national accounts budget of the Czech Republic. 
Thanks to this financing (subsidies in the amount of 2, 8 m. CZK) the necessary facilities and the equipment could be obtained and for the duration of 2 years you provide qualified staff and the business. 
After the exhaustion of the subsidies (2 years) the society Arch.Design is obliged to operate the mini-nursery school at the expense of its own further another 3 years. 
The preparations for this project took a whole year, in which the society Economy credit rating helped actively at the application carrying out. 
Qualified staff takes care a nurse of the children whole actively - and children can to a nursery school teacher, the nursery school pay a visit without age-like reservations although most of them are more than three years old. 
And since it is about a mini-nursery school, only 5 children may be present simultaneously, several children take turns mutually over the day, though. 
The nursery school business is, coordinated flexibly with the need of the parents this one children of all employees have the same rights with respect to the use of the nursery school without consideration for the company hierarchy and her respective position. 
Although it is individual education and care, the programme contents are nevertheless comparable with the framework of the pre-school education in the mini-nursery school. 
The children do only not play here, excellent lessons primarily are commanded to them from basic knowledge up to the pre-school lessons they at the same time also learn English. 
The classroom is not only with toys and creative games but also with a computer equipped which is at the children's disposal. 
The presence of little children in the company contributes what to a kind and positive company environment more. 
The parents can glance at the children any time and the stress is so dropped when picking up the children with a delay from a far away nursery school. 
The parents therefore use her working time more productively. 
No wonder that also natural and loyal employer employee relations take shape here. 
Arch.Design joined so under the Czech companies which offer at the recruiting of new employees clear Benefits who are family-orientated and confirm her staff marketing by such programmes.
