Affaire Clotilde Reiss: The Elysée palace exaggerates his mediator function for Syria 
Within more than six months of July 2009 until May 2010 the destiny of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was held tight because of "spying" in Iran, kept the French public in suspense, the diplomacy put on alert and accentuated the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Teheran. 
This everything under the attentive looks of the diplomats of the United States. 
The American documents received from WikiLeaks and had a look by the newspaper "Le Monde" surrender some backgrounds of this crisis. 
You describe how the Elysée had explained his strategy to the Americans who on the whole went to give these advice to dealing with her own crisis of "takings of hostages" in Iran (a small group of hikers). 
Showing you as the French responsible parties have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young Frenchwoman does not have the release of Iranian held prisoner in France by Majid Kakavand, one and looked for due to trade with material in favour of the Iranian nuclear programme by the American justice for the service in return. 
Finally they put the way with which the French committee has tried manipulate the media to an end to make these the idea credible, the Syrian president Bachar Al Assad has played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss in a glaring light. 
He had done nothing in this regard in truth. 
A diplomat telegram edited on August 12th, 2009 in Paris bears the title Iran ": French commentaries on the way of dealing with takings of hostages ". 
François Richter, Elysée adviser in strategy questions, talked the quay this in the company of Patrice Paoli, director ' Orsay for North Africa and the middle Orient with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone. 
You explained the French method to her. 
These advised the Americans to risk everything to lead her own nationals who would forcibly be held tight in Iran back. 
They said "noise makes", " the word "basic human rights", "innocence", "immediate release" in the media, articulates loudly and considerably and without refrain ". 
This is at a loss necessarily, around the Iranian regime to take, which very severely pays attention to his image. 
"All the more this operates, do not do this particularly since the Iranians ask you ". 
Ways, the Iranians are because "silence solves nothing", past "masters in evasive actions" the discussion tests about on unobtrusive. 
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "common, Iranian tactics": "Taking of hostages to an end of political extortion". 
He is, heralded "the payment of a large sum of money asks (230,000 euro bail of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which should take place on August 16th on the day on which she flees to the French embassy) to the Iranians" the release). 
And he lets announce, the Elysée anticipates further takings of hostages, a phenomenon which "will intensify". 
The Iranians could " in the near future unite the approximately 1,800 arrest a French citizen, live this one in Iran ", others he said so. 
August 28th, 2009. 
Clotilde Reiss has been discharged from prison twelve days ago, is held tight in Iran, however, furthermore. 
Some information was taken to circulation: The Iranian Majid Kakavand whose delivery the united states demand due to an illegal trade with delicate electronic material to Iran has been dismissed from the custody after decision of a judge in Paris. 
The American embassy faces, like numerous other observers, questions about this worrying coincidence. 
For Washington which pursues the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of this for the nuclear programme scheduled material the release of Majid Khakavand represents a piece of bad news. 
Has France accepted a horse-trading? 
The liberation of the Iranian against the one of the Frenchwoman? 
On the occasion of a renewed discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4th François Richier assures that this is not the case. 
The Elysée, not he says so, was only "surprised" by the decision of the judge completely but also has tried to rebel against it. 
(At present Michèle Alliot-Marie) "has given an active exchange between the French committee and the French Lord Chancellor" but he explains "the French government cannot change the judicial decision". 
Mr Richier also would like to point out that furthermore Majid Kakavand stands under "strict" supervision of the French secret service. 
Informs the American diplomat thereupon the Elysée adviser chooses a phone number, establishes again, the Iranian "would be in the buildings escorted by the Iranian embassy in Paris at present". 
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran and "influential mediator role" the Elysée does not spare his efforts, by means of announcements and "escape attempts organized by the media" thinks to make, the Syrian president Bachar Al Assad plays one "important". 
The Americans do not watch this activity without irony and notice that the manipulation carries fruits, since several press articles reflect the official French version. 
A telegram dating of August 25th, 2009 brings about "the medium lightning of the French authorities". 
The Parisian message asks herself what bases so much "intimation of gratitude" opposite Mr Assad on. 
"Despite her explanations full of praise the French authorities admit secretly that they have only a vague idea about it what the syrians have actually done". 
The document deals thereupon, with the reasons these have to become a slave to this fiction taken the Elysée. 
The intensive communication efforts are " as of, aimed he analyses to confirm Sarkozys policy of the opening opposite Syria ". 
A 2008 launched politics which "was perceived in France as well as abroad by numerous critic voices as premature and undeserved" at that time. 
"Blowing the Syrian role out "Paris tries" to make clear to Syria which commendation one can obtain, by one playing a constructive role in the region ". 
In addition, it is aim "to sow discord between Syria and Iran". 
The American embassy knows this from a reliable source. 
You had entrusted François Richier on August 11th: "we of course do not know whether the syrians have always done what, too". 
"But we have thanked them despite everything." 
"This should at least cause confusion with the Iranians". 
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16th, 2010. 
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in the Elysée. 
He thanks the presidents of Brazil, the Senegal and Syria for her "active role in favour of the release of our compatriot" in a communiqué.
