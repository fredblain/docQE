Police operations in China get gentler 
Like a training officer Tang Shenbin strode over a municipal Square, checked his nervous subordinates and assigned with military authority and muffled voice orders. 
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guardians of the municipal order, dreaded and disdained for her arbitrary raids and her tendency towards the force - to impress the spectators. 
"Stand upright!" 
"Look straight ahead!" 
"Shows them ", he whispered to them, " girls are that way as pretty!" 
Four girl out of hardly whom teenager ages grow, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and trousers stood tightly. 
Four pairs of black pumps suited in even row. 
Four proper hats sat on the hair held with blue whitely striped bows perfectly. 
"They look average for me", Mr Tang remarks contemptuously. 
"Models are pretty." 
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's town inspectors up. 
All new applicants must have a degree in a town. 
The province Guangdong imported a brightly blue uniform instead of the grey-green ones. 
Wuhan in middle China replaced force by low rigid: 50 officials orbited a snack car not built duly according to reports in 2009 and stared at the operator until this packed and left the place after half an hour. 
Xindu, a municipal district in Chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants, would like to change the image fundamentally. 
13 women strengthen the municipal police patrols since 2003. You were special selected due to her appearance, her good figure and her youth. 
You shall award a softer, feminine aspect to the coarse police. 
But unfortunately Scarlett Johansson would hardly manage to improve the bad picture which the Chinese of these town commands have, too. 
With right, so the critics. 
With the help of fines or other administrative punishments officials only succeed with the municipal laws different from the police be allowed to these. 
But the Chinese media show routinely another picture. 
In January 2008, officials beat in the province Hubei spectators unite to death, as this she filmed with his mobile telephone as they suppressed a protest against a garbage dump. 
Last year a training manual of the inhabitants of Beijing was stolen to officials and published on the Internet. Into this you describe as offenders can be thrashed without bloodsheds. 
This year a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered from brain injuries after a scuffle with five officials. 
One, video game being bursting shows in front of force in China that trained official at an attack on street vendors can be downloaded from the Internet. 
"Chengguan frightens the government", the national newspaper China Daily moaned last year after further controversies regarding the tactics. 
The newspaper required a "really thorough cleaning". 
Sceptics find the present approach to be clear insufficiently. 
When the district was looking for eight female recruits by advertisement in October, an editorial asked the question into the Beijing Evening New, whether the women would have real tasks or only shall serve as a visual diversion. 
Probably two. 
According to the job advertisement women were looked for in the age from 18 to 22 with a good figure and "harmonious features". 
You should be tall above average more than 1.5 m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 custom. 
The employment relation ends with reaching the 26th year of life. 
According to the officials the activity is physically too exhausting for women over 25. 
An unnamed district official said "the most important is her image" at the virtually government web page Rednet.com on. 
"Whether the candidates get the job depends on her outward appearance like size, weight, first, features etc.." 
Temperament and "inner qualities" then come. 
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases", he said and added "but furthermore they still have other duties". 
Zheng Lihua, acting leader of the municipal authority of the district, would not like to agree with this description, 
however, admitted that are not not usual into job advertisements for a both sex in China size specifications. 
The same applies to even features. 
Whether this has to be equated with a good appearance is controversial in China. 
But people with handicaps or physical distortions do not need to apply. 
"Unfortunately, we cannot use any lame or humpbacks here", so Mr Zheng 
"Your image would not be good." 
One approaches Liu Yi, this one cloister patrols, 22 is, has apple cheeks and a well formed mouth on Baoguang square. 
She does not find it sexist that value is so big attached to her appearance. 
Finds you ", I see in this uniform sexily?" she asks with an ironic look. 
21-year-old Xu Yang, we "have" the task of representing the image of the town your colleague with the dimples, this one ., commented 
According to your details they are not sorry for the short attitude since they would have more ambitious career plans than easy to shoo only dealers away through the lanes to prevent her from the business. 
The patrol deals every morning approx. twelve street vendors who try to sell as many rolls and as possible tofu dishes on foot or on the bicycle before they are chased away. 
"Mr Wang, disappear here, please." 
We "have" already so often told this to you!Ms. Xu explains to a dealer who had fled on foot and had let his down on a bicycle cart's fastened noodle kitchen temporarily. 
Sound of the officials is the activity rather monotonously as exhausting. 
This one explains to Huang Jing, 20, in the leisure time's sales nature educatedly "the same is almost every day". 
"All routine." 
It is a reason for it that the female officials may not confiscate the goods of the dealers like her male colleagues. 
You only can threaten offenders to notify her male supervisors of her. 
She shall protect this from public hostilities to which officials are frequently exposed in China. 
Hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of the province Yunnan, kicked up a row this year, the rumour circulated, Chengguan officials would have killed a dealer after. 
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan officials were injured in the nightly occurrence, 14 government vehicles were knocked over or set on fire. 
Xindu escaped from such force riots till now. 
But disturbances cannot be excluded. 
Only two blocks removed of quiet Baonguang Square at which the female officials patrolled in this morning assembled more than 50 persons at a corner of the street. 
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, instead of this contrary to the regulations on the pavement was repaired in a workshop. 
The owner shouted blue murder. 
After a 15-minute hesitation the officials forced the way to her vehicles with a furious face and continued with the motorcycle and his owner. 
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male patrol stayed behind. He turned his white nameplate over to remain anonymous. 
The coordinators - men over 40 - play colleagues a role supporting purely as hers. 
Presenting a clean image but they were not trained in this. 
"Sometimes we proceed verbally." 
Mr Li "sometimes but also physically" explains rationally. 
"People begin most time with the quarrel."
