U.S. document leaked out portrays Moscow as a port of the corruption 
Control of the town is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and she passes a part of the bribes and the protection money which gathers her on to the Kremlin. So the American embassy in Russia reported in a Memo in February. 
It is so said both police and the state security service blackmail large protection moneys so that they can keep her expensive standard of living in Moscow. 
You do not collect money only of legitimized business but also of organized criminal gangs. 
Every shift of the bureaucracy has - as " vertical the authority " - what takes his part of the money, the ladder walks up described prime minister Vladimir Putin this. 
The Memo which was sent to Washington under the name of the ambassador John Beyrle was published by WikiLeaks on his home page on Tuesday. 
The Memo is based on sources whose names were edited. 
It was written during Yuri Luzhkov Moscow's mayor still was and it accuses him of the corruption. 
He was fired by president Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is hardly a proof that you would have tidied in the meantime. 
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, whom a known building firm has have rejected corruption reproaches again and again over years and he has won numerous slander actions against such accusations. 
He explained to a Russian TV station in September as him after a documentation you asked, this one suggests, he is corrupt: "It is crazy, it is dirty, it is dirty." 
An unbelievably large number to believe Russians that her society is corrupt. Surveys have this devotedly. 
But it is unusual that single persons are called as happened in the report of the ambassador, and it is unheard that this happens by a diplomat of a foreign country. 
"The direct connection of the government of Moscow" with the crime has the Memo been the reason that some describe her as "disturbed" and come to the end as a government that the government rather like one kleptocracy acts, so. 
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a concept from the world of the criminals/the mafia which "roof" or protection word-for-word means), this one, office of the public prosecutor extends over the police, the security of the state (FSB), the service supervisory authority (MVD) and this as well as by the complete Moscow government bureaucracy. 
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow. 
"Luzhkov is at a topmost place." 
"FSB, MVD and the militia stand on the second step." 
"The vulgar criminals and the criminal inspectors follow on the undermost step last." 
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the town offers no help." 
The report passes on that the police arrest little business people the FSB money of the largest companies collected and this. 
A source is so said, is, " explained, that Moscow's shopkeepers understand, the protection that it is the best, get by the MVD and FSB and not of the organized crime (), there she does not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law." 
"For this reason the protection is no longer as in demand as early by criminal gangs." 
The Memo notices that no the protection be itself very modest while collecting the monies is comprehensive; sometimes even the ones who pay are arrested. 
The ones who does not pay find her business closed very fast in front of - due to the pretext. 
Medvedev has repeatedly has at the same time said, however, that he only has made few progress talked about fighting the corruption. 
The Memo of the embassy contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases which were presumably full of money. 
"Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats in his fight against corruption" told Georgy Satarov, director of by, a Moscow fact-finding mission, recently in an interview. 
"But he is part of this bureaucracy." 
"It is not a part of the political class because a political class does not exist in Russia any more." 
Without politicians without an opposition without a separation of the forces, he says so, corruption is unavoidable. 
Nationwidely estimates so by the corruption costs Russia, more than $ 300 billion per annum. 
The country shunts Transparence International on place 154 of a newer examination to the global perception of the corruption by the non-state organisation (countries are of listed too "most corruptly "least indeedly""). 
The uncovering of the Memos of the American embassy which was carried out late in the evening after Moscow time will arouse displeasure, although certainly within the Russian government, it also can be an opportunity for the Kremlin since Luzhkov can be accused for the faults of Moscow to claim that one solves the problems. 
In an interview with Larry King for CNN Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted furiously with the uncovering, that American diplomats have called him Batman and Medvedev Robin. 
It "is the truth that it is about our interaction which is an important factor of the domestic policy in this country", he said. 
"But to be honest, we would not have expected this with such a pressure and in such an unethical way to happen with such an arrogance know."
