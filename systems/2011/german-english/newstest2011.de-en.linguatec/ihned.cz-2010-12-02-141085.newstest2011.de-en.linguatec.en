I wish my successors a more peaceful year than we had it in Farmet 
The victory euphoria was taken off by the results of the crisis fast. 
Farmet has the worst thanks to his determination behind himself. 
Karel Ždárský accepted the price for the first rank of the competition Vodafone company of the year in the former year the owner of the company of Farmet, contrary to. 
The jury appreciated the efforts at that time with which he stamped an enterprise from the small tool engineering in Ceská Skalice from the ground which makes hundreds of millions of sales. 
"I can say that this appreciation encourages only me myself but also all my employees and has not confirmed our self-confidence in the fight with the competition", says last year's winner. 
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet stood the effort, something to do useful. 
And when the state of his father Karel Ždárský then offered a small workshop as a compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists to the lease he did not hesitate for a long time, let his career in the company he till there busy was employed which buzzes and a company of one's own was based with a couple of comrades of his father to the production of plastic baths. 
Short time later started with her to concentrate on plant oil presses. 
They are biggest manufacturers of automatic press in whole Central Europe within 18 years climbed to this. 
She also has entered the consciousness of the not special public but first by the success in the mentioned competition and its medialization. 
Our foreign partners did not also start Karel Ždárský says to be able cooperate with a company which has achieved the greatest possible success in her country the circumstance " only, that our customers are aware of the brand Farmet considerably more intensively now, to attach greater value ". 
The last year was not only dominated by the victory euphoria at Farmet, though. 
The appreciation started out from the economic results of the enterprise in 2008 and a part of 2009. 
And the most difficult year was straight 2009 for the sale of tool engineering products. 
The crisis which still less shook the citizens but primarily enterprise at that time just reached her highlight - many companies were forced to adjust her capital subjects and to limit the purchase of new facilities and technologies. 
"Of course we could not escape this situation either." 
"The sales declined by 40 per cent, we had to limit the production and even to reach for dismissals", declares Karel Ždárský 
A viable enterprise must take up also such unpopular measures from time to time. 
However, it turned out well to get a grip on the situation and to keep the company in the black numbers even if with smaller profits than before the crisis. 
The enterprise was not willing at one in investments in the research and development to make end strokes. 
"From the subsidy we built a research and training centre, we confirmed our presentation at international fairs and purchased first prizes at home exhibitions", says Ždárský. 
Everything shows it, that we have overcome the crisis. 
The sales wax again and with them the number of new employees, too. 
I "wish" the new winner a lot of joy, has Karel Ždárský lined up at the victory but in more quiet atmosphere.
