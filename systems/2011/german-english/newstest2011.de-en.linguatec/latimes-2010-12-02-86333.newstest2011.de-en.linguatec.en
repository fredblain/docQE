An arsenic resistant microbe could make new life-forms possible on the earth or elsewhere 
The discovery of a strange bacterium type which can live among others on arsenic opens up new possibilities on the earth and elsewhere for new life-forms. 
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on the earth, it is a sign in her opinion that a life is possible also without the elements considered to be essential till now. 
"This organism has two possibilities." 
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic for growing." 
This completely makes it to special something ", although it almost a type is 'strange' life-form ", of the Arizona State University and co. author of the report which appears to the magazine Science in the online version on Thursday Paul C.W. Davies declared. 
Six main elements were regarded as essential till now, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur. 
But as these found out scientists the bacterium grows mono brine in the Californian also then still further, if it replaces phosphorus by arsenic. 
The co. author of the report told Ariel D. Anbar of the Arizona State University "one wonders anyway there otherwise what is still possible". 
The discovery is an important step at the search for extraterrestrial life, so Anbar, since scientists must recognize lives and his forms. 
The study deals with microbes which were found on the earth. 
Reason for far common speculations announced a press conference in which no details on the discovery were announced that the report of the discovery of extraterrestrial life could act in the Internet the announcement. 
This is not the case. 
The discovery shows that organisms can put biochemical processes into walk in other planetary systems with the help of other elements " explained space Sciences research institutes of the open university of Milton Keynes to Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and in the United Kingdom and that the 'standard elements' which is absolutely essential in our opinion are not firmly predefined absolutely ". 
Base was not part of the research team. 
"A novelty is this work because she shows that an element can be replaced by a different one in basic biochemical processes and structures", Cockell added. 
This discovery was not coincidental. 
The mono brine chose Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the astro-biological institute NASA which conducted the study due to the large arsenic content. 
Arsenic and phosphorus chemically are, there himself she assumed that microbes which is exposed to both can replace an element possibly by the different one. 
"The toxicity of the arsenic is primarily based on the fact that it behaves chemically similarly as phosphorus." 
"Through this it is difficult for the organisms to distinguish an element of the other." 
"But the difference is so big that arsenic seems different than phosphorus. It reaches our biochemical system where it smears everything virtually ", Anbar explains. 
The researchers exposed the bacterium to GFAJ 1 of an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew. 
Although the microbe grows in phosphorus better, anyway that she can survive also into arsenic, shows either on the earth or on either another planet or moon on which arsenic happens more frequent that of course an arsenic based life-form can happen. 
According to the Jamie S. Foster, lecturer in microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new. There was no operating example but till now yet. 
Arsenic happened more frequent within the early earth years, she says, therefore science has assumed that early life-forms have used it. 
This admits reason so Forster, this one ", that life can have developed also differently than in the early geological era ", not a member of Wolfe Simons assumed research team. 
The research was supported by NASA, the department of energy and the national health authorities.
