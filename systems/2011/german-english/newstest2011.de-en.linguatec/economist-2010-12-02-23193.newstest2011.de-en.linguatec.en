An election defeat 
Nobody had expected the elections to want to be perfect in Haiti on November 28th. 
But the facts surpassed the fears of the polling officers who hurried for the shaken country for the help by far. 
Overcrowded ballot boxes, votes cast repeatedly, polling cards were only a part of the problems in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidations. 
Polling stations opened with a delay lasting several hours. 
Many Haitians from whom many had got homeless by the earthquake in January roamed on the search for a choice around. 
Some finally completely gave up. 
A dozen candidates for the presidency under this reconcile presumed leaders, required the abolition of the election results due to an alleged deceit. 
It came to partly violent protests in the whole country. 
Edmond Mulet, the leader of the UN mission in Haiti, nevertheless described the election as quite good "in many interests". 
According to a careful statement of observers of the organisation of American States and of The Caribbean Community these irregularities "do not" make trial invalid necessarily as seriously as they may be also. 
Into other word, The show Goes on. 
The election authority which allegedly is obliged to the unpopular departing president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the temporary results on December 7th. 
The expected final ballot is arranged for January. 
There still is hope in the election. 
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former roof ridge Lady Girlande Manigat have withdrawn her initial invalidity complaint. 
If Jude Célestin who meets with the electors' only little or not the slightest approval explained to the final ballot by the election authority to the winner, this could lead to problems. 
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 m. of the earthquake victims still live in tents a low poll was feared. 
Many Haitians were prevented from the voting by lacking organisation on the election day. 
Identity cards which are needed to the election were not distributed approx. 250.000 yet shortly before start of pulsing. 
Much is at stake. 
The donor countries regard a legitimate, recognized government as an important step at the reconstruction of Haiti. 
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
