The FIFA appoints the end judge country World Cup 2018-2022: 
In sheer excitement due to suspicion of corruption the executive committee of the FIFA appoints the end judge countries of the World Cups 2018 and 2022, a most political election, this one the scrap around influence as well as the lobbying threaten to press the technical criteria to the background on Thursday. 
A thing is, however, safe: The distribution in 2018 of the royal discipline of the FIFA will the 4 candidates take place (in Europe, her traditional stronghold: England, Russia, Spanien-Portugal, Niederlande-Belgium). 
The distribution in 2022 then will turn out a little more exotic; the international football association hopes to be able to win for himself on the African continent in 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) or further to pursue his branch office in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) after the premiere. 
The list of the personalities, this one to the delegation accompanying (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, this provides Maß Bill Clinton the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of the government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) economic and political use of a World Cup. 
So the wheelings and dealings behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute. 
Difficult otherwise, build a hierarchy of the candidates. 
According to the evaluation report of the FIFA the English, Spanish Portuguese and American offer file better argument than that one of her competitors. 
But these considerations will not be so heavy for the election for the 22 members of the executive committee at the hour. 
The Sunday Times which stood with the here leadership of the suspension two members of the executive committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the uncoverings could have spoiled the chances just as well for her own country, cradle of the football, the World Cup was allowed to deliver this namely 1966 only once. 
The three influential had BBC given this breeding ground on Monday once more by having radiated a documentary report members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under fire takes. 
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and to embarrass the English responsible parties which had primarily operated an intensive lobbying with David Cameron within these last weeks. 
The head of the government hopes for a reprint of the gambit Tony Blair was succeeded of his predecessor which had obtained the organisation of the Olympic Games 2012 for London in 2005. 
Would this intensive use suffice to increase the value of the image of England in front of the committee again? 
Nothing is less for certain, then this duo Spanien-Portugal does not lack trumps with his already ready stadia, his expertise (WC 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and his football culture. 
But the economic and financial shady sides of the two countries could muffle her ambitions. 
The possible reprisals against the Englishmen as well as the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal let the chances of Russia which has become the heavy outsider despite his gaps in the dossier (stadia, hotels, transport) rise. 
Prime minister Vladimir Putin has the frank hint on the accusations decided, however, the English Presse denounced "an unfair competition in the preparations for the coordination" on the part of the committeemen. 
"One throws dirt at her", one tries to compromise her, Putin cursed. 
For 2022 the United States seem to be the logical favourites, strengthened by the experience of 1994. 
A long list seems to show a first economic world power, seat of the FIFA main sponsors, the country of advantages over Japan and South Korea which have separately built a very beautiful project. 
But these new candidatures seem premature for two countries which had helped organize the competitions in 2002. 
Another threat: The permission of the WCs in 2026 for China which let the Asian chances of 2022 get invalid longed for by the FIFA much. 
With Australia and Qatar which pulled all the stops with the waiting at table of futuristic stadia had, does the FIFA pursue her extension in the direction of the new areas, these two countries, however, represent a greater risk, because certainty. 
Australia could have to suffer weakness of the television rights just like Japan and South Korea under this one of the European countries akquittierten (due to the time lag), the sensitive nerve of the FIFA.
