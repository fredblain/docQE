Sacred king is looked for 
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toy want the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela longingly. 
For the parents it will be difficult at next Epiphany to fulfil these wishes, because the household gets together no more and more than from twelve persons and a billy goat. 
Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel nevertheless do not give up hope, that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar give them the toy and the garments which longs for her so. 
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement Salvador Allende. You live into the mouth on your hand because the father does not have firm work. 
"Sometimes hard times are planned because my husband does not have any job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes ... Already in the afternoon I go with the brats ", said to Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little boys, for selling on the street. 
Four-year-old Adelaida would like to have a doll or a bicycle while her three years old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll. 
The ten-year-old José Alfredo would like to have a 'monster car' for some time already and for the eight months old brother Jesús suggests Cayetana clothes in the size for lower school certificates. 
"I, however, answered him told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like to have this monster so', 'let wait for us, boy', Cayetana remembered sadly because it was very expensive ". 
For the older children who were in school clothes and shoes would be ideal. 
María Guadalupe has the eleven-year-old the Größe 12; the ten years' Isaías the Größe 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel Größe has 8. 
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A couple in the Größe 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
