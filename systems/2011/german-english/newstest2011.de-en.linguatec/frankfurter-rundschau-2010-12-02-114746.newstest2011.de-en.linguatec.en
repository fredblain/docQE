The trace of the stones 
Which one does have himself Uli Gsell 400 kilos gottenly, altogether approximately also? 
He stood on the Monday evening in front of the Stuttgart station, the tuba on the back. 
It was demo. 
It snowed. 
The story is known: The excavators had advanced in September and had started to stop a large piece of the north grand piano. 
The same was not the Stuttgart world any more: Demonstrated against S21, the lowering of the station worth a few billion, tens of thousands. 
When it came to the building freeze, a large part of the grand piano lay in ruins. 
Broken in 6000, 7000 piece. 
A Crailsheim Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, between 1914 and 1920 obstructed. 
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern 43 years oldly. 
He has himself the chunk protected itself couple of one. 
"These stones are relics." 
"You mustn't disappear." 
He swarms: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earth custody." 
When he sawed one, this one has smelled of cigarette fug. 
He does not know yet what he will do with the chunks. 
Stones have time. 
Uli Gsell also. 
The trace of the Stuttgart stones leads to a former ammunition depot of the French army where Manuel Rongen has set up his stone empire to woods at Tuebingen. 
The 44-year-old trades in old stones. 
He has bought everyone whom attacked at the demolition in Stuttgart. 
"It would be a disgrace, they would be ground to gravel or in the dump disappear", he says in his office, a wood hut which was once a little guardhouse. 
Swears and threatens one has him, he tells stories when in this September was in the newspapers that he has bought the remains of the north grand piano of the demolition contractor. 
But he has talked with the S 21 opponents for days. 
And he has explained to them that he really can for the demolition do nothing at all now. 
And, if it happens now once, then it is the most sensible anyway if the stones were continued to use. 
About 200 s 21 opponents took one this one on average cuboid heavy 80 kilos, unit price 6.50 to 14 euro after that. 
However, being able to some give him back also in the hope at a reconstruction as a souvenir. 
Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 big lorry cargo loads. 
Approximately the half is still stored in the woods, the rest is sold already. 
Owner of a garden, landscape gardener, private developer. 
They have come and would have dragged away, what boot and caravans could carry of everywhere. 
The Stuttgart bones of contention have changed into "Mäuerle" long ago or into limitations of herb beds. 
"This stone is actually nothing special", says Rongen. 
"The political component would not be." 
He climbs into his cross-country vehicle, makes a tour of his 20 hectares empire. 
He has studied law and broken off then he has been interested in computers and finally has become stone dealers, late biology. 
And stone enthusiast. 
he stores 40000 tons of stones. 
He carts his treasures from all of Germany together. 
He says he is the greatest old stone dealer of the republic. 
He brakes. 
Sandstones hewed artistically lie in the snow. 
"You belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke once", he says. 
Elbe sand stone yellow, warm, he, swarms. 
"My favourite stone." 
It goes up the way through the woods. 
He points at a heap: Red sandstone, early part of the Karlsruhe station. 
And. 
"Beautiful travertine." 
The cuboids were part of the platform of the Stuttgart Neckar stadium once. 
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite out of the cathedral Sankt Blasien, tuff of the Heilbronn hospital. 
Which work, which efforts, which sweat. 
If Rongen thinks as the stones were hit by hand and moved with simple block and tackles and ox carts earlier gets he quite reverent. 
"It would be a scandal anyway if one would something like that become shredders." 
He richly does not have become, stinking rich already not at all. 
But 14 people employed of the stone dealers have today, in addition set up above in the woods stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a horticulturist. 
"We work hard but it is satisfactory", says the rest dismantler and recycler. 
He must to Cologne soon. 
Also there there is to save stones.
