Grammy nominations: Surprisingly, the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was honoured in the category newcomer of the year 
People will notice it if you on inquiry from a president appearance. 
President Obama asked Esperanza Spalding to appear at the ceremony on the occasion of the noble presentation of prizes 2009. Now became the 26-year jazz bass player and singer surprisingly nominates Grammy for this year's in the category newcomer of the year. 
In view of the fact that Spalding is already one celebrated star in the jazz scene in 2008 since her album "Esperanza" the nomination seems a little unusual. But she corresponds to the Grammy rules according to which an artist may have returned not more than three albums before publication of the album with which he was confessed in the broad public. 
Your ambitious album from the year 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is surely a step forwards. And with her elated voice and a good feeling for pop, radio and Latin Music one can compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003 safely whose great success comes as a jazz interpreter in this category of the nomination of Spalding most nearly in the year 2003. 
Furthermore the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer trio was nominated in the category's instrumental albs. This darling of the critics experienced a smash hit through this. 
"Moody 4 B" of the experienced saxophone player James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboarder John Beasley and others are part of the competitors Iyers. 
Trombone shortie, a rough-and-ready favourite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBOs "Treme", was honoured in the category contemporary jazz in which albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber otherwise can rather be found. 
The Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue got large group of well rightful attention in the category. He therefore competes with the Billy Childs ensemble with his chamber jazz and the Dave Holland fond of adventure and his octet whose Life album "Pathways" is a good example of a bass player as a democratic band leader.
