Threatening gestures of the European Central Bank (ECB.) 
The investors reacted keenly on the threat of the ECB president TÃ¶richte who warned yesterday "the markets should not underestimate our speed of reaction" 
The risk impacts of the euro periphery countries have increased dramatically and the shares of the European banks by more than 5%. 
We nevertheless should not the possibility that the ECB can be mistaken and the euro has hardly improved its performance at points underestimate what arranges to the worry. 
The events of yesterday are typically of an illiquid market, this one in the measure, in which he caves in recovers again though because of the shutdown of short and highly speculative positions. 
The institutional investor will not lose his fear yet for a long time. 
Today a month ago the European Central Bank invited us our liquidity measures, to make the ECB must back out within two years and probably still quite a few times in the future after what tomorrow for the fourth time. 
The finalisation of the plan demanded the Federal Bank for sale of national debts since these are ineffective as well as liquidity measures limited the abolition of all unusual. Only a one-week permanent access shall be kept. 
After the Irland crisis we expect the present liquidity measures "at least until March" prolonged and the quarterly advertisings with an unlimited access on the end of the quarter to ensure of the liquidity until at least June to want to keep. 
We also expect the programme for sale of bonds continual and a signal being fortifying to want to distribute. 
This is, if the created expectations are not met, be the excellent reaction of the markets of yesterday thrown back again and insisted if obstinate we to take our liquidity measures back, only God can help us! 
Could this story recur tomorrow not take the purchase of national debts papers into consideration and the markets caved in after that just like during the ECB meeting in May during which confirmed the bank. 
The ECB must be credible and insistent. 
She showed her teeth in May and she, already much said on Wednesday bought to have with what she provoked a new break of the market. 
The auction of one-year-old state titles was rather weak in Portugal yesterday. 
The state portfolio management distributed only 500 million to 5.28% opposite 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction. 
Nevertheless the interest rates dropped around 30 base points in Portugal in the complete curve and funnel reflected a perception change of the markets according to the words with that. 
The numbers of the fault hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland in Ireland. 
The sum is valued at approximately 10 000 millions of at short notice and possible further 15 000. There is time until February to obtain private capital or these banks are nationalized. 
Although Ireland has lost his credibility completely after it had not recognized the problem with the stress tests in July, the numbers are acceptable in the context of the rescue plan and help to reduce the uncertainty. 
The government must receive the parliamentary consent to his new budget next Tuesday, though. Since she still does not have the sufficient support, Ireland is one source of the uncertainty furthermore, too. 
Angela Merkel has made her discourse more moderate with regard to the summit of the leaders and the government on December 14th. There political unity is in demand to point that these play the same score us together. 
Countries are the problem, that Beethoven's ninth symphony Germany Wagner wants to play and the other. 
The Spanish district president introduced the action plan yesterday which shall be adopted by the ministerial committee on Friday. 
Reform of pensions, transparency into the independent regions as in the case of the financial institutions, reduction of the government's deficit, liberalization, privatization and job creation schemes. Measures which sound in the ears of the investors like vivaldi four seasons. 
The double effect Zapatero and foolish explain twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges why the Spanish stock exchange has improved its performance by 4.5 per cent. 
In comparison with February the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincing and we profit from the shock effect. 
There is a substantial auction of a three-year government bond which will profit from the foolish effect today. Therefore we back a heavy demand which will remove all doubts about our funding ability. 
For Spain the application for a help plan would be a self-sacrifice. 
We would get liquidity which we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros three times as much as in March at the disposal. The interest rates are extremely expensive and the entry to the markets would be closed without notice. 
Our strategy nevertheless should Caesar's wife correspond to the motto: "Being only not but also the appearances are counting now." 
We create this only courage!
