Ogoniland has burned down 
The water in the rivers is ölbraun, it smells like at the filling station: Billions litres of crude oil run out have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland. 
The people live on theft, corruption and illegal Ölkochen. 
Celestine Akpobari means it well. 
Do not be troubled the environmental activist calms the journalists " as of ": "Today, you still will get enough sludge in front of the lentil." 
The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed up the attempt to photograph a boy wading up to the chest in the water with the striations surrounding him: In the rainbow-coloured water gleam the scene seems almost pretty. 
It can be not seen that brown crude oil clouds float under the surface. 
She in the past has in bucketfuls collected prawns here, Esther Badom says on the bank of the Bodo-Jetty river. 
The sluggish running waters are completely bleak by now. 
Five years ago vast amounts crude oil flowed from a burst pipe into the gigantic wetland. 
Fishermen from this near situated small towns Bodo must paddle now six hours to reach waters containing fish: The Ogoniland lain in the heart of the Niger delta is regarded as one of the regions of the world polluted worst. 
On the journey by the mangrove marshes run through by courses of a river the whole extent of the devastation gets conspicuous. 
The motorboat stirs brown broth up, place who dips his hand into the water, pulls oily fingers out bright water. 
The roots of the little mangroves rise like black liquorice bars from the ground sadly, palms to be found have her fly whisks occasionally hung. 
As otherwise they are usual in wetlands one searches in vain swarms of birds: As soon as the outboard motor is silent, ghostly quiet spreads herself in the earlier paradise smelling like a filling station. 
"What happens here an ecological warfare is", Celestine Akpobari says darkly: "We live in permanent danger for the health." 
The war comparison is appropriate. 
The housing area of the Ogoni is a battlefield disputed for decades: Here the first discoverers penetrated more ago than 60 years from Europe, the first resistance organized himself with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa executed later here in the eighties, here the Shell group 1993 had to discontinue his production because it got too dangerous for the oil workers. 
The return is refused to the enterprise to Ogoniland certainly today: The oil fields are fallowly, too unstably located in the Ogoniland the situation is for the group while more than two million barrel of the black gold are pumped out by the triple size of Switzerland with over 5000 drilling sources and 7000 kilometres of pipes daily from the complete delta region. 
Steel racks like bizarre sculptures rise all couple of one hundred metres from the water: "Little Christmas trees" become far too tenderly the heads of the drill holes called. 
You are corroded to the core up to 50 year oldly, the usually one. 
Akpobari thinks such a drill chuck breaks from each other again and again, a constant current crude oil then runs into the water. 
More than two billion litre have flowed after expert estimates into the ecosystem of the delta within 50 years: How at the accident of the super tanker "Exxon Valdez" into the sea she insisted year for year the lot oil - one the greatest ecological disasters in the history of mankind 21 years ago in front of Alaska. 
Who for the continuous environmental district responsibly be made can, about this is argued? 
While the Shell group is holding the pollution sabotage and the oil theft organized responsible for more than 90 per cent, environmentalists consider bursting drill chucks and leaky pipelines main causes. 
Shell lays out considerably lower standards of security in Nigeria as or else in the world usual, the U.S. scientist Richard Steiner reproached the group 2008: Alone the instalment of defects at the pipes is " around a multiple higher than elsewhere ". 
Shapes appear from the mangroves at a place which looks like a deserted, oil-smeared workshop under a free sky from the distance: You are stark-nakedly and up to the neck oil-smeared. 
A fire flickers under one of the many barrels which can be agreed with tubes scattered connectedly, partly arbitrarily on the area partly: An illegal little refinery. 
Michael, the boss of the group, explains the crude oil is heated up over the fire in the barrel for several hours. 
Petrol penetrates through the pipes into the on-catch pot first, drips kerosene and finally diesels out later at the end of the line. 
So Michael and four employees produce litres up to four barrels of diesel at 300 each daily: This earns us 34.000 Naira one " - about 22 dollars ". 
The delta residents use the chronic fuel scarcity in the largest mineral oil state of Black Africa. 
Nigeria only has one single refinery at its disposal. 
This one still be able to the illegal cookers undercut with almost 40 eurocents per litre of ridiculously low diesel price: Because they get her raw material for free. 
He is from "bunker ships" which tap the pipeline net straight through Ogoniland: This way be lost to the country at least 16 million litre of crude oil lost daily according to the experts in the complete Niger delta. 
Only an insignificantly small portion of the raw material stored provisionally is refined illegally, though: Organized criminal networks fill the lion's share, to which and high-profile also politician shall belong, into tankers armed force and get rid of him on the world market. 
The debate rather haunted this one, whether the ecological disaster is owed to the population or the lax production way, the activist regards Akpobari as pure academically. 
"The petroleum companies would not be perceived as intruders and they would not have destroyed the basic living conditions of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be sabotage still theft and illegal refineries." 
The relationship of the Ogoni is destroyed primarily so meanwhile, however, to Shell that only a discount of the group would be possible: "Perhaps yes other nationalities like the Chinese than better prove." 
Michael gets nervous there. 
The muscular Ölmann says " high time, that you disappear ". 
"The soldiers can come every minute." 
Although if the illegal oil refiners of the special squad of the defense forces are caught, no arrest, well but a painful bribe, threatens them. 
The soldiers principally being from the country north also want to profit from the raw material like all Nigerians. 
"These damned things have taken our country to the dog in every regard", says Akpobari.
