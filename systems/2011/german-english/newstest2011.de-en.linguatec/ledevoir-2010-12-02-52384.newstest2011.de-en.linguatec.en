450 million in contracts without advertising 
Hydro Québec has allowed project planning companies 450 million dollars Eastman 1-A Sarcelle-Rupert by mutual agreement at contracts for the water-power project. 
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts a syndicate stands this the most important share consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe sm and Axor, namely that one of the project management has got, to a sum of 295 million dollars without advertising. 
This syndicate 2004 as concomitant of the decision of hydro Québec, the private sector became her responsibility, this important, called "energy gérance", hydroelectric project in amount of a sum of 5 billion dollars to over-answers, formed. 
The syndicate "energy gérance" got hold of the lucrative contract at the beginning of 2005 without there having been a public advertising. 
For the Parti Québécois going back to enterprise syndicates represents a grave ethical problem which brings about the risk of the competition superseding as well as a price increase. 
"This is a new way of a put-up job and weakens the competition." 
"This means that one carries out in open form instead of put-up job instead of in a secret way now", explained Sylvain Simard, representative the PQ, yesterday at the press conference. 
In the early morning Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly because it seems to him in a way difficult to understand how, that way, the interest of the public can be used. 
Resource minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted to it in the afternoon by denying vehemently that this contract would have been a put-up job. 
"I remain faithful to my line", she cursed, she confirmed by, the PQ has been more important "dishonestly" and "she lacks" hardness. 
She said it "was the least" that the PQ apologizes. 
The model of the syndicate is worldwide common practice. 
It normally is a from the point of view of time so temporary alliance which permits two or more enterprises to bundle her expertises with regard to a commandment on an advertising for a complex project. 
The project "Eastman" shows a high complexity standard regarding his work extent. 
The construction method is in way and shall be built to 2012. 
The contract nevertheless was allocated without a business struggle having been able to take place; there had already been negotiations. 
Moreover, more represents the model of the syndicate an exception in the Quebec even at relatively simple projects not at all. 
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" made a note last week, the model of the syndicate used in the area of the civil engineer and advice nature is object of government inquiries. 
A short overflight permits the Quebecer enterprise register more but to name 200 syndicates of which some of constant duration seem to be. 
That way, for example the company Dessau works into partnership together with the majority of her nuclear competitors to whom SNC-Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult belong, CIMA+, Génivar. 
Any combination, and of this it gives several up, dozen explains by the very same legal entity back, namely on Dessau. 
What the syndicate "energy gérance" concerns, has minister Normandeau emphasized so that the territory of the Baie of Jame is " subject to a special labour dynamics and that hydro Québec gives invoice to this fact in a special way for the seventies ". 
Réal Laporte has the great employer the Société this énergie de La Baie James (SEBJ) given an explanation the nose about the fact has had turned up which that the contract was allowed about the project management according to agreement, '. 
"An advertising makes and there are only few applicants, your prices will jump if you." 
"So you have two possibilities: You take people either, which is on this Mart and say to you: One will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price." 
It is, however, the thought Laporte confirmed that the price is not decisive " but the expertise of the persons ". 
This contract allowed the syndicate "energy gérance" is part of a long list dollar got of the Parti Québécois from contracts about more than . 
The contracts were allowed to Eastman 1-A Sarcelle-Rupert by either the hydro Québec or the SEBJ for the project. 
After check the branch offices, among this particularly resource laboratories, between 2002 and March more than 100 engineer and consultancy contracts, the companies counted the newspaper "Le Devoir" or 2010 were granted. 
SNC-Lavalin had gathered 22 contracts to himself, Génivar had got 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without counting the participation in "energy gérance". 
All these contracts have been negotiated. 
You amount completely to $ in this, included the contract with "energy gérance" about $ in this. 
Sylvain Simard had said, that this one " you declared yourself for Quebec well liberally " Parti the four companies, this one form the syndicate (BPR, Dessau, Groupe sm and Axor), is. 
Minister Normandeau had had been touched on, the PQ is similarly connected to the companies which "financed" her before she specified that it rather is the executives.
