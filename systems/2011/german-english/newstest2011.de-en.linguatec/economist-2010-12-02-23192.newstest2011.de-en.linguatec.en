The democratic routine 
The democracy movement in Latin America gets stronger like the support of private enterprises. 
Crime is a greater problem than unemployment. 
The influence of Brazil is greater than that one of the United States in many parts of the region. 
The Latinobarómetro survey which was carried out in 18 countries and published in The Economist exclusively arrived at these conclusions. 
This survey is regularly carried out since 1995 and shows the change of opinion in this region so. 
Two facts fall eye particularly into it in this year's survey of the September and October. 
Firstly the good atmosphere in Latin America 
and secondly the growing interest in democracy and her most important institutions. 
(P. table 1) has gained in the democratic movement strongly in numerous countries at the South American pacific coast. 
E.g. where the economy grows by approx. 6% since 2002 every year the number of the democracy supporters increased from 40% in the year 2005 to 61% this year in Peru. 
Such a trend can be recognized also in Mexico where the economy recovers since the strong drop last year again. 
The half of the people asked is convinced democrats in Mexico and Brazil, the population richest countries of the region, what lowers the regional average (p. diagram 2) only? 
Approx. 44% of the people asked explained that she be satisfied with the democratic practice of her country. These are so many like last year, however 25% more than in the year 2001 ( diagram 3). 
About 34% trust the convention of her country and 45% of her government. Both values correspond to those of the last year, however, 2003 (17 % or 24% show a clear increase opposite). 
A decade ago Latin America's economic crises undermined the efforts around more democracy. 
Also this during the world economic crisis lasted, is due to it possibly that the countries of Latin America this experienced only a short one recession phase and have recovered fast again. 
Furthermore the poor were caught by a stronger social net. 
(According to the reports of the UN economic committee for Lateinamerika of this week the poverty instalment rose only insignificantly in Latin America in 2009 and has fallen by 32% this year again.) 
But there are strong atmosphere differences (p. diagram 4) of country to country. 
Silva is reflected for presidents Luiz Inácio Lula Brazil's strong economy and the popularity the dividing in a common progress intellect there. 
The case is this few in Mexico and Central America where the recession more strongly was noticeable and crimes of violence have increased. 
Only for the second time since the survey beginning, in the crime, in Latin America, in her country, many people asked see a greater problem than in unemployment (p. diagram 5). 
Either she herself or a member of the family last year victims of a crime became say approx. 31%, that. But opposite 38% last year the values have dropped and therefore reach the lowest level since 1995. 
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and the market economy: Approx. 71% of the people asked supraregionally said that the private industry is indispensable for the development, in the year 2007 it was 56% (p. diagram 6). 
Approx. 58% explained that only the market economy can bring her country progress, compared with 47% last year. 
62% of the people asked have interestingly enough kept this view in Venezuela (and are 80% for a private industry) although her left president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private enterprises. 
The greatest has 19% of the people asked (18% last year) Brazil loudly weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year). 
The people asked in Mexico and most countries of Central America, however, see in the USA the most influential country, in which this role is taken on by Venezuela in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
