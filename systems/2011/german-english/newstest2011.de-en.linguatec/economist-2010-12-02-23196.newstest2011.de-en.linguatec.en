Weak applause for China 
Taiwan's electors approach slowly a closer connection to the mainland. 
What does Taiwan think of his big brother on the other side of the strait? 
On November 27th more than 7.5 m. made electors to themselves, these are 70% of all persons entitled to vote open to vote for mayors and town councils in the five municipal districts. This is judged to be a broad assessment of the president Ma Ying-jeou. 
By the construction of pioneering business relations, incl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma is itself a symbol figure for the relations to the mainland. His policy has changed the relations to the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949 lastingly. 
Ma has passed the examination, however only scarce. 
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) puts mayors for three of five, she did not get any majority of votes. 
The democratic progressive party (DPP), the one greater independence of Taiwan approved, almost 50% of the votes, which got KMT got 45% instead. 
At a presidential election this would have meant problems for Ma. 
Since his election two years ago the percentage of votes of his party has fallen by approx. 8%. 
For the first time the DPP moved in to the town councils even together with KMT. 
During the choice it came usual occurrences like lorry convoys with rowdies, mass moves and flags swinging over only scantily dressed dancers, to this one in Taiwan. 
There was even the obligatory, mysterious murder attempt. 
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman held KMT a speech on a KMT candidate on the evening before of the election, 
when a man shot in his face from the crowd. Lien was wounded and an overleaf spectator killed. 
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the marksman wanted to kill Lien or settle a quarrel with the candidate. 
The attack has independently of it impaired the election according to the Tsai Ing-wen, the leader the DPP, and moved the DPP in a bad light which has granted KMT more votes. 
China was possibly the tallest winner of the campaign. 
The relations to the mainland remarkably did not become picks out as a central theme. 
The candidates over plans to council flats and the job creation debated instead. 
The Taiwaneses love her actual independence and decline China's armed forces threat. 
For this reason KMT does not like to put her relations to the government in Beijing to the foreground. 
But the DPP avoided this time, too, stirring the anti Chinese feelings up too much. 
She reacted thus anew consciousness, that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China. 
Ma would for his part like to be able to to confirm that the majority of the Taiwaneses approves his China policy. 
Furthermore the government in Beijing will pursue his strategy, to lure back Taiwan with economic incentives to the community. 
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit meeting for investment safety and medical cooperation. 
It surely also wishes a political integration. First but the important one. 
It thus prefers to wait to after the presidential elections in 2012. 
The DPP has invented himself newly by now. 
She was weakened strongly two years ago: The former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison because of corruption. 
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008 he stood up vehemently for the absolute independence. 
But a new generation of moderate politicians developed under Tai's reign and the DPP fights for the voices of the working persons and the youth. 
Tsai met with a great approval, like Su Tseng-chang under Chen, as a candidate for the presidency the DPP. 
Your party does everything now to show that also she is able to build up close relations to Beijing. 
Tsai plans a think tank as a contact point between the DPP and China. This presupposes however unprejudiced discussions. 
Tsai explained publicly that her party offers a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas of rash approach towards China. 
Chen seems very annoyed about this change. 
He explained from his cell the candidates would have done to this to the DPP better to insist on Taiwan's independence. 
He even asked the pragmatist Su to do without the presidency candidature. 
Also without Chen's interference the DPP has difficulties hardly to vote for her possible candidate. 
KMT will have to undergo a self-analysis of her own. 
Ma's values are bad despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to conduct her election campaign without him. 
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the still further scissors between the poor and the rich. 
According to the statement of a KMT speaker he will alter his cabinet as well as the local facilities. 
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan approves a rapprochement only restrictedly. 
Most Taiwaneses consider the economic cooperation with China unavoidable at the same time.
