Second mandate: The notoriousness 
De Gaulle really had stopped short. 
Mitterand had had thought that he stops short. 
Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the least hesitation Valéry Giscard this '. 
And Nicolas Sarkozy still less than this. 
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next one. 
The current leader becomes ergo be a candidate in 2012. 
But the notoriousness stands the side of the mystery which sticks to the presidency function to face not well. 
Therefore one must pretend to be from this time on. 
In the one and in the other meaning. 
In 2006 the supporters provided Jacques Chiracs, a third mandate is not excluded without believing even in it. 
On November 15th Nicolas Sarkozy insured in serious clay, his decision, to meet "sometime in autumn of the year 2011". 
The perspective of "two mandates" would have been touched on, therefore had spread a little feverishness for the UMP parliamentarians that he on the Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of. 
Was this the official announcement of his candidature? 
Far from it. 
The president had reminded merely that the constitutional amendment of 2008 restricts the number of five-year terms of office to merely two. 
He made an observation, no announcement. 
It is not the first time that he has mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone. 
He explained in July 2009 "you still have at the worst sifting no half years with me or at best" to them. 
On a new one in May 2010: "Do not think that I do not think after that about the phase." 
His words of the day before yesterday do not make him the candidate any more than on the day before; but also much. 
They should cause comments, then for a double reason. 
The acceleration of the race around the candidature with the hp on a side. 
However, the taking up of the competition with Ségolène Royal which drives Nicolas Sarkozy to it does not have to be revealed to herself. 
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidature in 2012, this one, the hp early than assumed admonish many members for the declaration of war. 
The bad surveys on the other side. 
For the first time the electors of the right would become the one of Nicolas Sarkozy 46% against 44% according to the survey of the BVA l a candidature of François Fillon express (') prefer. 
"We have a candidate, " and there are no discussions about it with the UMP, the environment of the prime minister reacted immediately and carefully. 
A defeat as possible would " if he, he would not be a candidate ", Jean-Pierre Raffarin informs be. 
"He always will think to be able to win", Alain Juppé who has accepted the notoriousness corrects.
