A bone house fascinates also after 100 years. You have a look the interior from fun 
The roof appears like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spinal column of a dinosaur and the balconies are fish mouths torn up. 
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. 
Of the local inhabitants the house got the nickname "bone house" with his organic forms. 
Organic forms, wild colours, the unusual use of stone, glazed tile splinters and mosaic, lines move the to façades reminding sheds and ubiquitous, typical features are all this for the Art Nouveau of Antonio Gaudi. 
The façade of the house plays with wonderful lines, tender colours and textures which remind of nature and living beings. 
Only when looking more exactly one remarks that everything is mastered by geometry, rhythm and thought-out order. 
In the night works the whole façade still more plastically, more dramatically and the special lighting still strengthens the gleam of the colours. 
Forms also master the inside of the house the same sweeping lines and gobbled up. 
Wave-likely formed wood copies the window frames, banisters, decorating elements of doors, yes even peepholes and last. 
The house Batlló in the quarter Eixample at the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia no. 43 was made from the rebuilding of a house from the year 1877 which Emilio Sala Cortese executed for architects. 
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906. 
Originally the investor, the prosperous industrialist Joseph Batlló, insisted on the demolition of the old and the making of a completely new building but he agreed to the idea Gaudís on an unusual and also cheaper reorganisation at long last. 
The block of rented flats Casa Batlló, however, did not design Antoni Gaudí by itself. 
He cooperated at this with the architect Joseph Maria Jujol. 
The decorations arose just on the drawing-board for the representative flat of the real estate owner and his idea was also the use of mosaics at the façade. 
A however also numerous further creator and artist collaborated in the design of the façade. 
The common work on the outlines for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fertile cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí. 
So Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís house Casa Milá in the park Güell in which also further works are located in Antoni Gaudí. 
Already shortly after his completion the house of the local inhabitants got the nickname "bone house" because of his organic forms. 
In turn others called it the "yawning house" because of the special window opening mechanism. 
One also says the sword of Saint Georg, the patron saint is represented by Catalonia on the building right at the top. 
But also further sculptural elements symbolize hidden religious motives. 
Gaudí designed a central heating system unique for the time then for the house with venting channels and typical fireplaces. 
Her 45 degree inclination already appears a little bizarre. 
In the field of his work Gaudí ignored consistently all construction specifications then and let himself be put off by these not at all. 
Before start of building he caught up of the town with the corresponding planning and building permission but the details made by him on the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers were so horrified of the result at the completion two years later, that they required remedy. 
Among other things the councillors also disapproved of it, that the making even intruded on the public pavement with his pillars. 
To changes it did not come quite the reverse any more, though, Joseph Batlló made an application to the approval of the letting out of the two most situated stories of the house only fifteen days after the request of the district regarding this, and she was assigned to him promptly. 
The house-owner himself moved into the lower floors. 
A society parlour was located in the gallery in the 2nd floor, the bedrooms and private rooms of the flat were located in the third floor. 
The ground floor was leased to a jeweller's shop. 
The complete six-storied building passes through stairs to the housetop terrace to up. 
By the fundamental elements of the reorganisation became all right angles and straight lines removes and by turned and swung walls replaces. 
However, Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of rooms. 
The social part can be connected completely by opening the drawing-room doors and a larger society could talk comfortably so without having to do without a certain intimacy during more confidential conversations. 
Reorganisation also got a quite unusual roof and another two stories the house by Gaudís apart from a new façade. 
And the air wells impressively is, also Gaudís game with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles glazed the inner courtyard is covered with these. 
The game of these two colours awards a maximum amount of light to all floors of the house. 
He made use simply, that the light reflects whitely better of the principle when dark colours which on the contrary absorbs the sunlight to this. 
The 2005 into the world heir list of the Unesco the house Casa Batlló you took, can pay a visit to everyone today. 
The most spacious and most splendid flat is accessible to the public on the first floor made. 
The house-owners decided in for these step and this on occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator first. 
When one noticed that one quite lucrative business is one kept the inspections the housetop terrace, one stretched her also on further common ones and the attic storey rooms, inclusive out. 
The price for the inspection of the historical monument is not a chicken feed, though, he is 16,50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist identity cards get 20 per cent reduction. 
This amount surpasses the admission charges in the town to other Gaudí buildings. 
Who did friendship with one of the occupants of the house would like to get to know the genuine atmosphere of the house with his hang-glider turrets, should have a try?
