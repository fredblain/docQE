Supply offensive for the hunting for customers for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona 
The dictatorship of the calendar drops an avalanche this year. 
The celebrations paid by employees spread. You do not want to issue any more than 20 to 30 euros. 
How the Turrón and the christmas draw gives it again in the pre-christmas period to group dinners which supply the restaurants and leisure trade with Barcelona's oxygen, too. But because of the economic crisis they trigger a price offensive to also capture the customer segment which represents the big mass: Everyone almost would like between 20 and 30 euros for one noon or confirms dinners distribute the questioned businessmen and associations. 
The accounting gets even a bit more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eves fells) for a Friday has dropped all orders in the week from December 13th with the result of an avalanche of reservations of dinners on two top days (the 16. and 17.) and hardly any so that orders in the week before that. 
Having when the bad times started many enterprises stopped the group dinners since 2008 for household reasons. 
To not have to abstain from this tradition, many employees pay these from her own bag. 
As the economic situation also always lies, lowest prices are asked does the chairman of the restaurant committee confirm of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs? 
Up till now the representative of the holding organization does not venture to predict how the holidays this month will look. 
"People think it over ' umpteen time, before they reserve." 
He emphasizes "you would like to go out but respect her strongly on the prices". 
The business will turn out all right these, "the quality at good prices with a good service offers", he adds and calls us in the memory that the customers economize in times of crisis, why prices are asked for by 25 euros most strongly. 
At a survey in various centrally situated restaurants it turns out that the evening of December 17th leads the suppliers to the collapse. 
The group of Soteras says the demands would less but to spend 30 euros boom with the intention for this Friday. The group has adapted her menus to the economic situation with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros. 
With another leading group, Andilana, the 16 restaurants in the town (Hostal de La Rita, market, La Fonda and others) maintains, the peculiarity of the calendar has led to preferred reservations even as of the beginning of November. 
He explains "we have made the impossible possible to maintain last year's prices with menus for every taste of 19,95 to 30 euros". 
To Grup, the tbsp of mush sol, Attic, QuQu and altogether 23 restaurants conducts, does not lose the optimism one at, since the second quarter the takings flourish again and good if you await also on prospects of the Christmas trade concentrated few days after. 
Sources of the consortium stress that the 18th also will be a hyperactive day with friend groups, the Christmas early celebrations. 
A Christmas menu was added to the six group menus for 30 euros or more than price hit. One has the impression that the customers are ready to distribute 10 per cent more than in the previous year and in return more wish details such as Cava. 
One sees green rungs also in some companies sprouting why the employees are invited again. This conveys the impression that the group meals are again in the upswing. 
The acting chairman, Enric Gomà, seeing the end of the tunnel on this familiarly and remark on the part of the holding organization Fecasarm with associations like the pubs, restaurant and leisure association of Barcelona that the reservations altogether are quite "lively" although the customers "hammer out a maximum". 
The fun with celebrating has not declined no matter who pays, though.
