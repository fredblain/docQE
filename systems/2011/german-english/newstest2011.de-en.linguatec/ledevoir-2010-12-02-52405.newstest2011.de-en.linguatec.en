Worldwide plan for the renewal of the lights 
UNO has suggested a plan in Cancun for the renewal of the illumination of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with regard to the obtainment of a reduction of the greenhouse gas (CFC) which almost corresponds to a third of the additional diminution which must be carried out yesterday to stabilize the earth climate to 2020. 
This ambitious plan takes his position in the step of the concrete large-scale projects which hopes around the absence from mandatory diminution obligations of the industrial countries to compensate to convert UNO in Cancun. 
According to the plan put forward yesterday the main problem would be avoided in form of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of the CFC handed in due to the lights on the earth if light-emitting diodes (LED) would, the white-hot bulb which represents till now another monopoly from 50 to 70% on the market or still improve fluorescing by be replacing. 
The lights are responsible for 8% of the worldwide emissions. 
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the waste gases of the worldwide fleet of vehicles. 
The great waste gas issuers like the United States, China, Europe and a different one under which Canada also counted which the global CFC emissions of 53 Gt should lower on 49 Gt had committed themselves to doing voluntary diminution plans in Copenhagen last year. 
Of these balance sheets one still should remove 5 Gt, however, to stabilize the climate increase by 2 degrees centigrade of today up to the year 2020 around to prevent that this turns out out of control. 
In the white-hot bulbs escapes 95% of the energy in the form of warmth and the remaining 5% produce the light. 
The energy consumption goes down by 75% with the compact luminescent material bulbs, with the new LED light bulbs one reduces this energy requirement around the double one again. 
The compact luminescent material bulbs hold on average to 10,000 hours between 6000. 
Has has a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and uses up 80% less energy than a white-hot bulb, what a hint of the one economizing possibilities of the exchange plan arranges which shall be used in 100 countries put the new LED light bulbs, such as those, that one of the manufacturers Philips, on the market this week, this society has by the way taken part in the UNO study. 
Besides the fact that these completely new light bulbs only hand in very little warmth they can work also with a rheostat. 
And they contain no mercury. 
Several specialists has shown, that compact luminescent material pears show reserves, since they contain mercury and that one can dispose of her as a special waste because of what is not always possible in the developing countries unless the producers make a reception available. 
The main source to mercury emissions on the planet, however, does not represent the compact luminescent material bulb according to the report but around which electricity rather wasted the coal power stations of the white-hot bulbs which ejects considerably more mercury to produce. 
These coal power stations eject 25,000 tons of mercury alone in the United States every year. 
The report explains in detail the profits which every country thanks to this international programme would gain. 
Indonesia would save such for example a billion dollar at the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2 every year, this means an equivalent of 3.5 coal power stations whose building Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
