So more than a third of almost four thousand being correct giving businessmen decided. 
So the national insurance administration required a paper statement from the register of companies even if the official could him have called by two mouse clicks. 
Thanks to the opinion poll this changes now. 
The Czech national insurance administration "will" require no more statements from the register of companies at controls of national insurance payers in future, cited the spokeswoman of CSSZ Jana Buranová. 
It, all regulations and orders to take a close look, is for meaning and purpose of the opinion poll "absurdity of the year" which businessmen have to fulfil in Czechia and lift the nonsensical ones. 
This is already for the fourth time part of a business competition, the one of the tsch, this year. (HN) is organized and in public growing popularity enjoys business paper. 
If persons participated in the vote to the three thousand last year, these were already four thousand this year. 
No miracle hindering the enterprise activity because there still is a set of legal duties which only and alone serve. 
"What the number of income tax forms for example concerns, we take a front rank in the world", remarks Karel Havlícek of the union of small and perigynous enterprises and trader of the Czech Republic. 
The simplification of the entrepreneurial activity is the proclaimed aim of all governments within the last few years. 
In comparison with the world the situation in Czechia has hardly improved, though. 
According to the information from the World Bank Czechia ranks 74th one around eight places with respect to the enterprise conditions, in comparison with the previous year worse placing. 
The competition absurdity of the year was for the first time in exclaimed and every year happens after the same scenario.

Martin Kocourek informed the minister industry and trade "there can not be any real economic upswing where the state throws the businessmen sticks between the legs, therefore it is my aim of lifting at least thirty sections every year which unnecessarily makes her businesses more difficult for the businessmen today certainly". 
The efforts, nonsensical orders to make from the world, show effect. 
In 2007 it disturbed people to want to drive the duty imposed on businessmen to have to notify the trade office at the place of her permanent operational facility of the intention in advance for three days with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or kermis most. 
This duty was lifted by virtue of an amendment of the trade law. 
The 2007 number of votes got the second largest the duty - it became a so-called "green card" to have to notify the duty, the employment office of business trips of employees on the scale up to 30 days by the law about her - abolished. 
And - all good things come in threes: 
To the absurdity of the year 2009 the ordinance was chosen, this one imposed on physiotherapists, in the consulting room unite mirrors, a refrigerator and two scales, stand to have. 
This ordinance was soothed to some extent by the brazilian ministry of health this year, the refrigerator duty was discontinued.
