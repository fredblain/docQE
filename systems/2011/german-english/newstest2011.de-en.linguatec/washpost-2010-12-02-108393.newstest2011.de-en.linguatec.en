Cambodian rouge veterans with the past forced to the confrontation 
The director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds rouge leader Ta Mok in a classroom with dirty and flaking walls which is weakly lit and concreted to the later cambodian of the man who has built him. 
"Ta Mok loves everybody here." 
"He was a good leader and he has taken care of his people" said strictly chose Ma for 42 years. 
Because of his brutality during the cambodians' rouge power known as "the butcher" the commander remains popular in these remote former cambodians' rouge stronghold in the northwest of Cambodia, he have hospitals and bridges developed built, the infrastructure and where thousands more formerly still live soldiers where. 
But long-standing supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng this year, 12 years after the surrender of the cambodians rouge opposite the government. 
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum permitted the victims the public confrontation with the people who have supported the regime once. 
The government distributed a schoolbook, this the story of the cambodians rouge told to children of former soldiers for the first time in June. 
The former boss of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, and a community tribunal of the UNO and Cambodia sentenced for the first time a former member of the cambodians rouge in July as it, to 35 years in prison sentenced confessed better as. 
With each of these developments the fear grew under the cambodian rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, aggravated her efforts around reconciliation and reintegration to the society of Cambodia. 
The documentation centre there still are rejection and fear in the former cambodians' rouge but they have no power, something " ", of Cambodia, an independent organisation which investigates the regime, Chang said to Youk, leader. 
"The life was glorious for her under the cambodians' rouge but the regime has become a symbol of the bad." 
"It splits families itself." 
During the cambodians' rouge power in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979 approximately 1.7 million people were executed or they died of illnesses, revision or of hunger. 
When the Vietnamese collapsed and brought the pole pot Ied government down in 1979, the holdovers of the regime and his armed forces fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand. 
They spread unrest here until Decembers 1998 as which last movement surrendered. 
Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerilla war of her base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok consulted the next generation in Anlong Veng as a pole. 
But in the middle of the 1990s years large groups of cambodian led to the first democratic elections of the country, started with rouge fighters as a peace agreement 1993 promoted by UNO to the government to overflow, what led to the surrenders of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998. 
Pole pot died a natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok which had not given in was arrested 1999 of government strengths at the Dangrek Mountainss. 
He died in prison of Phnom Penh where he waited for his process in 2006. 
When her patrons protected her no more, most former cambodians rouge fighter in the trying poverty of rural Cambodia escaped and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory. 
Some reconcile elitist official even if the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated smallholders cambodians rouge kept her local government positions because they laid her weapons down this one. 
"These people have only very little profited from the surrender", said Sok Leang of the centre for justice and reconciliation, this in all of Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng, public fora holds 
"You are established in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime." 
"You grew up without any professional knowledge." 
This one leading himself around a life as a poor rice smallholder before he sat down in 1998 55 years in 1974 when teenager of the Rhmer had attached rouge, fought in the jungle around approval Veng, Sor Lim. 
"The life under the cambodians' rouge was good", he said. 
"Ta Mok has given everybody something to eat." 
"The life is hard but now because we must take care of us." 
The regular cambodians rouge tribunal have worries evoked also here? 
This becomes court try at the beginning of next year to put on trial Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his woman as well as Ieng Thirith, another earlier cambodian rouge minister. 
The order of the court is to condemn it, the old leaders and those which mainly are responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said, whether it will pursue further deeds out of over these four cases. 
This has contributed little to moderate the fears in Anlong Veng. 
Current medium speculations have open concentrated in the Chaem for 64 years, this one had been Manteay Meanchey in the province during the cambodians' rouge power within the late 1970s years district boss. 
In 2007 she had told about Cambodia to representatives of the documentation centre, she has conducted the making of the Trapeang dam topic, a project at which thousands of forced labour convicts presumably died. 
In a hot evening came back in the Chaem from the work in the fields to her frame-house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng. 
As the sun for a long time shade on the withered grass threw declined in the Chaem to discuss her past at the cambodians' rouge. 
If the court should summon her, then she would refuse to go, she said. 
"Cambodia lives into peace and into stability", she said. 
"If there were no more followings, war would be here." 
Prime minister Hun Sen who has fled 1878 of the cambodians' rouge has accuse although experts and historians discuss this warned in addition repeated it would become the court suspicious of more that the situation would get unsafe. 
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past", he said. 
But what must do Cambodia to be able to come on is the confrontation with the past, Chang Youk of the documentation centre said. 
The broken pieces collect reconciliation with the cambodian times meant " ", he said. 
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that be able to understand like everything." 
The centre created the first schoolbook approved by the government about the cambodians rouge, the 75-sided story "of democratic Cambodia". 
In June, it distributed the book in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the history book for the High School of the ministry of education which less than four sides contains rouge about the cambodians. 
How often in Cambodia do the young people know only some in Anlong Veng about the cambodians rouge despite the connections of the town to the regime? 
Air Valeak, 19 years, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new schoolbook helps the students to understand an important part of her story. 
But his parents reacted sceptically when he brought the book with home to read it. 
"My family declines many parts of the book and the court", he said. 
"You are mistrustful because they are not sure as many people are sentenced by the court." 
Such a resistance puts on reconciliation trial complexly and complicatedly, Sok Leang said. 
But the public fora, the schoolbook and the court attain little by little influence ", he said. 
A powerful still has the cambodians rouge attraction here. 
Dirty way to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof carries a overgrown by bushes and with plastic waste above in the Dangrek mountains. 
Pot polarize body had been burned after his death in 1998 on a tyre heap here. 
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a mobile telephone seller at the roadside, said she did not know much over the man who had been burned here. 
"He, however, has a strong mind and many people go here to him to pray", she said. 
She it was Nuom Sotheas birthday and then wanted on the day pot to pole be for last resting-place where she will put bananas a bush down more ripely in the hope that he brings her luck.
