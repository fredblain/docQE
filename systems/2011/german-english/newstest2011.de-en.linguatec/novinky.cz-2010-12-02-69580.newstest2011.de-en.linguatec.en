The anti corruption police carried out arrests in the building of the floor fund in Plzen within the last few days. 
The local medium businessman and real estate agents Lubos G. of the private investigators became had a laxative effect into handcuffs. 
This had tried allegedly to manipulate a public competition just taking place for the carrying out of claims for restitution so that the properties offered in the competition fell to a concrete interested party. 
This shall have paid Lubos G. half a million for this. 
The Plzen public prosecutor's office of the newspaper "Právo" I only can "" confirm at this time that the police follow a person because of the crime of deceitful wheelings and dealings at a public competition, Antonie Zelená said, she cannot broader details grant with regard to the regular examinations, the boss. 
The 46-year-old businessman was dismissed by the police again 24 hours later. 
How he manipulate the public competition could, about this can one speculate only in view of the scanty official information? 
The spokeswoman of the floor fund Lubomír Cerná led on the question of Právo regarding this, this one police actually have arrests carried out and this during a public competition in the Plzen extension of the floor fund. 
"It was all about a client and not at all all about one of our employees", she put in concrete terms. 
The public competition had the correct name "request for the tendering of claims to the transportation of properties in accordance with the floor law" according to Mrs Cerná and would take place in cases in which several applicants on show the offered property interest. 
"These persons offer a higher value of her claims for restitution to be settled by the assignment in the context of the request than the exclaimed real estate value." 
"The order of the potential buyers is limited according to the offered claims, the floor fund then transfers the property to the person with the highest supply", explains the spokeswoman of the fund. 
Obviously information was at Lubos G.'s disposal, who applied because of the request had and he was alone authorized person there, had there he bought a number of claims for restitution for himself, he offered one real-estate interests that he retires from the competition. 
Obviously compensation greases against one. 
This also would be an adequate explanation why he had such a large amount of money on him at his arrest. 
Lubos G. already had contacts too good in the past to the Plzen floor fund. 
So he played Václav Sankota who was followed criminally because he returned properties into substitute restitutions to which location decisions had already been made to building schemes a role also in the Causa of the former boss of the floor fund. 
Lubos G. purchased for example properties by the floor fund at that time which were intended for the making of public streets in the place, too, said more exactly, where the making of the access main transport line to the commercial district Borské polarizes planned was. 
Later, he exchanged these for a house very favourably with the municipal authorities directly in the historical centre of the town which far exceeded the value of the properties. 
Giving in must reluctantly the city hall at that time to not endanger the building scheme by the blocking of the properties.
