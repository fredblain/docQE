Government bond for the take-over of eXcentris 
The Quebecers government which in parallel was asked by the Société Angus as well as the enterprise to participate financially in the take-over of the cinema complex eXcentris explains to himself with an a cooperation's agreeably, however only in form of one competitive loan. 
Parallel, these did not have for enterprises his real cinematic function to over-answers, receivedly obvious what they have required the developer company Angus as well as this, around this again, hoped for a donation in the amount of seven million dollars of the Ministry of Education and the Arts for the take-over of the Daniel Langlois of belonging cinema complex eXcentris on the boulevard Saint Laurent. 
Although the government has himself accepted, to involve in this thing, though on her own terms. 
Instead of the expected donation a loan in lower height hoped initially as this one which could bring a viable solution on advantageous terms into being at least in opinion rather offers the Quebecers government this one from sources taking destitute of the state gossip factory. 
A first action plan as well as an inquiry after 12.8 million have been rejected by the Quebec already last spring, this petition was made go down sum moderately once more since this. 
This one already became " a suggestion together with an action plan Société de développement of the entreprises cultural " (SODEC) sent to minister St-Pierre of the president who conducts the file eXcentris, François Macerola. 
He had sent her a last factual report several days ago. 
The counterproposal of the cabinet was transmitted, however, to the SODEC on Wednesday. 
Parallel and Angus have now until December 31st time to respond to it. 
Anyway the premise of the state donation seems to have been pressed really aside. 
We call each other, that the Quebecers owner community of the cinemas and cinema complexes had rebelled against a direct state investment to the support of the take-over of eXcentris, she put forward the argument, this one the Minister of Education and the Arts does not have to help financially for property projects there by he has not also other cinema halls sent. 
Several other participants in the market of the segment sued, however, for a material, economic aid unlike this. 
Cinema boss Daniel Langlois had presented the author cinema under great difficulties in the premises of his cinema complex after the own financed construction of the cinema more than ten years for a long time which the special position could justify on the part of the treasury. 
The lack of cinema halls which show independent films is more than obvious in Montreal and eXcentris knew how to hold his clients at the bar. 
The Société Angus as well as the enterprise steer for their part for a campaign financed privately of which they hope for a sum $ to boost the acquisition parallel with Christian Yaccarini at the lead. 
Since the spring 2009 only one single canvas has continued namely Le to show films in eXcentris parallel. 
It is aim of the future buyers to open the three cinema halls of year next to February 27th with the demonstration of the very excellent film of Xavier Beauvoir of "the bar et of the dieux" newly. 
However, Christian Yaccarini has not recalled the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group keep of the suggestions made go down which one has made to them.
