No objections of the Spanish government to CIA flights 
The Spanish government did not have any objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaeda prisoners over a Spanish national territory to Guantánamo as the U.S.A. results from a telegram of the ambassador in Madrid. 
The documents revealed by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily "El País" (by cables) reflect this. It is the Spanish government shall that the former acting head of the government María Teresa Fernández de demanded La Vega be informed, added, " to prove, that foreign aeroplanes which overflies Spain are supervised adequately " 
The former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de consulted La Vega in June 2006 after the publication of a report of the Council of Europe in which financial assistance in human right disdaining practices was accused addressing with the familiar 'du'-form for countries, among this also Spain, in one. 
The acting head of the government admitted, "Zapatero has the report of the council met in the offside" and confirmed Spain has nothing to hide in this matter. 
"La Vega underlined, De Spain does not have any objections to the secret service flights over a Spanish national territory." 
"You simply only would like to be informed" to "be not surprised without preparation", reports Aguirre by cables. 
The former Foreign Secretary, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government does not " want to give this matter great attention although the government only has few chances to exercise one's influence, since these would be in the hands of the judges." 
The public prosecutor Vicente González gave for his part the embassy in January 2007 to understand that he would not the judicial initiative jam apply for the declassification of the documents of the Spanish secret service head office (CNI) and the Minister of Defence about the CIA flights. 
"These reports contain no charging or sensitive information", explained the ambassador after a conversation with the public prosecutor. 
About the "apparent coordination between the Spanish public prosecutor and the German public prosecutors", the USA were nevertheless more worried than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence. 
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts for the discreet handling" between governments, lamented for Aguirre. 
At a lunch in March 2007 in which the ambassador of the USA and the Spanish Home Secretary Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba took part the latter commented, that "what they regard" although the Spanish judges are strongly concerned about her independence and would do this incredibly as adequate, he has given his employees instructions "to avoid puffed-uply rhetorical comments to let the tension drop" 
The ambassador also expressed his anxiety about the procedure of the PP in this matter. 
"Despite her generally pro-American attitude our experience teaches us from a note that the government Zapateros actions of the USA that the PP will not doubt, will ", he stresses this one beat capital when possible violations of human rights could be interpreted, tolerate or have ignored deliberately even if these uncoverings could have a negative effect on the government of the USA.
