The right mattress and the right bedding down grid? Women have other wishes than men 
Not the most terrific bed framework but the quality of the mattress area mattress and grid therefore agree on the good bed. 
These must complete themselves harmoniously, though, to do justice to the wishes of the concrete user. 
In the choice many things play a role, the weight, the size, the state of health and not least also the sex of the sleeper. 
The interior in which mattress and grid have to subordinate themselves is also just as important. 
Typical example? 
Latex mattresses are not suitable well in a weekend house in which you do not regularly have the heating on, since they need much longer to "get warm". 
Furthermore they are considerably heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses. 
They should be turned regularly and. 
If they do not have enough little venting channels in the core and are to this on a solid plate still namely, humidity dams himself: So it is not ruled out that mould forms under her. 
In the election of course also plays a role, to what one is used. 
Abroad who was for some time where very high mattresses are usual with soft stratum will a low mattress get used with a hard surface heavily on be able to. 
"All ice-hockey players which has come back from the NHL have welfare complained that they can sleep no longer correctly here to me." 
"They simply need a soft shift for her toiled shoulders, heels and hips from Visco foam (memory Foam - a shape memory polymer)." 
"Among other things I recommend these to also diabetic people who suffers from a disturbance of the nervous system so that they can receive the "information" badly from the joints and the skin", Sylva Hadamcziková explains which specializes in upholstered furniture. 
Therefore I have already got many ice-hockey players but also other customer these mattresses with Visco foam (memory Foam) years ago. 
"This is no more problem today because the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico offers such mattresses among others." 
And one does not certainly have to be a famous ice-hockey player to learn to appreciate the advantages of the Visco foam. 
This "miracle" very simply works actually. 
The foam optimalises his hardness and form according to the absorbed warmth, different said, he nestles up really at the warm body. 
It pushes nowhere, in the night one does not roll around like after a heavy fight. 
One simply sleeps much better. 
Furthermore the viscoelastic foam also offers protection from decubitus (gangrene). 
One still should add the length of the soles of the foot to the height in the election of the mattress size that is approx. 21 to 34 cm. 
These about 180 cm are big, need such a 210 to 220 cm long bed man like woman. 
At least 90 cm of couch breadth should together that is 180 cm be at each's of the sleepers disposal. 
120 to 140 cm are appropriate at single beds for example at singles. 
On account of the comfort and also for possible visitors. 
The following rule of thumb otherwise applies to the ideal bed breadth: "Enough room still should, if one lies on the back, be for the arms bent easily", advises engineer Helena Prokopová, the guild master of the upholsterers and interior decorators who devotes herself to the difficulties of the healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture already for years and reports this topic also on technical colleges. 
Everybody needs a grid of his own and his own mattress, however, pay attention at the purchase at a double bed, so that the mattresses are also just as high. 
Nothing else otherwise is left but to put the cooking surfaces together in different height and this is not possible at every bed framework by far. 
Foam mattresses at least three centimetres should be at least 14 cm highly, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, of this should be allotted to the form stratum and the fine cushion. 
"One may feel the feathers by no means with the hand or when putting down", warns Helena Prokopová. 
Every mattress requires a special grid type. 
Whole upholstered beds with mattress and pad like Siam twins grown together have to look for nothing in the bedroom. 
These mattresses can not be let some air in and one can not wash the reference, today, what already a matter of course is. 
The mattress after five to seven years and one loses, is clear there in one single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat that becomes slow to a gigantic one (and stopped sieve up). 
Also because of this experts decline advertising slogans, of promise up to 25 years, yes even lifelong guarantee this one at mattresses a life time. 
Every thing has her ifs and buts. 
And therefore a practical council of the dealers: One should not shun the hygiene of the washable, deductible income at mattresses of 120 or 140 cm of breadth, recommends himself nevertheless to use a mattress cover which one can easily remove and wash. 
The manipulation often appears even if, today, mattress income is established with all around zip-fastener, as a rule, so that one gets after opening two halves (immensely important to the washing process and the washing machine size)!, with bigger mattresses like the dissimilar fight between David and Goliath, executed primarily alone. 
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a rust? 
Out so that! 
Or at the most for a bed for unloved guests and for one single night. 
They should provide the plate with cooling holes rather, (provided that none already are into this), and use mattresses with feather skeleton and 15 cm of minimum altitude with so-called bag inner-spring and fine cushion also so. 
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a pad. 
Latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable for not adjustable gratings with 14 to 18 spring contact strips (lamellae) (if necessary also combinations of latex and coconut), grids always pay off with a larger slat number therefore of 28 and more spring contact strips with lumbar support in the lumbar vertebrae region and the possibility, regulating the slat hardness. 
No mattresses belong on adjustable lamellar grids with feather skeleton since they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment. 
Besides the attitude of the stiffness of the spring contact strips also special flexible shoulder modules are demanded. 
Goes around a special fastening of the spring contact strips which makes it possible to press in the spring contact strips or to wind really so that they make possible sinking in selectively for the shoulder of the sleeper. 
By name for men with broad shoulders an important thing. 
There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use soft zones for the shoulder area at "sir mattresses." 
Also the ladies are thought, one is glad for them to have these soft zones in the hip area. 
Point elastic wing feather systems (Lattoflex) or grills are intended for most demanding customers with point elastic contact pads with a so-called multi-torsion springing. 
The pressure is distributed on several points, through what the tension is reduced. 
To the right one one a bad (too great and corpulent) pillow uses mattress and right grid, most advantages are lost again but if. 
Also here a rule of thumb: The pillow shall support the head, his tops only should reach the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax. 
Ideally a 50 x 60 therefore appears to cm of a big cushion, like it the Scandinavians for example like. 
In the side position the pillow should compensate for the shoulder height (together with the shoulder relief zone in the grid or the soft zone in the mattress). 
Our modern mattresses have got with the former palliasses (filled) hay commonly have something anyway. 
Modern manufacturers always more frequently use natural materials or at least their additions. 
The new magic word "biol" is called also at mattresses. 
Instead of mineral oil raw materials one always more frequently uses temperaments oils - for example castor-oil and soya oil for the production of polyurethane foams. 
Soya is used by all well-known manufacturers well. 
Biol is ", said her core consists of materials of purely natural origin Petr Vašícek of the company Tropico explains plus this ", at mattresses. 
However, natural substances are - the first used also at the production of mattress income one aloe was Vera. 
However, one also can allow himself microcapsules which spread a fresh woods or lavender smell when sleeping. 
One makes a difference between man and woman also here. 
While with the men one "refrigerant" plant extract from birch newspapers is used so that the mattress earnings can absorb the warmth and cool the body down, the income has "warming" effect for women. 
Extracts from red peppers activate the blood circulation, so the weakerer sex gets warm when sleeping pleasantly. 
And today's favourites? 
Mattresses from cold foam he (has bigger pores with a destroyed cell structure and therefore is more breathable than customary polyurethane and also many more flexibly). 
Increase zone mattresses which exactly know are made from the combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and Visco foams, where head, hip and heels are. 
For a high-quality mattress one has to pay 7000 crowns and more, though. 
However, health mattresses are charged usually by a less value added tax since they are regarded as medical aids. 
As the first Czech enterprise this advantage was granted to Gumotex. 
One sees, it is so easy not to economize at the mattress and at the grid. 
There are special offers of manufacturers and dealers now and then who offer two mattresses at a price of one. 
So the brand Magniflex offers the mattress Duofreeze with Visco foam memory turned into desert in the purchase for 11.990 CZK. 
One gets the second to it freely. 
It was the material Tempur which started the era of the viscoelastic foam materials with open cell structure and high density in almost cosmic tempo. 
They were not developed for NASA anyway any miracle, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the starts. 
Tempur gets soft in warmth, in turn it hardens in a cool environment. 
So it adapts to the human body perfectly and distributes the body printing in an optimal way. 
It therefore is not only ideal for the prevention of pressure fire but increases the sleeping convenience generally. 
However, viscoelastic foam materials will be supposed to provide the legs and the vessels of relief with it, not used only at mattresses but also at other health products such as at special foot cushions. 
Local manufacturers use for example the foam materials Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
