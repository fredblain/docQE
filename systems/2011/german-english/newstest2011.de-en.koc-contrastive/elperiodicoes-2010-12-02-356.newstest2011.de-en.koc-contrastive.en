Sport and regelumgehung 
Tricks such as that of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the desire to avoid a penalty. 
The supposedly of two players of real Madrid (xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) proposed exclusion in the game on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League led to much ink has been shed, about whether it is a unsportliche action or not and whether any both players should be sanctioned by UEFA. 
As is well known, the two players lost a couple of minutes to go (your team had already won clearly) time and played several fouls, so that the referee showed them the second yellow card. 
In this way, and as the Real Madrid his group, the two players would be the prescribed sanction in the next ligaspiel against auxerre and so without playing cards in the next spielphase. 
Finally, the disziplinarkommitee of UEFA, the coach of the club, José mourinho, with two to play and the players involved with various sums of money. 
The provocation of a yellow card in this or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football. 
It is so widespread that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this game - is visible rules. 
Part of the debate about the fact that outlined case that a team from the football clubs, Real Madrid (who, in his anthem edelmut and honor claims and on other occasions, his players had punished for similar incidents), and the key role played in the drama by mourinho, the more an episode to its long history as theatralischer and provocative engineers has added. 
In any case, the debate about whether this is not explicitly of the statutes of illicit behaviour runs counter to the principles of the sport, that is, whether these actions represent a regelumgehung. Indeed, believes that this approach to the statutes of the sport, but appear to circumvent its meaning. 
In this matter should be of the sporting spirit ailment being investigated. 
The sporting spirit defends the physical integrity of the challengers, an aspect that, through these actions was not at risk, because it was not aggressive play. 
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the force the players an unfair advantage from the gegenteam. This was not done. 
The paradox of the plot of the players of real Madrid is that they do not match up to what we normally regard as falschspiel or regelumgehung understand, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly taken place, in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be so visibly as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. 
The players waited and took the sanction to go. 
Another question is, what kind of advantage the ban from the deliberate fouls. 
Here, it should be emphasised that the rival either in a disadvantageous position has yet been brought advantages for the feigned game were erheischt because, the obvious result of this action was that their own team with fewer players had to play. 
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game because the club has not then on these players. 
The advantage is obviously the players that the next spielphase of the Champions League without playing cards, their participation in a future game could begin to threaten. 
But it is a long-term, up to a certain extent uncertain advantage, since the team eventually could exit. Moreover, players with this approach to a sanction and go in the second kartenzyklus about where they are because of kartenanhäufung with a card less than in the first cycle of exit. 
That is not so clear is whether it is really an advantage. 
Ultimately settle such practices are not against the sporting spirit, which also include strategic decisions, the rules in order to derive maximum benefit. 
In this case the players wanted to avoid any penalty (this would really be a clear case of regelumgehung), they wanted more, when you choose this. 
They made a strategic decision, without a penalty saved, before her, or to flee. 
Although the border between imagination and regelumgebung blur is, I believe that this issue is a clear case of inventiveness. 
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because it was about two selbstausschlüsse and because of the nature of the regelübertragung unprovoked. 
The damage of the principles of the sport by these actions inflicted is less ethical rather than aesthetic nature.
