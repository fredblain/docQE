World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the ausrichterland 
In a state of great excitement because of suspicions of appoints the FIFA executive committee on Thursday, the ausrichterländer the 2018 and 2022 world cups, a highly political election, in which the rangeln for influence, as well as the lobbying the technical criteria in the background are threatening to push. 
One thing is certain, however: the 2018 edition of the FIFA is accepted in Europe, its traditional stronghold, are held (the four candidates: England, Russia, spanien-portugal, niederlande-belgien). 
The edition 2022 will then be something exotic; the international football association hopes after the premiere on the African continent in the years 2010 new territories (Qatar), Australia, to be able to win, or its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) will continue to follow. 
The list of figures who deemed the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch leader, Zidane and Beckham, Cruyff) is the degree of economic and political use of the World Cup. 
The machinations behind the scenes so threatening to the last minute. 
Difficult otherwise, a hierarchy of the candidates. 
After the FIFA offer an evaluation report, the English, spanisch-portugiesische (2018) and American (2022) act bessseren arguments than those of their competitors. 
But these are considerations for the 22 members of the exekutifkommitees moment of choice is not so important. 
The Sunday Times, with the establishment of the suspension of two members of the exekutifkommitees (reynald temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, could just as well the opportunities for their own country, cradle of football, can ruin that, once the World Cup was allowed to proceed, namely in 1966. 
The BBC asked the ground again on Monday, giving them a story was broadcast, the three senior members of the kommitees, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas leoz and Issa hayatou under fire. 
Reason enough to alienate the FIFA and the British designers to embarrass the primarily with David Cameron in these last weeks had an intensive lobbying. 
The government hopes for a repeat of his predecessor, Tony Blair, the schachzuges successful in 2005 for London the organisation of the Olympic Games of 2012 had achieved. 
Would this intensive use in order to comply with the image of England before the kommitee upgrade again? 
Nothing is less certain, because the duo spanien-portugal does not lack trump cards, with its already finished stadiums, his expertise (82 World Cup in Spain, the Olympic Games in Barcelona in 1992, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and his fußballkultur. 
But the economic and financial shades of the two countries could dampen their ambitions. 
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal are the chances of Russia, which, despite its shortfalls, in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transportation) for the weighty has become marginalised, climb. 
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has, however, decided the openly suggestion on the bezichtigungen the English press "an unfair competition in the preparations for the vote" on the part of the kommiteemitglieder. 
"It bewirft it with dirt, they are trying to embarrass them," Putin lashed out. 
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, the logical to be favourites. 
First economic world power, seat of the fifa-hauptsponsoren, the country seems a long list of advantages to Japan and South Korea, the separately have drawn up a very good project. 
But this new candidatures seem premature for two countries, the competitions in 2002 had co-organised. 
Another threat: the long-expected approval by FIFA, the World Cup in 2026 for China, the Asian opportunities in 2022 will lapse. 
With Australia and Qatar, with the aufwartung futuristischer stadiums had pulled out all the stops, the FIFA their expansion into new areas, but these two countries to a greater risk because certainty. 
Australia could also be used, such as Japan and South Korea under the of the European countries akquittierten weakness of the television (because of the zeitverschiebung) have to endure, the sensitive nerve centre of FIFA.
