Arsen-resistente microbe could new life on the earth or elsewhere allow 
The discovery of a strange variety of arsenic, which can live opens up new possibilities for new life on the earth and elsewhere. 
Although scientists say this unusual bacterium discovered here on earth, it is their view, a sign that a life without the previously deemed vital elements is possible. 
"This organism has two possibilities." 
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." 
"It makes it to a very particular, although it is almost a kind of 'alien' way of life is," said c.w. Paul Davies of Arizona State University and co-autor of the report, which the Internet on Thursday in the journal Science. 
So far, six key elements as vital - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. 
But, as the scientists figured out the bacterium grows mono lake in California and then still further, if it phosphorus replaced by arsenic. 
"one wonders what else is possible," said the report that the co-autor Ariel Anbar of Arizona State University. 
The discovery is an important step in the search for außerirdischem lives since scientists life and his forms have to recognise as Anbar. 
The study addresses on the earth, the microbes have been found. 
The announcement of a press conference in which no details on the discovery was announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet, that the report by the discovery of außerirdischen life could act. 
This is not the case. 
The discovery "shows that in other planetensystemen organisms with the help of other elements of biochemical processes can set in motion and that the 'standardelemente', which, in our opinion, are absolutely vital, do not necessarily see are imposed," said Charles cockell, a professor at the planetary and space sciences Research Institute of the open university in Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. 
Cockel was not part of the research teams. 
"This work is a new departure, because it shows that, in fundamental biochemical processes and structures of one element can be replaced by another," added cockell added. 
This discovery was not accidental. 
Felisa wolfe-simon from astrobiologischen Institute of NASA, who led the study, chose the mono Lake because of the high arsengehalts. 
Since arsenic and phosphorus chemically identical, they took on that microbes that both are exposed, may be an element in the other. 
"The toxicity of the arsens is based above all, that it is chemically similar to behave like phosphorus." 
"by the organisms, it is difficult to distinguish between an element from the other." 
"But the difference is so great that arsenic different acts as phosphorus. It into our biochemisches system, where it is almost covered everything," said Anbar. 
The researchers used the bacterium gfaj-1 rising arsenkonzentration. It is suited to and grew. 
The microbe is growing in phosphorus better, but also that it can survive in arsenic, shows that a arsen-basierte lifestyle that can happen, of course, either on land or on any other planet or moon, to the arsenic occur more frequently. 
According to Jamie S. foster, dozentin for Microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus by arsenic can be replaced, not new, but until now there has been still no functioning example. 
Arsenic came in the early erdjahren more, she says that is why the science assumes that early life styles have used it. 
"that gives reason to believe that life can also have developed differently than in the early erdzeitalter," Forster, who was not a Member in wolfe-simons research team. 
The research by NASA, the Department of Energy and the national health authorities.
