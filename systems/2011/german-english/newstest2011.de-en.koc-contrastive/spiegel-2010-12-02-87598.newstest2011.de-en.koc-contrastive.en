Hell, warriors! 
The kunstkino splatter fits? 
The director Nicolas winding refn is testing with his kämpfer-epos "walhalla rising" old genre-grenzen newly. 
To which the audience may be the Danish director Nicolas winding refn thought as he "walhalla rising" spin? 
A prisoner wikinger-krieger with only one eye (Mads mikkelsen) is liberated from its peinigern and sets with almost superhuman powers multitudes of his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, it is precisely because our hero like rough used to kill his enemies and have the gedärme from the vibrant life, limb when he has bad humour. 
On the other hand, einauge says, as he is known, the whole film is not a word, and also the other characters can at most times to one or two sentences, or a few painful todesschreien. 
Otherwise it is in silence and in the gruselig beautiful Scotland, hügellandschaft feasted on the wikingerwelt of about a thousand years, provides the backdrop. 
Ideal for adults with more cineasten interest for existentialismus and very quiet kamerafahrten. 
Well, if a film has several target groups, it is a shame, if they are mutually exclusive. 
Winding refn, since its director is wild and gestylten drogendealer-trilogie "pusher" as a kind of Danish version of quentin tarantino, but refuses to stoisch, his works with a little more mainstream humour or a little less brutality to make available to the arthouse. 
The most kunstkino-freunde are around the spritzenden gehirnmasse and the gedärmen prohibitive. 
The latest action-fans will die from boredom, if einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons with a bunch of violent Christian missionaries via ship after Jerusalem areas and an eternity in the doldrums and fog before the team is, it would seem that in America there is and will continue to remain silent. 
No wonder, then, that "walhalla rising" in Germany has found no kino-verleih and now only on DVD. 
This is particularly due to the superb images a crying shame, but also because, behind the prätentiösen until bluttriefenden facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema, it deserves some attention. 
In this film is not about dialogues or a rigorous action, it is all atmosphere, a filmgewordener fiebertraum. 
And why is there no escape for the viewer. 
Refn takes him barely a moment of relaxation and his bags to him with his icy images and the dark trance-artigen soundtrack very slowly to the throat cut, but above all with the incredible hatred of him from the heart of the characters they. 
Only a small blonder young, the einauge faithful to the side retains something of innocence, as all the others are driven by anger. 
The vast majority of the einäugige hero, whose motives are never explained, but for enemies and temporary allies at some point to the warriors from hell, possibly to the Ambassador of the devil himself. 
It means lost, but perhaps only for the verdorbenen anyway. 
"walhalla rising" is a puzzling film, you have to admire the hate and can get angry, and marvel at. 
An experience.
