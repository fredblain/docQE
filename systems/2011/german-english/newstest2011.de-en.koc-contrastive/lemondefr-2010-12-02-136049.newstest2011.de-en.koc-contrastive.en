Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its intermediary for Syria 
During more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, considered the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher in Iran for "espionage" was recorded, the French public in suspense, left the diplomacy in akzentuierte alert, and the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran. 
All of this under the attentive eyes of the diplomats of the United States. 
From WikiLeaks and received by the newspaper Le Monde durchgesehenen American documents give some background to this crisis. 
They describe how the Elysée the Americans had said his strategy, which went as far as this advice to deal with their own crisis of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of wanderern). 
They show how the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young Frenchwoman not the release of Majid, a kakavand in France and imprisoned by the American justice because of trade with material in favour of the Iranian nuklearprogrammes wanted Iranian to gegeleistung said. 
Finally, they include the way in which the French Presidency of the media to the purposes of trying to manipulate this idea to make the credible, the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss, played in a harsh light. 
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard. 
A on 12 August 2009 in Paris redigiertes diplomatentelegramm bears the title of "Iran: French comments on the way to deal with hijackings." 
François richier, elysée-berater strategy that is discussed in the company of Patrice paoli, director of the Quai d " orsay to North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen allegrone. 
They told her the French method. 
The advised the Americans, everything possible to ensure their own nationals, the rückzuführen forcibly detained in Iran. 
"power of noise," they said, expressing "loud and clear, without letting" the words' grundmenschenrechte, "" innocence ,"" immediate release "in the media. 
This is necessary in order for the Iranian regime to embarrass the very sensitive to his image. 
"since this is all the more so, since you ask, the Iranians, what not to do so." 
Because "silence solves nothing," over the diskussionsversuche on unauffälligem paths, the Iranians are "master in ausweichmanövern." 
Mr richier adds that the detention of foreigners, a "normal, Iranian tactic" was: "hostage taking for the purposes of political blackmail." 
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss, from the prison (which should be reached on 16 August, on the day that they are in the French embassy vanishes) 'call for the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians' (230,000 euros) bail. 
And he does state that the Elysée antizipiere further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that, "will." 
The Iranians could "in the near future, another of the roughly 1,800 French citizens arrested in Iran," he said. 
28 August 2009. 
Clotilde Reiss is 12 days ago, has been released from prison, but will continue to be held in Iran. 
The information was in circulation: the Iranians Majid kakavand, whose extradition to the United States because of illegal trade in empfindlichem elektronikmaterial to Iran are asking for is discovered, after a judge in Paris, has been released from detention. 
The American Embassy is, like many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence. 
For Washington, which is the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the for the nuclear programme has provided material, is the release of Majid khakavand bad news. 
France has a fool in purchase? 
The liberation of the Iranian against the Frenchwoman? 
At a further meeting with Kathleen allegrone on 4 September, François richier assured us that this is not the case. 
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the decision of the judge," but have also tried to revolt against it. 
"It has a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Justice Minister, Michèle Alliot-Marie, gave" (now), but "the French Government, the judicial decision can not change," he says. 
Mr richier would also like to point out that Majid kakavand continues to be under "strict" supervision of the French secret service. 
The elysée-berater opts for a telephone number, is on again, then informed the American diplomat, the Iranians, "is currently in the Iranian Embassy managed buildings in Paris." 
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss, in Iran, too, the Elysée its efforts, not by means of information and of the media organized "fluchtversuche" to make us believe, the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad Games a "significant" and "influential role." 
The Americans are watching this activity is not without irony, and note that, in the manipulation of bear fruit, because several articles reflect the official French version. 
One of 25 August 2009 datierendes telegram evokes "the medienblitz the French authorities." 
What is based so much "dankesbezeugung" to Mr Assad, wonders the Paris Embassy. 
"in spite of their declarations lobpreis give full of the French authorities to secretly, that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians really have done." 
The document deals then deal with the reasons the Elysée have pushed this fiction. 
The intensive communication efforts "aims to Sarkozy 's policy of openness towards Syria to confirm," he analysed. 
A 2008 launched policy at the time "of many kritikerstimmen in France and abroad as premature and undeserved was perceived." 
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" Paris "Syria attempts to laud, what we can achieve by playing a constructive role in the region." 
It is also, "discord between Syria and Iran to spread." 
The American embassy knows this from a good source. 
On 11 August had François richier to her: "of course we do not know whether the Syrians have done whatever." 
"but we have nevertheless grateful to you." 
"This should at least be confusion on the part of the Iranians rioters." 
Clotilde Reiss, returns on 16 May of 2010 after France. 
Nicolas Sarkozy is in the Elysée. 
In a communiqué he is grateful to the President of Brazil, of Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our compatriot."
