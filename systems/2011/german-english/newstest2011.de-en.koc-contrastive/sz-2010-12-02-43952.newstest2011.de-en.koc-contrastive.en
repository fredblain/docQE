Love in a time of war 
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer, with the work on her still nameless regiedeb端t has begun, there is trouble. 
The script, she has even written a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man. 
Much more is known about - but not enough for the unrest. 
It is rumoured that the woman, a Muslim, verliebe during the jugoslawien-krieges in their Serbian rapists. 
Bosnian women " s organisations have protested immediately, and some in Sarajevo drehtage planned in the short term after Hungary were transferred. 
Now is the film in Hungary tap off and in the postproduktion, but there will still be protested in Bosnia. 
Bakira hasecic, of the organization of female victim wrote about the un-fl端chtlingshilfswerk UNHCR of Jolie and requesting a meeting with the actress, has a Bosnian newspaper reported now, Jolie is even Ambassador of the un-fl端chtlingshilfswerks. 
Diplomatically, it is not - it has the women before weeks before a meeting in Hungary, which rejected the offer, however. 
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, so hasecic. 
Liebesgeschichten in vergewaltigungscamps did not exist, and Jolie attitude towards the victims would not be betraying her enough about the script. 
Her organization has, according to the un-fl端chtlingshilfswerk recommended Jolie as Ambassador, the guardian reported. 
But what exactly has Jolie for scenes written? 
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which your script to read has got after some back and forth to a drehgenehmigung for Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie still not happened. 
The jungautorin even asserted that they had no political intentions with her film, was with a great deal of effort in the jugoslawien-konflikt incorporated into it if the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved. 
The content, however, remains vague. 
It seems a second synopsis of the film in the network, which is then quite different sounds: the loving knew already caught before war and once again when they meet, a Bosnian Muslim, in a Serbian camp being hijacked, in which he is working as guards. 
Which is considerably different sounds when the variant "rape victims in verknallt torturer." 
Actually that Jolie film before the war begins - that much is certain. 
The pressure on you, so Jolie, was "unfair and is based on misinformation." 
Now, she can probably only the hackers from Hollywood for peace: by the script, as so many before, illegally into the net.
