China keeps its targets to reduce greenhouse gases, maintain 
The representatives of China said at the COP16, his country would have to make enormous efforts to reduce the kohlenstoffspuren shape and it would maintain its offer, by 2020, 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases. 
China considers his offer the emission of greenhouse gases by the year 2020 by 40 to 45 percent, to reduce assured Su Wei, the representative of that country on the COP16. 
In his first public appearance at the Summit of 16 of the United Nations (COP16) assured Su Wei, his country would have to make enormous efforts to lower the kohlenstoffspuren and the conversion of his industry. 
He said that in the last four years, his country is investing $245 million, in order to limit the emission of greenhouse gases. 
However, he said that China would not change his goals, but together with the international community in this matter would work. 
He said that the Chinese strategy on climate change in four aspects sub-parts: dialogue, capacity-building, institution building and support of pilot programmes. 
In all aspects, we have made progress, including the adoption of a new energiegesetzes last year that the targets for the reduction of the emission of gases posts, he said. 
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the authorities of the states with which the centralised state and local communities working together to meet the objectives for energy saving, the efficient use of energy and the reduction of emissions. 
Moreover, he said, are already some multiannual plans in or have been concluded, both those who have been funded by the Chinese Government, and as such, the money from other countries. 
For example, he was referring to the programme for the efficient use of energy, which in the last five years was introduced and investment by the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands. 
There is also a project at provincial level on climate change, another for the replacement of the traditional incandescent light bulbs by energy-efficient light bulbs and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said. 
Martin krol, scientific regierungsberater on climate change in this country, confirmed that the efforts of China are far greater than is commonly believed. 
It showed that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China in six tonnes per person, while in the United States were 100 tonnes. China is for a neunprozentigen costumes on pollution. 
Just do it an unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. The energiewirksamkeit was in the last five years increased by 20% and by the year 2020 and another had happened, he said.
