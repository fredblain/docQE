Controllers in the zwielicht 
The European Food Authority is of the EFSA with genpflanzen experimental industry at all. 
This charge now formulated in the expert group testbiotech, as an independent institute for the impact of biotechnology. 
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well documented," said testbiotech-chef Christoph then in Munich on Wednesday. 
The head of the efsa-expertengruppe for genetically modified plants, Harry kuiper, and another efsa-experte for years are also when lobbyistenverband ilsi under contract. 
The will of the corporations like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer. 
Kuiper was instrumental in the efsa-prüfvorschriften worked for genpflanzen and am so that, in a clear conflict of interests, then criticized. 
The efsa-vorschriften are absatzweise word for word with position papers by the ilsi and deceive so that bears the hallmark of the industry, which is actually of the authority in the Italian Parma will be monitored. 
It was the second time that testbiotech a interessenskollision share your criticism. 
So is a high-level efsa-managerin recently without restrictions or transitional period for the Swiss agrarkonzern Syngenta - and have changed sides. 
Also the mitteldeutsche broadcasting (mdr) recently had personal links between a few unruly end and lobbies, revealing what the umweltbundesamt as MEPs sit up and take notice. 
The EFSA can however, see no conflict of interest. 
We will take every serious data back, even to those of the industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, it says in a statement. 
The experts, the work of EFSA, asking not to be, that they have no contact with the industry. 
But they would have to disclose them. 
Kuiper gives his work for the international life sciences Institute (ilsi) in the United States. 
This describes himself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things, on risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbyauftrag. 
In the matter of independent experts criticize how then that genetically modified crops are currently without any fütterungsversuch in animals be allowed and the reaction of genpflanzen environmental shall not tested. 
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize on the field power," says then. 
Current practice is only isolated proteins, but not the whole genpflanze to test what no reliable results covering. 
"If you take risks not addiction, how should we then find you?," asks then accusing. 
It also provides for Angelika hilbeck so. 
The research scientist since 1994 in the engineering and is currently at the technical University of Zurich. 
The industry attempts in this area, as in the US is now also in Europe, scientists are becoming more and more critical to influence or discredit. 
There is, therefore, are scarcely even researchers, not with corporations are interwoven. 
For businesses, critical studies would not normally was published. 
"The industry controls the research," claims hilbeck.
