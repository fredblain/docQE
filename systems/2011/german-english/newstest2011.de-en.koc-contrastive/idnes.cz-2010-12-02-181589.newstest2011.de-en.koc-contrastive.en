The army has so many scheme that it is the Czech Republic umwickeln could keep them but only two years. 
The Czech army has 445 kilometres bought with explosives scheme, to be released. 
In the year earlier, the Ministry of Defence has 224 miles but delivered to the double. 
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces for ausgesorgt 225 years. 
The problem is only the durability of the scheme - two, but no more than four years. 
The army bought the scheme from the company stv group, A. S. for paltry 40 million crowns. 
In his explanatory statement for the procurement of this huge amount but said of the General Staff mf dnes, the soldiers would be on the 60 kilometres per year but are using. 
The calculations of armeepyrotechnikern, mf dnes, according to the point raised in this indication is that the whole army, each year, an intensive training course pyrotechnic should - of all the generals and commanders of the armeekommandos, up to the secretaries and cleaners. 
Defense minister Alexandr Vondra and army general Vlastimil picek is no exception. 
Only in this way can be of considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres zündschnüren more or less justified. 
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonationen. 
But even so, this would armeebestände for more than ten years. 
But if even the old rule of experts is that the training of every new professional two metres but are quite sufficient, then the army with this neueinkäufe - from the point of view of the increased needs of key units - a reassuring stockpile for the above-mentioned 225 years created. 
It complained the soldiers of the schnelleinsatzbrigade recently with the Defense Minister Vondra, you would have had almost no cartridges for small arms register more, so that the lack of resources because of freedom are greatly restricted. 
The unterhosenmangel. 
"to me is not why they are such huge sums to buy" scheme. 
But it is ultimately their decision, you will already know, what they need. " 
"for us, the army is a good customer, we as traders largely want to come forward," says the vertriebsmanager the stv group děcký Jan. 
Jan pejšek, the spokesman for the Department of Defense based on the purchase of hundreds of kilometres, but so that the army would have been so for at least ten years with this "ammunition" members. 
Jan děcký of the stv group but talks only of a four-year gebrauchsdauer the scheme and police and armeepyrotechniker even only from two years ago. 
"in perfect storage are probably also mentioned the four years of possible," one of them, but wants to remain unnamed, not as a soldier of the criticism of the army to be accused of. 
After the expiry of the gebrauchsdauer must thoroughly any ammunition to be tested whether they still is reliable and not the lives of the soldiers at risk. 
But these tests are not in vain, but cost more money. 
A further argument of the Defense Department is the mengenrabatt for 445 kilometres but. 
"It cost us 60 percent less than the last delivery of 244 miles," spokesman pejšek tells us the position of purchasers might arise with the Department of Defense. 
Just by way of comparison, the annual consumption of zündschnüren of pyrotechnikern of the police, the munitions from the second world war or the Soviet bruderarmee liquidate exceeds, already some years barely 1,500 metres. 
And the police always appointed only such amounts of ammunition it before the end of the gebrauchsdauer can consume. 
The safety of the pyrotechniker, moreover, because we are so the possibility of more modern flexible purchases and therefore reliable scheme open. 
The Ministry of Defence has already huge problems in the winding up of the tens of thousands of tonnes of munitions from times of Warsaw Treaty, as the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak army in their campaign to the Rhine. 
The pyrotechnikern, according to the mf dnes, expects the Czech armed forces in a few years ago, the same problem with the elimination of hundreds of kilometres of old scheme, which they now as "good" has bought.
