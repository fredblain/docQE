An opinion poll, with nonsensical rules cleaning up 
The opinion poll "the absurdity of the year" for the fourth time is part of the unternehmerwettbewerbs. 
Some daft rules already succeeded, from the world. 
The unlikely winner of the next poll "born in the absurdity of the year" has the duty to create documents to authorities, which are available online. 
As more than a third of not quite four thousand stimmabgebenden entrepreneurs. 
So he asked for the sozialversicherungsverwaltung a papierauszug from the commercial, even if the officials had access through two click of a mouse. 
Thanks to the opinion poll is changing that now. 
"The Czech sozialversicherungsverwaltung in future will be in control of sozialversicherungszahlern no extracts from the commercial demand more," said the spokeswoman čssz Jana buraňová. 
Sense and purpose of the opinion poll "absurdity" of the year it is, all the rules and orders to examine the entrepreneurs have to meet in the Czech Republic and the nonsensical. 
This is the fourth time this year, part of a unternehmerwettbewerbs, of the tsch. Business daily (hn) and will be hosted in public. 
If, in the last year of the three thousand people participating in the vote, it was in earlier this year four thousand. 
No wonder, because there is still a lot of statutory duties, which only serve to hamper the activity. 
"What, for example, the number of einkommenssteuerformulare is concerned, we will take a front rank in the world," said Karel havlíček of the Association of small and medium-sized businesses and gewerbetreibender of the Czech Republic. 
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity in recent years the proclaimed goal of all governments. 
Compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic, but hardly improved. 
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic in relation to the unternehmensbedingungen the 74. Grade A, compared to the previous year to eight places a poorer place. 
The absurdity of the year competition was declared for the first time in years, and plays each year after the same situation.

To register the website address is seeking www.firmaroku.cz. then the organisers of the competition seven candidates for the "antipreis" from the public and the Internet on the websites of www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz vote. 
It triumphs that absurdity, which gets the most votes. 
For this year " s poll have already been more than a hundred specifically, 105 senseless rules and orders. 
The tips are not only of entrepreneurs, but also of professional organisations and journalists. 
Among the nominees, "finalisten" of the competition, for example, include provisions that instandhaltungsfahrzeuge for motorways and have to pay a toll expressways, or that employers with 20 staff, two offices and two toilets vorrichten every two years. 
The list of this year 's "seven" is in the pages of the competition. 
The proclamation of the competition each at the beginning of November at the Prague Wenceslas Square is part of a happenings, regularly to the people of the political and public life. 
This year, for example, Eva svobodová, the director of the Association of small or medium-sized businesses and the tsch gewerbetreibender. Republic and Petr kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the tsch. Republic at the height of the competition for the long haul. 
"where the state of the entrepreneurs spanner, there can be no real economic recovery, that is why it is my aim, every year at least thirty paragraphs, today, the entrepreneurs unnecessarily complicate their operations," said Martin kocourek, the Minister for Industry and Trade. 
The efforts of nonsensical orders from the world, to create effective. 
In 2007, was the people most entrepreneurs on duty, the gewerbeamt on the ground of their permanent company three days in advance of the intention to declare, with a ausstellungsstand to an exhibition or kirmes want to drive. 
This duty was force a review of the gewerbegesetzes lifted. 
The duty in 2007, the second largest number of votes received - the duty of the job, the missions of workers in the scope of up to 30 days to notify must, by law, it has been on so-called "green card" has been abolished. 
And - all good things come in threes.
