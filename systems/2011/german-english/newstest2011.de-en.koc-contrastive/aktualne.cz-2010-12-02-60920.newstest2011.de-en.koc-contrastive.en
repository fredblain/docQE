A tenant of bakala: he revives in the kiln, yet pays higher rent 
An older untersetzter man just out of the klientenzentrum society rpg byty of "kohlebarons" zdeněk bakala, the largest privatbesitzers choose from in the Czech Republic. 
Under the arm of a file, with three new rental homes to three: on its own and the homes of his daughters and his son, who had just served a prison sentence. 
All three were in the framework of the so-called "deregulation" has just increased the rent. 
Instead of 3,500 kronor monatsmiete is the son of the next year for a 2-zimmer-wohnung with kitchen fork out the second category 4100 crowns. 
"and because there is not a fluent in the apartment once hot water and heating it must be in a simple kohleofen," if he angered the finger at the new lease of the son, whose signing a power he has. 
"But what I have signed," said he was upset and half resigned itself. 
Bytyokd.cz 's citizens' Association, the new mietbedingungen as "incorrect and immoral," advises the tenants, the new contracts is simply not to sign and to wait until 7 December, at which it intends to publish guidance as you against such contracts. 
But the man only beckons. 
"A says this, the other the," he is a benighted face. 
The region is so great, "the Ostrava deregulierungslabor." 
After new year is this deregulation most choose in the Czech Republic before, whose tenants has not market-oriented pay rent. 
Aktuálně.cz decided, therefore, this "laboratory" to visit personally. 
The rpg-warteraum in havířov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine a.m. on this Tuesday packed full. 
Just beside the door, the bodyguards of a safety agency and in its a aufrufgerät. 
"rent" in 2011, so is a special tastfeld on the front. 
And briefly touched upon this already spuckt the device from a nummernzettel. 
We hardly have the number "157" entziffert and piepst they already on the large display on the ceiling of the warteraums. 
Half a second later, one of the series. 
A little later an old couple enters the waiting room, after the rent on issues, but the onslaught in the waiting room is apparently not the new rent. 
Most people are here to the usual problems to solve - reparaturanträge, insurance and so forth. 
Mid November fly in the region of Ostrava, the kuverts with the new rental most tenants out of a total of 44 000 homes of the portfolios of the rpg in the letter boxes. 
The rpg byty proposes them in the letter, a mieterhöhung of around 15 to 38%. 
The special switch to the new rent is in klientenzentrum since the 18 November. 
"The action is in a little over a week, that is to say, this is just the beginning," answers the ladies behind the counter for a moment of hesitation, when the "client" turns as a journalist. 
The deregulation and bakalas former bergarbeiterwohnungen are a sensitive issue. 
Before the elections from the Ostrava, Deputy Lubomír zaorálek of the ČSSD this issue fairly roared up, it is no wonder that today the newspapers are full of them. 
"twenty years I want from you a new floor." 
"not even ne besch. Wc-brille could change it," the man said at the outset. 
Until now, according to the staff, above all, to pensioners on counters, in order to convince them, whether they really mietermäßigung promised them rpg promises, if they spezialangebot sign in time. 
Enjoy a half reduced februarmiete should the other tenants, the new lease until 15 December sign. 
Until now, is "deregulierungsschalter" in havířov but anything other than of enquiries overloaded. 
"from yesterday " s 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because of this," the schalterbeamtinnen estimate. 
Rpg offers both on their websites, as well as wandtafeln individual mietvereinbarungen, where it seems necessary. 
Should the mietparteien but not to the new rent for some, they will be set by an independent court. 
"This is not a threat, but as information is about the only possible and perfectly legitimate legal approach to understand rpg," said on its web sites. 
"here, no one goes to court," says one of the staff of byty rpg and a man in the street before the klientenzentrum gives it at least partly right. 
"I have more than 13,000 (kronor) pension, I remain convinced of 5,000 to eating left, where should I put the money for a gerichtsstreit coming from," he says. 
Then the employees but uncertain. 
"time." 
"Mr zaorálek tells you about the media, they should not sign, and so are the people still," there are concerns, too. 
The regulated rent ends in the largest part of the Czech Republic and rpg byty demonstrated in 2011, according to the mieterhöhung is an economic necessity. 
"the existing level of rents is not enough time for the maintenance of the wohnfonds from," argues Pavel klimeš, director of the wohnungs-portfolios society and rpg byty - particularly those of the supplement tenants criticised wohnungsfonds is neglecting the opinion of the homeowners as the main reason for the mieterhöhung. 
While rpg in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the rent collected four billion to invest in the homes, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it should be 5.2 billion. 
On the großformatigen lcd-display on the ceiling to the polstersesseln in the waiting room of havířov once in a while there are always a few red shining information on. 
"The mieterhöhungen in 2011 by 15%, and less concern 31 200 homes, that means more than 90% of the homes of rpg." 
"It always means a maximum of 7,50 CZK per square metre and month," is on the lcd-monitor to read. 
Only 400 homes from the portfolio of rpg increased the rent by 38 percent. 
"in these cases, there is the increase in extremely low rental charges of 19,66 CZK per square metre," argues rpg. 
At 2600 homes remains the rent for the next year the same amount. 
Rpg byty promises that the deregulation of the rents not exploded, but gradually within four and eight years. 
What is more, the company a further obligation imposed on: all revenue from the mieterhöhung (see diagram) wants the businesses back into their homes, especially in wärmeersparnisse - in new windows and in the insulation. 
But are these people - and especially those who benefit from the agreements on the mieterhöhung sign.
