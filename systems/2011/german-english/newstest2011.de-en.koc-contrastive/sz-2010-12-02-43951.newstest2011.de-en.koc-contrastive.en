Puzzling erdarbeiten 
The Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA has new evidence of a clandestine nuclear program in Syria. 
The country holds out but to comment - nor does it controls. 
Midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 fighter I. a mysterious, würfelförmiges building in Syria. 
It is on the shores of the Euphrates, the next major city, 30 miles away, is as-saur dair. 
Her name is in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on when it comes to the reactor, Syria allegedly with help from North Korea in the quader has built, hidden in a valley by the electricity. 
According to a briefing of the us-auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA of 2008 would be the end of April, also under the name of Middle village el-kibar normal reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which to build nuclear weapons. 
For other purposes, but the technology is hardly from the fifties. 
The CIA has led a videopräsentation before with blurred imagery. 
By computeranimation they ignored a, where the components of the reactor, before the destruction should be a copy of the North Korean model fell from the atomzentrum Yongbyon. 
Moreover, it presented photographs, above, in which the buildings from the vicinity show or even the innenraum. 
The reactor was just before the operation, it said, but had not yet been brennstäben peppers. 
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is scarcely more than it was then known, is the mystery at the time were more important. 
The former US President George W. Bush has recently in his memoirs, revealed that the CIA before the attack is fairly sure that Syria was in el-kibar built a reactor, but saw little evidence that, in the country, "an active nuclear weapons programme." 
Some intelligence officers in Europe that are rather more cautious and only talk of an "alleged reactor," even if they cia-präsentation for "plausible." 
They lack of hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. 
Asked how sure he was a reactor is said to have a high un-diplomat in summer only, the IAEA "simply had enough material to pose questions." 
The rubble of the supposed "dormant" militärgebäudes created the Syrians are hastily aside and planierten the site thoroughly. 
It was in June 2008, a iaea-team under the former chief inspector Olli heinonen, in el-kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people. 
Moreover, the IAEA about a Member State of satellite imagery of commercial providers from the period immediately after the attack, which may be more meaningful than those outlined by the CIA. 
However, these recordings are on the market, not because of the unknown purchaser - perhaps Israel - it has bought exclusive rights. 
The IAEA can therefore not independently verify its authenticity. 
Syria has always asserted, has never been a secret nuclear program, farms or to have built a reactor. 
The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus. 
But the instructed the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely. 
Since then, Damascus, refuses to discuss - as well as on the satellite pictures. 
In addition, the inspectors have been denied a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the rubble of a bombed-out building. 
But Israel too Stony silence. 
"We will never comment on that," confirmed recently by the time of the attack acting Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, the official position. 
As the investigation drags on the case since June 2008 and ineffective "is becoming a serious problem of credibility for the office," as a senior Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna pointless - after all, it is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area, on which the IAEA watchdog. 
As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA apparently three other facilities in the "functional link" with the alleged reactor should be - and unlike this still exist. 
While the inspectors have so far not revealed what the assets are, or what role they have or what they appear to be suspicious. 
According to information the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are in the IAEA as as-sultan masyaf marj internally, and iskandariayah calls, which are derived from nearby cities. 
The independent institute for science and international security in Washington (ISIS advises) has identified in these places and imagery in a complex masyaf, in which it is most likely one of the suspects objects. 
It is probably in or directly next to a military base - precisely on these grounds, Syria denied the IAEA access to the three locations. 
In Vienna, it is feared the Syrians a fishing expedition - that the IAEA from the United States vorgeschickt will auszuspähen military equipment. 
Because the nukleardetektive goods through a tip of the US intelligence services on the institutions has become. 
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the quader on the Euphrates material was moved back and forth. 
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could "in connection with the brennstoffproduktion ." 
But there was "no evidence of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes, to the construction of nuclear weapons are needed. 
The type of reactor is with uranium farms, it is not enriched. 
But where the uranium would have to come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated, on these central issues is there any plausible conjecture. 
Also unclear is whether the valuable pieces of debris, traces of mountains, could at the three locations were stored. 
As if the hundreds of lastwagenladungen disappeared from the ground, nobody wants information about where the rubble. 
Only a few kilometres from el-kibar, on the other side of the Tigris salzmine allocated al-tibni Syria, 1998 to their suitability as a camp for radioactive waste has investigated, the IAEA as unlikely. 
The former iaea-inspektor Robert kelley had it in a recent analysis of the imagery for the venerable magazine Jane 's intelligence review with the reactor in mid-afternoon. 
Recordings from the orbit but show that Syria to the three suspects places erdarbeiten and large containers distant, after the IAEA access had requested. 
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped the suspicion. 
In addition, it says the IAEA in diplomatic circles, have used a number of months, a plan for inspections there to develop the Syria should allow any military secrets - the effort alone shows how great is the interest of the inspectors. 
However, Damascus bügelte also this proposal. 
Western diplomats in Vienna ahead of a year, soothed the reactor was destroyed, so the matter was not a high sense of urgency, bring about US ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months' sonder-inspektionen into the game, one of the harshest means that the Vienna atombehörde, in order to impose controls. 
Iaea-chef yukiya Amano, these inspections should propose, has been of "an option, for which I am open in the future," but he still hesitates. 
It is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it needs for a majority of the Board of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented are anything other than eager for an escalation. 
On the other, like a diplomat to think: 'What is, if you end up with nothing at all? "
