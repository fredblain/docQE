A knochenhaus fascinates even after 100 years. Take a look at the interieure of Gaudi to 
The roof seems to like the back of a prehistoric echse, climbing the stairs as the spine of a dinosauriers and the balkone are aufgerissene fischmäuler. 
This is the Casa batlló of Catalan architect, Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. 
Of the local inhabitants of this House, with its organic forms the nickname of "knochenhaus." 
Organic forms, wild colours, the unusual use of stone, kachelsplittern and mosaic, which is seeking to shed façades and ubiquitous soft lines, all of these are typical features for the jugendstil of Antonio Gaudi. 
The facade of the House is playing with beautiful lines, colors and texturen lack force of nature and living things. 
Only on closer inspection, they noticed that all of geometry, rhythm and ill thought-out order dominated. 
In the middle of the night, the whole facade is still plastic, dramatic and the special anleuchtung enhances the splendour of the colours. 
The same schwungvollen lines and tortuous forms also dominate the interior of the House. 
Geformtes Parliament spouting out waves of wood being copied the window frames, geländer, zierelemente by doors, even gucklöcher and afford. 
The House in the eixample quarter batlló on a busy shopping road passeig de grácia no 43 was created by the renovation of a house from the years of 1877, the architects Emilio sala cortese said. 
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906. 
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but in the end, he agreed to the idea of gaudís on an unusual and even cheaper to reconstruction. 
The mietshaus Casa batlló Antoni Gaudí noted, however, is not alone. 
He was working with the architect Josep Maria jujol together. 
Just on the drawing board established the rhetorical flourishes for representative apartment of the realitätenbesitzers and also the use of mosaics of the facade was his idea. 
In the shape of the facade was working but also many other bildner and artists. 
The joint work of the drafts of the Casa batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation of jujola and Gaudí. 
So jujol also participated in the construction of gaudís House Casa milá in park güell, which also further works of Antoni Gaudí. 
Shortly after its completion, the House of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the nickname of "knochenhaus." 
Others described it as the specific fensteröffnungsmechanismus due to the "yawning House." 
It also says to the top of the building is the sword of St George, of the existence of Catalonia. 
But other elements of bildhauerische symbolize hidden religious motives. 
Gaudí outlined for the House for the time zentralheizungssystem unique with entlüftungskanälen and typical kaminen. 
Seems a little bizarre to her 45-grad-neigung already. 
In his create Gaudí consistently ignored all the building codes and had no way of this. 
Before the start of construction - although he studios, the city of the appropriate planning permission but one which it claims to be made on the planned reconstruction were so vague that the stadtväter two years later at the completion of so horrified by the result has been that they demanded redress. 
The ratsherren breathed among other things, that the building, with its pillars: even in the public sidewalk intervention. 
It was not to make changes, however, quite the opposite - only 15 days after the call on the stadtviertels, Josep batlló a request to approve the renting of two höchstgelegenen floors of the House - and it was promptly gave him. 
The homeowners themselves drew in the lower floors. 
In the gallery on the second floor was a gesellschaftssalon, on the third floor were bedrooms and privaträume the apartment. 
The ground floor was taken to a juweliergeschäft that are allowed to be leased. 
The entire sechsstöckige buildings is going through a ladder up to the dachterrasse. 
With the main elements of the redevelopments have all been right corner and precise lines removed and replaced by bent and geschwungene walls. 
Gaudí worked but also with a modern approach to mutual connection of spaces. 
The social part is explained by the opening up of the salontüren completely combine and so could a larger society, without chatting comfortably in vertraulicheren talks to a certain degree of intimacy. 
The House was given by gaudís refitting except a new facade and a rather unusual roof and two other floors. 
Also impressive is gaudís game with the light and the blue and white glasierten kacheln, with whom the courtyard is dressed and the lichthöfe. 
The game gives these two colours all floors of the House a maximum amount of light. 
While he made simply to use the principle that knows better reflect the light, as a dark colors, contrary to absorb sunlight. 
The House, Casa batlló in 2005 in the welterbe-liste UNESCO was included, I can now visit everyone. 
In the first floor is the geräumigste and prächtigste apartment made available to the public. 
The homeowners decided only in the years to this step and that on the occasion of the 150.geburtstags of the famous creator. 
As you pointed out that this is a very profitable business activities, is thriving in the surveys, one they also extended to other common and the dachgeschossräume, including the dachterrasse. 
The price for the inspection of the preserve an however is no trifling matter, it is 16,50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of touristenausweisen get reductions of 20 per cent. 
This figure dwarfs the eintrittspreise to other gaudí-bauten in the city. 
Whoever the real atmosphere of the House with his drachentürmchen know wants to learn should try, friendship with one of the inhabitants and to close to visit him at home.
