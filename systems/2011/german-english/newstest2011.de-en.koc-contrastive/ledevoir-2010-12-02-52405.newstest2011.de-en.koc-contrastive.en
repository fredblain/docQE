A global plan to renew the lighting 
The UN yesterday in Cancun has a plan for the renewal of the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in terms of achieving a reduction of the greenhouse gas (CFCs), suggested the nearly a third of the additional reduction is the equivalent, which must be implemented in order to stabilise the earth 's climate by 2020. 
This ambitious plan takes his position on the steps of the specific projects, which the UN hopes to implement in Cancun, the absence of compelling reduction to compensate for the developed countries. 
After the plan would put forward yesterday, the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (GT) of the lighting on the earth " s CFCs are to be avoided, if the weißglühenden pears, which still has a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, by fluoreszierende or, better still, by light-emitting diodes (led) would be replaced. 
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. 
This is the equivalent of 70% of the exhaust emissions of global vehicle fleets. 
In Copenhagen last year had the great abgasemittenten as the United States, China, Europe, and others, including Canada, reduktionsplänen to volunteers, the commitment to the global fckw-emissionen of 53 GT on 49 GT should lower. 
Of this assessment, we must, however, still deduct 5 Gt, from now until 2020 the klimaanstieg by 2 degrees Celsius, to stabilise in order to prevent this out of control. 
In the weißglühenden pears something like 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% of the light to produce. 
With the kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, with the new led-glühbirnen reduced energy needs of this once again in the double. 
The kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen keep on average, between 6,000 and 10,000 hours. 
The new led-glühbirnen, such as those of the manufacturer Philips this week on the market - has this society has also participated in the UN - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a weißglühende pear, which is a suggestion the savings of the auswechselungsplanes over 100 countries, is to be applied. 
Besides the fact that iese completely novel incandescent light bulbs, only very little heat, they can also with a regelwiderstand work. 
And they do not contain any mercury. 
Several specialists have shown that kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves, because they contain mercury, and that they therefore as hazardous waste, in the developing world is not always possible, but the producers are a bring centre available. 
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, not the kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit far more mercury around the weißglühenden pears wasted to generate electricity. 
In the United States alone, these are 25,000 tonnes of mercury from coal-fired power plants a year. 
The report sets out in detail the profits, which each country thanks to this international programme would generate. 
Indonesia would, for example, $1 billion a year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, it means the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose infinite spiritual Indonesia 2.5 billion would cost.
