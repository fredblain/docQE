Second mandate: the offenkundigkeit 
De Gaulle had prevented really. 
Mitterrand had faith that he stutze. 
Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation. 
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that. 
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next. 
The current head of state is so candidate in 2012. 
But the offenkundigkeit is the side of the mysteriums, which is why we cannot, not good to face. 
So he has to pretend that the doubt henceforth. 
In one, as well as the other senses. 
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac, a third mandate is not excluded, without even to believe. 
On 15 November assured Nicolas Sarkozy in serious nature, by his decision "some time in the autumn of 2011." 
On Tuesday evening that he was in the Elysée before the ump-parlamentariern the prospect of "two mandates" would let slip a little, so fieberhaftigkeit. 
This was the official announcement of his candidacy? 
Far from it. 
The President, just to remind you that the Constitution in 2008, the number of five-year terms to just two. 
He made a statement that no announcement. 
It is not the first time that he is the presidential election on the occasion of such meeting in a humorous tone. 
"You have seven and a half years at worst still with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009. 
On a new in May 2010: "does not believe that I am not thinking about the stage after that." 
His words from the day before yesterday not to make him more candidates than the previous day, but also no less. 
Should you comments, then from a double reason. 
The acceleration of the wettlaufes the candidacy with the hp on one side. 
But it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal, the Nicolas Sarkozy is to reveal itself. 
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, the many Members of the PS earlier than expected to take the challenge. 
The bad polls, on the other side. 
For the first time the voters of the rights of a candidacy of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to survey the bva-l 'express). 
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP," responded immediately and carefully in the context of the Prime Minister. 
"if he would be a defeat as possible, he would not" candidate Jean-Pierre Raffarin, agrees with. 
"He will always believe victories can be corrected," Alain Juppé, who is with the offenkundigkeit has accepted.
