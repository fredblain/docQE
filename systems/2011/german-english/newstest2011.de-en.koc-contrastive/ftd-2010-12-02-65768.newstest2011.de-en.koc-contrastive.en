Ogoniland is burnt 
The water in the rivers, as it is ölbraun smell at the petrol station: billion litres of ausgelaufenes crude oil, the nature in Ogoniland in Nigeria destroyed. 
The people of theft, corruption and illegal ölkochen. 
Celestine akpobari mean well. 
"Do not consuming," reassured the ökoaktivist the journalists: "You will still have enough oily slime from the lens wars." 
The 37-year-old Nigerians attempt, has followed a until the chest in water watenden young with the surrounding schlieren abzulichten: in the regenbogenfarbenen wasserglanz sets the scene almost nicely. 
That under the surface rohölschwaden Brown is not to see. 
They have been here eimerweise shrimps, told badom Esther collected on the edge of the bodo-jetty-flusses. 
Now is the lazy fluid waters completely dead. 
Five years ago, poured from a geborstenen quantities of crude oil pipeline in the vast wetland. 
Fishermen from the nearby städtchen Bodo must now pull together for about six hours, in order to reach fischhaltige waters: in the heart of the Niger Delta Ogoniland is enlarged, as one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world. 
On the journey through the flussläufen criss-crossed by mangrovensümpfe will the full extent of the devastation stand out. 
Instead of bright water wühlt the motorboot Brown brühe, who put his hand up into the water, ölige finger. 
The roots of the mangrovenbäumchen stand out as black lakritzstangen from the soil, sad leave as their wedel scattered palm trees. 
Vogelschwärme, as usual, in wetlands are meted out: as soon as the außenborder silence is spreading in the as a filling station riechenden former paradise ghastly calm. 
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says celestine akpobari gloomy: "We are living in constant danger for the health." 
The kriegsvergleich is appropriate. 
The area where they live the Ogoni is a disputed battlefield for decades: this burst, more than 60 years ago, the first explorateure from Europe, organized here in the 1980s, with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa death later the first resistance, here the shell-konzern 1993 had to stop its production, because it was too dangerous for its oil workers. 
Nor is today the company denied the return after Ogoniland: while from the whole of the delta region of the triple the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 bohrquellen plumbing and 7,000 kilometres a day more than two million barrels of the black gold, are pumped into the oil fields in Ogoniland, the corporation is too unstable the situation. 
Every few hundred metres stählerne stand out gestelle as bizarre sculptures from the water: "christbäumchen" are the heads of the boreholes have much to zärtlich. 
They are up to 50 years old, the most korrodiert to the core. 
Again and again breche such a bohrkopf diverge, believes akpobari rinne, then a constant flow of crude oil into the water. 
More than two billion litres are experts estimate in 50 years ago has gone into the Delta ecosystem: year after year, the amount of oil, as they are now more in the wreck of the 'Exxon Valdez' 21 years into the sea off Alaska drive - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind. 
Those who continued for the ultimate environmental catastrophe is to blame, it will be. 
During the shell-konzern sabotage and the organised öldiebstahl for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see berstende bohrköpfe and lecke pipelines as the main culprit. 
Shell in Nigeria do much lower safety standards than elsewhere in the world, accused the us-wissenschaftler Richard Steiner in 2008 alone, the company: the rate of defects in the pipes is "several times higher than elsewhere." 
In a place of from the distant as an abandoned ölverschmierte workshop, open-air, looks up from the mangroven on: they are splitternackt and up to our necks ölverschmiert. 
Under one of the many barrels, with the proportion of tubes, partly linked to arbitrarily scattered on the site have come to identify, a fire: an illegal kleinraffinerie. 
In the barrel, the crude oil on the fire several hours, said Michael cooked, the head of the group. 
First enters petrol through the pipes in the auffangtopf spits, later, at the end of the leadership of kerosene and diesel. 
So produce Michael and four staff on a daily basis up to four barrels à 300 litres of diesel: "it brings us 34.000 naira a" - around 22 dollars. 
The deltabewohner benefit the chronic treibstoffknappheit in the largest erdölstaat sub-Saharan Africa. 
Nigeria has only through a single refinery. 
With less than 40 euro-cent per litre of ridiculously low price of diesel oil can the illegal kocher has undercut their raw material: because they have been in vain. 
He comes from "bunkerern," which the pipeline network across Ogoniland tap: in this way, to go to the country, according to experts in the entire Niger delta on a daily basis, at least 16 million litres of crude oil lost. 
Only a very small part of the provisional zwischengelagerten raw material is illegal, however, veredelt: fill the lion 's share of organised criminal networks, including politicians and senior military personnel should belong in tankers and basement him on the world market. 
The debate over whether the environmental disaster, rather than the activities of the population or the lax production is due to the activist akpobari for purely academic. 
"The oil companies would not be perceived as invaders and they would have been the livelihood of the fishermen will not be so thoroughly destroyed, there would be neither sabotage or theft and illegal refineries." 
Now is the relationship of the Ogoni people, above all, to Shell but destroyed so that only a withdrawal of the Group of the question would be: "perhaps are different nationalities, such as the Chinese better." 
There is Michael nervous. 
"high time that their disappears," says the muskulöse ölmann. 
"every minute of the soldiers can." 
The illegal ölveredler of the special forces, threatening caught them no arrest, but a painful of receiving bribes. 
The mainly from the North, soldiers want - like all Nigerians - of the raw material benefit. 
"This damn stuff, our country in every respect to the dog," says akpobari brought.
