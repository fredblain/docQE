NASA has announced the discovery außerirdischen life 
The US space agency has called a press conference tomorrow, a fund vorzustelle, the impact on the search for life in all. 
The National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) of the United States tomorrow, Thursday, a astrobiologische discovery knows, the theory of außerirdischen could confirm the existence of life. 
The fund will take place tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference in the NASA headquarters in Washington, presented by experts of the astrobiologie. This is a science which the origin, the development, distribution and the future of life in the universe. 
At the press conference convening assured NASA, they will be "a aufsichtserregenden fund for the search for außerirdischem lives" imagine what experts triggered speculation in other countries. 
The discovery could prove the theory that, in hostile environments, it has been held for unbwohnbar human-like creatures, can exist. It has been raised, the hypothesis that these are intelligent creatures - as people - could transform, if their living conditions are improved. 
Apparently, it is a microbe, which was at the bottom of the mono lake in California, has been found, yosemite-nationalpark. She lives there, in an environment that is too toxic for all possible life forms have been kept, since the sea arsenhaltig is strong. 
In any way, the mikrobie used the arsenic than überlebensressource. Taking into account the ability to increase the chances that it on other planets, the not on our protective atmosphere, similar life could be. 
If these organisms that arsenic verstoffwechseln, is in accordance with the astrobiologen showed that "there is a real a different way of life, a second way of life, which we are aware of the difference." 
The space agency is tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference, the actual scope of their funds. 
At the conference will be the geobiologin pamela Conrad part, with the possibility of life on Mars, and a biologist Steven benner, one of the scientists, the titan (the largest moon saturns) in response to the question of whether its chemical composition of the earth, studied.
