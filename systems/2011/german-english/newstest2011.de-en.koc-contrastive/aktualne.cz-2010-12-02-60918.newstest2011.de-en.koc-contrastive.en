What can you do to the ČSSD? the Czech social democrats in Prague are not aware of voldemort, nor the "konditorei." 
The new ratsherren of capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously certain language barriers must be overcome their alt-neuen colleagues from the Czech ODS in Prague Council and in the stadtvertretung understand at all. 
The newspaper aktuálně.cz, members of the new Council from the ČSSD time a little "abgeklopft ', as they dominate the notorious slang, which in recent years has established, in which the current coalition partners in Prague at the helm. 
The codierte vocabulary, which in the long era of mayor Pavel bém of the Prague political elite has been introduced, is some of the best-known actors, situations and borrowed causae. 
Surprisingly, showed that the new councils in relation to these new notions of somewhat in the dark. 
The claim they at least. 
"who is voldemort?" 
"No idea." 
"I am more a newcomer in the Prague policy," responded Lukáš kaucký, of the new town councillor from on culture, on the test of the "paten-wortschatzes." 
But also the town councillor from Karel Březina - a political veteran, responded in a similar way. 
For example, at the term "golfloch." 
"This is the only expression of which they are submitting me, which I am now and again." 
"otherwise, I believe that not much often infiltrated by slang." 
From the vocabulary of the aktuálně.cz tageblatt, in June this year before the electoral congress of the ODS, the editorial was published pickte six words, especially those that are notoriously with the Prague magistrate. 
The Social Democrats should the concepts of 'voldemort,' 'biggest Prague golfloch, "" in the konditorei go', "stiernacken," the capital of "betrayal" and "verblechen define." 
Three of the Prague ratsherren agreed to the test, the fourth - Mr weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - first promised his participation in the conversation, but not even the listeners. 
The fifth, town councillor from Petr dolínek, rejected the test. 
"These are things I do and as the Civic Democrats talk about each other, I passed." 
"for me, it is important, as we understand, within the framework of our programs," he countered. 
As already indicated, would have Lukáš kaucký in the aforementioned headline allegedly failed to understand that the influential businessman and friend of the ex-oberbürgermeisters bém, Roman janoušek. 
The term "voldemort" says kaucky absolutely nothing and the only one he had on the test erriet correctly, was "the greatest Prague golfloch." 
"This is the tunnel blanka," says kaucký, added to safety but still added: "But I know this from the newspaper instead." 
And jokingly: "I will be a sprachkurs must show." 
The "golfloch" will then not just of matador Karel Březina, but also from the town councillor for the environment Lukáš plachý right as blanka entziffert tunnel. 
Both Democrats also know, however, for whom the term voldemort and Lukáš plachý senses even where this figure is to find and also what it means, "in the konditorei to go." 
"I believe that that is, in any company in Prague to go," plachý is pretty close to solving the conundrum hit, when we know that it is the seat of janoušeks firms. 
In keeping with Březina, he asserted, but rather this knowledge from the newspaper to have drawn, as this would embrace that language. 
The testteilnehmern, judging by the Social Democrats, in fact, it seems no similar slang habit. 
"I have asked my colleagues, but obviously there is something we really not." 
"We call upon us in the name of, and again we use also acronym or nickname of," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr hulínský - by his own party who put "hulda." 
"at school I was bříza (birch), but I do not know whether to call my colleagues too," Karel Březina tells us his nickname. 
The newspaper deník aktuálně.cz has pioneered the names and lo and behold, it works. 
Town councillor from weinert is for the party of "friendly" OPA or less friendly to the "old," the representative, Miroslav poche, before the elections, with operations in the partei-sponsoring on, will be made by some colleagues' igráček " (well-known Czech lego-figur). 
Nicknames are so the only thing that the Social Democrats in the intra-party vocabulary. 
It may not hulínský allegedly, if it is "hulda ', but deník aktuálně.cz registered yet another moniker of Prague chairman. 
His spitzname 'doctor who allegedly gummiknüppel-rechte "has to do with the fact that Petr hulínský his juris doctor title to the bratislaver police academy has acquired.
