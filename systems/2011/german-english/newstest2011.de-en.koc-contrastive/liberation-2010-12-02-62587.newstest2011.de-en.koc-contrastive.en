Grand Paris métro: first financial skizzen 
Since the debate about the modernisation of the transport industry, on the Ile is in full swing, it rains billion. 
At least in the discussions. 
We call on this, in particular, the 23 billion for the metro grand Paris in memory of the Société du Grand Paris is to be built. 
At the start of construction - the SGP, the state has a kapitaldotation of 4 billion euros was proclaimed. 
In the theoretical framework, it is the sum total of the SGP would then, on the markets of a part of the finanzsumme to her twin. 
Today it has finally come to first projections. 
The amending budget from 2010, looked at this morning by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly, contains the measures laid down in the first part of this money. 
It is two measures: the creation of a special tax to erschließund and higher taxation on the offices of the ile-de France. 
The former, so as to remove Article 15 of the draft law, is "in favour of the public body Société du Grand Paris." 
This is quantified: "the product of this tax amounts to EUR 117 million per year." 
Zweitere is an overhaul of the existing taxation: "in order to modernise them, in order for it to increase legal product and this increase of the Société du Grand Paris to myself." 
How much would the whole? 
A mystery. 
This amount is not in the text. 
Of the 4 billion is far away. 
"It is said that the fiscal resources to the EUR 4 billion of the kapitaldotation will be added by the state to be found and the Société du Grand Paris to and after the project to be done," is the explanatory remarks. 
In the SGP is this system does not offensive. 
"for the moment, in which we have been recorded revenue (the two taxes, D. R.), one of the studies over three years, and only then cover from the 4 billion dip," it is claimed. 
"This will be noted and in the budget and to leave." 
The SGP estimates that in 2013 will be started, the 4 billion for the budget to make a note of 2014. 
This measure, whose 4 promised billion it will still be able to seek, is in danger of a troublesome right, parliamentary discussion. 
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
