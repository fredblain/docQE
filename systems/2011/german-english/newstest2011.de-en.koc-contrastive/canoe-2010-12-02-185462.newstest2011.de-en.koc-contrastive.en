The new body is no unanimity 
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new, our unity in the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public committee of inquiry into this subject. 
Robert dutil, Minister of public security, claimed this idea come not from yesterday: Quebec could have been last January, the New York department of investigation, consulted on this issue. 
The metropolis has since 1870 over a unity against corruption. 
However, the announcement of Wednesday, more than just a surprise. 
You have to say that this measure at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the quebecer police service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert dutils not in the slightest. 
There was also not that Stéphane bergeron, critic and a Member of the Parti québécois, this announcement in terms of public safety as a "gezaubertes rabbit from the hat" and "in a will rightly gebastelte solution" qualified. 
Minister dutil had in turn help to those who fear that the political power too much influence on the future of unity was possible. 
"It will be the result, if we are announcing," therefore, it is. 
"We are aware of this problem." 
According to réjean parent, the President of the csq, nothing can replace the implementation of a public survey. 
"The more Mr. Charest, insists on education, we want to prevent this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think that he has something to hide," he said. 
"The only way to set up a committee of inquiry, is able to form the resignation of Jean Charest, for its part," said Yves boisvert, a teacher for ethics and politiksysteme at the ENA (staatl. College for the training of senior governor). 
In order to escape from this impasse, he proposes the Quebec, the finanzprüfungskontrolle a specific mandate, so that these about corruption and secret agreements relevant inquiries. 
"We should be able to extend the mandate of the prüfungskontrolle," he said. 
He also takes the view that the Quebec the prüfungskontrolle the same power as Commissioners could give, which she also would allow the people to the statement. 
The formation of a unity is not the only project in the drawers of the government Charest. 
The Quebec Ottawa will also demand to the penal code in order to respond better to this type of crime to be stopped. 
This demand from the public prosecutor of the operation marteau, the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier has informed that the administration of justice in this kind of prosecution is unclear. 
Vic Toews, Minister for public security, in turn, confirmed, his colleague from the justice, rob Nicholson, are currently with certain of this dossier to revise concerned. 
During the operation printemps in 2001, the groups of the motorradpolizisten was concerned, there were 131 people have been arrested, although the penal code has not been revived. 
Ottawa has, as a result of the law against gansterism prevailed.
