In the middle of secretly 
In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband, Argentine President, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy to their beliebtheitsrate 20 points to more than 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007. 
Whether it is, however, that in the next year to get re-elected, depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández kompromissbereiter than her late husband, your predecessor and political partner of Néstor Kirchner. 
The signs are not clear. 
Néstor Kirchner, even after the election, the economic policies of his wife, drew, was often on the budgets, the tax revenue, the economic growth and inflation does not fully into account. 
This allowed the presidential couple then, the extraeinnahmen spend as they see fit. 
On paper, the fernández-regierung lost in the last year, the majority in Congress. 
But the opposition is divided and Kirchners death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further divisions. 
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández. 
But after chaotic meetings (in which a Member of another in the face and others suggested the government of the bribery of lying), managed the Congress not to pass the budget for 2011. 
"I will not discuss," as the President. 
The 2010 budget now is for the next year, leaving the President still has more opportunity to spend money as they see fit. 
The economy is hot: probably it will this year by up to 9%. 
The official inflation rate is z.z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - the value of up to almost 30%. 
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was negatively by economic crises, said growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not the inflationssenkung. 
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, the private sector säuberte singled out for bullying and the National Institute of statistics and census indec, which then the official inflationsstatistiken schönte. 
Fernández now can we road? 
It has the private sector and the trade union leader has called for talks. 
And, according to official statements should wage increases in the next year to 18%, will be limited. 
The high world prices for agricultural products of Argentina have a strong boost to the economy. 
But the inflation undercut the burst through a big devaluation of 2002. 
Perhaps for this reason, Cristina Fernández would like Argentina again and economic terms to the rest of the world to follow. 
At the beginning of this year, the government had an agreement with shareholders holding the former rescheduling of the country in 2001. 
Fernández now appears to have an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which they owe about $6.7 billion. 
The Kirchners have had a review by the IMF, as elsewhere, always rejected. 
But in the last month, the economy Minister Amado boudou, announced that the fund in the drafting of a new national consumer price index "technical support." It looks as if this were the first step to cleaning up of the indec. 
It is not known whether Mr Fernández, after ending her term even without the support of her husband will be politically active. 
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely enough by the Kirchnerism. 
If the Argentines in March to return from their summer vacation, the wave of the sympatie, it has been shown to be, fizzled. 
If you want another election win, she must decide whether you many political decisions of their man quietly lifted.
