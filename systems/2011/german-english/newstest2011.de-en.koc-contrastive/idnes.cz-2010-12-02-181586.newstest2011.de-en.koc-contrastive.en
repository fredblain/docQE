More and more parents want to menschen-überwachungsgeräte, in order to control the youngsters have 
The fear for their own children grow, and as always, they consider more parents to monitor via GPS. 
The system, which was originally to searching for cars was invented, is as good as people, places, and in such cases would be helpful, as recently in the spurlosen disappearance of the nine-year anička janatková. 
The device is currently about as large as a packet of but soon, there should be no bigger than a wristwatch. 
Many people, the case of the missing anička in fear and so they were looking at ways and means, to better protect their children. 
Also for the price of an encroachment on their privacy. 
"We are all, to say that this is by no means herumspionieren, but an effective way to reduce the likelihood that it will lead to tragedy," Petr pilin of society because of macro, one of the suppliers of gps-ortungsgeräten on the Czech market. 
"I admit that, in response to the abuse of such devices can be, for example, if there is someone in the pocket, without knowing about it, but so far we have had no such case." 
"most customers are really buy it for security reasons," adds pilin added. 
In his opinion, should the child but always know what purpose the "box" and how they are used in an emergency. 
The kinderpsychologin Dana bočková has, however, suggest that a child, if there is such a thing, it may not bear its simply be dumped. 
"even very young children show great creativity when it comes to certain things deliberately to lose if they do not want to be controlled." 
"The phones were initially awoke to the parents of high expectations, but they can be just as easy as closure, this new überwachungsgeräte," says Mrs bočková. 
Your opinion is also controversial, if such a body in the event of an attack is actually helps. 
"on a planned abduction, the kidnappers almost always checked whether the child in any electronics, with which it could be located." 
"Today is the mobile phone." 
"If such überwachungsgeräte were wider use, they would also seek them, because their sale sure would be accompanied by massive advertising." 
"in these cases the police are the criminals are always a step ahead," says psychologist. 
But it removes a similar devices in a sudden attack by a paedophile can be extremely helpful. 
Roberta čech by society, according to the ortungsdienstleistungen RC monitoring, both for cars, as well as for people who can offer the existence of such an appliance and then help, if it immediately after the attack will be destroyed. 
"The device is so that it is exploring the respective positions in certain intervals." 
"even if it would immediately destroyed, at least, is the final position of the person concerned available." 
"with more expensive devices is even a neigungsmesser integrated, that is, if you hinfällt and bewegungslos breaks down, the machine immediately sends a warning to the position," claims Mr čech. 
In his opinion, similar services could also intelligent mobile phones with navigation perform, you only have a special software einzuspielen. 
The problem with the current positioning is that this is either about equipment in streichholzschachtel-größe, resemble the supporters or smaller mobile phones. 
So there is always the risk that they will lose. 
Mr pilin of the macro because tests, according to you, therefore, in the present devices, which look like normal digitaluhren. 
"This has the advantage that the possible attackers do not realise that there is a monitoring and localisation device. 
"or he notices that only after a certain time in what the police are a zeitvorsprung," he added. 
Regardless of the direction in which development is - towards armbändern or trailers, always will be the same technology, such as the fahrzeugortung. 
Therefore, the combination of ortungsfunktion through the gps-systems (just like the MS in the car) and the function of a mobile phone, which is the current position.
