Red Bull triumphs in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens 
The car will be improved with a software in real time. 
Red Bull since 2004 in the world of Formula 1 is moved their history in this splendid universe of speed of surprises and successes. 
Initially, no one paid much attention to the newcomer, and despite his sharply rising track record over the last few seasons and the final set, last November, all on the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso. 
Without the skills of the German pilots and champion Sebastian vettel or the performance of the motors of downgrade Renault to want, is the "secret weapon," the multinational Siemens Red Bull in the hands of, and thus a siegerteam created to become legend. 
In reality, is a powerful software to simulate of litigation, the German company in 2007 for purposes not with motor race have to do, on the market. 
This as plm informatikprogramm was called for the development of montageketten in factories around the world, energiewerken and precise instruments used. 
Question is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before this really will be constructed so errors and to avoid unnecessary costs. 
Plm, the development of the cameras of canon, the aircraft of Sukhoi and the most famous vehicles from Nissan. 
Siegfried russwurm, head of the industrieabteilung of Siemens, said that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 - factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes and improvements to the race and the tests are observed, and can carry out. 
Russwurm reveals that in 1992, in the rennst√§llen an average of ten engineers working in a season than three or four improvements could introduce. 
In red bulls team are currently 180 highly qualified young people. With powerful do they lead analyses and all sorts of changes to the rennwagen through. 
The siemens-manager said the plm-software was in the situation, all elements of the rennwagen of Red Bull to analyse and to improve, with the exception of the motors, exclusively responsible for the Renault. 
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamik and altered the safety elements. 
The changes may thanks to advanced production facilities and hightech-autoklaven within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulators in reality. 
The only border, this insane technical perfect is set, the $40 million, which is a Formula 1 racing - for his race team in a season can spend. 
Red Bull has its hightech-fabrik for the development and production of its rennwagen 50 kilometres from London in a remote location. 
It is two buildings in which visits - particularly of journalists - are severely circumscribed. 
Everything that is happening there is top secret. 
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion vettel and mark webber. 
But red bulls true Formula 1 - zweifelslos hero is the latest world champion Sebastian vetell. 
Behind the enormous technological resources, the energy-drink-hersteller in the service of his participation in the race tracks, hiding other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and whose reputation is nil. 
The technologichef of the plant, Steve nevey, stressed that, five years ago, you could say that the progress made in the area of R & D for rennwagen with 50 per cent for the victory and earned the pilots were responsible for the rest. 
Today, the anteilswerte changed. The technology makes 85 per cent of success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent. 
Nevey recognises that vettel and webber by computer can never be replaced, because they "are not voraussagbare gladiators."
