Belarus is in agreement, cannot continue to accumulate weapons-grade uranium 
In a surprising victory for President Obama 's campaign to global security of nuclear materials, the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. 
The deal has been in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei martynov in an additional article of the sicherheitsgipfels announced. 
The US government had for years sought to persuade, Belarus, not more highly enriched uranium to gather last spring and seemed to have reached a hurdle. 
But the US administration official told the Washington Post, that in the last two months, two secret agreement with Belarus have been made to 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian forschungsanstalt. 
The folks on the stage for the agreement on Wednesday, the rest of the material - to remove, according to an official staff who, because of the sensitivity of the matter remains anonymous, roughly 500 pounds. 
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama "nuclear sicherheitsgipfel of 47 nations" in April, the Belarus had excluded. 
And it was obviously well enough, at the invitation of the former Soviet Republic of the next summit in 2012. 
"I was really impressed with the fact that they have a seat on the nuclear sicherheitsgipfel (by 2012) want." 
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken luongo, President of the partnership of global security, a group on the promotion of nuclear safety. 
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant and important step" of Belarus. 
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, within four years to secure all vulnerable nuclear material. 
Since then, the US government of six countries, helped her to get rid of highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus will be the seventh. 
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush. 
At the time of Obama 's nuclear sicherheitsgipfel, the Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko, declared that the nation will never give up its uranium. 
"how to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos of what is, fundamentally waffenfähig, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time. 
"This is our raw material... we will not derive any dirty bombs and we will sell it on anyone." 
"We use it solely for research purposes, this is everything." 
Belarus, however, approached a few months ago in the United States, as there is interest in the meeting of an agreement anzeigte. 
The first time round, the uranium Belarus in October to remove was particularly complicated, because the material was easily irradiated, officials say. 
It has been in a spezialzug load, the more than 1 300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, officials say. 
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the official. 
The US government will pay for this effort $14 million, with a large proportion of the money in the Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which can be used not for nuclear weapons. 
"This was extremely carefully coordinated, in order to build trust," the agreement, which was signed by Clinton led, said Andrew bieniawski, a representative of the primary, which, at the global gefahrenreduzierung operates. 
The James Martin Center for nichtweiterzugebende studies estimates that Belarus in this year waffenfähhigen had at least 88 pounds of uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus wants, according to the joint agreement his camp until 2012. 
The relations between Belarus and the US have been strained for years, first and foremost because of Lukashenko 's harsh disregard for human rights. 
But the statement on Wednesday suggesting a possible rapprochement. 
"the progress of this global security issues heißend welcome, the United States of America and Belarus aware that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus, a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
