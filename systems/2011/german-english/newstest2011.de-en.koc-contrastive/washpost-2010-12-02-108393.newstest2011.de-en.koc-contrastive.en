Khmer Rouge veterans to confrontation with the past forced 
In a weak betonierten schoolroom before pointed with dirty and abblätternden walls, recalls the director of anlong veng high school to the man who built it in the future, the Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok. 
"everyone here loves Ta Mok." 
"He was a good leader and he has taken to his people," said sreng kor Ma, 42 years. 
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the slaughtermen," is the commander in this remote former Khmer rouge-hochburg in north-west Cambodia " s popular, where he built bridges, hospitals and infrastructure has developed and where thousands of former soldiers still lives. 
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, are longstanding supporters in anlong veng. 
In April allowed a local truth and versöhnungsforum the victims of the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime. 
In June, the government of a schulbuch, the first time that children of former soldiers of the history of the Khmer Rouge told. 
And in July, a gemeinschaftstribunal Cambodia and the UN for the first time, a former Member of the Khmer Rouge, when the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing khek iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison. 
With each of these developments, the fear among Khmer Rouge veterans alnlong vengs, hindered their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia. 
"There are still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said youk chhang, head of the documentation centre of Cambodia, an independent organisation, which the regime. 
"for them was the live under the Khmer Rouge glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." 
"It is divisive even families." 
During the Khmer Rouge reign over Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, revision or starvation. 
When the Vietnamese invaded in 1979 and the Pol pot-ied government overthrew fled the remnants of the regime and its armed forces on the border of Cambodia to Thailand. 
This widespread until December 1998, when the last movement, surrendered. 
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary guerrilla warfare from its base in the Western mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok, the next generation in anlong veng. 
But in the mid-1990s, when a crack through the UN peace accords in 1993, the first democratic elections in the country, have led to large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, to government, to hear what the kapitulationen of Ieng Sary in 1996 and nuan Chea Khieu Samphan and 1998. 
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who was not given in 1999 by government forces in the dangrek mountains were arrested. 
He died in 2006 in a prison in Phnom Penh, where he was at his trial. 
As their benefactors they are no longer protected, the majority of former Khmer Rouge fighters in the bring relief from grinding poverty of the rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory. 
Even if a few elitist official Khmer Rouge their local regierungsposten because they kept their arms of all time, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, ill-educated peasants. 
"These people have very little of the capitulation," said Sok leang benefited from the centre for justice and reconciliation across Cambodia, in anlong veng, also holds public forums. 
"They are enshrined in the utopian agrarideologie of the regime." 
"they grew up without any berufswissen." 
Sor Lim, 55, who as a teenager in 1974, the rhmer Rouge had joined, fought in the jungle by anlang veng, before he niederließ in 1998 to a life of poor reisbauer. 
"The live under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said. 
"Ta Mok everyone has something to eat." 
"But now, life is difficult, because we must look to ourselves." 
The current, the Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also brings concerns here. 
At the beginning of next year, will seek the Court, Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng thirith, another former Khmer Rouge ministers, to court. 
The mandate given to the Court, it is the old leaders and those who, mainly for the atrocities are responsible, to condemn them, but it is not to say whether it is on these four cases further actions will follow. 
This has little contributed in anlong veng to alleviate fears. 
Current media speculation have gathered in the chaem, 64 years, the during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s distriktchefin in the province had been manteay meanchey. 
In 2007, they are representative of the documentation centre of Cambodia, she had told the construction of the dam, trapeang thma led a project in which thousands of forced labour probably died. 
On a hot night in the chaem came from the work in the fields to its holzhaus in a dirty streets outside of anlong veng. 
As the sun long shadow over the desiccated grass threw in the chaem rejected it, about their history with the Khmer Rouge to discuss. 
Should the Court they vorladen, so they would refuse to go, she said. 
"Cambodia is living in peace and stability," she said. 
"There would be no prosecutions would be more to this war." 
Prime Minister Hun Sen, the in 1878 from the Khmer Rouge has fled, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, the Court would more suspects on trial, although experts and historians to discuss this. 
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said. 
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to be able to go forward, said youk chhang, the documentation. 
"reconciliation with the khmer-zeiten means bring together the broken pieces," he said. 
"It is our duty, this broken parts together, so that we can all understand." 
The Centre has created the first approved by the government schulbuch on the Khmer Rouge, the 75seitige "history of the democratic Cambodia." 
There, the book was published in June in anlong veng appended to the history books for the high school of the Ministry, which is less than four sides on the Khmer Rouge. 
As often happens in Cambodia know the young people in anlong veng, little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the links of the city to the regime. 
Touch valeak, 19 years, a student at anlong veng high school, said that the new schulbuch students, is an important part of your history to understand. 
But his parents were sceptical when he brought the book home, in order to read it. 
"My family is not opposed to many parts of the book and the Court," he said. 
"They are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people will be sentenced by the Court." 
Such a resistance makes the reconciliation process is complex and complicated, said leang Sok. 
But the public forums, the schulbuch and the Court and to gain influence, "he said. 
Still owns the Khmer Rouge is a powerful attraction. 
Up in the dangrek mountains leads one of sträuchern überwucherter and with plastikmüll verdreckter path to a rechteck of black soot, covered with a pair of rusty Tin Roof adapted. 
Pol Pot 's body was here after his death in 1998 in a reifenhaufen had been burned. 
Nuom sothea, 31 years, a handyverkäuferin on the roadside, said she does not know much about the man, who had been burned. 
"But he has a strong spirit, and many of the people here go to order him to pray," she said. 
It was sotheas nuom birthday and later in the day, it wanted to go to Pol Pot 's final resting place, where a Bush will give an ripe bananas - in the hope that he will bring their luck.
