Obama stop new drilling 
Off the coast of the us-bundesstaats Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years there will be no new drilling. 
Such a ban, the government in Washington - and so that their previous plans were withdrawn once and for all. 
Also in the Atlantic coast remain for new Drilling techniques. 
This Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar said Wednesday. 
The catalyst for the strict ban on which, at least for the next five years should apply, is the explosion of the bohrplattform "Deepwater Horizon" in April. 
Before the accident that claimed the lives of 11 workers and to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had led to pressure from the opposition and the industry to its willingness to new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico. 
The advocates want the dependence of the United States from foreign oil. 
Who was responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf, is still not finally settled. 
In the centre of the criticism, the British energy company BP, which is faced with milliardenforderungen. 
A committee of inquiry on behalf of Obama is, in the course of 2008 to submit their results. 
In October, Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar the bohrstopp imposed after the explosion. 
Following various oil companies had immediately applications for new bohrvorhaben. 
With stricter controls and tougher safety regulations want Obama and Salazar a repetition. 
At the moment, the competent supervisory authorities, which, after numerous corruption charges was in disrepute, radically reformed. 
At the same time, Obama has announced that lucrative loopholes for the oil and gaskonzerne. 
The industry warns now publicly before, that the level of production in the Gulf by a tighter regulation would be markedly lower than hitherto. 
"the plans of the government are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a current branchenumfrage by the consultant bdo - even before the bohrverbot from Wednesday. 
The American energy alliance also complained about the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows what happened with the regulation that will change." 
Investment in new projects would be delayed until further - at the expense of growth.
