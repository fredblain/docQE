450 million in contracts without competition 
Hydro-québec, mutual understanding projektplanungsfirmen 450 million dollars in contracts for the eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert hydro-power project. 
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 treaties a consortium, consisting of the firms bpr, Dessau, Groupe sm and axor, the main proportion, namely, the projektleitung, to a value of $295 million without invitation to tender has been received. 
This consortium, called "énergie gérance" in 2004, has as a corollary of the decision from hydro-québec, the private sector of their responsibility for this important, hydroelectric project in equivalent of a sum of $5 billion to set up myself. 
At the beginning of 2005 ergatterte the consortium "énergie gérance" the lucrative contract, without there being a public invitation to tender had been made. 
For the Parti québécois is resorting to unternehmenskonsortien a serious ethical problem, the the risk of the wettbewerbsverdrändung and an increase in prices. 
"This is a new way to a conspiracy and overcome the competition." 
"This means that rather than abgekartete games rather than on secret way is now being investigated in a more open form," said yesterday Sylvain simard, a Member of the PQ, at the press conference. 
Early in the morning simard had the issue before the national assembly, because it seems to him hard to understand how the interests of the public in this way can be served. 
Ressourcenministerin Nathalie normandeau had responded by the afternoon, they vehemently deny, that this Treaty is a stitch-up, would have acted. 
"I am sticking to my line," lashed out, by the PQ confirmed, was "dishonest" and it "lacked rigour." 
She said it was "the least" that the PQ is sorry. 
The model of the consortium is common practice in the world. 
It is usually a temporary order such temporary alliance which it two or more companies, allowed their expertise on a requirement for a tender for a complex project. 
The project "eastmain" has a high komplexitätsniveau relating to its arbeitsausmaßes. 
The construction techniques is under way and should be drawn up until 2012. 
Despite this, it was awarded the contract without competition had can take place; there had been negotiations. 
Furthermore, the model of the consortium in Quebec, even on a relatively simple projects by no means an exception. 
As the newspaper Le Devoir published "last week, is noted in the field of bauingenieur- and beratungswesens applied model of the consortium has been the subject of regierungsermittlungen. 
A brief overflying the quebecer unternehmensregisters allows, more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of persistent duration. 
In this way, for example, the firm Dessau is working in partnership with the majority of their kernkonkurrenten, + Cima, génivar, snc-lavalin or even Roche and tecsult count, together. 
Any link, and there are several dozen, at one and the same legal person, namely in Dessau. 
What the consortium "énergie gérance," normandeau Minister stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special arbeitskräftedynamik hydro-québec to this fact and that since the 1970s in a particular way and bill heap." 
Réal laporte, the big employers of the Société d 'énergie de la Baie James (sebj), has issued a statement on the nose, so the fact that the Treaty on the projektleitung after agreement was approved. 
"If you ask a tender power and there are only a few candidates, will your prices to soar." 
"You have two possibilities: either you nimmst the people on this Mart and you are saying: you will be a satisfactory agreement to negotiate a good price." 
"The idea is not, however, that the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," added laporte. 
This the consortium "énergie gérance" approved contract is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 of the Parti québécois $received. 
The Treaties have been either of the hydro-québec or the sebj for the project eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert approved. 
After review, one of the newspaper, "Le Devoir published" more than 100 ingenieurs- and beraterverträge, the companies or their branches, including, in particular, ressourcenlabors, between 2002 and March 2010 were allowed. 
Snc-lavalin had 22 contracts in itself gerafft, génivar had 16, 14 and 10 tecsult Dessau, without their participation in this, "énergie gérance counting." 
All of these contracts have been negotiated. 
It is estimated the entire on 783 344 $449, including the Treaty with "énergie gérance" about 295 131 564 $. 
Sylvain simard had indicated that the four firms, which form the consortium (bpr, Dessau, Groupe sm axor) and the "Parti libéral du Quebec well known." 
Minister normandeau had suggested, the PQ is equally associated with the firms that they "funded," before they specify that they are, rather, its managers.
