The right mattress and the right bettenrost? women have other wishes than men 
Not the tollste bettrahmen, but the quality of the liegefläche - mattress and rost make the good bed. 
These must, however, harmony, in order to supplement the wishes of the specific user. 
In selecting the many things to play a role - the weight, the size of the state of health and, last but not least, the gender of the schläfers. 
Just as important is the interieur where mattress and subordinate rost. 
Typical example? 
In a wochenendhaus, in which no heated on a regular basis, latexmatratzen are not well suited to much longer because they need in order to "warm." 
In addition, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethan-matratzen. 
And, they should be turned on a regular basis. 
If it is not enough entlüftungskanälchen in the core and have yet to have a solid record, staut humidity in itself: it is not therefore ruled that under their mould will. 
In the election, of course, also plays a role, to which it is used. 
Those long periods of time was abroad, where very high with mattresses weichschicht fare, will be difficult to a low mattress with hard surface can get. 
"probably all hockey players, who are stuck in the NHL, have complained to me that they are no longer able to sleep properly." 
"for their abgeschundenen shoulders, heels and hüften they need just a weichschicht from visco-schaum (memory foam, a formgedächtnis-polymer)." 
"This, I recommend including diabetic people under a disorder of the nervous system, so that they are suffering from the" information "from the gelenken and the skin can receive bad," said hadamcziková Sylva, which specializes in polstermöbel. 
That is why I have many years ago eishockeyspielern, but also other customers these mattresses with visco-schaum (memory foam) concerned. 
"Today, this is no longer a problem, since such mattresses provide the tempur among manufacturers, the Italian company magniflex or the Czech manufacturer tropico." 
And one need not be a famous hockey players for the benefits of the visco-schaums learn to appreciate. 
This "miracle" actually works quite simple. 
The foam optimalisiert his toughness and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, he is schmiegt on warm body. 
Nowhere is there, in the middle of the night shifts we are not as around after a major battle. 
You simply sleep much better. 
The viskoelastische foam also offers protection against dekubitus (gangrene). 
The election of the matratzengröße you should still be at the height of the length of the fußsohlen add is approximately 21 to 34 cm. 
As Mrs Mann, of the 180 cm in size, need as a 210 to 220 cm long bed. 
Each of the schläfer ought to be at least 90 cm liegebreite available, so together 180 cm. 
In einzelbetten, for example in singles, are 120 to 140 cm. 
For the comfort and also for any visitors. 
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb for the ideal bettbreite: "If you take on the backs of lies, should have enough room for the easy angewinkelten poor," ing advises. Prokopová Helena, the zunftmeisterin the polsterer and raumausstatter, which has for many years the issue of common sense and makes the ergonomics of furniture is dedicated to this issue and at university. 
In a doppelbett everyone needs a home and his own mattress, but be careful when buying products, so that the mattresses are too high. 
Otherwise there is nothing, as the roste variations in assembling and that is not in any bettrahmen possible. 
Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with federskelett 15 cm, ought to be at least three centimetres in the formschicht and the feinpolster alone. 
"with the hand or sit down, we must in any case, feel the feathers," warns prokopová Helena. 
Each mattress makes a special rosttyp needed. 
Ganzgepolsterte beds with bed and document as zusammengewachsene siamzwillinge have nothing to look in the bedroom. 
These mattresses are not to reveal the terms and you cannot wash today, which already is. 
And because you are in a single night between 0.2% to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years to a huge (and congested sieve). 
This is also why reject werbeslogans specialists, the mattresses in a lifespan of up to 25 years, and yes even lifelong guarantee promises. 
Every cause has its if and buts. 
And it is therefore a practical advice from dealers: mattresses of 120 or 140 cm wide should the hygiene of the waschbaren, abziehbaren remuneration should not be afraid, however, it is recommended that a matratzenschoner, you have to leave and can easily wash. 
Even if today, in the rule matratzenbezüge with rundumreißverschluss produced after the open, so that you get two halves (immensely important for the waschvorgang and the waschmaschinengröße!), looks the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially just pointed out, often as the unequal battle between David and Goliath. 
Have you in bed instead of a rostes a fixed panel? 
Out with it. 
Or a maximum for a bed for undesirable guests and for a single night. 
Even so, you should be preferred to the plate with lüftungslöchern oversight (if not in there already are) and mattresses with federskelett and 15 cm floor with so-called taschenfederkern and feinpolster use. 
Polyurethan-matratzen belong on such a document is not. 
For not verstellbare lattenroste with 14 to 18 federleisten (lamellen) are latex- or sandwichmatratzen suited (possibly even combinations of latex and kokos), always figures are roste with a larger lattenanzahl, 28 and more federleisten from, with lordosenstütze in lendenwirbelbereich and the possibility of the lattenhärte to regulate. 
On verstellbare lamellenroste include no mattresses with federskelett, since they are not on the ergonomische verstellung respond. 
In addition to the suspension of the stiff the federleisten will also be special flexible schultermodule. 
There is a specific integration of the federleisten, enabling the federleisten einzudrücken or even to verwinkeln, that it is the odd einsinken the shoulder of the schläfers. 
Especially for men with broad shoulders of an important matter. 
There are even matratzenhersteller have started, "herrenmatratzen" weichzonen for the schulterbereich to use. 
Also in the ladies is - you guessed it takes these weichzonen in the hüftgegend. 
For ambitious customers are punktelastische flügelfedersysteme (lattoflex) or roste with punktelastischen kontakt-pads with so-called multitorsionsfederung. 
The pressure will be distributed at several points, and thereby reduce the tension. 
But, if you are on the right mattress and right rost a bad (too big and fülliges) kopfkissen, used to go to most of the gains will be lost. 
Here too, a rule of thumb: the kopfkissen is the head, his tips should only up to the shoulders of rich, so that the schultermuskeln can relax. 
Ideal is therefore a 50 X 60 cm great cushion, as it may, for example, the Scandinavians. 
In the seitenlage should be the kopfkissen (along with the schulterentlastungszone rost or in the weichzone in the bed of the schulterhöhe). 
Rather, our modern mattresses, with the former (with hay festive) strohsäcken but in common. 
Modern manufacturers increasingly use natural materials, or at least their mixtures. 
Also in the new magic formula mattresses "organic." 
Instead of erdölrohstoffen we used for the manufacture of polyurethanschäumen frequent naturelle oils - for example, rizinus- and soya oil. 
Soya is known to be used by all manufacturers. 
"organic is, in other words, the mattresses at its heart from materials purely natural origin, there is," said Petr vašíček by the firm tropico plus. 
Naturstoffe but they are also used in the manufacture of matratzenbezügen - one of the first was aloe Vera. 
We can but also mikrokapseln, sleep in the fresh woodland or lavendelduft. 
Here too there is a difference between a man and a woman. 
While the men a "kühlender" pflanzenextrakt from birkenblättern used so that the matratzenbezug absorb the heat and cool the body can have the salary for women "wärmende" effect. 
Extracts from red paprikaschoten rain in the blood, the weaker sex will sleep in the wohlig warm words. 
And the current favorites? 
Mattresses from kaltschaum (he has more poren with devastated zellstruktur and is therefore atmungsaktiver than standard polyurethan and also much more flexible). 
Through the combination of the various stiff (force) of kaltschäumen and visco-schäumen mehr-zonen-matratzen arise, the know exactly where head, hip and heels. 
For a high-end mattress is 7,000 crowns and to fork out more. 
Gesundheitsmatratzen are, however, usually with a lower value added tax, since you, as a medical tool. 
As the first Czech companies were gumotex this advantage. 
You see, on the bed and on rost save is not so easy. 
And again there are special offers of manufacturers and dealers, the two mattresses for the price of an offer. 
The brand magniflex the mattress duofreeze with in relation verstepptem visco-schaum memory for 11.990 CZK. 
The second one gets free to do so. 
It was the tempur material, that the era of the viskoelastischen schaumstoffe with open zellstruktur and dense in almost kosmischem pace. 
Not surprisingly, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts at the launch of enormous überbelastungen. 
Tempur will warm soft, in a cool place, in turn, reinforces it. 
So it fits perfectly in the human body and spread over the best way körperdruck. 
It is therefore not just ideal for the prevention of druckbrand, but increased the schlafkomfort generally. 
Viskoelastische schaumstoffe but they are not only in mattresses, but also in other gesundheitsprodukten, such as, for example, in particular fußpolstern used the legs and the gefäßen relief are laid down. 
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, the schaumstoffe eucatherm C, twinsaver or similar products.
