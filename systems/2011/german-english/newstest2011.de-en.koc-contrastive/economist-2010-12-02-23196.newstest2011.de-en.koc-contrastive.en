Weak applause for China 
Taiwan voters are coming to slow closer links with the mainland. 
What does Taiwan from his big brother across the Straits? 
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, which is 70% of all eligible voters, in the five city 's to elect mayors and councillors. This will be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou. 
Through the development of cutting-edge business, einschl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland. His policy has the relationship with the Chinese motherland, for the first time since 1949 permanently changed. 
Ma has insisted the examination, but just barely. 
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT), three of the five mayor, it received no majority. 
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has a greater independence for Taiwan supports, almost 50% of the vote, the KMT received 45%. 
In a presidential election would mean for Ma problems. 
Since his election two years ago is the support of his party by around 8%. 
For the first time the DPP drew even, together with the KMT in the councillors. 
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as lastwagenkonvois with reclaim flaggen-schwenkende massenumz체ge and sparse dancers worked. 
There was even the obligatory, mysterious attempted. 
Sean LIEN, the son of Lien Chan and the KMT held on the eve of the election in a speech at a kmt-kandidaten, 
When a man from the crowd in the face of lap. LIEN was wounded and a umstehender spectators were killed. 
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter LIEN or kill a dispute with the candidate wanted to settle. 
Regardless of the attack, according to tsai ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the election, and the DPP in a bad light, which has provided the KMT more votes. 
China may have been the biggest winners in the campaign. 
It was the relationship with the mainland. 
Instead, the candidates debated over plans to housing and the creation of jobs. 
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and are opposed to China " s milit채rbedrohung. 
This is why the KMT its relations with the government in Beijing does not want to see in the forefront. 
But this time also has avoided the DPP, the anti-Chinese feelings too much. 
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan 's economy cannot survive without China. 
Ma, for its part, would like to confirm that the majority of the Taiwanese in its China policy. 
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy, Taiwan with economic incentives in the Community zur체ckzulocken. 
China sent immediately after Taipei, a negotiator for a summit meeting to prepare for investment and medical cooperation. 
Certainly, it also wants a political integration. But the most important thing first. 
It would prefer to wait until after the 2012 presidential election. 
The DPP has reinvented itself now. 
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: the former leader Chen Shui-bian sat in jail for corruption. 
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was strongly in favour of the complete independence. 
But under tais reign has developed a new generation gem채ssigter politicians and the DPP struggling to find the voices of the professionals and young people. 
Tsai took place as a presidential candidate of the DPP great support, such as Su tseng-chang under Chen. 
Now, their party is doing everything possible to show that they, too, is in a position to establish close relations with Beijing. 
Tsai is planning a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this requires open-minded discussion. 
Tsai said publicly that their party is a "reliable alternative" offer to Mas vorschneller rapprochement with China. 
Chen seems very angry about this change. 
From his cell, he said the candidates from the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan independence. 
He urged the pragmatists Su even on, on the presidential candidacy. 
Even without Chen interference is difficult for the DPP, its possible to elect candidates. 
The KMT will need to undergo a own self-analysis. 
Mas values are a bad thing, despite the rapid economic growth; the kmt-kandidaten wanted their campaign without him. 
The main reason for his unpopularity seem to unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor. 
According to a kmt-sprechers will he, his cabinet and the local institutions. 
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is a rapprochement only restricted. 
While at the same time, most Taiwanese economic cooperation with China as inevitable. 
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist at, "there is already a point of no return."
