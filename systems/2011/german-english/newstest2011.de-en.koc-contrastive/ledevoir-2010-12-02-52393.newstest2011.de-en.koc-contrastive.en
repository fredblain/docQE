Bond for the takeover of excentris 
The quebecer government, which the Société Angus and the company parallèle, called on contribute financially to the adoption of the kinokomplexes excentris, explains with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive bond. 
The entwicklergesellschaft Angus and the company parallèle a donation of $7 million from the kultusministerium for the adoption of Daniel Langlois was kinokomplexes excentris on the Boulevard saint-laurent had hoped for, in order to get this back to his real cineastischen function, appears not to receive what they have called for. 
The government has accepted, although in this case, too, but on their own terms. 
Instead of the expected donation offers the quebecer government rather a bond in less than the amount initially had hoped for a viable solution to advantageous conditions could launch, at least in the opinion from the State scaremongers entnehmbaren sources. 
A first action plan as well as a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, the bittgesuch was again since the overall downwards. 
A proposal, together with an action plan has already been made by the President of the 'Société de Développement des Entreprises culturelles " (sodec), François macerola, Minister st-pierre, the acts of excentris chairs. 
Several days ago he was her one last sachbericht. 
The counter-proposal from the cabinet was sent but the sodec on Wednesday. 
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December, at this time to reply. 
In any case, the premise of the staatsspende seems really to have been pushed aside. 
Let us remember that the quebecer eigentümergemeinschaft cinemas and kinokomplexe against a direct staatsinvestition to support the takeover of excentris had revolted by this argument, stories about the culture ministers have no financial aid for immobilienprojekte there to do, which he does not also other cinemas. 
Several other market segment of the cases, however, in contrast, a substantial economic assistance. 
Kinochef Daniel Langlois, according to the design of the cinema for self-financed over ten years under great difficulties, the autorenkino in the confines of his kinokomplexes presented, as regards the exception from the treasury could justify. 
The lack of cinema, the independent films show in Montreal, is more than obvious, and excentris knew his clients in the book. 
Société Angus and the company parallèle with Christian yaccarini taxes at the top, in turn, is a privately financed campagne, of the 700 000, a sum $expect, in order to boost the acquisition. 
Since the spring of 2009, only a single screen, films in excentris continues to show, namely Le parallèle. 
The aim of the future purchasers, it is, the three theatres on 27 February of next year with the showing of the very successful film by Xavier beauvois "des hommes et of dieux 'newly opened. 
Christian yaccarini but did the newspaper, "Le Devoir published" not removed, and it ignores what he and his group from the revised downwards, the proposals we made you.
