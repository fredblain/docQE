Durchgesickertes portrayed us-dokument Moscow as a port of corruption 
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and it is a part of the bribes and of the schutzgeldes darlings, which you, to the Kremlin continues. As reported in February, the American Embassy in Russia in a memo. 
Both police and the state security service blackmail high protection money, so that they keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, so they say. 
They collect money not just of legitimate businesses, but also of organised criminal gangs. 
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as a "vertical of power" - takes its part of the money which the head to the top. 
The memo, which, under the name of the ambassador John beyrle after Washington was broadcast on Tuesday by WikiLeaks published on its web site. 
The memo is based on sources, whose names have been edited. 
It was written while still of Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov was, and it accuses him of corruption. 
He was in October by President Dmitry Medvedev fired, but there is little evidence that in the meantime, it would have been clearing up. 
Luzhkov, and his wife, Yelena baturina, who owns a construction company, have repeatedly rejected charges of corruption for years, and he has won numerous verleumdungsklagen against such accusations. 
In September he told a Russian television station, when he was asked for a documentary, which suggests he is corrupt: "It is crazy, it is dirty, it is dirty." 
An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, which polls have shown. 
But it is unusual that, as the report of the ambassador, individuals will be called, and it is that this is addressed by a diplomat of a foreign country. 
"The direct link to the government of Moscow with the crime has led to some people they describe as" disrupted "and come to the conclusion that the government is more like a kleptokrat acts as a government," according to the memo. 
"criminal elements" enjoy a kryshna " (a term from the world of criminal / of the mafia, what word for word" roof "or protection means), which is concerned about the police, the Stasi (FSB), the dienstaufsichtsbehörde (MVD) and the office of the public prosecutor, as well as spread through the entire regierungsbürokratie Moscow. 
Experts have a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow. 
"Luzhkov is at the top." 
"The FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage." 
"least consequences of the ordinären criminal and the criminal inspectors at the bottom." 
"This is a inkompetentes system, in which criminal groups in some areas, a gap is because the city offering no help." 
The report goes on to say that the FSB money from the biggest firms from the police and the small business people were arrested. 
A source says, "explained that Moscow shopkeepers understand that it is best to include the protection of the MVD and FSB to receive (and not from the organised crime), since they are not only more weapons, resources and power as the criminals, but also because they are protected by law." 
"This is the reason why the protection by criminal gangs, not more so, as asked in the past." 
The memo noted that, while the collection of the money is comprehensive, protecting themselves very modest no; even the, the figures are sometimes arrested. 
The figures, which do not find their business very quickly - because of one or other under. 
Medvedev has repeatedly spoken of the need to fight corruption, but at the same time, he noted that little progress has been made. 
The memo, the message contains descriptions of men who, with suitcases full of money, which probably were, in the Kremlin. 
"in his fight against corruption must Medvedev to leave the bureaucrats," said Georgy satarov, director of by, a Moscow think tank, in a recent interview. 
"But he is part of the bureaucracy." 
"It is not part of the political class, because a political class in Russia no longer exists." 
Without an opposition politicians, and without, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable. 
Nationwide, by the corruption of Russia, will cost more than $300 billion per year. 
The country ranks at number 154 to a recent study on global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation transparence internationally (countries will be of "least corrupt" to "most corrupt"). 
The revelation of the American embassy, which surely after Moscow time happened late, will certainly displeasure within the Russian Government, even though, as Luzhkov for the mistakes of Moscow can be blamed for the Kremlin, it also can be a way to claim that the problems of issues. 
In an interview with Larry King on CNN, Putin claimed that the wikileaks-dokumente might be a forgery and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats him Batman and Robin Medvedev mentioned. 
"The truth is that it is our interaction is an important factor in the internal politics in this country," he said. 
"But to be honest, we would not have expected that this would happen with such arrogance, such a pressure and so unethical way, you know."
