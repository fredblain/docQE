The eis-universität 
In the "gelato university" in Bologna eiskonditoren to be better prepared for seasons. 
The three-day grundkurs for future gelatieri has the most numerous and visitors from around the world. 
Where does the whole ice? 
The gelatiere and the gelataio. 
The gelatiere, something the eiskonditor antiquated in German, the cream, following all the rules of Italian eismacherkunst. 
The gelataio drawers with a spachtel the ice cream from the kühltheke, it in the waffel and then selling them. 
In order for it to know that we must not after anzola Dell 'Emilia in the province of Bologna. 
But who still want to know more about ice, which is not on the "gelato-university" the Italian firm carpigiani over. 
The eis-universität, the manufacturer of eismaschinen set up in 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines across the high Italian ideals. 
The three-day grundkurs for future gelatieri has the most numerous and visitors from around the world. 
But there is also mehrtägige spezialkurse around the schokoladeneis and internships in the hauseigenen eisdiele. 
Some in the midlife-crisis dreaming of a new career, other cars simply time on the treacherous ice of their vague aspirations. 
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia. 
Jacky, kunstlehrer from California, loves the slow-food-bewegung and wants the country to the industrial ice-cream, in future, a European quality product offer. 
Anke from Berlin is unternehmensberaterin and wants to after years in a nerve-racking job eintüten something of their own. 
Two young ägypterinnen dream in Cairo to open a eisdiele. 
A man from Malta and a from Brazil want the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and improve the Canadian housewife Julia is because their children love Italian ice cream. 
Maestro-gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains the participants, firstly the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream. 
It is vital, not only of good taste, but also the seidige fluidity and the good consistency. 
Luciano forgets at his training but also not the icing on the cake of all national and South überbaus: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of romanticism." 
The first step to manufacture seems simple. 
Luciano dump the grundzutaten milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilisers in a large mixgerät which, with an electronic programme everything at 85 degrees and then cooked immediately on four degrees cools. 
Then he turns to the machine on a tap, and out comes a pasteurised White basiscreme, basis for all milcheissorten. 
The teacher immediately they were all practically crowding me with questions: can you only ice cream with natural substances without stabilising factor? 
How can one of their own experimentierlust give free rein? 
Luciano warns the zeitgeist to mislead. 
Who of ice cream "only from natural ingredients' speech, perhaps, has nonetheless used stabilisers - usually a product of nature, such as guarkernmehl from the guarbohne. 
Of course you can ice without stabiliser, only it must then be sold within a day, or else it sackt in together, and the customer bites on eiskörnchen louder. 
Certain variations in the grundmasse are allowed. 
It will be more exciting with the flavourings. 
For the taste of the ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients, the one in the obst-abteilung or the sweets of buying supermarket. 
In addition, there are there and pasten powder. 
"The suppliers will all try to foist onto them dozens of aromatised additions." 
"But they should simply time to experiment." 
Either the fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruits. 
Or just in the ice cream from the White grundmasse with eggs to a yellow flower with kakaopulver and will form the basis for all kinds of schokoladen-verführungen. 
Now, the kursteilnehmer to the eismaschinen. 
Luciano, they each four different types of vanille-, schokolade-, mokka- and produce haselnuss-eis - with or without eggs in the grundmasse, with more or less vanillearoma or other natural additives. 
The same experiment will also be subject to the fruchteissorten. 
More flavourings, more frucht-püree -; that is not necessarily better. 
Haselnuss-eis tastes not necessarily nussiger if it contains nuts. 
The most popular kiwi-eis, the working party, which more fruit, use less water and less stabiliser. 
Only a balanced mix will highlight the taste of a gelato correctly, says Luciano. 
Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: will pfirsich-püree with a lot of sugar, used the sugars in the grundrezept must be reduced. 
For zitroneneis is a extraportion sugar is necessary. 
Luciano prefers a device with which he stressed the sugar content of the fruchtsorten (winegrowers fairs so that the oechsle in grape must). 
Fortunately, the rechnerei easier tables. 
Ice does not require longer to make so much physical use as before. 
Not just the equipment for the manufacture of the automatic grundmasse helps. 
There is even a device, in which the final eis-mischung while at the same time, cremig beaten and on minustemperaturen gekühlt. 
Despite all the automation remain small glitch. 
The Brazilian Gustavo himself and his kurskollegen intervention from top to bottom with fruchtpüree him, as the überdimensionale hand blenders spirals out of control. 
"in every direction," says Maestro Luciano, "it is only a matter of time before such a thing has happened."
