The trail of stones 
Uli gsell has also what concerned, a total of about 400 kg. 
On Monday night, he stood before Stuttgart station, on the back of the tuba. 
It was demo. 
It snowed heavily. 
The story is well known: in September were the angerückt excavators and had started, a large chunk of the nordflügels. 
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: thousands protested against S21, the multi-billion dollar tieferlegung of the railway station. 
When it came to "freeze," there was a large part of the left in ruins. 
Shattered in 6,000 to 7,000 pieces. 
Crailsheimer produce, a soft rough stone, between 1914 and 1920. 
Gsell is sculptor in ostfildern, 43 years old. 
He has a few of the headache. 
"These are reliquien stones." 
"They must not disappear." 
He schwärmt: "a cheap and poor Stein, simple and erdenhaft." 
When he was a aufsägte, according to zigarettenqualm gerochen. 
What he will do with the headache, knows he has not. 
Stones have time. 
Uli gsell also. 
The trail leads the Stuttgart stones in a forest in Tübingen to a former munitionsdepot the French army, where Manuel rongen his stein-reich has built. 
The 44-jährige acts with old stones. 
He has bought all the demolition in Stuttgart fell. 
"It would be a shame, you would gemahlen Schotter or disappear in the hole," he says in his office, a holzbüdchen, which once was a wachhäuschen. 
Insulted and threatened him, he was told, when, in September in the newspapers that he is the remnants of the nordflügels from abbruchunternehmer bought. 
But he has with the s-21-gegnern talk for several days. 
And he has stated that he does nothing for the demolition. 
And now, even if it is, then it is but the most sensible, if the stones were used. 
About 200 s-21-gegner took an average of 80 kilos of serious quader with, stückpreis 6,50 to 14 euros. 
As a memory, but also some in the hope of him in a reconstruction to be able to return. 
500 tonnes of rongen had bought 25 large truckloads. 
About half is still in the forest, the rest is sold. 
Gartenbesitzer, gardeners of the countryside, häuslebauer. 
They were coming from everywhere and had weggeschleppt what boot and supporters could bear. 
The Stuttgart stones of contention have long been in "mäuerle" or turned in by kräuterbeeten limitations. 
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says rongen. 
"would not be the political dimension." 
He is rising in his SUV, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of great empire. 
He has studied law and later suspended biology, then he is for computers is interested in, and eventually become steinhändler. 
And steinliebhaber. 
40000 tonnes of stones, he found. 
From across Germany karrt he combined his treasures. 
He says that he is the biggest altsteinhändler of the Republic. 
He put brakes on it. 
In the snow are skilful behauene sandsteine. 
"They once belonged to Dresden marienbrücke," he told. 
Elbsandstein, amber, warm, he schwärmt. 
"My lieblingsstein." 
It is the way high through the forest. 
It shows a bunch: red sandstein, previously part of the Karlsruhe railway station. 
And on. 
"beautiful travertin." 
Once the quader belonged to the gallery of the Stuttgart neckarstadions. 
Across the snow stones and stories, cannstatter travertin from Stuttgart, rötlicher stone is complemented with more from the cathedral, St. blasien tuff from Heilbronner hospital. 
What kind of work that effort, which sweat. 
If rongen thinks about how the stones used nail by hand and with simple flaschenzügen and ochsenkarren were mobilized, it is not reverential. 
"It would be a scandal if such a thing would schreddern." 
He is not rich has become very rich, certainly not. 
But 14 people, the steinhändler today, also have been up in the forest steinmetze, a sculptor, a Smith, a glasbläser and settled a horticulturalists. 
"We work hard, but it is satisfactory," says the resteverwerter. 
He must soon after Cologne. 
Also there are to save the stones.
