Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum, beer is out - it is simply too slow 
Fernet, rum and vodka, exceptionally, who is also a good whisky, the one from the father of the hausbar has stolen. 
These are the drinks, for whose benefit from drunken Czech teenager under fifteen most commonly notbehandelt must be. 
No exceptions are children, the repeated their hangovers in the hospital ausschlafen. 
This is from the experience of doctors, with similar cases in the inclusion of the kinderabteilungen of clinics are facing. 
"beer or wine are completely out of fashion, because it was simply too long until you get drunk." 
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol," said právo luděk Pelikán, who used the senior physician of the kinderabteilung in the mittelböhmischen clinic hořovice. 
"whisky, if it succeeds, the father of a bottle from the hausbar to, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka. 
"vodka has the advantage that it can interfere with juice, then it is not as strong smell," said the senior physician. 
The speaker of the fakultätskrankenhauses motol Eva jurinová gives him right. 
"most frequently involves Fernet or rum." 
"This is the alkoholtrend today, particularly in primary schools." 
"It was important to slivovice, we feel at home," said Mrs jurinová. 
Senior physician Pelikán according to dreizehn- or 14-year drinkers in the krankenhausaufnahme no anomaly. 
Before the clinic in hořovice, in which he has been working this year, he was 10 years in the pädiatrie-abteilung of the hospital motol, where the rettungswagen angetrunkene pupils from both near and far then. 
"A girl four times and had to be taken." 
"It began their careers with 12 years ago, when she was the first time with 3.5 per alcohol in the blood and in combination with" extase "was admitted," the doctor described a particularly severe case. 
"It was in the ausstellungsgelände in Holešovice on any tanzparty." 
"The interesting thing is that it was their mother is not at all strange was that their daughter, not 48 hours came home," the senior physician wonders. 
The lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance at the launch of its own with the sprösslingen is one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children. 
A true dependency in the true sense of the word, it is not, according to experts in children. 
"under alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and related phenomenon to understand and that is not the case in these children." 
Among those who enjoy repeatedly alcohol, is mostly a negative familiär-sozialer characteristic background, "said senior physician Pelikán. 
The spokeswoman for the hospital, according to motol Mrs jurinová, have until the middle of November, around 40 drunken children in the abandonment of department of child and jugendmedizin instructed. 
But only with the cases of serious five-year, the one in hospital, go in the statistics. 
Drunken children who, in ambulatory care of the parents or, if necessary, by the police to be brought home, will not be registered. 
Apart from the cases in which children only time so a bottle of spirits in the schulbank austrinken there after opinion of Mr Pelikán three jahreszeitliche amplituden, on the 100% is good: walpurgisnacht, Sylvester and the end of the school year. 
"The latter is for two reasons - either from distress because of the poor or testimony from joy to the holidays." 
"in the walpurgisnacht, I have also already been seven drunken children at once in the opening," stressed Pelikán experienced doctor. 
A betrunkenes child spent the night under medical supervision, paradoxically, is better off, as a child, the only the next day with a nasty hangover. 
The headaches in the morning, then by the dehydration and the glukosemangel shocks, it is in hospital with a flüssigkeitsspendenden infusion with glucose and nutrients, the absence of the organism. 
"They are clearly better off, because after the" beautiful "experience in the evening, raise them with good humour, without that somewhere a little ache." 
"They are just a little confused about where they are," admits he is a doctor Pelikán, with the patients at least sometimes the good humour dish, by offering them the cost of which, the treatment will cost. 
Because of the transport with the rettungswagen and the night in a akutbett are well and very much like to have a few tens of thousand kronor. 
"Every now and again I used this as an educational instrument, if I directly to the children in the trip have have calculated their drunkenness, which has cost, and that it may well happen, that it is time the whole holidays about having to work the money for a single to deserve such fete," added doctor Pelikán added. 
In his view, the health insurance companies are not, however, after regressverfahren to curing the trunkenen children necessary costs of the parents.
