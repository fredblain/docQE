Cheshire-berufung power on Twitter carefully 
Half a dozen of them tippten itself in the riots in the courtroom. 
In the minutentakt verschickten you on Twitter their reports on grausige testimonies. 
In the end, so the defence, there was more than 140,000 twitter-meldungen on trial for rape and beds gekettete children in a House, the flare-up. 
On Thursday, the process will be closely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was charged, three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to have been killed, an official end, if the ruling on the death sentence, which the panel has ruled. 
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted proposals in court, the reasons for an appeal, and the outline of the courts in years. 
One of the provozierendsten reasons is that, by the intense coverage of the process, even through the extensive use of Twitter by durchschnittsreporter - to a "zirkusatmosphäre" and such a widespread, swift penetration take details, so that the jury in an improper manner by the public outrage had been affected. 
This protest could prompt the appelationsgerichte, to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules will be necessary in the courtroom. 
"as I have seen during this process, I believe that it really is a danger, if the introduction of new technologies in the courtroom every individual " s right to a fair trial," said Thomas J. influenced Ullman, Mr. Hayes hauptverteidiger. 
The presiding judge Jon C. blue by the Supreme kammergericht, rejected last week, the applications by ruling, briefly and succinctly when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion. 
But this was certainly not the last word on this matter. 
For decades gerichtseinsprüche have found that the coverage of famous cases of doubt on the fairness of the process. 
In his historic decision by 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States the ruling against Dr Sam sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, who killed his wife would have to be lifted, and said in his decision, that it is because of the new media as a "karnevalsatmosphäre in the courtroom" had been made. 
Some people believe that the TV show and the movie "on the run" on this crime is based. 
Some lawyers say, gerichtseinsprüche, which Mr. Hayes condemnation of half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary, the communication from the courtroom, the time of the fall of Dr sheppard were unimaginable to rules. 
"There is a good reason, on the impact of new media in trials of the general public are persecuted, to be alarmed," said John J. donohue III, a professor at Stanford law school, of the death penalty in Connecticut has investigated. His report, it will be applied arbitrarily. 
Professor donohue said, some appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restrictions on a prompt communications from inside the courtroom could make the process fairer. 
The twitter-angelegenheit is only one of many, the lawyers of Mr. Hayes outline for years, in order to discuss and thus a condemnation. 
The defenders claim, for instance, that Mr. Hayes had already been regarded with hostility under any circumstances could be, as judge blue had not allow them to test the reaction of potential judges, by giving them during the jurorenauswahl grausige tatortfotos showed. 
Some of the judges said that photos of the victim, Jennifer hawke-petit, 48 years, and their tüchter, hayley, 17, and michaela, 11 years, they would have with horror. 
The defenders say that they would also carry the constitutionality of the death penalty in question, and argue that the judge mistakenly replaced a jury, which is a critic of the prosecution, and that he had been unacceptable pressure on the ruling, than he would have made the unusual decision, the panel had taken over the weekend to free. 
The judges were not isolated. 
But their arguments about the impact of the extensive coverage of the process is perhaps the greatest interest. 
In a urteilsanfechtung, which you have submitted last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the post of Governor and for the American Senate has been discussed by the candidates. 
They argued that the new media constantly the flames of the emotions on the case would be reopened. 
"such a daily crush of medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "has even beforehand in new haven and perhaps even have not yet seen a nationwide." 
Its focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial. 
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct news are rabble-rousing but effective as reports, the slower are reimbursed, a technikfeindlicher view was that the reporting on verarme future processes. 
However, some lawyers said, would appelationsgerichte often with the argument, social and technical changes we need to give the adaptation by the courts. 
Mr. hayers lawyers reinforce this assertion. 
In her complaint, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, in which the sentencing of Dr sheppard due to the coverage was rescinded and made it clear that the new media, new rules require. 
"this case," they wrote, "represents sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
