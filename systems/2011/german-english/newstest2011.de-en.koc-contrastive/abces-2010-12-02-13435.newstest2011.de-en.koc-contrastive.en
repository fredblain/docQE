The altenpflegeheim reaffirms that the deaths not on "a lack of action" are due 
The owners of the altenheims in olot close, not from their carers on eleven elderly people killed 
The leaders of the altenpflegeheims la caritat in olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday, in which she highlighted the damage the criminal actions of Joan Vila dilmés - the nurses, who during his work at least eleven of old people, for which he was responsible, had killed the establishment - had caused. 
The head of the altenpflegeheims, Joan sala, was accompanied by his lawyer, Joan cañada in court and announced, "la caritat would like the responsible (for the deaths) charges," but "the right and our liability oblige us to the process and the civil liability." 
The establishment must be not only a social being discredited, because they accept the criminal actions of the pflegers not realised in time, but now also repay a high figures of the rechtsvertretern the families of the victims will be calculated. 
Joan Vila dilmé acknowledged that the first crime in August 2009 and has since continued that he was murdered. 
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the altenpflegeheims - because he suspected that no doctor had examined the deceased personally, but the formalities due to their age and disease were handled by telephone. 
The head of La caritat verneinte this point and flatly declared that "lack of action keinerzeit the reason for the incidents could have been." 
The lawyer of La caritat added that it "in the dispute no indications for negligent actions, a person other than the defendant." 
The Union already as "angel" confessed to the 11 murders and explained that the first crime perpetrated on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later, the second old lady to have murdered. 
In this case he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime, in which he is a mixture of various sedatives. 
The head of La caritat said access to the medicines of the staff was very difficult to control. 
The insulinspritzen and the beruhigungsmittelcocktail suspended the carers in six of nine crimes, patients with the death of her suffering. 
But the results of the laboratory, whether it be Vila is lying and for his first victims actually have a less cruel death or whether he chose this from the inside ausbrannte, by offering them bleichlauge verabreichte, as it is, according to the confession in three of the women had done, he between 12 and 17 October. 
In La caritat listens to the testimony of the pflegers no faith, not even on the number of murders, a subject which could be much more. This attitude is justified that Vila very different statements in court, and that it had made no sense, though its approach after eight successful murders suddenly to be changed. 
They say that it is for this reason, and to clarify the scope of these incidents of the justice system available.
