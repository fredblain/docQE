Barometers verantworungsbewußten consumption - the "green" label is not inspire me with confidence 
Green, but quite frankly sceptical. 
The quebecer consumer has little trust at the centre of sustainable growth, but also to the troubled brands or the öko-kennzeichnungen, which taxes its choice. 
It is a pity, though it is applied in a universe where we are in favour of a responsible manner by information consumption so teeming with only: the barometers responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain about a deficiency, which is putting the brakes on his commitment displayed power as the first reading, which was held yesterday. 
Although the consumption of the so-called socially responsible products in 2010, seem to have pushed forward the quebecer, however, those who sell them, try to pay tribute to little credit. 
Two thirds of the population to quebecer is, in fact, the matched the firms nor to believe as the Greens, the unternehmenswerbung instilled by the responsible consumer centre of the University of sherbrooke sophisticated instrument. 
Another diagnosis: half of consumers is casting doubt on the credibility of the official, to the supposedly fair products attached certificates, but also the credibility of the products and brands, which have proven to be a closet, so the scoreboard. 
Following the same pattern is the discourse of the politicians on this issue of only 14.6% of quebecer population seriously. 
The information about responsible consumption appears important to stimulate this konsumsegments, which currently only by nearly a third of the quebecer consumers. 
In fact, dämpften empty and dubious nature of the information the zeal of 46% of consumers. 
This is after the higher price of the product, the second part of the barometer identified brakes. 
In addition, there is a third of the quebecer of the performance of green products and services, you have to put in the effort, with mistrust. 
According to another report has already had more than half of consumers have changed their habits in the year 2010 and predominantly the brand of one or more products, in order to change their conviction. 
According to barometers they had also to 61% of purchases dealers of their stadtviertels colonization and the purchase of food that is grown in their region. 
Green and responsible - the index of the environmentally aware consumption this year had a 64 in the maximalwertes of 100 - the Homo consumus of Quebec loves himself as king of the recycling, which is seeking to present its in the environment to reduce traces left by he cares about the welfare of animals. 
But the social and environmental awareness, however, appears before his car to stop, so the scoreboard: just 28% of the quebecer indicated in the 2010 public transport used or the mitfahrzentrale prefers to have to, in order to demonstrate their ecological concern. 
The walking and cycling were also of 39,1% of the participants in this comprehensive verhaltensumfrage supports the stereotypes.
