On the hunt for WikiLeaks head 
Obama appoints a high is responsible for the antiterrorismuskampf on the prevention of new revelations. 
Interpol has a red warning to monitor and detect Assange has. 
Everything with WikiLeaks and its founder, jullian Assange has generated, is a complicated maze in which is difficult to explain the facts. 
Interpol yesterday issued a "red alert" to "detect and pursue" of Assange has. 
However, it is not a traditional orders to arrest. 
Moreover, it is not new, it comes from the 20 November. 
It also has nothing whatsoever to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but to do with the accusations of sexual abuse, which the Australians are in Sweden. 
It also assures the lawyer of the founder of WikiLeaks, mark Stephens, "the police know where and how they contact with Mr Assange has." 
Already on 20, the international police body, with headquarters in Lyon (France), at the request of the orders from Sweden, but it was up to yesterday after receiving authorisation by the Swedish authorities have not been known. 
As is the case. Interpol-länder are the 188, Assange has instructed to identify and locate, "in order to provisionally arrest and extradite him." 
Although Interpol for the arrest of a of a red warning affected individual cannot issue orders to consider a number of Member States, according to the organisation of the Red warning as a licence for a arrestierung - of the national police forces must be carried out, particularly if they have a bilateral extradition treaty, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange has probably. 
The approach is causing assanges lawyers, the gestures, published a letter in which you about it, the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks is prepared by videoconference, the issues of the Swedish authorities to answer. 
They also recall that Assange has the departure from Sweden and requested by the prosecutor, the with the sagenumwobenen lavrentiy Beria pavlovich, head of security of Stalin, compared to the corresponding received approval. 
"This is like a hunt, not as a legal persecution," will be charged in the letter. 
While the world is looking for him, and his mother of Australia from the innocence of their son, Assange has asserted in an unknown location on, but not in silence. 
On Monday, he was the head of the magazine time via Skype from an unspecified location. In an interview to the conversation, he called for the resignation of the Secretary of the United States, Hillary Clinton. 
"If it can be shown that it was responsible for the organisation of North American diplomats to spy on the UN and in breach of the United States has signed international agreements, it would have to resign," he said. 
His opinion was the Pope yesterday from the White House, Robert Gibbs, condemned the proposal to resignation as "ridiculous and absurd." 
"I am not sure why we value on the opinion of a type with a website should show," he told the broadcaster CNN. 
Obama himself has a high is responsible for the antiterrorismuskampf, rusell Travers, with the prevention of new dokumentenenthüllungen. 
The attempt by the spokesperson of the präsidenden Barack Obama, Assange has to pay less attention, stands in contrast to the views of the Conservative politicians and commentators on these days. 
Congressman Peter King from January, the Chair of the national sicherheitskommitee will lead the House of Representatives, has asked the staatsabteilung to study the possibility of WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "in order to put their money to seizures, and each of you support or a contribution to follow." 
Tom flanagan, an adviser to the Canadian President Stephen Harper, has gone even further, and he had to his statement, Assange has had to be withdrawn "murdered." 
"Obama would have to turn it into a target and a not bemanntes plane or so what use." 
Anyone who has not apologized, was Mike Huckabee, baptistischer Minister, a former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate. 
"it always was, the leaked information in the government, he is guilty of treason and everything is no execution, is eiine too lenient sentence," he told the broadcaster Fox.
