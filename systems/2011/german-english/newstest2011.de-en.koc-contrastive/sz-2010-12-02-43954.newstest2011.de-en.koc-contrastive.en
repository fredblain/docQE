Nothing like way here. 
On this evening it is finally time right again around for the Irish. 
No trace of sadness. 
For the heimteam dominated his guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States to very much. 
The fans johlen with joy in krachend louder music, you scratch with the feet. 
The bailey-pub in südirischen Cork, because the players tischtennisbälle on a dreimeterdistanz in bierbecher throw and meetings. 
"bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle to win, there is EUR 500 siegprämie plus tickets to Las Vegas for the bierpong-weltmeisterschaften in January. 
Cian tanner is a quiet type; this shrill trinkspiel and the cautious computer scientist, which really does not fit together. 
But the 26 year old and trying to divert amusement, the nagging question of what the future will bring. 
His plan is not spielspaß in Las Vegas, he will be in January bewerbungsgespräche in New Zealand. 
"I have a mulmiges feeling about this," he says. 
"It is so far away from home and I still have no work." 
After all: his girlfriend waiting in auckland already on him - "you had to push their wunschjob zuck as eventmanagerin, may be a good sign," says the young man and smile. 
Because of poor prospects at home have already made two of three geschwistern tanners sought their fortunes abroad.

100,000 people of Ireland will be the country is likely to leave in the near future, experts say the economic and sozialforschungsinstituts ESRI in Dublin. 
By 2015, they expect even with 200,000 immigrants. 
For this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, and a big loss. 
The predictions hold true, it is a auswanderungswelle comparable with those in the Ireland in the 1980s suffered. 
After a decade of economic recovery, for the Irish, great wealth, power is now conceded again. 
The economic crisis throws in particular the young, well-educated Irish, for which there are only projections. 
Jobverlust and social decline in the boom years seemed absurd. 
Any was needed, there was money available in abundance. 
Now, however, three out of ten women and men under 30 without work. 
In the Irish Times abound leserbriefe young emigrants, the complaints: "Everything is in Ireland, the Bach error." 
"It should be a revolt against politicians and bankers - but who can, go away and our country will lose so that an entire generation." 
"The last power then ask the light from." 
Jura-studentin leanne caulfield, President of the Irish studentenunion, sees a bright future, raise because the government is only a sham and the young people who have no future prospects, there is much more to offer. 
"you reduce the minimum wages, but they have no strategy, such as new jobs," says the 20-year-old. 
They watched as their fellow students from a unpaid work feel to the next. 
Their main concern, she says, be it in four years, even to emigrate. 
"This idea is sad and depressing." 
To try to help men such as Stephen mclarnon positive to occupy the issue. 
Mclarnon organised the "workingabroadexpo," a mass, which is a rundumservice on the issue of work abroad. 
"for people abroad but the work is a great opportunity, the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.

The message is clear: to work abroad is not a galeerendienst, but also brings freedom and fun. 
As it is to build system elsewhere, knows Seán o 'donovan for half a year. 
Because it is for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, there was nothing more to do, he works now with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction in Germany. 
In Gelsenkirchen, you just a fashion house high. 
In January it goes on to Hanover or Berlin, for the next project. 
His home is o 'donovan is now only rarely because he extraschichten makes the credit for his house abbezahlen at home. 
"The situation is certainly a bit crazy," he says, as he has for a long time for the first time on the threshold of his house. 
"I should have money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I am never more." 
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes through ausgekühlte rooms. 
The little house is on a subtle neighborhood with leafy front gardens, in the park einfahrten huge, expensive cars. 
Together with a sister has o 'donovan the House for four years for 380 000 euros - 100 percent bought credit-financed. 
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says. 
He was afraid that it could go wrong with the credit? 
O 'donovan have taken a while, after adding hot tea and says: "I have no children, I durchfüttern must, and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again." 
It may be that the horror of a civil engineer, not that he often hears at present. 
"No one should go hungry, our situation is far from being as dramatic as in former times here on the island," he says. 
"a while to work abroad, this is not the worst thing that can happen, perhaps, we feel it only when Irish." 
He then laughs and tells of his father, who in the last major economic crisis after England is gone. 
"after seven years, he was back and that life in Ireland went further, very simple." 
Cian tanner like this idea. 
For the future and just look at how it runs with the life elsewhere. 
A couple of years of work in London, he is already behind in New Zealand, and why should it not also go well for him and his girlfriend? 
There is one thing but, in those days it seemed concerned: the celebration on his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin. 
He fears that, in a lebewohl-party could degenerate. 
"just not too much emotion," says he and drink a great schluck from his beer. 
"goodbye, it sounds but frightening." 
"We prefer to call it a weggehparty, very loosely, with a few friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
