Rachsüchtige hackers and race spies 
The Wikileaks case has a twofold significance. 
On one hand, it is as obvious scandal, turns a scandal, only one scandal in the sinner hypocrisy, which is the beziehunge between the States, the citizens and the press. 
On the other hand, it has announced major changes at international level, and gives a taste of the future, dominated by regression. 
But we walk of the series after. 
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each by a secret service produced acts (a nation), other exclusively from press cuttings. 
The "extraordinary," American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi 's throw from nothing more than what you anyway for months on end in any other Journal got to read (except those whose owner Berlusconi is), and the terrifying karikaturierte profile of Gaddafi " s kabarettkünstlern already provided for a long time for their sketche stuff. 
The rule, according to the secret dossier only from already well-known news must exist, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century. 
If you go into a library, which is dedicated to esotherischen publications, you will realise that each work (on the grail, the mystery of rennes-le-chateau templer, the or the rosenkreuzler) exactly what happened in previous works have already been written. 
This is not only, therefore, that the author occult texts do not want to publish research (still, therefore, that he does not know how, where news about the nicht-existierende to), but because those who are the okkultismus devote to nothing different than what you already know and confirms what you already have learned. 
This is also the erfolgsmechanismus of Dan Brown. 
Also the secret files. 
The informant is lazy and lazy (or restricted spirit) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could also be what is, for example, editor at Libération), which is just as true to what he considers it. 
The top-secret information on Berlusconi, the American Embassy in Rome, the staatsdezernat had sent, were the same as those of us who already Newsweek published the previous week. 
So why was such a fuss about the revelations made this dossier? 
On one side of this, to say what any educated person already knows, namely that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the government can call each other or an aircraft can take in order to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of a few small virtue in spionagezentren have turned. 
Any viewer of ermittlungsfilmen knows this very well, and it is not from hypocrisy that one way of doing this is to ignore. 
Still, the fact it publicly to repeat violates the task of hypocrisy and serves, the American diplomacy in a bad light. 
Secondly: the idea that a business-as-usual hackers of the geheimsten secrets of the most powerful country in the world can tap, runs the significant blow to the prestige of the staatsdezernats. 
In addition, the scandal is less the victims rather than the "executioner" in trouble. 
But we are dealing the profound nature of what happened. 
Formerly, Orwell " s times, they could all power like a big brother, the pool every gesture of his subjects controlled. 
Orwell " s prophecy would have been quite right since then as can highlight any movement, where you can control thanks to the telephone, drain every transaction, visited the hotel, the elected motorway and so on; the citizens would result in the total victims of the eye of power. 
But, bearing in mind what is happening today, even the secret krypten of power is no longer the control of hackers can escape, so the kontrollgang, to be directed to unilaterally and will zirkelförmig. 
The power of controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - chosen as rächer of the citizen - can the secrets of the power in experience. 
How can a power, but keeping the is no longer able to preserve their own secrets? 
It is true, Georg simmel has already said that a real mystery, a mystery is empty (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi or Merkel 's, in fact, a secret free of geheimis is, as it surrenders the public sphere; but in styles of WikiLeaks, reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means any power. 
Wikileaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel against injustice, but Clinton and Obama. 
What are the consequences of this violation of which would be such a huge power has been done? 
It is obvious that the Member States in future no longer reserved for information online posts - would be the one on the street corner angeklebten aushang guilt. 
But it is equally obvious that with the current technology is to be hoped not, confidential reports on telephone to keep secret. 
Nothing is easier than finding out whether, and when a Head of State is in a plane and moved one of its Members has been in contact with. 
How could in future private and only for certain ears certain relationships? 
I know very well that my forecast at the moment and romanhaft sounds like science fiction, but I am compelled me to present the government agents on secret way to score and uncontrollable marschrouten moving, their communications anywhere else than mere memory in order to deal with, and, moreover, the few written information they received in the schuhabsatz verbergend. 
The information would be in single copy in closed drawers of stored: basically the spionageversuch had less success of Watergate, when WikiLeaks. 
I had the opportunity to write that the technology today is like a cancer progresses, namely backwards. 
A century after the wireless telegraf communications had revolutionized, reconstructed the Internet with a telegrafen (telephone) line. 
The (analogue) cassettes had the filmforschern allows, a film band for band auszukundschaften by one from back to front spulen and all the secrets of the installation could lift, while the (digital) CDS nowadays is nothing other than allow from chapter to chapter to jump in makroportionen. 
With the high-speed trains, we within three hours from Rome to Milan, while it by plane, including the switching requires three and a half hours. 
It is therefore not exceptional, policy and communications at car and return to the horse. 
A final observation. 
In former times was trying to understand what the press for secrets between the embassies were forged. 
Currently, there are the messages that confidential information from the press.
