Mystery of the komplexgeschüttelten Canada lifted 
The new American diplomatenleitungen by WikiLeaks, drop the mystery about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of the Canadians vis-à-vis the Americans; I think you are, but with the same blow the superiority the latter to Canada open. 
Consequently, the American diplomats have been surprised that the Canadian voters to the ballot is not the kanadisch-amerikanischen relations in spirit, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the Conservative Government, budget from 2009. 
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington yesterday, the public were spread, still offer more pikante details than the mere substantial content, in which it has a very bad outcome. 
One of 22 September 2008, link, in other words, in the period in which the Federal wahlkampage are in full swing, it was reported, the point the United Nations no longer apply to their political bosses by discussed operations. 
To the surprise of David Wilkins, of servicemen in Ottawa, American ambassador. 
Mr Wilkins offers various erklärungsmöglichkeiten this situation. 
"The Canadians innewohnender owing almost an inferiority complex may have prompted the Canadian, political leaders, much more to do with internal issues of daily life to talk, as the United States in this election the ball (as in 1988 during the campaign about the free trade)," he describes. 
The United Nations, so, he concludes, are therefore "the proverbial Goliath this election: omnipresent but potentially to be implemented in order to speak of him." 
The Ambassador understands this "deafening silence" even less so as the two countries have been intensive political and economic relations. 
"logically," so he should be evaluated, "the ability of a candidate, a party and a lot more of a party leaders to engage in such an essential relationship, the voters at the polls as a key factor in the spirit." 
The other expression of this sense of importance in the open on 22 January 2009 by Terry breese, chargé d 'affaires in Ottawa, gesendeten communication, the President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa to prepare. 
"her trip will help in the preservation of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February to ensure in the Canada its first deficit after more than a decade, will announce the result of a belebungsprogrammes in the level of 30 to 40 billion dollars has emerged," breese, describes. 
Nowhere was it mentioned that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas, in order to prevent the House from the coalition would be overthrown and allowed to continue as the opposition parties on the quality of the proposed belebungsprogramms would have an impact. 
Another, from January 2008, and on the part of the Wilkins " s ambassador to Washington from the increasingly negative communication involving an evolving picture that the broadcast on CBC, dramatic series, of the United States. 
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts as border, little mosque on the prairie, intelligence and H2O, in which little of subtle references to Maher Arar, the "no-fly-list" or contributions for the purposes of muskelprotze carried out by the CIA interrogation can observe. 
A different communication reported extensively about how Hillary Clinton remarked with her French counterpart, Bernard Kouchner, during their first bilateral meeting then asked whether Europe is prepared to incorporate certain prisoners from Guantanamo. 
Mr Kouchner 's question is yes, but on the basis of an individual' case to case "decision. 
Àm end of the meeting, described as "the state, he has a paper in terms of Omar Khadr, was given a 15-year Muslims Canadian origin." 
"The Secretary of State has committed the acts look again." 
Finally, we realise that the mood on the website WikiLeaks heated. 
Tom flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper, bears a very close adviser had on CBC, declared that the people responsible for this massive leak "should be killed." 
He was here to Mike Huckabee a report from the United States.
