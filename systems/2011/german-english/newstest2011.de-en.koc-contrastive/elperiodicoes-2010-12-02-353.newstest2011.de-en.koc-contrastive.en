Zapatero and the red line of Germany 
Berlin has, for the keeping of the euro, but at the same time, conditions for the entire European Union. 
The tension on the markets have a two-fold response from the government. 
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation measures, starting with the tax reliefs for small and micro-enterprises, regulation of the agencies or the lifting of the 426 euro support for the unemployed, no unemployment benefit, and the privatisation of 49 per cent for aena, the management of airports, particularly Barajas and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery. 
On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former Prime Minister Felipe González, the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible, along with the current crisis herausbeschwört said. 
How are these events? 
It is anticipated the Merkel 's position is not a mistake of their public relations. 
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro. 
In Germany, is a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future, the one with the maintenance of the old traditions of so many of his partner. 
Given the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis to spekuliern. 
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South to leave the euro area should have been. 
The second: the restoration of the German mark - although at the moment, sounds more like science fiction, supported by a large proportion of public opinion, approximately 50% of the population. 
The third: a review of the euro in accordance with German proposals. That means that more macroeconomic control; rigorous financial management; punishment of the countries which exceed the requirements of möglichereweise; the failure of some countries, as well as the extension of the potential costs of adaptation to the private sector. 
The German position is clear and has been for some time. That is why there is now no excuses. 
First, in 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission incentives for deficits, and the German Government is a constitutional reform drew from the sleeves in order to prevent this from 2016. 
It was the first signs of the drift between what Germany was thought necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. 
The second sign suspended the Central European country, when Merkel announced the decision to save Greece painful serious. 
At the time, the heavily criticized. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion absolutely against a bailout of Greece. 
Finally, Merkel in the last oktobertagen with an unambiguous position. It calls for a reform of the agreements of the European Union, in order to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time the private lender, to commit a part of the costs. 
This position was interpreted as anti-European, since they irlandkrise and everything the following. 
But its proposal, albeit slightly sweetened, has been adopted. In the coming months we will be in the reform of the European Union, which these measures from 2013 that should enable us to participate. 
Germany has drawn a red line, which it does not intend to cross. 
It says all that - even if now unpopular measures need to be made - it from that date, the old ways of the euro will not be. 
The geburtsjahr 2013 will be a new currency zone, in which the force countries severely punished, that can be forced to declare itself insolvent and, in this case, the private sector a portion of the costs. 
Germany shows us that we must take a hard path, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances. 
The other alternative in the debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments is based, as it was led by Spain in boom times, is simply not acceptable. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would be wrong to do so, it is not understood. 
It is not only a question of the budget deficit by 2013 runterzufahren at three per cent. 
The demands are much tougher. 
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, is ourselves to cheat. 
I hope that the current turbulence in more calm. 
And that we need the opportunities offered to us, be offered until spring 2013 will use. 
It seems that Zapatero also has understood, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) points out that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, right in their own House, to create their way. 
But the of Germany want red line is there, and it does not seem that things would change. 
Among the possibilities is taking into account the fact that we, the countries with little serious fully gestopften euro area, cannot be ruled out. 
In this case Germany might still tell us that it had warned us.
