As a training officer stepped on an urban place, Tang Shenbin reviewed his anxious subordinates and gave orders to military authority and subdued voice. 
He wanted his female members of the cheng guan - China's robust urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their tendency to violence - to impress viewers. 
"It is!" 
"Look in front!" 
"Show them," he flüsterte to them, "how beautiful girls so!" 
Four girls, barely adolescent age, with white gloves and identical olive green Jackes and trousers were hard. 
Four pairs of black Pumps were just set.

By law, so the critics. 
Unlike the police, these officials, the municipal laws should only with the help of fines or other administrative penalties. 
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture. 
In January 2008, prügelten officials in Hubei Province, a bystander to death than those using his mobile phone and filmed as they defeated a strong protest against a dustbin. 
Last year was a training manual for the Beijing officials that have been stolen and published on the Internet. This report described how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.

A violence strotzend video game that can be downloaded from the Internet, shows officers trained in China in an assault on hawkers. 
"Cheng guan of the government's fear," the national newspaper China Daily lamentierte in the last year, after more controversy about the tactics. 
The newspaper called a "real thorough cleansing." 
Skeptics find the current approach clearly inadequate. 
When the Distrik in October by the board searched eight female recruits, a Editorial in the Beijing Evening News the question whether the women real tasks had been or simply should serve as a visual distraction. 
Probably both.

"The most important is its image" was a unbenannter district officer in the Rednet have been virtually ruling website.. 
"Whether the candidates to get the job, first depends on their appearance, such as size, weight, Gesichtszüge, etc." 
Then temperament and "inner qualities." 
"Female cheng guan, as they are put," he said, and added, "but they also have other duties." 
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the municipality of the district would not agree with this description, 
But admitted that China's size limits in advertisements for both genders are not unusual. 
The same applies to evenly. 
Whether it is synonymous with good looks, is controversial in China. 
But people with disabilities or physical need not apply. 
"Here, unfortunately, we cannot use Lahmes or Buckligen," as Mr. Zheng. 
"Your image would not be good." 
Liu Yi, on the Baoguang-Platz near a monastery, patroliert 22, Apfelbäckchen and a well shaped mouth. 
They empfindetes not as a sexist, that so great value is placed on their appearance. 
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with wry look.

"Mr Wang, you disappear here, please." 
"We have so often said to you that!" said Frl. Xu a trader who had fled on foot, and his nudel kitchen attached to a bicycle karre had temporarily abandoned. 
According to the officials, the work is more monotonous than arduous. 
"It is almost every day the same," said Huang Jing, 20, in the leisure, distribution system is being studied. 
"Everything routine." 
One reason is that the female servants of the goods of merchants not as their male colleagues should confiscate. 
You criminals can only threaten them to notify their male superiors.

Hundreds of residents rioted outside in this year, Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, after the rumour stock-market boom, Chengguan-Beamte had killed a trader. 
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan-Beamte were injured in the nighttime incident, 14 government cars have been undermined or burned. 
Xindu of these Gewaltausschreitungen have so far been spared.

Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male Streife, stayed back, and he turned around his name tag knows to remain anonymous. 
As their female colleagues play the coordinators - men over 40 - a purely supportive role. 
But they were not trained to present a clean image. 
"Sometimes we go verbally." 
"Sometimes but also physically," said Mr. Li sober. 
"Most of the time people start with the dispute."
