Ogoniland is destroyed by fire 
The water in the rivers is ölbraun, it smells like the petrol station: billion litres of spillage of crude oil have destroyed nature in Ogoniland in Nigeria. 
The people live by theft, corruption and illegal Ölkochen. 
Celestine Akpobari, it feels good. 
"Plagt not away" reassured the green activist journalists: "You are still enough oil slicks from the lens wars." 
The 37-year-old Nigerians have followed the attempt, one by watenden boy on the chest in the water with him around Schlieres abzulichten: in the regenbogenfarbenen water are being is sapping the scene almost beautiful. 
The fact that brown crude hanging below the surface, is not to be seen. 
In the past, they have collected buckets and wise shrimps, tells Esther Badom on the shores of the Bodo-Jetty-Flusses. 
In the meantime, it should be the lazy river waters completely dead. 
Before five years ago from a geborsten pipeline is a ton of crude oil in the vast wetland. 
Fishermen from the nearby city Bodo must now pull together for six hours, in order to get into fish containing waters: the Ogoniland situated in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered to be one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world. 
On the journey through the mangrove sumpfs criss-crossed by rivers is striking the extent of the devastation. 
Instead of bright water brown unsavory brew was wühlt the engine boat, who appears in his hand into the water, prefers ölig finger out of this mess. 
The roots of the mangrove bäumchen as black Lakritzstangen from the ground, sad isolated trees to hang their Wedel. 
Vogelschwärme, as they are usually in wetlands, looking in vain: as soon as the external border is spreading in the silent as a petrol station fragrance end eerily calm from former paradise. 
"What happens is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari dark: "We live in constant danger for the health." 
The war is appropriate. 
The residential area of the Ogoni is a Europe for decades disputed battlefield: here, more than 60 years ago, the first Explorateure from Europe a here in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, the first opposition here, the shell company has ceased its production in 1993, because it was too dangerous for its Ölarbeiter. 
Even today, the company denied the return to Ogoniland: while the entire delta region of three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5 000 Bohrquellen and 7 000 miles donated more than two million daily barrels of black gold are pumped in Ogoniland, the oil fields, are lying idle at the corporation is unstable situation. 
All the few hundred metres out steel Gestells as fanciful sculptures from the water: "Christian bäumchen" are the heads of the boreholes sunk much cited lack. 
They are up to 50 years old, most shook korrodiert. 
It is always such a Bohrkopf apart, says Akpobari, then rinne a constant stream of crude oil into the water. 
More than two billion litres, according to expert estimate in 50 years were spilled into the ecosystem of the Delta: year on year, the amount of oil, as they are in the wreck of the super tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago into the sea off Alaska - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind. 
Who is to blame for the continuing Öko-GAU about the dispute. 
While the shell group of sabotage and organized Öldiebstahl for more than 90 percent of the pollution responsible, environmentalists see berstend Bohrkopfs and pipelines as the main culprit. 
Shell attach in Nigeria much lower safety standards than usual in the world, the US-Wissenschaftler Richard Steiner accused the company in 2008: alone, the rate of defects in the pipelines was "is several times higher than elsewhere." 
At one place from afar as an abandoned, ölverschmiert garage under open looks, they appear to be finalised from the Mangroves: you are naked and ölverschmiert up to the neck. 
Under one of the many pits, partly associated with flasks, partly arbitrary scattered on the site, a fire flackert: an illegal small refinery. 
The barrel of crude oil on the fire several hours heated, said Michael, the head of the group. 
First of all, gets petrol through the pipes in the detention facility, and later tröpfelt at the end of the leadership kerosene and finally diesel, it has emerged. 
Thus produce Michael and four staff on a daily basis, up to four Fässer diesel à 300 litres of water: "This brings us 34 000 Naira a ' - around 22 dollars. 
The delta residents use the chronic fuel shortages in the Africa's largest oil state. 
Nigeria only has a single refinery. 
According to the just under 40 euro cents per litre ridiculously low diesel prices can still offer the illegal Kocher: for their raw materials are getting it for free. 
It comes from "Bunkerern," the pipeline network across the whole of Ogoniland on tap: in this way to go to the country, according to experts in the entire Niger Delta every day lost at least 16 million litres of crude oil. 
Only a tiny part of the provisional zwischengelagerten raw material is illegal: according to the lion's share fill organised criminal networks, including politicians and senior military officers should belong in tankers, and command him on the world market. 
The debate, whether the disaster rather the activities of the population, or is due to the lax practices, the activist Akpobari for purely academic. 
"If the oil companies are not perceived as invaders and they should have been the livelihood of the fishermen are not as thoroughly destroyed, there was neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries." 
Meanwhile, it is the relationship between the Ogoni people, especially on Shell but so destroyed that only a withdrawal of the company in question would be: "Maybe there are other nationalities, such as the Chinese as a better out of this mess." 
Michael will be as nervous. 
"It is high time that it disappears," says muskulös Ölmann. 
"Every minute, the soldiers can come." 
If caught, the illegal Ölveredler of the special unit of the armed forces face no arrest, but a painful bribes. 
Similarly, mainly from the rural, young soldiers want - like all Nigerians - will benefit from the raw material. 
"This damn stuff has our country in every respect to the dog," says Akpobari.
