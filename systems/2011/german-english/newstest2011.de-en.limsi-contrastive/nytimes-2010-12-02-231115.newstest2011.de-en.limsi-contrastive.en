Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance 
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can grab a significant hole in your gift budget. 
A iPad costs as much as five BMX-Räder to 99, Dollar while the price for a Kinect-Spiel around 10 classical garden or approximately 48 cans of Play-Doh responds. 
But you can protect your gift budget. 
I recently visited on the search for three electronic toys in 80 Dollar three national toy retailers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys 'r' and a BJ's whole sale club. 
I was immediately clear that Moore's Law in force, and this year the technological toys are more efficient and at the same time costs a little less than last year. 
And while fewer new toys appear with their own website, is the best-known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, a broader supply. 
There are more Knopfzellen-betriebene toys on the market, and many include rehabilitation and aufladbare batteries. 
Here are a few recommendations. 
(If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "r"). 
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 Dollar for children 3 years) are Plüschfiguren such as sea pigs sing a note if it depresses her belly. 
The first dodge corresponds to a note by repeated pressure it can play a song. 
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony. 
Respect: when you started with the pressure, you can no longer stop. 
For a combination of Gesand and dance the dance star Mickey (fisher price 60 Dollar for children from 2) the best choice. 
Based on last year's Elmo developed technology offers the animatronische doll exchange games such as 'Simon says ', and thanks to the innovative Scharnierfüße with Radblockierung, they dominated the Moon-Walk. 
Children who test the equipment, use Mickey as a dance teacher, but your parents complained about the lack of vocal starch system. 
If you are a child of the '80s, you must remember Alphie, one of the first computerised validation system foreseen learning toys. 
Now he is back there (Hasbro/ Playskool, 40 Dollar for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards, which can be a car journey on a lesson with a know-alls with Autokorrektur-Funktion as teachers. 
If you go back to your child does not want to entrust your Smartphone, here are three independent alternatives. 
MobiGo VTech (60 Dollar for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most solution, equipped with a qwerty-Tastatur, and to include games, however, are not as instructive as the Leapster Explorer (70 Dollar for children 3 to 12) after Leapfrogs first major revision of the Leapster-Reihe is equipped with a new, brighter screen. 
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes. 
IXL fisher price (90 Dollar for children from 3 to 7) used for the Games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes and, thanks to the SD-Kartenlaufwerks can also family photo to be seen. 
Finally, there is still Scrabble Flash (30 Dollar Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED-Bildschirm. 
The game is about to merge the units into words, before the time is running out. It is great for an impromptu Buchstabierwettbewerb. 
More and more toys have a kind of Internet connection. 
If you alone after the supply in the toy stores, Webkinz and Club Penguin the most important. 
In order to make your child an online to pay the club Penguin, you can, for example, a Disney Club Penguin 2 " mix 'N match figur package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) buy, containing a coin with a secret code. 
If you introduce the code Online receives your child in the club Penguin Store have enough credits for two other parts. 
This can rolling shoes or a Puffle-Stofftier. 
The latest Kopfzellen-betriebene single use, Hexbug Nano (10 Dollar trillion economy means for children from 5) is not bigger than the head of your toothbrush. 
The Käfer is moving quickly to 12 vibrierend Silikonbeinen in any direction. 
It makes fun to send him with a Irrgarten from Klotzs. 
And he keeps a number of things. 
We fell off the kitchen table and outlived even some time at the foot of our dog.
