The government of Berlusconi in Italy in coverage 
After a disturbing week beginning in Italy the situation yesterday, with the decline of the Eckzinsen for 10 years a little more relaxed. 
A return to the uneasy silence. 
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs had the regional chairman, Giulio Tremonti, to the situation as a "unentzifferbar" train and it with an "unpredictable" weekend can expect to hear what the person concerned, however, immediately denied. 
On Tuesday at least had the gap with the German interest rates its record of 210 base points achieved and the price of contracts to cover the Konkursrisikos are risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain amount of Kopflosigkeit in Rome. 
Silvio Berlusconi was in his Council of Ministers pointed out that the discrepancy in Spain to the German interest rates is in the hands of 400 base points. 
His right hand, Gianni Letta, was, however, as a "serious concern" about the "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland indicated. 
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro zone, not like Greece or Ireland." 
"The bad news is that Italy, like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute. 
To put it plainly, his problem is the shortage of economic growth and the concomitant anaemic tax eingangs the state in danger, no longer cover its funding needs to be able to. 
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government. 
In the future will be an Italian growth of 1,1% in 2011 and expects 1,4% in the year 2012... even though the current budget in the Senate for consideration with 1,3% respectively, 2% of the expected. 
Under these conditions, as calculated by the European Commission, the budget deficit next year will be 4,3% of GDP (contrary to the government's forecast 3,9%) and 3,5% in 2012 (instead of 2,7%). 
Hence the uproar about a new budgetary collective after the holidays to a sum of EUR 7 billion could be used. 
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says accountant Olli Rehn. 
On the hour Italy receives the support of international institutions. 
"The foundations of Italy's economy in order and its accounts are settled, we repeat this for a very long time," Arrigo Sadun assured Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF is charged with Italy. 
"At the moment there are no problems, neither short-term nor long-term point of view, because of Italy, despite its high level of debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011, A. that R.), lesser Stabilisationsfortschritte will be required as of other countries," observed Pier Carlo Padoan, chief volkswirt of the OECD. 
That leaves the question of political Unstetigkeit. 
On 14 December Silvio Berlusconi is a motion of censure in the House of Representatives face as a result of those early elections at the end of March could be organized. 
It is therefore a little favorable period before a decisionmaking process on a serious crisis.
