450 million in contracts without tender 
Hydro-Québec mutual understanding Projektplanungsfirmen 450 million dollars in contracts that have been approved for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project. 
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, the major proportion, namely the project pipeline, has received a sum of 295 million dollars without tender. 
This consortium, known as "Énergie gérance" was in 2004 as a side effect of the decision by Hydro-Québec, the private sector for their responsibility in this important hydroelectric project a sum amounting to 5 billion dollars to entrust formed. 
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium ergatterte 'Énergie gérance' the lucrative contract without that there had been a public invitation to tender. 
For the Parti Québécois is resorting to Unternehmenskonsortien a serious ethical problem, which evokes the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung and an increase in prices. 
"This is a new way of conspiracy and distorted the competition." 
"This means that rather than fix games rather than in a secret manner is now carrying out in an open way," said yesterday Sylvain Simard, a delegate of the PQ, at the press conference. 
In the early morning Simard had raised the issue before the National Assembly, because it seems hard to understand how the interests of the public can be used in this way. 
Resource minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon by they vehemently deny, that it is a conspiracy in this treaty would have acted. 
"I am sticking to my faithful," they raged by them confirmed that PQ was "dishonest" raiding "and lacked rigour." 
She said it "is the least we can do," the PQ. 
The model of the consortium is world practice. 
It is usually such a temporary alliance the two or more companies allowed their expertise on an imperative to concentrate on a tender for a complex project. 
The project " East main ' a high komplexität level indicates about his Arbeitsausmaßes. 
This is well under way and construction techniques should be established by 2012. 
However, the contract was awarded without a competitive campaign had can take place; it had already negotiations were held. 
It also represents the model of the consortium in Quebec even relatively simple projects by no means an exception. 
As the newspaper 'Le Devoir' last week noted that in the field of civil engineers and Beratungswesens used model of the consortium are the subject of Regierungsermittlungen. 
A brief overflying the Quebecer Unternehmensregisters allowed more than 200 consortia to appoint, some of which seem to be steady duration. 
In this way works, for example, the company Dessau in partnership with the majority of its key competitors, CIMA, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roach and Tecsult also count together. 
Any link, and there are several dozen leads to a and the same legal person back, namely Dessau. 
As far as the consortium "Énergie gérance," as Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special Arbeitskräftedynamik and Hydro-Québec this fact since the 1970s in a particular way account pays." 
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ) has issued a statement that the nose has right now on the fact that the treaty was approved after agreement on the project pipeline. 
"If you makes a call for tender and there are only a few candidates, your prices will soar." 
"So you have two options: either you nimmst the people who find themselves at the Mart and saying:" we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price. " 
"The idea is, however, that it is not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," confirmed Laporte. 
This consortium "Énergie gérance" approved contract is part of a long list of contracts on more than 50 000 dollars received by the Parti Québécois. 
The contracts were either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ approved for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project. 
After reviewing the newspaper 'Le Devoir' more than 100 Ingenieurs and consultancy contracts, the companies or their branches, including, in particular Ressourcenlabors, between 2002 and March 2010 have been awarded. 
SNC-Lavalin had 22 contracts, Génivar received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without here their participation in "gérance" count Énergie. 
All these treaties have been negotiated. 
In total they amount to 449,783,344 dollars, including the treaty with "Énergie gérance" about 295,131,564 dollars. 
Sylvain Simard had indicated that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Quebec well-known." 
Minister Normandeau had let slip the PQ is equally associated with the firms they "finance" before she clarified that it is acting contrary to their leaders.
