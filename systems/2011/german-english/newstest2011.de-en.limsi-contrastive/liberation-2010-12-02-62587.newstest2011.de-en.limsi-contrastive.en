Métro Grand Paris: first financial spectacular 
Since the debate about the modernization of the transport industry is in full swing on the Ile de France, it has been raining billions. 
At least in the discussions. 
We urge in particular the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris in memory of the Société du Grand Paris is to be built. 
In order to guide the start of construction of the SGP in the ways that the state has a capital dotation of 4 billion euros. 
In the theoretical system, this is the amount, which would then allow the SGP to the markets to their two times to give a part of the finance bill. 
Today, it is, after all, come to first projections. 
The supplementary budget from 2010, this morning seen by the financial committee of the National Assembly, contains measures intended to raise the first part of this money. 
It is two measures: the creation of a special tax on the Erschließund and a higher taxation of offices on the Ile-de France. 
The former, we remove Article 15 of the bill, "for the benefit of the public clinic Société du Grand Paris." 
This is the equivalent: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year." 
Two more, an overhaul of the existing business taxation: "In order to modernise them, in order to increase their resulting product and this increase of Société du Grand Paris to respond." 
How much would this bring? 
It is a mystery. 
This amount is not quantified in the text. 
From the 4 billion is far away. 
"It is said that the fiscal resources to the 4 billion euros will be added to the capital dotation, which can be found by the state and the Société du Grand Paris after and to be done for the project," as is apparent from the explanatory presentation. 
In the case of the SGP, does not mean this system at all. 
"Since the moment in which revenue (the two taxes that R.), you can cover long studies over three years and then extract from the 4 billion," so declared. 
"This will be noted in the budget and gradually withdrawn." 
The SGP estimated that it will be launched in 2013, the 4 billion to make a note on the budget in 2014. 
This measure, whose 4 promised billions of people will be able to search for a long time, runs the risk that a law is on the move, causing parliamentary debate. 
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December instead.
