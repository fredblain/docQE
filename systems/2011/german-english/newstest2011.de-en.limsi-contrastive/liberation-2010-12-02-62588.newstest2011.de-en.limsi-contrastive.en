Rachsüchtige hackers and industrious spies 
The Affaire has a dual significance. 
On one side, she was emerging as an obvious scandal, a scandal that only a scandal in the Sinner hypocrisy is the Beziehunge between the countries, ruled the public and the press. 
On the other hand, it presents profound changes at international level, and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by recession. 
But we are taking the series. 
The first aspect of Wikileaks is the confirmation of the fact that each act drawn up by a secret service (a nation) composed solely of newspaper cuttings. 
The "extraordinary" that American revelations about the sexual habits Berlusconi's throw no more than what you for months on anyway in any Journal got to read (except those whose owners Berlusconi) and the terrifying karikaturierte offered Kabarettkünstlern already rebuffed profile stuff for a long time for their Sketchs. 
The rule, according to which the secret files should only consist of well-known news is essential for the dynamic of the secret services, and not only in this century. 
If you go into a library devoted to the esotherischen publications, you will see that every piece of work (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, Templer or Rosenkreuzler) repeatedly exactly what has been written in previous works. 
It is not alone, therefore, that the author occult texts intends to publish any research (yet, therefore, that he did not knew where to find would be news to report on the non existierende), but because those who dedicate themselves to the Okkultismus, nothing else than to believe what they already know and confirmed what they already have learned. 
This is also the most mechanism of Dan Brown. 
Similarly, the secret files. 
The informant is rotten and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (he might otherwise whatever it may be, for example, editor in Libération), which only considers to be true, which he acknowledges. 
The Top-Secret information on Berlusconi, the US Embassy in Rome was sent to the Staatsdezernat, were the same as those which Newsweek had previously published the week. 
So why such a fuss was made by the revelations of these files? 
On one side they say what any educated person knows, and that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the leaders can call each other, or we can take a plane in order to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small classed have turned spy centres. 
Every and any viewer of investigative movies knows this very closely, and it does not happen from hypocrisy, that it is doing so to ignore this. 
However: the fact that to repeat it in public, violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put the American diplomacy in a bad light. 
Secondly: the idea that an ordinary hacker secret most secrets can become the most powerful country in the world, carries a significant blow to the prestige of the Staatsdezernats. 
The scandal also brings fewer victims, rather than the "executioner" in trouble. 
But we address the profound nature what happened. 
Ehemals Orwell's time, it was all power as a Big Brother to combine the controlled every gesture of his subjects. 
Orwell's prophecy had since then as a perfectly correct can turn out when you can, thanks to the telephone control every movement, every site's operation, visited the hotel, the elected motorway and so forth; the total victims of citizens would be the eye of power. 
But if you are in mind, what is happening today that even the secret Kryptas of power will not be able to escape the control of a Hackers, listens as the monitoring of the elections to be addressed, unilaterally and zirkelförmig. 
The power controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - chosen as the public - can discover the secrets of power. 
How can they keep a grip on power, which is no longer able to protect their own secrets? 
It is true, Mr. Simmel said that a real mystery is an empty secret (and an empty mystery can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the character Berlusconi's or Merkel's essentially free of Geheimis is a mystery, because the public sphere of price; but in the style of WikiLeaks to reveal the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty secrets were means to deprive them of any power. 
Wikileaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wronged, however, Clinton and Obama. 
What are the consequences of this injury, which has caused such an enormous power? 
It is obvious that the states in future no reserved information will make more online - that would be tantamount to a posting added on the street corner. 
But it is equally obvious that it is frustrated with the current technology to hope confidential reports to be able to keep secret via telephone. 
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of state in a plane move and one of his colleagues contacted. 
How could future private and only for certain ears certain relationships? 
I know very well that my prediction at the moment for science fiction and Roma confinement sounds, but I feel compelled to imagine the government agents in a secret manner inspired to uncontrollable road routes moving their messages anywhere else than in a mere memory key, and also the few written information they received in the shoe marketing verbergend. 
Only copy the information would be stored in locked drawers: basically had the spy effort of Watergate less success than WikiLeaks. 
I had the opportunity to write that the technology nowadays like a cancer progresses, namely backwards. 
A century after the wireless telecommunications had revolutionized communications, the Internet is a Telegrafen (telephone) line. 
The (analog) Videokassetten had allowed the Filmforschern ribbon band for a film auszukundschaften by one spulen from the back forward and was able to reveal all of the secrets of the Montags, whereas the (digital) CDs allow nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter, in other words, Makroportionen. 
With the high-speed trains travel within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this by plane, including the switching requires three and a half hours. 
It is therefore not exceptional, policy and communications technology come back on car and horse. 
A final observation. 
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets have been forged between the messages. 
At the moment, there are the messages, which demand confidential information from the press.
