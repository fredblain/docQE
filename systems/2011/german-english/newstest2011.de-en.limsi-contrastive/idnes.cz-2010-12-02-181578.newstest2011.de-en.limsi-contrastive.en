A bone chamber fascinates even after 100 years. If you look at the Interieure of Gaudi 
The roof looks like a prehistoric Echse, the back stairs, such as the vertebral column of dinosaurs and behind Fischmäuler. 
This is the Casa Batlló by the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. 
From the local residents got the house with its organic forms the nickname of "bone house." 
Organ forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, Kachelsplittern and Mosaiks, which covered facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of youth style of Antonio Gaudi. 
The facade of the house plays with fantastically lines lack paints and Texturen out to nature and living things. 
It was only on closer inspection, you notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and conceptual order. 
In the night still works against the whole facade of plastic, dramatic and specific Anleuchtung stepped up the glamour of the paint still. 
The same buoyant lines and tortuous forms also dominate the interior of the house. 
Wave type of shaped wood frames, support Zierelemente by doors, even Gucklöcher and. 
The Batlló house in the district Eixample in the busy shopping road Passeig de Grácia 43 arose from the renovation of a house from the year 1877, the architects Emilio Sala Cortese said. 
The Americans took two years on the right and finished 1906. 
The investor, the wealthy industrialists, Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but he ultimately voted Gaudís to the idea of converting to an unusual and even cheaper. 
The rental house, Casa Batlló was an architect, Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone. 
He worked with the architect, Josep Maria Jujol together. 
The Dekorations have been created for the ceremonial home to some of the Realitätenbesitzers and even the use of Mosaiks in the facade was his idea. 
At the design of the facade but also many other Bildner and artists. 
The joint work on the drafts of the Casa Batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí. 
This Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís House, Casa Milá in Güell Park, in which other works also located by Antoni Gaudí. 
Not long after its completion was the home of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the nicknames for "bone house." 
Others called it the specific window opening mechanism for the "yawning home." 
It also says that on top of the building was the sword in the holy Georg, presented by the Patron of Catalonia. 
But also other bildhauer elements symbolize hidden religious motives. 
Gaudí was an architect of the House a unique central heating system for the time with Entlüftungskanälen and typical Kamins. 
It is a little bizarre is its 45 degrees inclination already. 
In his creation Gaudí consistently ignored all former building codes and in no way anyone could be discouraged by this. 
Before start, he was one of the relevant permission from the city but the information presented by him on the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers in the completion of two years later were so appalled by the outcome that they change the situation demanded. 
The Ratsherrs were also among other things, that the building with its pillars, even in the public sidewalk. 
Among the changes, however, there was no longer quite the opposite - just 15 days after the relevant request of the district asked Josep Batlló a request for approval of the property of the two highest situated floors of the House - and it has given him promptly. 
The homeowners themselves pulled into the lower floors one. 
In the gallery on the 2nd floor was a company showroom, on the third floor were bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment. 
The ground floor has been leased to a juwelier business. 
The entire sechsstöckig building is going through a set of stairs up to the dachte race. 
The basic elements of the reorganization were all right corner and just lines removed and replaced by bent and waved walls. 
Gaudí also worked with a modern approach to the mutual connection between rooms. 
The social part is quite connect through the opening of the Salontüren and so could comfortably chatting, without a major society in vertraulich more talks will have to give up on a certain intimacy. 
The House received by Gaudís restructuring, apart from a new facade is also an unusual roof and two other floors. 
It is also a formidable Gaudís game with the light and the blue and white glasiert Kachels with which the courtyard is dressed and Lichthofs. 
The game of those two colours gives all the floors of the House a maximum amount of light. 
In doing so he became simply the principle that white light reflects better than dark colors, the sunlight on the contrary absorb. 
The house, Casa Batlló, the 2005 was included in the welterbe list of Unesco, everyone can now visit. 
In the first floor is the apartment made available to the public geräumigste and prächtigste. 
The homeowners chosen first in the year to this step, and the cause of the 150 birth day of famous writers. 
When we found out that this is a fairly lucrative business reserved the inspections, so they also extended to other common and Dachgeschossräume, including the dachte race. 
The price for the inspection of the monument is not a small thing, he stands at 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get 20 per cent reduction. 
This figure surpasses the entry price to other gaudí estates in the city. 
Who the real atmosphere of the House, with its drache door mchen would like to know, should seek friendship with one of the domestic residents to close and put him on a visit home.
