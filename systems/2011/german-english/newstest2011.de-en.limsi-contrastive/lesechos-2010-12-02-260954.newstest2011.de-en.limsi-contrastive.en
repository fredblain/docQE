Second mandate: the evidence 
De Gaulle had genuinely curtailed. 
Mitterrand had to believe that he stutze. 
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation. 
And Nicolas Sarkozy, still less than this. 
A mandate in the Elysée calls on the next. 
The current leader will be candidate in 2012. 
But the evidence is the side of the mystery of the presidential function, not a good thing to face. 
So we must act as if there would be doubts now. 
In one, as well as in the other sense. 
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac's pretended that a third mandate is not excluded, without even believing. 
On 15 November in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy, said that its decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011" to be taken. 
The fact that he on Tuesday evening in the display of UMP-Parlamentariern the prospect of "two mandates" would, therefore, had spread a little Fieberhaftigkeit. 
This was the official announcement of his candidacy? 
Far from it. 
The president left just remind you that the change in the constitution of 2008, the number of five years of consecutive terms to just two. 
He made a statement, no announcement. 
It is not the first time that he is the presidential election, made during these meetings mentioned in a humorous tone. 
"At worst, you are still seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009. 
In a new state in May 2010: "Does not, that I do not think beyond the stage." 
His words of the day does not make him more about the candidate than the day before; but it is also not less. 
If they alarmist comment, then from a double reason. 
The acceleration of the Wettlaufes for the nomination with the PS on one side. 
But it is not the start of the competition with Segolene Royal, Nicolas Sarkozy is pushing to reveal. 
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, many members of the PS early as adopted for the Challenge. 
The poor polls on the other side. 
For the first time, the electorate would be the rights of François Fillon a candidacy by Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the survey of BVA-L'Express) prefer. 
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP ', and immediately reacted cautiously to the environment of the Prime Minister. 
"If it is a defeat would find as possible, he would not be a candidate" shares Jean-Pierre Raffarin. 
"He will always believe it to be able to win" corrected Alain Juppé, who has gone along with the evidence.
