Saba dell wants to its rival in three years, a million customers 'klauen ' 
The executive director of Banco saba dell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but a new liquidity crisis initially rejects and predicts the end of the Schuldenkriegs. 
Nevertheless, he sees a collapse of the banks with interest margins ahead to offset increases in the fees and prices for loans to try. 
Saba dell expected in three years, a million retail customers - a remaining specialist. 
Saba dell has found the way to the next three years, and so in a very complicated economic environment to survive. 
In 2011, the bank will introduce a new three-year flagship plan. 
The goal is not only to survive without public aid from the FROB to enjoy, but also the market share of about a million retail customers - 700 000 if the customer leaves the bank will lose - to increase. This is the great challenge facing this bank, because until now it has its business customers more attention than their private customers. 
This year it has 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies get. 
Your market share in retail is at 3.5 percent, while the business customers account for more than 10 percent. 
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase of productivity, or rather Austerität, cost reduction. The challenges faced by the bank so that it is facing, it will present, along with annual Summary. 
Only a few banks dare in these difficult times set targets and to publish as a result of the financial crisis all global banks' plans are disrupted. 
Saba dell this year its flagship plan established four years ago Optima finish. This was initially designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended for a business year. 
The customers who left the savings banks, the main objective of the bank. 
At a breakfast organized by the APIE Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great scope." 
The manager expects Spain would only "slow" out of the crisis. 
In addition, it would be "very difficult" in two or three years "work to create" - essential for the survival of the banks. 
Although he assumes that the war for liabilities - the interest rate margins punished - will wane, raise risk premia, banks and thrifts must pay for their emissions to the maintenance of liquidity, as compensation for loss of profit margins have already passed on the cost of borrowing. 
"The issues of liquidity and funding are structural in nature, and they will exert pressure on the credit." 
"We have not marginalised Hahn, but the Zinsdifferenziale are very high," were Guardiola. 
Banesto was on Thursday ordering its subsidiary network, to restrict the granting of long-term loans and to increase the Zinsdifferenziale (cf. Cinco Díaz report on 22 and 27 November). 
The manager also acknowledged a currently pursued by the banks of the Stategie, "to increase the fees," but "within a framework that have been shaped by the competition." 
Saba dells guiding plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business. 
It is no coincidence that he assured that in Spain "more companies are necessary." 
"In the coming year will change everything," he assured. 
He stressed that the need for capital is currently "huge increases" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions are slipping into red figures. 
He is of the opinion that Kaptitalaufstockungen FROB could replace the money market. 
After he assured that saba dell also can survive a temporary closure of the markets, he refuted the argument by some bankers, who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis. 
He stressed that nothing can be put into circulation, but compared to the events in June, could be short-term funding beyond Repogeschäfte reach, and hence the crisis.
