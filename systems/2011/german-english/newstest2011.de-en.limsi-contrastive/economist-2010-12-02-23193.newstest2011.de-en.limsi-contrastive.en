An election weak 
Nobody had expected that the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect. 
But the facts exceeded the fears of polling officials who rushed to help the troubled country, far from it. 
Overcrowding Wahlurnen multiple votes, election notes in Rinnstein destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only a part of the problems. 
Wahllokale opened with hours of delay. 
Many Haitians, many of whom became homeless by the January earthquake were built against mountain slopes in search of a choice. 
Finally, some gave the whole. 
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged leader, demanded on the basis of an alleged fraud, the lifting of the election results. 
In the whole country was partly violent protests. 
However, Edmond Mulet called the head of the UN mission in Haiti, the election "as good in many issues." 
According to a cautious statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean community "to make these irregularities so serious they may be, the process is not necessarily unlawful." 
In other words, the show goes on. 
The Electoral Commission, which alleged the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Célestin Jew, obligated, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December. 
The expected runoff is scheduled for January. 
There is still hope in the election. 
The two leading opposition candidates, the Rap-Musiker Michel mart elly and the former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial ungültigkeit claim. 
If Célestin Jewish voters little or no support from the Wahlberhörde declared the winner of the runoff, it could lead to problems. 
As a result of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million for the earthquake victims are still living in tents, feared a low turnout. 
On election day, many Haitians have been hindered by a lack of organisation of the vote. 
Shortly before polling began were approximately 250 000 identity cards, which are needed for the election has not yet been distributed. 
There is much at stake. 
The donor countries consider a legitimate recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti. 
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
