A tenant of Bakala: it fuels in the stove - still pays higher rent 
An elderly untersetzter man leaves just the client center of the society RPG Byty the 'Kohlebarons' Zdenk Bakala, the largest Privatbesitzers of rental housing in the Czech Republic. 
Under the arm of a commemorative envelope with three new leases on three houses: on their own and the homes of his daughters and his son, who has just served a prison sentence. 
All three were in the framework of the so-called "deregulation" has just increased the rent. 
So, instead of 3 500 kronor monthly miete is the son next year on a 2 room home with kitchen fork out £3.3bn 4100 kronor in the second category. 
"There are less than fluid in the house hot water and heat must be in a simple carbon," he angrily tippt a finger at the new lease of the son, whose signature he a power. 
"But what - signed and I," he explains half and half resigned. 
The civic association BytyOKD.Cz, the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral," advises the tenants, the new contracts are not easy to sign up and until 7 December to wait, in which it intends to publish a guidebook, as it fights against such contracts. 
But the man only is dismissive. 
"One says that the others," he makes a grim face. 
The region of Ostrava as the great "deregulation laboratory." 
After the New Year is this deregulation most rental housing in the Czech Republic before, whose tenants pay no rent market. 
Aktuáln.Cz therefore decided that this "laboratory" on a personal visit. 
The RPG-Warteraum Havíov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning packed on this Tuesday. 
The Bodyguards are right beside the door of a security agency and an aufruf machine. 
"Rent 2011," stands as a special Tastfeld on the touch screen. 
In a nutshell touched upon by and already spuckt the device with a numerical list. 
We hardly have the number "157" entziffert and already piepst them on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting period. 
Half a minute later in the series. 
A little later, an older couple walks into the waiting area, in order to ask for the rent, but the onslaught in the waiting area apparently does not apply at all the new rent. 
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - Reparaturanträge, Versicherungsangelegenheiten and similar. 
From the middle of November fly over the region Ostrava Kuverts with the new leases most tenants of a total of 44 000 homes of the portfolio of RPG in the mailboxes. 
The RPG Byty beats them in the letter, a rent increase of around 15 to 38 percent. 
The specific date for the new rent in the client centre is opened for the 18 November. 
"The action runs a little over a week, which is to say, that is only the beginning" to answer the ladies behind the counter for a moment of hesitation, as the "client" emerging as a journalist. 
The deregulation and Bakalas former Bergarbeiterwohnungen are a sensitive issue. 
Before the elections was the parliamentary Vice-President originating from Ostrava Lubomír Zaorálek SSD quite loudly taken up this issue, no wonder, then, that today the newspapers are full of them. 
"Twenty years, I want a new bed from them." 
"It is not even look at besch. WC-Brille they could change" makes the aforementioned man air. 
Until now, according to the staff are all pensioners on the counter in order to convince themselves whether they really get the promised tenants' moderation, which promises them RPG if they have the specific requirement to sign in time. 
In the enjoyment of a half reduced February miete should also get the other tenants, the new lease until 15 December to sign. 
Until now, "deregulation" in Havíov but everything else, as an overloaded of enquiries. 
"From yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because here" appreciate the schalter beamtins. 
RPG offers both on their websites, as well as Wandtafeln individual rental agreements where necessary. 
If the parties do not agree on the new rent, they will be determined by an independent court. 
"This is not a threat, but as the information on the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach to understand," RPG said on its website. 
"Nobody here goes to court," says a staff of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client centre gives her, at least partly right. 
"I have 13 (Sweden kronors) pension, of which I left for dinner 5, where I should get the money for a legal dispute," he says. 
Then the employee is uncertain. 
"Time to see." 
"Mr Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so people prefer to wait and see," it must be borne in mind. 
The regulated rent ends in the main part of the Czech Republic on New Year's Day of 2011 and RPG Byty, according to the rental increase is an economic necessity. 
"The existing level of rent is not enough times to the maintenance of the housing funds from" argues Pavel Klime, the director of the society Wohnungs-Portfolios RPG Byty and - just to criticize the neglect of the angry tenants of the Housing Fund, according to the homeowners of the main reason for the rent hike. 
While RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010 from one's rent four billion could be invested in the houses in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it should be 5.2 billion. 
In the broadsheet LCD-Display on the ceiling over the polster sessels in the waiting area of Havíov in the meantime, there are always a few red shining information. 
"The rent increases by 15% in 2011 and less concern 31 200 homes, which means more than 90% of the homes of RPG." 
"This means that whenever a maximum 7,50 CZK per square metre and month" is to read on the LCD-Monitor. 
Only 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG increased the rent by 38 percent. 
"In these cases is the increase of extreme lower rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG. 
In 2600 housing remains the rent on the same level in the next year. 
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation of the rent is not erratic in pushing up but staged within four and eight years. 
What is more - the company imposed an additional duty: all revenue from the rent increase (see graph) wants to keep putting the company back into the homes, especially in Wärmeersparnisse - in new windows and insulation. 
But - and this should primarily benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent hike.
