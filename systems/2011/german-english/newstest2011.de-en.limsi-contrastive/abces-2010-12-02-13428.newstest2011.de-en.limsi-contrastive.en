The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA with Taliban and Al-Qaida-Gefangenen on Spanish territory after Guantanamo as a telegram from the ambassador, S.A. emerges in Madrid. 
This reflects the enhüllten of Wikileaks and the daily newspaper El País " (cable) passed on documents, but it adds that the former deputy leader María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, the Spanish Government should be informed," is to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain, will be monitored properly. " 
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the subsidy on human rights practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, have been indicted, discussed the former American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.

"Despite their generally proamerikanischen attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt from an indication that the government of Zapatero's actions of the United States as a possible human rights violations could be interpreted, tolerated or have deliberately ignored capital, even if these revelations will have a negative impact on the government of the United States could," he stresses.
