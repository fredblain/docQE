"If you for the adoption of the dream Act - thousands, then ruf your senators and urge the adoption of this law," twitterte Obama. 
His short statement contains a cyber left to a more comprehensive document, which calls on the public unterzüglich to come in contact with their senators, because the vote on the bill imminent. 
"With your vote, in which we wait, the time has come to listen to you," he stresses. 
The news was disseminated after the 42 Republican senators androhten to block all voice for every law except the extension of tax rebates from the times of Bush and the financing of the government would be extended. 
Such a blockade at one of the 42 Republican senators signed letter was announced, might affect the vote of the dream Act - thousands and other projects, such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia to combat nuclear proliferation. 
The blockade of the law's Republican dream Act and other projects have been questioned, said presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs, he trust that, once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable for the other projects could be established. 
"I think we still have a lot of time..." 
"We all agree that the tax issue must be completed before the end of the year..." 
"I believe that we can make an agreement at any time, and then we can plan the expiry of the remainder," he said. 
The chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, kündete on Tuesday, "he would vote to end debate" request, so that the dream Act - the law with which the initiative to legalize undokumentierter students could be put to a vote in the Senate on Thursday, even though the next week would be more likely.

That is why the defender of the dream must get Act, several Republicans on their side, if other Democrats choose should turn our backs on the initiative. 
Among the most pulled Republicans include Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux of the mandate of the senator from Florida, Mel Martínez took over. 
Other Republicans in the past supported the dream Act, are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said it in a different opportunity not to support any more. 
Another Republican who voted for the bill, John McCain, has not yet defined its position. 
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the dream Act in the Senate faces the biggest obstacles.
