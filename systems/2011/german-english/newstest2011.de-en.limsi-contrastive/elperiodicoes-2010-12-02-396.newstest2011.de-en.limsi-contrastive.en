Puigcercós addiction with a nod to the Carod close the social peace in the ERC 
The Republican leaders allowed the party a secret ballot on his continuance in office. 
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the Vollversammlungsprinzips. 
Joan Puigcercós a recipe seems to have found, for the umpteenth time of internal turmoil in the ranks after the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes from landmark unemployed ERC from the way to go. 
The leader is aware that his resignation threat to close the former party leader, Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira is not enough. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is now so weakened as her mentor himself and he is not the same headaches in store for us, as other former currents. 
That is why the leader of Esquerra trying to win with a nod to the new critics, what his position until the next local elections would secure. 
Kündete for the start yesterday, that the more than 200 regional members of ERC about his stay in the office could comment secret. 
With ballot papers, not with gehobener hands. 
If the Carodisten wanted to miss the Präsidenen with a fine, they could do this without needing to fear repression. 
Indeed, would head both the impression of divisions, as well as the submission to avoid him. 
In several interviews, he confirmed he would with half of the votes plus one not vindicated, and he added without giving any percentage levels, a result "in the Bulgarian style" is not good. 
The Carod urged the social demand from the president more than just provide the party office. An inadequate gesture, because Puigcercós is the supreme body of the congresses controlled. 
But because they do not have a sufficient majority for the promotion of resignations, it will be with the board a course plan from now until May agreed. 
To this end, they expect in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation that leadership on 18 will submit to the Council to vote can participate. 
It is your intention to guarantee for Puigcercós. In turn this should promise the congress in the autumn of 2011, which already holds the leader of a fait accompli. 
The leader of the ERC is of the view that the "Polyphonie" shame of the stability and wants forever, to bring the organization in the position to wash their dirty linen behind closed doors. 
In this sense, the article, the incumbent Conseller, Josep Huguet wrote in his blog, in typical fashion. 
Against this backdrop, the Puigcercós is an ideologue, the owner of Innovació felt that it was a fact that the party chairman "in exchange for various objectives will be supported." 
He was five, and two of them in the foreground. 
First of all, the "restructuring" of the board of directors, so that it takes at least 90 percent of party members, that means the inclusion of new faces from Carods environment. 
The second could be the big news. 
Huguet proposes ERC should the full assembly principle as the operation scrapped. 
In so doing, he verfechtet a reform of the statutes, which should make it possible to hold the conferences with elected delegates. 
From the end of the Vollversammlungsmodells - an exception in the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós ' team, which is already in the last two congresses fought like mad. 
Indeed, at the bebend Assembly of 2008, the party leadership with the review of the Vollversammlungsprinzips at a congress should deal with the reform of the statute instructs. 
This date is still, as infogle of the internal Aufruhe of the last few years tackling this issue was not advisable. 
Now, without which the critical sectors are on the lookout, the time has come to address this matter again and forever to complete.
