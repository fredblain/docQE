In the pursuit of Wikileaks boss 
Obama will appoint a senior person responsible for the anti-terrorist campaign on the prevention of new revelations. 
Interpol is a red alert has been issued for the prosecution and location of Assange. 
Everything with WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange connected forms a complicated maze where only difficult to investigate the facts. 
Yesterday Interpol, a "red warning" to "locate and persecution" of Assange. 
However, it is not a traditional layout on the arrest. 
In addition, it is not new, it comes from the 20 November. 
It also has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States to do, but with the allegations of sexual abuse, which the Australians must face in Sweden. 
The lawyer also assured the founder of WikiLeaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they came into contact with Mr. Assange could absorb." 
As early as 20 gave the international police agency located in Lyon (France) at the request of the Swedish Order, but until yesterday after the receipt of the power it was not announced by the Swedish authorities. 
That is how things stand. The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify Assange and, presumably, "in order to arrest him on a preliminary basis and hand them over." 
Although Interpol for the arrest of a person hit by a red warning may not see many member countries according to the organisation of the red warning as a licence for a Arrestierung - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange probably finds himself. 
The action empörte Assanges lawyers, the gestures, published a letter in which they are about it, the 39 year-old founder of Wikileaks is prepared by video conference to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities. 
They also recall that Assange exit from Sweden, and the prosecutor with the shrouded Pavlovich Lavrentiy Beria, security chief of Stalin, compared to the corresponding authorization was given. 
"This is like a hunt, not as a legal persecution," will be charged in the letter. 
While it seeks the world - and his mother of Australia from the innocence of their son - Assange clings to an unknown location, but not silent. 
On Monday he was the head of the Time magazine via Skype from an unspecified location for an interview. In the interview he called for the resignation of the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, the United States. 
"If it can be proven that it was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the United Nations, and thus against the United States to sign an international agreement has infringed, they should resign," he said. 
His opinion was yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, condemned the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd." 
"I am not sure why we value on the opinion of a guy with a website should," he told CNN. 
Obama himself has a highly responsible for the anti-terrorist campaign, Rusell Travers, charged with the prevention of new Dokumentenenthüllungen. 
The attempt by the spokesman of the side that those responsible for Barack Obama, Assange to pay less attention, stands in contrast to the views, the conservative politicians and commentators proclaim in these days. 
The Congressman Peter King, from January the chair of the House of Representatives in the national security kommitee, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of Wikileaks to put on the list of terrorist organisations, "in order to seize their money, and everyone who supported or contributes to follow." 
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to the Canadian President Stephen Harper, has gone even further, and he had to his statement, Assange must "be killed" revoked. 
"Obama should transform him into a target and is not a manned aircraft or so what use." 
Anyone who has not apologized, Mike Huckabee, baptistischer minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate. 
"Who else was in the government leaked information, it is the treason and everything that is not an execution is eiine mild punishment," he told the broadcaster Fox.
