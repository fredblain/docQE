The European Central Bank (ECB) 
Investors reacted yesterday sharp on the threat of ECB President Trichet warned that "the markets should not underestimate our capacity." 
The risk premia have risen dramatically in the Euro-Peripheriländer and the shares of European banks by more than 5%. 
However, we should have the possibility that the ECB can deceive themselves and the euro has gained little points, which led to concern, not underestimate. 
The events of yesterday are typical for an illiquid market in the deal, in which he collapses recovers, however, as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions. 
The institutional investors do not lose his fear. 
Now a month ago, the European Central Bank urged on us to reverse our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen, according to which the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably still a number of times in the future, must make a U-turn. 
The Bundesbank called for the lifting of the plan for the purchase of government debt, because they are ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. It should only be a week's indefinite access will be maintained. 
After the Ireland crisis, we expect that the current liquidity measures "at least until March," extended and the quarterly tenders with unlimited access on the quarterly of the year in order to guarantee the liquidity will be maintained until at least June. 
We also expect that the programme for the purchase of bonds continued and will spend a reinforcing message. 
If the managed expectations are not met, the excellent response of the markets of yesterday back and if halstarrig insistence that we withdraw our liquidity measures, can only God help us! 
Like the EZB-Sitzung in May, in which the bank confirmed the purchase of government debt securities do not need to be considered and then collapsed, the markets could repeat this story tomorrow. 
The ECB must be credible and tenacious. 
In May, they showed the teeth and on Wednesday, she said to have bought a lot, provoking a new collapse of the market. 
Yesterday was the auction of one-year government permits in Portugal rather weak. 
The state asset management was only 500 million at 5,28%, compared with 750 million at 4,81% in the previous auction. 
However, the interest rates fell by 30 basis points in Portugal in the whole curve and thus reflected a perceptual change the markets after the words Trichet's reflect that. 
In Ireland were the figures of the debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland published. 
The amount is approximately 10 000 million short-term and possible further 15 000. There is time until February in order to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized. 
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after the problem with the stress tests had not detected in July, the figures are acceptable within the framework of the rescue plan and help to reduce uncertainty. 
However, the government Tuesday received parliamentary approval to his new budget, but the fact that they still do not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty. 
Angela Merkel has its discourse with regard to the summit of the Heads of State and the government of moderate shaped on 14 December where it needed political unity in order to show that we shared the same score to play. 
The problem is that Germany, Wagner wants to play and the other countries of the Beethoven's ninth symphony. 
The Spanish government minister yesterday asked the action plan, which is due to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday. 
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reduction of the deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures in the ears of investors such as Vivaldis sound for four seasons. 
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges. 
Compared to February was the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank quickly and convincingly, and we benefit from the surprise result. 
Today, there is an authoritative auction of three-year bond, which benefit from the trichet effect, and that is why we put on a strong demand, which remove all doubts about our debt-restructuring capacity. 
For Spain would be the application of an aid plan is a self-sacrifice. 
We get liquidity, which we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion available, three times as much as in March. the interest rates are very expensive and would get access to the markets closed. 
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with the motto "Caesar's wife:" now what counts is not only his, but also on the bill. " 
Only the courage that we create!
