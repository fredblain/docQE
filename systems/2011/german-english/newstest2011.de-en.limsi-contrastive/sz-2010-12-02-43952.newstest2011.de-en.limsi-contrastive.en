Love in a time of war 
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer with the work of their still nameless deb端t has begun, there is anger. 
She has even written the script, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serb man. 
Rather, we do not know about it - but it is sufficient for unrest. 
There is the rumor, the woman, a Muslim woman, verliebe during the Yugoslav war in her Serb rapist. 
Bosnian women's associations have immediately protested, and some Drehtags planned in Sarajevo have been transferred in the short term after Hungary. 
In the meantime, the film marginalised in Hungary and in the postal production, but it is still protested in Bosnia. 
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote on the UN-Fl端chtlingshilfswerk UNHCR, Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - even the UN-Fl端chtlingshilfswerk Goodwill Ambassador Jolie. 
It is not Diplomatisch - it was the women from several weeks before a meeting in Hungary offered what but refused. 
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic. 
Liebesgeschichten, it was not given in Vergewaltigungscamps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims would not be betraying her enough about the script. 
Your organization has recommended, according to the UN-Fl端chtlingshilfswerk to dismiss as a Goodwill Ambassador Jolie, the Guardian reported. 
But what exactly Jolie wrote for scenes? 
The Bosnian Culture Ministry, which was to read their script, after some to-ing and fro-ing issued a permit for Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie then nothing came. 
The young author even claimed to have no political intentions with her film was incorporated into the Yugoslav conflict with a lot of effort, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties. 
Content, however, it remains vague. 
Thus, even a second Synopsis for the film in the network, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew it before war broke out and meet again, a Bosnian Muslim woman when she is kidnapped in a Serbian camp, where he works as a guard. 
What sounds considerably different than the variant "rape verknallt torturer." 
The fact that Jolie's film actually starts before the war - so much is safe. 
The pressure on them, as Jolie is "unfair and based on misinformation." 
She can now probably just give the hackers of Hollywood peace: in dismissing the script, like so many before, illegally on the Internet.
