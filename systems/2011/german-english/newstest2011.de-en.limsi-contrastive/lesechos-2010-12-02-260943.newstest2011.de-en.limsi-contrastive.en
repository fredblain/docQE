2018 2022 World Cup: the FIFA appoints the ausrichter country 
In a chaotic frenzy because of corruption suspicions appoints the executive committee of FIFA on Thursday, the ausrichter countries of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice, in which the Rangeln influence and lobbying the technical criteria are threatening to push into the background. 
But one thing is certain: the spending 2018 the royal discipline of FIFA in Europe, its traditional stronghold, take place (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain Portugal, between belgien). 
The edition 2022 will then be somewhat exotic; the International Football Association hopes for the first time on the African continent in the year 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) to win, or its branch in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to pursue. 
The list of personalities on the delegation accompanying (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch leader, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) is the extent of the economic and political use of a World Cup. 
The machinations behind the scenes are threatening up to the last minute to hold. 
Otherwise it is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates. 
After the evaluation report of the FIFA, the English, Spanish portugiesische (2018) and American (2022) Act bessseren arguments than those of its competitors. 
But these considerations for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees on the hour of choice is not so strong. 
The Sunday Times, with the establishment of the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, also had a good chance for their own country, cradle of the football, can ruin, only a single time was allowed to compete at the World Cup: 1966. 
The BBC had the ground again on Monday given by their own report was broadcast, the three influential members of the Kommitees, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou takes under fire. 
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and the English responsible to embarrass primarily with David Cameron had pursued an intense lobbying in recent weeks. 
The Government hopes for a repeat of the gambit fine from his predecessor Tony Blair in London in 2005 had reached the organization of the Olympic Games in 2012. 
The dignity of this intensive use enough image England appearance before the Kommitee again? 
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain Portugal has no shortage of trump cards, with its already finished stadiums, his expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, the Olympic Games in 1992 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture. 
But the economic and financial drawbacks of the two countries could stifle their ambitions. 
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, the chances of Russia, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become the influential outsiders are rising. 
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to openly hint at the Bezichtigungs of the English press "an unfair competition in the runup to the vote" on the part of the Kommiteemitglieder denounced. 
"We bewirft it with dirt, trying to compromise," Putin lashed out. 
For 2022 seem the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, the logical favorites. 
First economic superpower, seat of the FIFA-Hauptsponsoren, the country seems a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have drawn up a very nice project separately. 
But this new nominations seem premature for two countries that had helped host the competitions in 2002. 
Another threat: the long-awaited approval of the FIFA World Cup 2026 for China, the Asian opportunities will lapse in 2022. 
With Australia and Qatar, with the Aufwartung futuristischer stadium had drawn all registers, the FIFA has pursued her expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk for certainty. 
Australia may as well as Japan and South Korea under the akquittierten weakness of the European countries of television rights (due to the time shift) have to suffer the delicate nerve of FIFA.
