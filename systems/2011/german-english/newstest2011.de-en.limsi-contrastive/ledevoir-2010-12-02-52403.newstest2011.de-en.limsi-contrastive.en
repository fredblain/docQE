Mystery of the komplexgeschüttelten Canada lifted 
The new American Diplomatenleitungen, which have been disseminated by WikiLeaks reveal the mystery about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of Canadians feel toward the Americans; but they put the the latter superiority with the same blow against Canada open. 
As a result, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters to the ballot, not the kanadisch American relations in the spirit, and they believe that the visit by President Obama would have helped the Conservative government, their Budget of 2009 to enforce! 
The four new communications between the US Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were prevalent yesterday publicly offer even more juicy details than the mere substantive content, with which it has a very bad outcome. 
A previous link on 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period in which the federal Wahlkampage was currently in full swing, reported from what point the United Nations is not more of the operations involved discussed by their political bosses. 
With regard to the great surprise of David Wilkins of Ottawa deployed American ambassador. 
Mr. Wilkins offers various channels in this situation. 
"One of the Canadians are almost inherent inferiority complex conditional leads possibly the Canadian political leaders far more on internal issues of everyday life to talk as the United States in this election the buck (as in 1988, when the campaign on free trade) ," as he describes. 
The United Nations, he concludes, are thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially threatening to talk to him." 
The ambassador understands these "deafening silence" especially since the two countries have intensive political and economic relations. 
"Logically," as he assessed, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a leader to drive such processes relationship, which the voters at the polls as a key factor in the mind." 
The other expression of this sense of importance reads on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business sources in Ottawa, written communication, President Barack Obama on his first visit in Ottawa to prepare. 
"Your visit will help the survival of the government in a confidence vote on the federal budget at the beginning of February to ensure that the Canada its first budget deficit after more than a decade, will announce the result of a recovery programme in the level of 30 to 40 billion dollars has arisen," describes Breese. 
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had parliamentary session before Christmas must be postponed in order to prevent that Parliament would be toppled by the coalition and the conditional continuation of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed Belebungsprogramms. 
Another, from January 2008 dating of the year and written communication from the Wilkins ambassadors agreed to Washington from the increasingly negative hard-line image, the dramatic series broadcast on development, spread by the United States. 
The ambassador is concerned about programmes such as Border, little Mosque on the Prairie Intelligence and H2O, where little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even Abführungen for the purpose of interrogation analysis by the CIA Muskelprotze watch. 
Yet another communication reported at length about how Hillary Clinton remarked on their French counterparts, Bernard Kouchner, during their first bilateral meeting asked whether Europe is ready to include certain prisoners from Guantanamo. 
Mr. Kouchner is expected to answer the question yes, but on the basis of an individual " case to Fall"-Entscheidung. 
Àm at the end of the meeting, as described, "he was the Secretary of State distributed a paper on the issue of Omar Khadr, a 15-year Muslim Canadian origin." 
"The Secretary of State has promised the files again." 
Finally, we can still see the sensibilities on the website WikiLeaks. 
Tom Flanagan, an old and very close Stephen Harper standing adviser, explained on development, that the people responsible for this massive leak "should be killed." 
He was here to just cites Mike Huckabee from the United States.
