Zapatero and the red line in Germany 
Berlin has opted for the of, keeping the euro, but at the same time the conditions set for the whole of the European Union. 
The tension on the markets have triggered a dual response of the government. 
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation presented, beginning with tax rebates for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the lifting of the 426 million support for the unemployed, not unemployment benefits, referring to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of airports Barajas and El Prat, as well as 30 per cent of the state lottery. 
On the other hand supports the Deputy Head, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former government minister Felipe González criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible, calls have been made to get the current crisis. 
How are these events to understand? 
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their public relations. 
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro. 
It takes Germany a fundamental new perspective on the shape of our future, with the maintenance of the ancient traditions of a large part of its partners. 
Given the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis on spekuliern. 
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro area. 
The second point: the restoration of the German mark - although that is currently more sounds like science fiction - supported by a majority of the public opinion, around 50 percent of the population. 
The third point: a transformation of the euro, according to German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict budget; the punishment of the countries that overstep the targets; möglicher as the default of certain countries, as well as the extension of the cost of potential adjustments to the private sector. 
The German position is clear and has been for some time, and that is why there are no excuses. 
First of all, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission to provide incentives for deficits in the past and the German government is a constitutional reform has withdrawn from the case, in order to prevent this from 2016. 
This was the first sign of the divergence between what Germany saw fit (strict fiscal plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. 
The second signal suspended the Central European country, as Merkel the decision on the rescue of Greece is also more than painful. 
At the time was heavily criticised. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion were totally against a rescue of Greece. 
Merkel is finally in the last Oktobertags again with a clear position, which calls for a reform of the agreements between the European Union in order to facilitate the rescue of a country and at the same time to commit the private lender to bear a portion of the costs. 
This position was interpreted as anti-European because they Ireland crisis and propelled all the following. 
But her proposal, albeit slightly sweetened, Parliament approved in the next few months, we will be in the reform of the European Union, these measures should enable from 2013, participate. 
Germany has drawn a red line not to cross does. 
It says all that - even if now unpopular measures must be taken - from the date of the old workings of the euro will be no more. 
In 2013 it will be the birth year of a new monetary area in which the offender countries be punished harshly, may be forced to declare itself insolvent and in this case, the private sector must take a share of the cost. 
Germany shows us that we must take a hard growth rate, high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances. 
The other alternative to debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments is based, as they led by Spain in boom times, will simply not be tolerated. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would do wrong to not understand it. 
It is not just about the public deficit to three percent by 2013 runterzufahren. 
The demands are much harder. 
And the worst of all, what we could do under these circumstances is to cheat ourselves. 
I hope that the current turmoil to move into more calm. 
And that we have the opportunities that are available to us, until the spring of 2013 will use. 
It seems that Zapatero has understood this, too, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies on last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel hypothesis to create order in your own home, is getting its way. 
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not seem that it would change anything. 
Among the options taken into account is that the euro area packed with little serious countries would have to leave, not be ruled out. 
In this case, Germany could still tell us they have warned us.
