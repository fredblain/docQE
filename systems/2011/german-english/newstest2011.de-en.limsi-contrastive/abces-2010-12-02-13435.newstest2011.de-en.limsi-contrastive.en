The elderly care home confirmed that the deaths were not due to "lack of action" 
The owners of the old people's home in Olot does not preclude their carers on 11 elderly people killed 
The people in charge of the elderly nursing home in La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which she highlighted what damage the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the carers during his work at least 11 old people, for which he was responsible, was killed - had caused the institution. 
The head of the elderly care home, Joan Sala, came in the company of his lawyer, Joan Cañada, before the court and announced, "La Caritat would like to thank the people responsible (for the deaths) tribunal," but "the right and our liability force us into the process and the civil liability" to adopt. 
The institution must not only accept a social prestige lost, because they are the criminal activities of the nurses had not detected in time, but now also pay a high compensation sum by the legal representatives of the families of the victims will be calculated. 
Joan Vila Dilmé acknowledged that the first crime is falling in August 2009, and that he had murdered since even further. 
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight Körpern - former patients of the elderly nursing home - because he thought that no doctor examined the dead personally, but the paperwork because of their age and disease have been handled by phone. 
The head of La Caritat flatly prominent writers have expressed this point and said that "the lack of action in no time, the reason could have been for the events." 
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "there is no evidence in the litigation for negligent acts were a different person than the defendant." 
The already as "Angel" Getaufte confessed the day 11 killings and said the first crime committed on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later, the second old lady to have been murdered. 
In this case he was killed with an overdose of insulin, compared to the first crime, in which he is a mixture of various sedatives had. 
The head of La Caritat, said the staff access to the drugs is difficult to control. 
The insulin injections and the sedative middle cocktail suspended the carers in six of the nine crimes a to liberate the patients with the death of their suffering. 
But the results of laboratory tests will point out whether Vila is lying and for its first victims actually chose a less cruel death, or whether he ausbrannte them from the inside by calling them bleich lauge forecast was, as it had done, according to three women he killed between 12 and 17 October. 
In La Caritat listens to the statements of the carers no faith, not even as far as the number of confessed murder, which could well be more. This attitude is justified that Vila very different statements made in court and that it make no sense, his approach after eight successful assassinations to suddenly change. 
They say they stood up for this reason and investigating the scope of these incidents of justice available.
