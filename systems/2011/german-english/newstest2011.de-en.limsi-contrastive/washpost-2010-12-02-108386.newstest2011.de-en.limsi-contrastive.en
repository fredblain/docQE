Politeness can combine the division? 
After a campaign of dirty words and negativity this week erupted little civility in Washington. 
It is the sign of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before quickly returning to the struggle of the parties in the capital? 
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and congressional leaders brought no breakthrough on the big issues during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government session, in which no decisions will be taken longer had to employ. 
After all, what is being said, it was neither a polite discussion between the two sides are still a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of partisan Punktesammelns. 
The public meeting of the president's deficit commission on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences that still exist between the members. 
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months created a new mutual respect can the ideological divide that still divides the members disguised. 
This is hardly enough to say that it is a new era of cooperation. 
Both sides are now in a testing phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise, even while trying to cross the borders of the public opinion and the patience of voters to weigh a renewed partisan warfare. 
This was why the meeting on Tuesday itself and its estimation by the participants limited to a minimum of demands or accusations. 
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep when a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, could be expected. 
No matter whether we are talking about taxes, donations, health or Anwartschaften, the two sides are miles apart. 
Finally, the November election Washington has, at least for a short time bribed. 
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, which is now on the "Ethics and Public Policy Center" works. 
"This is inevitable after elections. 
Elections appear partisan passions again. 
This is so good." 
In a number of issues, particularly those on the agenda of the "lame duck session," Republicans and Democrats have hardly any other choice than to find a solution. " 
Bush's tax cuts end up at the end of the year, and no one advocates. 
Both sides want to find a way to make some or even all receive, whether temporary or permanent. 
It is also expected to reach a compromise on the increased unemployment money, even if only because the Republicans cannot afford that it believes the preferred tax cuts for the rich, while they are unemployed workers to refuse a support. 
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House has increased the optimism that these issues during the "lame duck session" to reach an agreement and at the same time, the new Start treaty can be ratified. 
But William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame duck session " soft must lead to a lasting cooperation between the parties, if the new 112. Congress convened in January. 
Instead, he says, is a period of failure for huge likely, perhaps even inevitable. 
"After the things that need to be done, done, will transform this short-term psychology in confrontation," he said. 
Wehner is also sceptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - the politeness leads to real cooperation. 
"I see many things from now on will be done by 2012, as a Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event from 2012," he said. 
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority to do in the White House and the Teeparty-Wählern were instrumental to their education. 
As the Republican leader also expressed concern may be that they vie to high, they know that they must try to keep their promise to cut government spending and the healthcare reform to set aside to adhere to. 
This party lines are already in the first reaction on the recommendations of the deficit commission clearly what a fiscal reform and raised some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and cutting government spending include. 
The stellvertretends Chairman Alan Simpson and Bowles Erskine have one of the most difficult jobs in Washington accepted and, according to their own assessment, pressed so much on the public agenda, the deficit issue, that they can no longer be ignored. 
But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes in order to make its plan for the official recommendation, and they are fighting very well to come only in the vicinity of these numbers. 
The biggest resistance is reflected in the elected representatives of the body, because financial issues, at least today, little room or little sympathy for compromises. 
Galston says two stages in the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress ahead. 
The first fight next year will take place in the form of Parteizusammenstößen, when the Republicans Obama on the state budget, taxes and challenging the health care system, then followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation. 
What will lead to this change? 
The public opinion. 
It is shown that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties to work together. 
If confrontation in a blind alley, as happened in 1995, then both parties need to be careful to respect the public reaction. 
Whoever wins will be doomed to lose, will change the course and the compromise must seek. 
This may in fact be an optimistic view. 
Partisanship and polarization are now greater than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem to have a major ideological divide between Obama and the Kongress-Republikanern to be at the same time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. 
At the same time to see the activists of the two parties in 2010 as a mere prelude to a consequence far broader election in 2012. 
So it may be courtesy display this week will be welcomed by many Americans. 
But on both sides, it will require much more effort to find a common denominator in the issues that the two still separate.
