Sport and regulatory tax evasion 
Tricks like Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax of show inventiveness, but not the desire to avoid a sanction. 
The alleged by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) exclusion in the game on 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League meant that there was a lot of ink about whether it is an unsporting act or not acted upon and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA. 
As is well known, lost two players for a few minutes of the game of the year (her team had already clearly won) time and played several Fouls, so that the referee they showed the second yellow card. 
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would cite his group, the two players the prescribed sanction against the Auxerre meet in the next league game and so without maps in the next room for stage boarding. 
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary kommitee, Jose Mourinho, the coach of the club with two games and the participating players with different amounts of money. 
The provocation of a yellow card in this or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football. 
It is so widespread that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed rules in this game -. 
Part of the debate about the portrayed event is due to the fact that a team of football club Real Madrid (the find and honor claims in its national anthem and on other occasions for similar incidents had punished his players) played the main role, and the drama by Mourinho an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician has added. 
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this is not explicitly prohibited behaviour by the statutes contradicts the principles of the sport, which is to say whether these actions constitute a virtual evasion. Indeed, this approach will abide by the statutes of the sport, but they seem to evade its terms. 
In this matter should damage the spirit of the sport will be investigated. 
The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect which was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game. 
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the offender players an unwarranted benefit from the team, and this did not happen. 
The paradox of the plot of the players of Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally understand under false game or regulatory evasion, since the circumvention of the rule was not taken secretly in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as visible as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. 
The players waited eagerly and sanction attended. 
Another question is what kind of advantage the offender went from the deliberate Fouls. 
Here, it should be stressed that the rival either in a disadvantageous position was still an advantage for the played game were erheischt, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue to play with a few players. 
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, then the club lacks these players. 
The advantage is obvious is that the players the next ground phase of the Champions League without tickets, which could threaten their participation in a future game begin. 
But it is a long-term, up to a certain extent uncertain advantage, because the team could also be absent at some point, and we get the players with this approach, a sanction and go in the second cycle on where they are for card acquisition disappeared with a card less than in the first cycle. 
Thus, it is not so clear whether it is really an advantage. 
Ultimately, such practices are directed not against the sporting spirit, which includes strategic decisions, in order to derive from the rules for a maximum benefit. 
In this case, the players did not want any sanction deal (which would indeed be a clear case of regulatory tax evasion), they wanted to elect more when they undergo these. 
They met a strategic decision to avoid without a penalty or to flee before her. 
Although the line is blurred between inventiveness and regulatory environment, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness. 
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because it involved two Selbstausschl√ºsse and because of the nature of the regulatory operation. 
The damage of the principles of the sport was caused by these acts is less moral rather than aesthetic nature.
