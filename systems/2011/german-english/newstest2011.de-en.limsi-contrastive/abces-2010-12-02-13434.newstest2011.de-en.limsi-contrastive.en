PP Ma's calls for a postponement of the tax agreement 
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, yesterday took the opportunity to Artur Ma's personal their conditions for the support of his assumption of office as prime minister to present the Generalitat. These do not differ from the already during the election campaign raised and the primacy of the economic recovery and the regionalist Unabhängigkeitsabenteuern as a financial compensation agreement, the leaders at the culmination of his mandate, proposing to assemble. 
The leader of the Catalan Popular Party opposing Mas with the security of Artur awarded her the 18 MEPs, which they won on Sunday - a paragraph, which is more than enough to feel indispensable because, as the candidate of the Civic regionalistischen CiU party is dependent on that at least one of the opposition parties in the vote abstained on his assumption of office. 
The future alliances turn in the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Congress intend to depend on a possible entente with the PP, but the talks, Mr. Mas is currently conducting with the other party leaders, however, revolve around Catalonia. 
As far as the leader of the PPC is concerned, it calls for the support of the inauguration of "all discourse, which affect the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia," as well as an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the autonomous region - as in the Basque Country - and the leader of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum, to be employed at the back. 
Both political leaders are common, that they exaggerated political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and want to abolish death duties and gift tax. 
With the details of the negotiations for the inauguration of Ma's deal on the part of the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors. 
Mas has already spoken with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - which announced a harsh opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV hit) today, he will be with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana) to meet.
