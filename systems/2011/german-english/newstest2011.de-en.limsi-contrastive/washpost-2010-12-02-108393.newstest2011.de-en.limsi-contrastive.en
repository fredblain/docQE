Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past 
In a weak brake betoniert class area with dirty and abblätternd walls, reminiscent of the director of the Anlong Veng High School in the man it has built in the subsequent Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok. 
"Everybody here loves Ta Mok." 
"He was a good leader and he cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years. 
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butchers," remains the commander in this remote former Khmer Rouge hochburg popular in the north-west of Cambodia, where he hospitals and bridges built, the infrastructure has developed and where thousands of former soldiers still live. 
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge against the government, are longtime supporters challenged in Anlong Veng. 
In April a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims to the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime. 
In June, the government circulated a school book for the first time children of former soldiers told the story of the Khmer Rouge. 
And in July, a Community court condemned the United Nations and Cambodia for the first time a former member of the Khmer Rouge, as the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, was sentenced to 35 years in prison. 
The fear grew with each of these developments under the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, complicating their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration into the society in Cambodia. 
"There is still disagreement and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime. 
"For them life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." 
"It is dividing even families." 
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or they died from disease, overwork or starvation. 
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-Ied government, fled the remnants of the regime and its armed forces on the border of Cambodia to Thailand. 
In this case it until December 1998, when the last movement, to surrender unrest. 
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary, the guerrilla war from its base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok withdrew the next generation of Anlong Veng. 
But in the middle of the 1990's, when a peace agreement promoted by the UN in 1993 led to the first democratic elections in the country, began major groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, with the government, resulting in the Kapitulationen by Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan of 1998 led. 
Pol Pot died in 1998, a natural death, and Ta Mok, who was not given, was in 1999 by government forces in the Dangrek Mountains were arrested. 
He died in 2006 in a prison of Phnom Penh, where he was awaiting his trial. 
As their benefactors they no longer protected by default, the majority of the former Khmer Rouge fighters in the grinding poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory. 
Even if a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts, because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers. 
"These people have benefited little from the capitulation," said Sok Leang from the Centre for justice and reconciliation throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng holds public forums 
"They are embedded in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime." 
"They are growing up without any professional know." 
Sor Lim, 55, in 1974, joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager, had fought in the jungle at Anlang Veng, before moving in 1998 Lower left a life to lead as a poor rice farmer. 
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said. 
"Ta Mok has everyone to eat something in place." 
"But now, life is difficult, because we have to care for ourselves." 
The current Khmer Rouge tribunal has also fomenting here concerns. 
At the beginning of next year, the court will try, Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge ministers, brought to trial. 
The mandate of the court, the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for atrocities to be condemned, but it has not said whether it is on these four cases will pursue further action. 
This has contributed little to ease fears in Anlong Veng. 
Recent media speculation on the Chaem, 64 years concentrated during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's, district chief in the province of Manteay Meanchey have been. 
In 2007, it was representative of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, told me she was the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms led a project in which thousands of forced labourers probably died. 
At a hot night came in the Chaem of the work in the fields with her wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng back. 
When the sun long shadow on the dried grass threw in the Chaem to discuss her past with the Khmer Rouge. 
If the court vorladen them, so they would refuse to go, she said. 
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said. 
"If there were no longer is war." 
Prime Minister Hun Sen, in 1878, fled from the Khmer Rouge, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be unsafe, the court would accuse more suspects, although experts and historians are discussing this matter. 
"Cambodia should dig a hole and bury the past," he said. 
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to be able to go forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation. 
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means to collect the broken pieces," he said. 
"It is our duty to these broken parts together, so that they can understand how everything." 
The centre has created the first school paper approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, 75 pages "history of the Democratic Kampuchea." 
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history of the High School of the Education Ministry, fewer than four pages contains about the Khmer Rouge. 
How often in Cambodia to know the young people in Anlong Veng little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's links with the regime. 
Touch Valeak, 19 years, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students to understand an important part of their history. 
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read it. 
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said. 
"They are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people will be condemned by the court." 
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process is complex and complicated, said Sok Leang. 
But the public forums, the school paper, and the court will gain gradually influence," he said. 
Still, the Khmer Rouge here has a powerful attraction. 
Likely leads in the Dangrek mountains, a Strauchs is rampant and plastic waste verdreckter route to a Rechteck of black soot covered with a rusty tin ceiling. 
Pol Pot's body was here after his death in 1998 have been burned on a Reifenhaufen. 
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a cell phone verkäuferin at the roadside, said she does not know much about the man who had been burned here. 
"But he has a strong spirit and many people are going to pray to him," she said. 
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later in the day, they wanted to Pol Pot's final resting place to go where they will take a bush of mature bananas - in the hope that it brings her luck.
