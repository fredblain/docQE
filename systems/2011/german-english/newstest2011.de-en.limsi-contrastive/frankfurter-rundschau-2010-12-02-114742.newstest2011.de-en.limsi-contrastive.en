Controllers in the Zwielicht 
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa is from the experimental industry infiltrated with Genpflanzen. 
Thus, this accusation has now formulated the test biotech expert group, which turned out to be an independent institute to understand the impact of biotechnology. 
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well documented," said Christoph Testbiotech-Chef Then on Wednesday in Munich. 
The head of the EFSA expertengruppe for genetically modified crops, Harry Kuiper, and for years a further EFSA expert are also in the Ilsi lobby organization under contract. 
The corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer paid. 
Kuiper was involved in a major way to the Efsa-Prüfvorschriften for Genpflanzen and am so that in a clear conflict of interest, Then criticized. 
The EFSA rules are marketing methods of viewing the same with the Ilsi position papers and make a contribution so that the imprint of the industry, the real authority in the Italian Parma should be controlled. 
It is already the second time that a representative of the test biotech bemängle. 
This is a senior EFSA managerin recently without conditions or transitional period for the Swiss agricultural company Syngenta - and thus have switched sides. 
Even the Central German radio (MDR) had recently unveiled personnel links between EU authority and industrial lobby, which the Environmental Office, as well as EU policymakers made sympathetic. 
However, the Efsa can see no conflict of interest. 
We refer you back to all the serious data, even in this industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, says in a statement. 
From the experts who work for Efsa, we do not demand that they have no contact with the industry. 
You would have to disclose but this. 
Kuiper gives his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States a. 
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from academia, industry and policy - partly on the risk assessment of biotechnology without lobbying mission. 
In the matter have criticised independent experts such as Then that genetically modified crops currently without any feeding experiments on animals are allowed, and the reaction of Genpflanzen will not be tested on environmental influences. 
"We want to know, for example, genetically modified corn makes on the field," says Then. 
Derzeitige practice is merely isolated proteins, but not to test the whole Genpflanze, what am no reliable results. 
"If the risks are not looking, how is it possible to find them?" asks Then accusatory. 
It also provides Angelika Hilbeck so. 
The scientist in the engineering since 1994 and is currently at the technical university of Zurich are active. 
The industry experiments in this area as in the United States is now also in Europe are increasingly critical scientists to influence or to discredit. 
There were so few researchers who were not intertwined with corporations. 
For business critical studies were not published in the rule. 
"The industry controls the security research," Hilbeck claimed.
