The right mattress and the right bed rost? Women have other aspirations than men 
It is not the tollste bed frame, but the quality of the surface - mattress and make a good bed. 
However, this must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user. 
Many things in the choice to play a role - the weight, size, health, and last but not least, the sex of the Schläfer. 
Equally important is the Interieur mattress and subordinate. 
A typical example? 
In a weekend house, which is not heated on a regular basis, Latexmatratzen are not good, because they need a lot longer, "hot." 
In addition, they are clearly more difficult than usual Polyurethan-Matratzen. 
And - they should be turned on a regular basis. 
If they do not have enough Entlüftungskanälchen in the heart, and still to lie on a solid record humidity, the movement: it is not excluded that is emerging from its mold. 
In the election, of course, also plays a role in which it is used. 
Anyone who wants a longer period of time was abroad, where very high Matratzes with soft layer are normal, hard on a low mattress with hard surfaces can get. 
"Benefit all ice-hockey player who have returned from the NHL, have complained to me that they cannot sleep very well here." 
"For their abgeschundenen shoulders, Fersen and Hüften they simply need a soft layer of Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam - a Formgedächtnis-Polymer)." 
"I would recommend this including sugar sick people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that the" information "from the joints and the skin can receive bad," said Sylva Hadamcziková, which specialises in polster möbel. 
That is why I have a few years ago many ice-hockey players, but also other customers these Matratzes with Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam) concerned. 
"Today, this is not a problem any more, because those Matratzes offers, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico." 
And we should not necessarily be a famous ice-hockey player, in order to appreciate the benefits of the Visco-Schaums. 
This "miracle" works really quite simple. 
The foam optimalisiert its severity and type in accordance with the absorbed heat, or in other words, he is downright schmiegt on warm body. 
There's nowhere else in the night shifts go around like after a heavy battle. 
It simply sleeping a lot better. 
The viskoelastische foam also provides protection against Dekubitus (fire). 
With the election of the matratze size to body size, we should still include the length of the sohles, then approximately 21 to 34 inches. 
Men like Mrs of the 180 cm wide, so need a 210 to 220 cm long bed. 
Each of the Schläfer should be at least 90 cm of width available together so 180 cm. 
In single beds, for example in Singles, 120 to 140 cm are appropriate. 
Furthermore, a comfort and, for the sake even for any visitors. 
Otherwise, the following thumb for the ideal bed band: "If it is on the back, should still have enough room for the easy angewinkelt to be poor," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the zunft model of Polsterer and Raumausstatter, who for many years the issue of healthy sleep and devotes the ergonomics of furniture and this issue also presented at technical schools. 
In a double bed needs every one of his own and his own bed, but be careful with the purchase, so that the Matratzes are equally high. 
Other than that, nothing else other than the Rosts to assembling in differing degrees, and that is not long on each bed frame possible. 
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 inches high, mattresses with stroke skelett 15 inches of it should be at least three centimetres accounted for formal classes and fine cushion. 
"With the hand or in the Hinsetzen you can feel the feathers in any case," warns Helena Prokopová. 
Every mattress requires a special Rosttyp. 
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document how together increased Siamzwillinge in the bedroom to find nothing. 
These Matratzes are not strip and you can't wash, which is already commonplace. 
And since we are in a single night between 0.2 to 0,75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years, becoming a huge (and clogged sieve). 
This is also why experts reject Werbeslogans Matratzes a lifespan of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee promise. 
Each thing has its if and buts. 
So a practical advice from the dealers: when Matratzes of 120 or 140 cm diameter should be the hygiene of the waschbar, abziehbaren salary will not be afraid, nevertheless, it is recommended to use a Matratzenschoner, you can wash and drain slightly. 
Even if today the rule Matratzenbezüge made with Rundumreißverschluss, so that you get two sides after the opening (immensely important for the washing process, and the waschmaschine size!) is the manipulation with larger Matratzes, especially alone exported, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. 
They have to sleep on, rather than a solid record of a Rostes? 
Order! 
Or, at most for a bed for unpopular guests and for a single night. 
Even so, they should be labelled the record would rather Lüftungslöchern (if already are not included) and mattresses with stroke skelett and 15 cm minimum level with so-called pocket stroke nucleus and fine cushion use. 
Polyurethan-Matratzen belong to such a document is not. 
For not verstellbar latte rosts with 14 to 18 stroke play (Lamellen) Latex or sand emphasis mattresses suitable (possibly even combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay Roste with a major latte number, then 28 and more stroke play, with Lordosenstütze in the lende area and the ability to regulate the latte härte. 
At verstellbar Lamellenroste does not include Matratzes with relevant skelett, because they do not respond to the ergonomische pretexts. 
In addition to the suspension of the Steife stroke play will be offered particularly flexible modules. 
This is a particular stroke play, enabling the stroke play einzudrücken or even verwinkeln so that they allow the occasional Einsinken from the back of the Schläfer. 
For men with wide shoulders an important matter. 
There are even matratze makers, which started with "Beatles' mattresses" soft zones to use for the shoulder area. 
I also thought about the ladies - they might be this soft zones in the Hüftgegend. 
For demanding customers are scoring load large guidance systems (Lattoflex) or Roste with scoring burden Kontakt-Pads with so-called Multitorsionsfederung certain. 
The pressure will be distributed on several points, which reduces tension. 
But - if you're on the right mattress and correct a bad (too big and fülliges) head bed used to get the most benefits will be lost. 
Here too a thumb: a bed should be based on the head, its leaders should only go to the shoulders, so that the Schultermuskeln can relax. 
The ideal seems a 50 x 60 cm wide cushion, as for example the Scandinavians might. 
In the situation should head bed (along with the discharge zone in or the soft zone in the bed) to compensate for the shoulder height. 
Something our modern Matratzes with the former (with hay filled) Strohsäcken but common. 
Modern manufacturers increasingly use natural materials, or at least their mixtures. 
Even Matratzes is the new magic word "bio." 
Instead of Erdölrohstoffen used for the manufacture of Polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturell oils - for example Rizinus and soya oil. 
Soy is used by all the well-known manufacturers. 
"Bio says in Matratzes, her heart is pure natural materials," said Petr Vaíek of the company Tropico Plus. 
Naturstoffe are also used in the manufacture of Matratzenbezügen - was one of the first Aloe Vera. 
You can also kapseln the spread of fresh wood or Lavendelduft in sleep, Mr. President. 
Here too it makes a difference between man and woman. 
While the men a "cooling in the existing" plant extract from birke sheets will be used, so that the matratze relationship can absorb the heat and cool the body, the salary for women "current mend" impact. 
Extracts from Red Paprikaschotes stimulate the blood circulation to the weaker sex is wohlig hot during the sleep, Mr. President. 
And the current favorites? 
Mattresses of foam may (he has more Pores with devastated cell structure and is therefore breathing more active than normal Polyurethan and also much more flexible). 
The combination of the various Steife (toughness) arise from Kaltschäumen and Visco-Schäumen Mehr-Zonen-Matratzen who know exactly where head, hip and Fersen are located. 
For a quality mattress, however, has 7 000 kroner and more to fork out £3.3bn. 
Health mattresses but are usually burdened with lower value-added tax, because they are considered to be medical assistance. 
As the first Czech companies this advantage Gumotex has been given. 
You can see on the bed and on to save is not so easy. 
Every now and again there are special offers from manufacturers and distributors, the two mattresses on the price of an offer. 
For example, the trademark offers the mattress Duofreeze Magniflex in verstepptem Visco-Schaum Memory 11 990 CZK. 
The second you get for free. 
It was the material Tempur the era of the viskoelastischen foam with open cell structure and high density in almost cosmic speed. 
Small wonder, then, they have been developed for NASA, because the astronauts are subjected to enormous excess loads on the landing. 
Tempur is a soft warmth, entrenched in a cool environment again. 
For example, it fits perfectly in the human body and distributed in an optimum manner the physical pressure. 
It is therefore not only ideal for the prevention of printing brandy, but generally increased the sleeping comfort. 
Viskoelastische foam but not only Matratzes but also for other health products, such as special Fußpolstern used the legs and will provide the equipment relief. 
Local manufacturers use, for example, the foam Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
