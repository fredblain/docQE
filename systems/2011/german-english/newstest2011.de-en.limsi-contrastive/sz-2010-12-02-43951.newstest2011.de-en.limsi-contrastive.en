Puzzle Erdarbeiten 
The International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence to a secret nuclear program in Syria. 
The country does, however, to comment - still leaves it controls. 
Mr. President, around midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007 will jump at least four Israeli F-15 i warplanes a mysterious, würfelförmiges building in Syria. 
It is on the banks of the Tigris; the next major town, 30 miles away, is Dair as-Saur. 
Your name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor to Syria, allegedly with help from North Korea has built in the Quader, hidden in a valley of the stream. 
According to a briefing from the CIA, US-Auslandsgeheimdienstes by the end of April 2008 would be well under the name of the near village el-Kibar familiar reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium - which could be employed to build nuclear weapons. 
For other purposes hardly worth the technology from the fifties. 
The CIA has led a video presentation with vague satellite imagery. 
Per computer they ignored a animation which components of the reactor should be have been before the destruction of a smaller copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyong nuclear center is. 
They also presented photographs showing the building from the vicinity or even the interior compartment. 
The reactor was briefly stood before the beginning of the operation, it was said, but has not yet been drawn up with fuel rods. 
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more aware than it was then, of course, the mystery has been even wider with the passage of time. 
Former US President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoir that the CIA was fairly safe before the attack that Syria has built a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly evidence saw that in the country, "an active nuclear weapons program existed." 
Some intelligence officers in Europe, there are more cautious prefer to see and speak only of an "alleged reactor," even if they CIA-Präsentation to keep "plausible." 
You lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. 
What we need, as I am sure he was a nuclear reactor, a high UN-Diplomat replied only flat over the summer, the IAEA was "enough material to ask questions." 
According to the rubble of the alleged "ungenutzten Militärgebäudes" the Syrian authorities rushed to one side and thoroughly planierten the terrain. 
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by the former chief inspector Olli hein in el-Kibar traces of uranium had been produced by people. 
In addition, the IAEA received commercial providers of a Member State satellite images directly from the time after the attack, which should be more powerful than the CIA. 
However, these recordings are not to get on the market, because the unknown purchaser - perhaps Israel - she has bought the exclusive. 
Therefore, the IAEA could not independently verify its authenticity. 
Syria has always declared, never pursued a secret nuclear program or a reactor built. 
The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, Damascus said. 
But the IAEA indicated that, according to analysis of particles as unlikely back. 
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss - just as it did about the satellite imagery. 
In addition, it denied the inspectors access to a second inspection in el-Kibar and the rubble of bombed-out buildings. 
But Israel also says the iron. 
"We never comment on ', recently reiterated at the time of the attack incumbent Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, the official position. 
So the investigation of the case since June 2008 in vain, "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority," as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - after all, a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area, about which the IAEA monitoring. 
As a key to progress in resolving the IAEA appears to be three more bodies, "functional contact" with the alleged reactor should - and unlike those still exist. 
In doing so, the inspectors have neither disclosed which assets it is still what role they are or what they can appear to be suspicious. 
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they will be on the IAEA internal as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah called in turn derived from nearby towns. 
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and at satellite images tracked down a building complex in Masyaf, where it is most likely is one of the suspicious objects. 
It is probably in or adjacent to a military base - exactly with this justification, Syria denied the IAEA access to the three places. 
In Vienna, it says, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be vorgeschickt by the United States, auszuspähen at military installations. 
Because the Nukleardetektive were caused by a piece of the US intelligence agencies learned. 
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three locations and the Quader material on the Tigris, was transported. 
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could "in connection with the fuel production." 
But there is "no indication of sensitive activities" so uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes which are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons. 
The type of reactor is operated with uranium is not enriched. 
But where the uranium could have come from and where it has turned into at a later date should be separated plutonium for the bomb, these central issues if anything, there are plausible assumptions. 
It is also unclear whether debris, which could involve valuable clues in the three places were stored. 
When would the hundreds Lastwagenladungen disappeared from the ground, no one wants to have information on where the rubble has remained. 
The only a few kilometres from el-Kibar located on the other side of the Tigris salt mine in al-Tibni, Syria in 1998 on their suitability as a storehouse for radioactive waste has been analysed, the IAEA is regarded as unlikely. 
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley she was recently in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor in mid-afternoon. 
Photographs from orbit show, however, that Syria in three suspicious places Erdarbeiten and large containers, after the IAEA access had requested. 
This cannot be coincidence, but has contributed little to dispel the suspicion. 
It is also in diplomatic circles, the IAEA had spent a number of months to develop a plan for inspections there, Syria should allow to maintain any military secrets - only the tape shows how great the interest of the inspectors. 
Meanwhile, Damascus also bügelte this proposal. 
Although Western diplomats in Vienna before a year to appease the reactor was destroyed, the matter was therefore no urgency, brings about US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months the so-called special inspection into the game, one of the strongest funds that has the Vienna nuclear agency to enforce controls. 
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, which should propose these inspections, has been " an option for which I am open in the future ', even though he hesitates. 
There is a high risk in this way: first, it needs for a majority in the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and a number of the 35 countries represented are anything but eager for an escalation. 
On the other hand, as a diplomat to bear in mind: "What if they find nothing in the end?"
