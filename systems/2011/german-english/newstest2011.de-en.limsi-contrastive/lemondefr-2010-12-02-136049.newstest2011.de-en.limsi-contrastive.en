Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediating role for Syria 
More than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, considered the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher in Iran has been detained for "espionage," the French public in suspense left the diplomacy on alert, and akzentuierte the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran. 
All this under the attentive eyes of diplomats from the United States. 
The WikiLeaks received and by the newspaper "Le Monde" seen American documents give some background to this crisis price. 
You describe how the Elysée Americans had declared its strategy, which went as far as this advice for dealing with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of Wanderers). 
They show how the French people in charge have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman not the release of Majid Kakavand, a France detained and of the American justice system as a result of trade with material for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme ' Iranians voted for Gegeleistung. 
Finally, they put the manner in which the French Presidency to manipulate the media to the purpose has tried this idea to convince Syrian President Bachar al Assad took a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a harsh light. 
In truth, he had not done anything in this regard. 
One in Paris on 12 August 2009 redigiertes diplomatic telegram of condolences bears the title "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostage-taking." 
François Richier, the Elysée adviser in strategic issue, kept in the accompaniment of Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay in North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone. 
They told her the French method. 
The Americans urged to do everything possible to make their own nationals back to bring the violent in Iran would be recorded. 
"Power noise," she said, "loud and clear, articulate and endlessly," the words ' fundamental human rights ,"" innocence ,"" immediate release " in the media. 
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which respects very sensitive to his image. 
"Betreibt all the more so, especially if you ask the Iranians not to do." 
The fact is that "silence solves nothing" over the discussion experiments on unobtrusive way, the Iranians are "masters in prevarication." 
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners a ' normal, Iranian tactic: "Kidnapping for the purpose of political blackmail." 
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from the prison (which should be reached on 16 August, on the day on which she takes refuge in French embassy) "demand the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (230 000 million). 
And it can be reported, the display antizipiere more hostage-taking, a phenomenon which "will worsen." 
The Iranians could "in the near future, another of the roughly 1 800 French nationals living in Iran," he said. 
28 August 2009. 
Clotilde Reiss 12 days ago has been released from prison, but will continue to be detained in Iran. 
An information was circulated: the Iranians Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States because of illegal trade in sensitive electronics materials to Iran, demand after ruling by a judge in Paris has been released from prison. 
The US Embassy is like many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence. 
For Washington, which is the illegal Iranian networks followed the acquisition of the material provided for the nuclear program is a bad news for the release of Majid Khakavand. 
France has taken a horse-trading in purchase? 
The liberation of the Iranians against the logic of the French? 
During another interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September François Richier assured that this was not the case. 
The display, as he says, was not only "quite surprised by the decision of the judges," but also tried to resist. 
"It was a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French justice minister given" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government could not change the judicial decision," he says. 
Mr. Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand still under "strict" supervision of the French secret service says. 
The Elysée adviser chooses a telephone number, again, then informed the American diplomat, the Iranians "are currently in the buildings, led by the Iranian embassy in Paris." 
While in the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the display does not save his efforts, through statements and by the media of organized "flight testing" believe Syrian President Bachar al Assad plays an "important" and "influential mediation." 
The Americans are watching this activity is not without irony and note that the manipulation is bearing fruit, since several articles reflect the official French version. 
A telegram datierendes on 25 August 2009 evokes "the media blitz of the French authorities." 
What is based so much "thanks" towards Mr. Assad, wonders the Paris embassy. 
"Despite their declarations, full of Lobpreis, the French authorities privately admit that they only have a vague idea about what the Syrians have actually done." 
The document then addresses the reasons which led to the Elysée to plumb this fiction. 
The intensive communication efforts "aimed at Sarkozy's policy of openness towards Syria to confirm," he analysed. 
A 2008 launched policies, then "many critical votes in France and abroad as premature and undeserved perceptions." 
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" testing Paris "Syria to remember which laud it can achieve by it plays a constructive role in the region." 
The aim is also to "discord between Syria and Iran." 
The American Embassy knows this from a good source. 
On 11 August Francois Richier had entrusted her: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians whatever they have done." 
"But we have nevertheless thanked them." 
"This should at least create confusion on the part of the Iranians." 
Clotilde Reiss is returning to France on 16 May 2010 back. 
Nicolas Sarkozy will receive it in the display. 
In a statement he would like to thank the President of Brazil, of Senegal and Syria for its "active role in favour of the release of our compatriot."
