Durchgesickertes US-Dokument Moscow as a haven for corruption 
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and they are a part of the bribes and the protective benefits they einsammelt on the Kremlin. This reported in February, the US Embassy in Russia in a memo. 
Both police and the state security service blackmail high protection money, so that they can keep their expensive living in Moscow, it says. 
They not only collect money from legitimate business, but also by organized criminal gangs. 
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as a "vertical authority" - takes its part of the money, which, according to the top of the ladder. 
The memo under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was sent to Washington, was on Tuesday by Wikileaks published on its website. 
The memo was based on sources, whose names were edited. 
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov still Moscow's mayor was, and it accused him of corruption. 
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that had been cleaned up in the meantime. 
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, a well-known operator has over the years makes repeatedly rejected, and he has won numerous libel actions against such accusations. 
He told a Russian TV channel in September, when he was asked for a documentary, which suggests that he was corrupt: "It is crazy, it is a dirty, dirty." 
A huge number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. The surveys show. 
But it is unusual that, as has happened in the report of the ambassador, individual persons, and it is heard that this is done by a diplomat from a foreign country. 
"The direct link with the government in Moscow with the crime has meant that some of them as" disturbed "and come to the conclusion that the government is acting as a Kleptokrat rather than a government," as the memo. 
"Criminal elements enjoy a" kryshna " (a term from the world of criminals and the mafia, which literally" umbrella " or protection means) on the police, the Public Safety (FSB), the service supervisor (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor onscreen as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy. 
Experts have discovered a dreilagige structure inside the criminal world of Moscow. 
"Luzhkov is uppermost." 
"The FSB, the MVD and militia on the second stage." 
"Finally, followed by the perfectly ordinary criminals and criminal inspectors at the bottom." 
"This is an incompetent system, where criminal groups fill a gap in some areas, because the city is offering no assistance." 
The report says further that the FSB money received by the biggest companies and the police small businessmen have been arrested. 
One source, so it is, "said that Moscow shopkeepers to understand that it is best to protect the MVD and FSB to get (and not by the organized crime), because they are not only more weapons, resources and power than criminals, but also because they are protected by the law." 
"For this reason, the protection by criminal gangs, not more sought-after as before." 
The memo noted that while the collection of the money is fully protected even very modest no; even those who pay are sometimes arrested. 
The same people who do not pay, find their business very quickly closed - on the basis of one or other excuse. 
Medvedev spoke several times to combat corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress. 
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men with suitcases, which were presumably full with money, go in the Kremlin. 
"In its fight against corruption Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said named Georgy, who Satarov, director of by a Moscow expert commission recently in an interview. 
"But it is part of this tape." 
"It is not a part of the political class as a political class no longer exists in Russia." 
Without a politician without an opposition, without a separation of powers, as he says that corruption is inevitable. 
Nationwide, as estimated by the corruption is costing Russia, more than 300 Dollar billion per year. 
The country is ranked 154, a recent study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparence International (the countries "least corrupt" to "most corrupt" listed). 
The revelation of the Memos of the American Embassy, which after Moscow time late in the evening was done, it will certainly be sorry cause within the Russian government, though, because Luzhkov can be blamed for the errors of Moscow, the Kremlin may also be an opportunity to claim that one answer to the problems. 
In an interview with Larry King on CNN stated Putin that the WikiLeaks-Dokumente might be a forgery and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats him Batman and Medvedev Robin said. 
"The truth is that our interaction is an important factor of internal politics in this country," he said. 
"But to be honest, we had not expected that this would happen with such arrogance, such pressure and such unethical way, you know."
