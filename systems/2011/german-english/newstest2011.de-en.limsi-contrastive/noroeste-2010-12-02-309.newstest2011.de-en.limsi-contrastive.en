With the reform of the Organgesetzes of the Congress will introduce the two-party system, they complain. 
It is the 60th legislature had begun, and already installed an opposition bloc, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergència and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented himself as an Independent. The four posed the following question: the arrival of the 'Zweiparteiensystems ' in the chamber. 
Before the start of the opening session in the 60th legislature wetterten Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergència, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo against the reform of the Organgesetzes, because they would be excluded. 
With this reform, they repeated, would be a 'Zweiparteiensystem ' was introduced, because now there were two people, the same number as parties who controlled the Congress. 
These four MEPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only against the Panisten Salvador Lopez Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as deputy chairman cited Bureau agreed. 
Corvera Quevedo said that the PRI and PAN parties institutional with these reforms had been introduced its political fringe equality. 
He led them in the next few days with the representatives of PAN and PRI would speak in order to change the system, and they went out of its political will and if they hadn't, they were again subjugated by both parties, by which the opposition coalition would put an end to it. 
"Far I come (opposition coalition), which is what I see, because we are excluded from all Entscheids, not even to Rücksichte, to take into account the opinion of the rest." 
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergència said there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that is why a diverse group would be formed. 
It cannot be permitted, he continued, that the Congress after he was monopolistic, now should be 'duopolistisch'. 
"It is not the spirit of legislative reform in Congress an eternal two-party system must prevail." 
"For the beginning of this group begins with five Members and they speak with other colleagues, so that they will be more," said the convergencia member. 
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza led by the PT in allusion to PAN and PRI, that the Congress is currently in a 'Beute ' have turned for two. 
"Before, it was just a party, they now share this second." 
Patrón Montalvo, asked the members to respect and give them their place at the negotiating tables. 
"It should not be on the basis of five top choices, which will probably be nine members will ignore. The five, which is currently seen as broken up into different groups have decided to unite to adopt our place at the negotiating table, because he reform of the others has been carried out and agreed that we are out there remained, and we do not agree with this reform."
