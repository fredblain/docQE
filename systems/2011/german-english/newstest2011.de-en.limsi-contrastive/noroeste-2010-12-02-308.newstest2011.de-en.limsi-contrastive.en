NASA announces the discovery außerirdischen life 
The American space agency called a press conference, a vorzustelle a discovery so tomorrow, the impact on the search for living creatures in all. 
The national air and Space Agency (NASA) of the United States tomorrow, Thursday, a astrobiologische discovery well known, the außerirdischen life could confirm the theory of the existence. 
The Fund will be tomorrow at 1pm at a press conference at the headquarters of NASA in Washington, presented by experts from the Astrobiologie. It is a science, the origin, development, distribution and the future of life in the universe examined. 
In convening the press conference, the NASA assured they will be "a aufsichts of regulatory built by the Fund for the search for outside life" imagine what speculation in experts from other countries. 
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments, which has so far been deemed unbwohnbar human-like creatures can exist. It raised the possibility that these intelligent creatures - as people - could turn if their living conditions improved. 
It seems that it is a microbe at the bottom of the mono Lake in Yosemite-Nationalpark, California, has been found, and living in an environment of toxic for all kinds of life forms have been kept, since the lake is severely arsenhaltig. 
In one way or another, the Mikrobie used the arsenic than survival resource. Given this ability to increase the chances that it on other planets, which do not possess our protective atmosphere may be similar lives. 
If these organisms verstoffwechseln the arsenic is in accordance with the Astrobiologen proved that "it is really a different way of life, a second way of life, we know different." 
The space agency is tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference will know the real scope of her discovery. 
At the conference, the Geobiologin Pamela Conrad are participating, which investigated the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, the Titan (the largest moon Saturns) under the question of whether its chemical composition is similar to that of the Earth.
