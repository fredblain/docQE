What should they do the SSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "Konditorei." 
The new Ratsherrs of capital from the ranks of the SSD will obviously have to overcome some language barriers, with their alt-neu colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and city representation at all able to understand. 
The newspaper Aktuáln.Cz members of the new Council of SSD times a little "abgeklopft," as they dominate the notorious slang that has become common practice in recent years, in which the current coalition partners in Prague have been at the helm. 
The encoded vocabulary in the elapsed era of Mayor Pavel Bém was introduced by the Prague political elite, some of the best-known actors, situations and Causae. 
Surprisingly, it became clear that the new councils in relation to these new terms somewhat in the dark. 
They say that, at least. 
"Who is Voldemort?" 
"No idea." 
"I am more a newcomer in the Prague policy," responded Luká Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, the test of the "Paten-Wortschatzes." 
But it is also the councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar way. 
As an example to the term "golf hole." 
"This is the only expression of which you are presenting me here, I occasionally use." 
"Otherwise, I do not think a lot of slang." 
From the vocabulary, the daily newspaper Aktuáln.Cz in this year's June before the electoral congress of the ODS was published, the editors pickte six concepts, it turned out, especially those that are notoriously associated with the Prague government. 
The Social Democrats should the terms "Voldemort," "greatest Prague golf hole," "go in the Konditorei," " nacken ," " betrayal of the capital " and " verblechen " define. 
Three Prague Ratsherrs agreed the test on the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - first promised his participation in the meeting, then less than the listeners. 
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, the test was rejected from the outset. 
"These things have given me no matter how the Civic Democrats and chatting with each other about it, I am not passing judgement." 
"I think it is important, as we understand in the context of our programmes," he countered. 
As already indicated, would have been Luká Kaucký in the abovementioned headline allegedly not recognized by the influential businessman and friend of the Ex-Oberbürgermeister Bém, Roman Janouek of the speech. 
The term "Voldemort," Kaucky says nothing at all and the only word he was erriet correct on the test, "the main Prague golf hole." 
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, to safety but added: "But the more I know from the newspaper." 
And jokingly: "I am probably a language course requirement." 
The "golf hole" will not only of matador Karel Březina, but also from the town councillor for the Environment Luká Plachý right as a Blanka tunnel through the entziffert. 
Both Social Democrats but also know for whom the term Voldemort stands and Luká Plachý idea even where to find this character, and thereby also what it means, "to go in the Konditorei." 
"I think that is to say, to go into any Prague catering industry" is pretty Plachý close to the solution to the problem, if you know that this is the seat of Janoueks firms. 
However, in line with Březina but he claimed that this knowledge is more likely to have accessed from the newspaper, than for him this vocabulary would own. 
According to the Testteilnehmern judging by, it seems really under the Social Democrats have no similar popular slang. 
"I asked my colleagues as well, but obviously there is something we are really not." 
"We call upon us by name, occasionally even using words or colorful names," says the chairman of the Prague SSD Petr Hulínský - of his party peers loosely "Hulda." 
"I was in school Bíza (Birke) called, but I do not know whether my colleagues also called" Karel Březina tells us his nickname of. 
The newspaper Deník Aktuáln.Cz has tried out the name and behold - he works. 
Weinert councillor for the party allies and friendly "one's grandfather" or less friendly to the "old" Representative Miroslav Poche before the elections by activity in the party sponsorship drew attention from some colleagues "Igráek" (renowned Czech do figure) mentioned. 
Colorful names as the only the Social Democrats in the intra-Party parlance permit. 
Hulínský, it may not be alleged if it "Hulda," but Deník Aktuáln.Cz registered yet another nickname of the Prague chairman. 
His nickname of "doctor Gummiknüppel-Rechte" was supposed to do that Petr Hulínský its title Doctor juris has acquired in the Bratislaver police academy.
