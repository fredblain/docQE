Two L-159 training aircraft for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain 
There are two easy fighter aircraft L-159 from a total of five, the Czech Defense Ministry has exchanged against the Casa aircraft carrier C-295M on Tuesday in the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS sets. 
It is the first time that machines of this type in possession of a foreign army. 
Abroad, they were only for exercises or air shows to see. 
It is the airline capable two-seats version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army. 
The other three planes are einsitzige L-159. 
These are still einkonserviert in the Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the company Omnipol - they last week accepted. 
When they expediert the aircraft physical Vodochody, Jan Pejek, according to the spokesman of the Defense Department is still not known. 
The einsitzigen fighter plane L-159, in turn, have been singled out for long-term stored aircraft, and that without further deposits and investments on the part of the department of the ministry. 
"The double seats L-159T1 were exchanged in the current situation and appearance," said Pejek of the newspaper Právo. 
He added that the army will not have to live without zweisitzige fighter aircraft as the Defense Department in May 2009, with Aero Vodochody a 200 million contract on the conversion of four superfluous L-159 on two-seats version signed. 
A new aircraft, the army took over in July, the second if it wants to play until the end of this year. 
According to Pejek EADS has committed warplanes in the equipment of the NATO countries to impose. 
"The treaty is clearly pointed out that the company EADS aircraft L-159 customers and that those on the training of pilots of the NATO countries are supposed to serve. 
"It is therefore up to the buyer, in what way he realised the matter," Pejek. 
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159. 
The barter of five L-159 against a Casa aircraft carrier and the purchase of further aircraft for 3.5 billion kronor was in the past year by the government of Mirek Topolánek has been approved. 
The Defense Ministry had tendered for purchase any bidding process, but spoke EADS directly. 
The former Defence Office argued that this exchange will support the future export of L-159 abroad. 
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, which they used only 24, they wanted to sell the rest. 
The acquisition of the Casa aircraft should also have a judicial sting. 
The European Commission sued the Czech Defense Ministry: at the European Court of Justice. The reason? it would have been the aircraft on the basis of a European call for tenders to choose and not by a single manufacturer. 
The army has already adopted three planes, the final is within 14 days at the Airport Kbely land.
