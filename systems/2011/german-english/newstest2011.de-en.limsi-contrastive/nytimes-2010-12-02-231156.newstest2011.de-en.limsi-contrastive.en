Cheshire on Twitter draws attention 
A half-dozen of them tippten in the riots in the courtroom. 
They verschickten in their reports on Twitter of gruesome testimony. 
In the end, as the defense, there were more than 140 000 Twitter-Meldungen on trial for rape and gekettete children in beds in a house, the flare-up. 
On Thursday the closely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was charged with three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to have killed an official end, when the judgment on the death sentence, which the jury pronounced falls. 
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted requests submitted in court, explain the reasons for an appeal and the courts for years. 
It is one of the most provozierend reasons that it through the intense coverage of the trial - even with the extensive use of Twitter by average reporter - into a "circus atmosphere" and a more widespread immediately penetration aufr端hrerischer details came, so that the jury in an improper manner had been influenced by the public outrage. 
This appeal could prompt the Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question whether the new technologies, new rules are needed in the courtroom. 
"As I have seen during this process, I believe that it is really a danger, if the arrival of new technologies in the courtroom, the right of each individual affected to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes main defenders. 
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue by the Supreme Chamber of Appeal rejected the requests last week by ruling succinct back when he said that the New Media "carefully controlled" would, and that there is no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions. 
But it was certainly not the last word in this matter. 
For decades Gerichtseinspr端che have noted that the coverage of notorious cases of doubt on the fairness of a trial. 
In his historic decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, which is supposed to have killed his wife, lifted and said in its ruling that because the new media with a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" would have been. 
Some believes that the TV show and the movie "on the flight" is based on this crime. 
Some lawyers say, Gerichtseinspr端che, which Mr. Hayes conviction be seen half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary to ensure the channels of communication from the courtroom at the time of the case, Dr Sheppard was unimaginable to regulate. 
"There is a good reason, about the impact of new media in trials, which will be followed by a broad public to be concerned," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut, but his report also says that it will be imposed arbitrarily. 
Professor Donohue said, some Appelationsgerichte may be intrigued by the idea that the restriction of immediately communication from the courtroom, it turned out, could make the trials fairer. 
The Twitter affair is just one of many who set out by Mr. Hayes lawyers to discuss a number of years and thus delay a condemnation. 
For example, the defense lawyers also claim that Mr. Hayes may already have been vorverurteilt as a judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential Jurors, by giving them showed gruesome Tatortfotos during the juror selection. 
Some have said the Jurors photos of the victim, Jennifer hawke petit 48 years, and their T端chter, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, they would have met with disgust. 
The protesters say they were also questioning the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judges have mistakenly exchanged a jury, which has been a critic of the prosecutor, and that he had exerted undue pressure on the ruling, as he had taken the unusual decision to ask the jury free over the weekend. 
The Jurors were not isolated. 
But their arguments about the impact of the extensive reporting about the process prefers perhaps the greatest interest. 
In a anfechtung, which have submitted them last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and has been discussed by the candidates for the U.S. Senate. 
They argued that the New Media continuously had rekindled the flames of the emotions of the case. 
"Such a daily crush of media piepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," wrote the lawyers, "it has been previously in New Haven, and perhaps even nationwide have yet to be seen." 
Your emphasis on the reporting by Twitter is controversial. 
Some journalists have said in interviews that the assertion that these direct messages are rabble-rousing but as reports, which will be reimbursed at a slower rate, is a technikfeindlicher glance, the verarme reporting on future processes. 
But some lawyers said, Appelationsgerichte would often faced with the argument, social and technological changes, the Adaptation sidelined by the courts. 
Mr. Hayers lawyers to strengthen this assertion. 
In her appeal, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the conviction of Dr Sheppard was removed as a result of the reporting and made it clear that the New Media new rules require. 
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
