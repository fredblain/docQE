More and more parents want to Menschen-Überwachungsgeräte, in order to have the kids under control 
The fear for one's children is growing more and more parents, so consider them via GPS to monitor. 
The system, originally invented on the tracing of cars is equally good people, which would also be helpful in such cases, such as recently in the mysterious disappearance of nine-year-old Anika Janatková. 
The device is about as big as a cigarette packet but soon it should be no bigger than a wristwatch. 
Many people in the case of the missing Anika in fear and funk, and so do the ways to better protect their children. 
Even for the price of a deterioration of their privacy. 
"We try to tell everybody that this is by no means be overlooked is spying on, but an effective means to reduce the likelihood that it comes on top of the tragedy," leads Petr Pilin of the society Macro because one of the suppliers of GPS-Ortungsgeräten on the Czech market. 
"I admit that it is in the unique to the abuse of such devices will be able to come, for example, when someone it is steeped in the pocket, without that it knows, but we have had no such cases have been recorded." 
"Most customers buy it really for security reasons," adds Pilin to add. 
In his opinion, the child but always know what the purpose of the "box" and how they are being used in the event of an emergency. 
The child psychologin Dana Boková, however, suggests that a child, if such a thing may not wear his simple emptied. 
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately lose certain things, if they do not want to be controlled." 
"Even from the mobile phones set initially great expectations with the parents, but they are just as easy as this new surveillance equipment," says Ms. Boková. 
In your opinion, is also a contentious issue, whether such a body would help in the event of an actual attack. 
"The kidnappers on planned kidnappings controlled virtually always, whether the child any electronics, with which it could be located." 
"Today it is the mobile phone." 
"If such monitoring devices wider use, they would also seek them, because their sales would be accompanied by massive advertising." 
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist. 
But she acknowledges that similar devices in a sudden attack by a paedophile may be helpful. 
Roberta ech of the society RC monitoring, according to the tracking services both for automobiles, as well as for people offering, can the existence of this kind of equipment to help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack. 
"The machine is really stop the respective position at certain intervals." 
"Even if it would be destroyed immediately, at least, is the last position of the person at your disposal." 
"When we integrated more expensive equipment is actually a neigung knife, which is to say, if you hinfällt and bewegungslos breaks, the device instantly sends a warning under indication of the position," claimed Mr. ech. 
In his opinion, similar services could also smart mobile phones with navigation perform, you need only a einzuspielen special software. 
The problem with the current positioning tools is that either it is equipment in streichholzschachtel size, the supporters are similar or smaller mobile phones. 
As always there is the risk that they will lose. 
Mr. Pilin of the Macro because, according to test it in the present devices look like normal Digitaluhrs. 
"This has the advantage that the possible aggressor must realise that not even a surveillance or radar gear. 
"Or he can see the first after a certain period of time, which gives the police a time advantage," he adds. 
No matter what direction the development - towards tags or trailers, still using the same technology as the vehicle tracking. 
So the combination of radar function with the help of the GPS-Systems (as in Ms. in the car) and the function of a mobile phone, which operates the current position.
