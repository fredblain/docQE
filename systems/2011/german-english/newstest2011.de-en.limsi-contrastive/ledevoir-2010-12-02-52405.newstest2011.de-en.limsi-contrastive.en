Global plan for the renewal of the lighting 
The UN has a plan yesterday in Cancún for the renewal of the lighting from households, commerce and industry in 100 countries in terms of achieving a reduction of greenhouse gases (CFCs) proposed nearly a third of the additional reduction is in line with that must be implemented in order to stabilize the earth's climate by 2020. 
This ambitious plan takes his position in the step of specific projects, a UN in Cancun hopes to implement by the absence of compelling reduction commitments to compensate for the developed countries. 
After the yesterday put forward a plan that would be the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the CFCs emitted as a result of the lighting on the planet to be avoided, if the white hot pears, which still has a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market by fluoreszierend or, better still, by diodes (LED) would be replaced. 
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. 
This equates to an equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet. 
In Copenhagen last year had the major emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, was committed to a voluntary Reduktionsplänen, the global fckw emissions from 53 to 49 Gt downsized Gt should. 
From this record, we should still deduct 5 Gt from now until the year 2020 climate rises at 2 degrees Celsius to stabilise in order to avoid that this control. 
In the white hot pears 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% to produce the light. 
With the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, reduced with the new LED bulbs this energy again twice. 
The Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen hold on average between 6 000 to 10 000 hours. 
The new LED bulbs, such as those which the manufacturer Philips has brought this week on the market - this society has participated in the study undertaken - have a life expectancy of 25 000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a weißglühende pear, which auswechselung plan gives a hint of the savings, which is supposed to be used in 100 countries. 
In addition to the fact that iese novel light bulbs only make very little heat, they can also work with a set widerstand. 
And they do not contain any mercury. 
Several specialists have shown that Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves to run because they mercury and that they therefore must as a toxic waste dump, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except which producers constitute a Bring Centre available. 
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not, however, the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, according to the report, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit significantly more mercury, the electricity is being wasted by the White fiery oranges to produce. 
Alone in the United States encounter these coal plants 25 000 tons of mercury annually. 
The report sets out in detail the profits, which would generate each country thanks to this international programme. 
Indonesia would such a billion dollars a year on the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2 is saved, which means an equivalent of 3.5 Kohlekraftwerken, whose spiritual Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
