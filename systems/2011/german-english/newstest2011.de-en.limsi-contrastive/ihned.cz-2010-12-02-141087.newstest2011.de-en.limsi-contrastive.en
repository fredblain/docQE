An opinion poll, removing the nonsensical rules 
The poll by the "absurdity of the year" for the fourth time part of the business competition. 
Some unreasonable rules already managed to create from the world. 
On the dubious winner of the next year of the poll "absurdity of the Year" has the duty to provide documents to authorities available online. 
Thus decided more than a third of not quite four thousand voting abgebe built by the entrepreneurs. 
For example, the social insurance administration demanded a paper auszug from the trade register, even if it had been the official can be accessed by two click of a mouse. 
Thanks to the poll, this is now changing. 
"The Czech social insurance administration will in future control of Sozialversicherungszahlern no longer require extracts from the register," led the SSZ spokeswoman Jana Buraová. 
Sense and purpose of the poll "absurdity of the year," it is under the microscope all rules and orders to comply with the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and lift the unreasonable. 
This is the year for the fourth time part of a business competition, by the tsch. Economic newspaper (HN) will be held and enjoys a growing popularity in the eyes of the public. 
If in the last year of three thousand people took part in the vote this year, there were already four thousand. 
Small wonder, then, because there is still a lot of statutory obligations, the only and only serve to hamper business activity. 
"What, for example, the number of Einkommenssteuerformulare are concerned, we are taking a front rank in the world, a" noted Karel Havlíek of the association of small and medium-size companies and sectors driving the Czech Republic. 
The simplification of the business in recent years, the stated aim of all governments. 
Compared to the world the situation has hardly improved in the Czech Republic. 
According to the World Bank will take in the Czech Republic in relation to the rank of a business conditions, as compared to a worse place for eight seats. 
The competition of the year has been declared for the first time in the year, and plays each year for the same scenario. 
Everyone can from April to the print of the competition at the end of September, notify administrative and bureaucratic nonsense. 
As regards the inscription serves the website address is invited. Firmaroku.cz. after that seeks the organisers of the competition seven candidates for the "anti-pornography price" and leaves the public online on the website www.europa.eu.int. firmaroku.cz/ absurdita and www.europa.eu.int. ihned.cz vote. 
It takes the one absurdity, which receives the most votes. 
In order to this year's poll were already more than a hundred, or more precisely 105 senseless rules and orders registered. 
The tips come not only from employers but also by professional associations and journalists. 
Among the nominated "via a list" of the competition are also a number of provisions, for instance, that maintenance vehicles on highways and rapid road tolls to pay or that employers with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets must vorrichten every two years. 
The list of the year's "Seven" is published on the sides of the competition. 
The announcement of the competition each time at the beginning of November on Prague's Wenceslas Square is part of a Happenings, which also regular people participate in the political and public life. 
This year was, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-size companies and sectors driving the Tsch. Republic, and Petr Kuel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Tsch. Republic at the height of the competition with the game. 
"Where the state raises the employers stick between the legs, there can be no true economic recovery, so it is my goal every year for at least thirty paragraphs to lift the now entrepreneurs still unnecessarily complicate their operations," stated Martin Kocourek, the minister for industry and trade. 
The effort to create unreasonable orders from the rest of the world, to show effect. 
In 2007 rankled people most entrepreneurs imposed duty, the Gewerbeamt in the place of its permanent company three days in advance will have to notify the intention with an exhibition subject to an exhibition or Kirmes drive to want. 
This obligation has been lifted the force of a Gewerbegesetzes series. 
The duty, which in 2007 received the second-largest number of votes - the duty, the Labour Office missions of employees amounting to 30 days of reporting, and it was through the law on them so-called "green card" abolished. 
And - of all good things are three: 
With regard to the absurdity of the 2009 regulation was elected, the physical therapists in the empty room with a mirror, a refrigerator and two Personenwaagen. 
The health ministry, this regulation has been somewhat alleviated this year - fell on refrigerators requirement.
