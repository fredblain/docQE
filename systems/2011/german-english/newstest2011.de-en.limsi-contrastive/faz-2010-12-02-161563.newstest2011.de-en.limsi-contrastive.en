The Eis-Universität 
At the 'Gelato University' in Bologna Eiskonditoren be prepared for better seasons. 
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest pool of recruits and visitors from all over the world. 
What is really the whole ice? 
From the Gelatiere and the Gelataio. 
The Gelatiere German somewhat archaic Eiskonditor after all the rules, is the cream of the Italian Eisma royal art ago. 
The Gelataio old with a Spachtel ice cream from the freezer counter that it is cutting into the Waffel and then sold them. 
In order to know that we must not after Anzola dell'Emilia drive in the province of Bologna. 
But who would like to know more about ice, which is not in the "gelato university" by the Italian firm Carpigiani over. 
The Eis-Universität manufacturer of Eismaschines set up in 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines in every corner of the high Italian ideals. 
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest pool of recruits and visitors from all over the world. 
But there are also started Spezialkurss around lost Schokoladeneis and internships in the domestic Eisdiele. 
Some dreams in the midlife crisis of a new career, other cars simply backing the treacherous ice of their vague aspirations. 
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil on Hungary to Saudi Arabia. 
Jacky, art teachers from California, loves the food movement and wants to be in the country of industrial Ice-Cream a European quality product to offer in the future. 
Anke from Berlin, business adviser and wants after years in a nerve-racking job a bit eintüten. 
Two young Egyptians dream to open an Eisdiele in Cairo. 
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Yulia comes as Italian ice cream to love their children. 
Luciano Maestro-Gelatiere Ferrari, the participants initially said the ideal characteristics for the perfect ice cream. 
The key is not only good taste, but also the seidig fluidity and good consistency. 
Luciano forgets his training but also not the icing on the cake of the national and even südländischen superstructure: ' By Gelato is simply the best - and then there is still plenty of romanticism." 
The first step towards the manufacture seems quite simple. 
Luciano repeals the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a large Mixgerät with an electronic programme everything at 85 degrees heated and then immediately to four degrees cooler. 
Then he turns on the machine turning off a tap in and out of this mess is a white base cream, foundation for all the milk eiss. 
As the teacher bestürmt with questions: can you ice cream only produce with natural substances without agent? 
How can you own experimental free course? 
Luciano warns the Zeitgeist mislead. 
Who of ice cream "only" speech from natural ingredients, has possibly yet stabilisers used - usually a natural product, such as Guarkernmehl from Guarbohne. 
Of course you can ice also produce without agent, it should only be sold within a day, otherwise sackt together, and the client bites in loud Eiskörnchen. 
Some variations on the basic chips are allowed. 
It will be more exciting with the flavours. 
For the taste in ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes the ingredients in the fruit department or to buy the sweets from the supermarket. 
In addition there are bullets and Pasten. 
"The suppliers are all trying to get dozens of aromatic ingredients you try to foist on." 
"But you should simply experimenting." 
Either in the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruit. 
Or just on the ice cream from the white primary chips with eggs on the yellow cream and cocoa powder on the basis of all possible Schokoladen-Verführungen. 
Now we can change players in the Eismaschines. 
Luciano leaves them each four different types of vanille, chocolate, produce Mokka and Haselnuss-Eis - with or without eggs in the basic material, with more or less whatsoever aroma or other natural additives. 
According to the same experiment will be subjected to the eiss assembly. 
More flavourings, more fruit puree - taste is not necessarily better. 
Haselnuss-Eis is not necessarily palatable nut palm, if it contains more hazelnuts. 
The most popular Kiwi-Eis is the working group, and used more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer. 
Only a balanced mix will highlight the taste of a Gelato correctly points out Luciano says. 
Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: if used peach puree with a lot of sugar, the sugar share must be reduced in the basic recipe. 
For Zitroneneis, an extra oats sugar is needed. 
Luciano prefers a device is to be resolved, with which he the sugar content of fruit varieties certain (winemakers measure so that the Oechsle in the grape must). 
Fortunately facilitate calculation tables. 
Ice to make no longer requires as much physical use as in the past. 
It is not just the device for the automatic production of basic material helps. 
There is also a device in which the finished Eis-Mischung at the same time cremig beaten and chilled to freezing temperatures. 
All automation in defiance not remain small mishaps. 
The Brazilians Gustavo late and its stock price colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree than him outsized hand blenders control. 
"In every course," says Luciano Maestro, "it is only a matter of time before something happens."
