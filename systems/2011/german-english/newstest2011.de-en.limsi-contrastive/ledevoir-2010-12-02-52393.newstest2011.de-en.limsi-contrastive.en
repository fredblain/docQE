Bond for the takeover of eXcentris 
The Quebecer government of Société Angus and called on the company Parallèle has been financially to participate in the takeover of the eXcentris Kinokomplexes agreed to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive loan. 
The Angus entwickler society, as well as the company Parallèle a donation amounting to seven million dollars from the Ministry for the adoption of the Daniel Langlois covered by Kinokomplexes eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint laurent had hoped to bring this back to his real cineastischen capacity to respond, do not seem to get what they demanded. 
The government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, but on their own terms. 
Instead of the expected donation offers the Quebecer government instead of a loan at less than the initial desired level, a viable solution to create favorable conditions could, at least according to the entnehmbaren sources from the state-owned scaremongers. 
An initial action plan and a request for 12.8 million were already last spring by the Quebec rejected a further request has been made since the renewed layoff moderately revised downwards. 
One proposal, along with an action plan has already been the president of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, sent to St-Pierre Minister, who chairs the eXcentris act. 
Before several days, he had her a grant last factual report. 
The counter-proposal of the cabinet, the SODEC was sent on Wednesday. 
Parallèle and Angus now have time until 31 December to respond to this. 
In any case, it seems that the premise of public donation really been pushed to the side. 
Let us remember that the Quebecer owner's community theatres and cinema complex against a direct government investment to support the takeover of eXcentris had revolted by making the argument invalid, the Culture Minister did not have any financial help for real estate projects there, which he did not even other cinemas to send. 
Several other players in the segment, however, in contrast to substantial economic aid one. 
Movie chief Daniel Langlois was after the self-financed design of the cinema over ten years under great difficulty the authors' cinemas presented in the premises of his Kinokomplexes, which could justify the exception from the public purse. 
The lack of cinemas showing independent films in Montreal more than obvious, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients in the bar. 
Société Angus and the company with Christian Yaccarini Parallèle at the top, for their part, are heading for a privately financed Campagne, of which it is a sum of 700, 000 dollars, hoping to boost the acquisition. 
Since the spring of 2009 drives for just a single screen so that continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle. 
The aim of the future acquirer, the three Kinosäle on 27 February next year with the spectacle of a very fine film by Xavier Beauvois " I hommes et des dieux ' to reopen. 
Christian Yaccarini, the newspaper 'Le Devoir' is not removed and ignores what he and his group of the revised downwards proposals that we made them.
