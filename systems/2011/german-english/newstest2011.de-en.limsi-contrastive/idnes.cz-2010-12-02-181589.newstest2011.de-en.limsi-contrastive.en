The army has so many Zündschnurs that the whole of the Czech Republic umwickeln, you might consider but only for two years 
The Czech army has 445 kilometers Zündschnüre bought with weapons. 
In the year before, the Defense Ministry had 224 kilometers Zündschnur delivered to the army camp. 
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have ausgesorgt for 225 years. 
The problem is just the durability of the Zündschnur - two, at most, but four years. 
The army bought the Zündschnur company STV Group, others for paltry 40 million kronor. 
In his explanatory memorandum for the purchase of these huge amount Zündschnur said the General Staff MF DNES, the soldiers would annually consume about 60 kilometres Zündschnur. 
According to the research by Armeepyrotechnikern, according to the MF DNES to show for this indication that the whole army annually should undertake an intensive pyrotechnics training - by all the generals and officers of the army command, right up to the Sekretärins and cleaning women. 
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded. 
Only in this way could be considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometres Zündschnüren reasonably justified. 
This length corresponds 25 000 Detonationen. 
But even this army stocks would be sufficient for more than ten years. 
But if even the old rule of experts that every new professional soldier for training two metres Zündschnur quite sufficient, then the army by those Neueinkaufs - also under the point of view of the increased needs of pioneer and special teams - a reassuring stockpile for the above-mentioned created 225 years. 
It complained soldiers of the Rapid Border Intervention Brigade recently in the Defence Minister Vondra, they had almost no look for hand-held weapons more so that Schießübungen the lack of resources are limited due to strong. 
From the same shortage demure. 
"I am also not a why it from us to buy those legions of Zündschnüre." 
But it is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need." 
"For us, the army is a good customer, we, as traders want concessions to as much as possible," says the marketing manager of the STV Group, Jan Dcký. 
Jan Pejek, the spokesman of the Defense Ministry justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of Zündschnur, so that the army would have been at least ten years with this "ammunition" acknowledges the covers. 
Jan Dcký of the STV Group, but only talks about a four-year span of the Zündschnur and the police and Armeepyrotechniker even just two years ago. 
"In a perfect storage is also possible the four mentioned a number of years," admits one of them, but wants to remain unnamed, as a soldier not accused the criticism of the army. 
After the expiry of the period of any ammunition must be tested thoroughly, whether it is reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers. 
But these tests are not in vain, but costs further money. 
Another argument of the Defense Department is the quantitative rebate for 445 kilometers Zündschnur. 
"It cost us 60 per cent less than any year supply of 244 miles," Pejek spokesman us shares with the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence. 
It is only by way of comparison: the annual consumption of Zündschnüren Pyrotechnikern the police, the ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Army, liquidate exceeds some years barely 1 500 metres. 
And the police are always ordered such quantities of these weapons, which they still can use before the end of the term of use. 
It is wonderful for the safety of the Pyrotechniker, so it also considers the possibility of flexible procurement of more modern and hence reliable Zündschnurs open. 
The Defense Ministry has already huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, as the two hundred thousand members Czechoslovak People's Army on their campaign was on the Rhine. 
According to the Pyrotechnikern, according to the MF DNES of the Czech armed forces, expected in a few years ago, the same problem in the killing of hundreds of kilometres of old Zündschnurs, which they now as "favourable."
