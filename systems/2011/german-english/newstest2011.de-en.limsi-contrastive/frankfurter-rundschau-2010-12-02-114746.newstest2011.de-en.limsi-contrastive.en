The trail of stones 
Uli Gsell which has also become concerned, a total of approximately 400 kilograms. 
On Monday evening from Stuttgart station he stood Tuba on the back. 
It was Demo. 
It snowed heavily. 
The story is well known: in September, the excavators were angerückt and had started to cut a big slice of the northern wing. 
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: hundreds of thousands marched against S21, the station's multi-billion low erlegung. 
When it came to a settlement freeze, a large part of the wing in ruins. 
Zerbrochen 6 000, 7 000 pieces. 
Crailsheimer mussel shell, a soft rough stone between 1914 and 1920. 
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old. 
He has a couple of scraps guaranteed. 
"These stones are Reliquien." 
"You should not go away." 
He schwärmt: "A cheap and poor ball, simple and detention." 
When he is a aufsägte, was the rat for cigarette smoke. 
What he will do with the headache, they still do not know. 
The stones have time. 
Uli Gsell, too. 
The trail leads the Stuttgart stones in a forest in Tübingen in a former munitions deposits of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his empire. 
The 44 year-old person with old stones. 
He has bought all fell in the demolition in Stuttgart. 
"It would be a shame, they would Schotter or disappear in the hole," he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen, which was once a young häuschen. 
Beschimpft and they have threatened him, he told me, as in September in the newspapers that it bought the remnants of the northern wing of the demolition contractors have. 
But he talked with the S-21-Gegnern for days. 
And he told them that he can seize anything for the demolition). 
And if it is now, then it is surely the right thing when the stones were reused. 
About 200 S-21-Gegner then took an average of 80 kilos of heavy Quader with unit prices 6,50 up to 14 million. 
As the memory, some but also in the hope that it will be able to return to a reconstruction. 
500 tonnes had purchased Rongen 25 major Lkw-Ladungs. 
About half is still in the forest, the rest has long since been sold. 
Garden owners, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer. 
They come from wherever they are and have been weggeschleppt, which could bear boot space and supporters. 
The Stuttgart stones of contention have long turned into "Mäuerle" or limits of Kräuterbeeten. 
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen. 
"If no political component." 
He is rising in his SUV makes a tour through his 20 hectares of great empire. 
Jura, he has studied and discontinued later biology, then he is interested in computers and, finally, dealers have become. 
And Stone lovers. 
40000 tons of stones he eclipses. 
For Germany, completely karrt his treasures together. 
He says he is the biggest Altsteinhändler of the Republic. 
He slows down. 
In the snow are skillful fitting sand stones. 
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marie Bridge," he told me. 
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he schwärmt. 
"My favorite stone." 
It is the way high through the forest. 
It shows a bunch: red sand stone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe train station. 
She then. 
"Schöner Travertin." 
The Quader once belonged to the gallery of the Stuttgart Neckarstadien. 
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin of the Stuttgart police headquarters, rötlich stone is complemented with from the cathedral of St. Blasien, Tuff the Heilbronner hospital. 
What work, what efforts which sweat. 
If Rongen remembers how the stones in the past by hand and with a simple Flaschenzugs and karren were moved, it will be very reverential. 
"It would be a scandal if we were a bit schreddern." 
Reich is he not become immensely rich even less. 
But 14 people discussing the stone dealers also have the top in the forest Steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a Glasbläser and a horticulturalists settled. 
"We are working hard, but it is satisfactory," says the residual those who exploit. 
He must shortly after Cologne. 
Similarly, there are obstacles to save.
