With regard to the hell! 
Assimilate Splatter for art cinemas? 
The director Nicolas Winding Refn lotet with his combatant saga "Walhalla Rising," new from old the genetic boundaries. 
The Danish director at which audience may Nicolas Winding Refn thought when he "Walhalla Rising," revolved around? 
A captured wikinger warriors with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) liberated from his Peinigers and sets with almost superhuman forces order as his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero like rough killing methods used and its enemies before the Gedärms alive, if he bad mood. 
On the other hand says Einauge as he is called, in fact, the whole movie about nothing, and also the other characters are at most times on one or two sentences or a few painful Todesschreis. 
Otherwise, silence and gruselig beautiful hill scenery in Scotland have feasted upon the wikinger world of about a thousand years provides the backdrop. 
More ideal for adult Cineasten with interest of Existentialismus and very quiet camera journeys. 
Fine, if a film has several target groups, only a pity if they are mutually exclusive. 
Director Winding Refn has been in force for his wild and gestylt drogendealer trilogie 'Pusher' as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but refuses to have stoically, his works with a little more humour to the mainstream, or a little less brutality to make the Arthouse available. 
Most Kunstkino-Freunde are likely from around spritzend brain mass and the Gedärms be deterred. 
The Action-Fans will then be able to die from boredom, if Einauge free interpretierbaren grounds with a bunch of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and an eternity for a fixed mired in depression and fog before the team arrives in America seems to be and remain silent. 
It is no wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising," has found no movie in cinemas in Germany and is now only appeared on DVD. 
This is particularly due to the magnificent images of a shame, but also because behind the grandiose until blood triefend facade hiding a sometimes exciting piece of cinema deserves attention. 
This film is not about dialogue or a coherent plot, it is all atmosphere, a film had fever dream. 
And for which there is no escape for the spectators. 
Refn he might barely a moment of relaxation, and he undertakes with his icy images and the sinister Trance-artigen sound track very slowly, but above all with the incredible hatred of him from the hearts of the characters has anti-American. 
Only a small blond boy, the Einauge faithful to the side, retains something like innocence, everyone else will be driven by anger. 
Most of the blind hero whose motives are never explained, but for enemies and temporary allies sometime on the warrior from hell, possibly with the ambassadors of the devil himself. 
It means destruction, but perhaps even for the already Verdorbenen. 
"Walhalla Rising," is a mysterious film you can hate and admire the Ärgers, Aufregen and next. 
It is a thrill.
