Belarus agrees not continue to collect weapons-grade uranium 
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to global security of nuclear material the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it no longer will collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. 
The deal has been in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarussian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov announced in an additional article of the Sicherheitsgipfels. 
The US government had been trying for years to persuade Belarus, not to collect more highly enriched uranium and appeared last spring reached a hurdle. 
But the US administration officials told the Washington Post that in the last two months, two secret agreements were made with Belarus, 187 pounds weapons-grade uranium to remove from a White Russian research centre. 
This was the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official staff, who will remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue, roughly 500 pounds. 
It seems one of the main findings of Obama's "nuclear security summit of 47 nations" in April, the Belarus ruled. 
And it was apparently good enough, at the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012 to secure. 
"I was thrilled by the fact that they have a seat at the nuclear security summit (by 2012) want." 
"This shows me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership Global Security, a group on the promotion of nuclear safety. 
Clinton called the agreement " a very significant, important step ' of Belarus. 
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009, within four years to secure all vulnerable nuclear material. 
Since then, the US government has helped six countries, its highly enriched uranium to be loose. 
Belarus will be the seventh. 
A dozen did so under the government of George W. Bush. 
At the time of Obama's Nuklearem security summit in the Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up their uranium. 
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamental weapons-grade, and fewer enriched uranium," said Lukashenko at the time. 
"This is our raw materials... we will not make it a dirty bombs and we will sell it to anyone." 
"We will use it solely for research purposes, that is all." 
Belarus is still a few months ago, the United States, as interest in the meeting of an agreement anzeigte. 
The first attempt to remove the uranium in Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was irradiated easily, say officials. 
It was loaded in a Spezialzug of more than 1 300 miles on a Russian factory for storage and disposal, say officials. 
The second attempt was approved on Monday and was carried out according to the officials by plane. 
The US government pays for these efforts - 14 million, with a large part of the money in the Belarussian research goes with low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons. 
"This was very carefully coordinated and concerted confidence" to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton led, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Energy Department, which is working with the global risk reduction. 
The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende Studies estimates that Belarus this year at least 88 pounds waffenf√§hhigen uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus wants, according to the joint agreement to remove his camp until 2012. 
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harschen lack of respect for human rights. 
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement. 
"According to the progress of this global security issues welcome liable to cancel out the United States of America and Belarus aware that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she says.
