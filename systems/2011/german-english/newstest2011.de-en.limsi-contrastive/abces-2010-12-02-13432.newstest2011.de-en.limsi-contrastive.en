Popular Party won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9 
With the results of 28 November could the PP in the Lérida towns, Tarragona and Barcelona play a crucial role 
After the major voices and fellow gains in the last regional elections executes its view the PP already on the parliamentary elections - early or not. Your expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes, the party achieved in these elections is usually twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia. 
For example, the Catalan Popular Party received 610.473 votes in the parliamentary elections of 2008, while this paragraph in the regional elections in 2006 only 316.222. 
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384.091 votes. 
If this rising trend - a result of the diversion of the share of PSC and the pegging of the electorate of the PP - should continue, analysts predict the PP in the parliamentary elections, the PPC could rise by 8 to 12 Congressmen who are, while also CiU four (it now has 10) added to win and the PSC at least 9 members (25) would lose. 
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE. 
According to the analysis of the People's Party would lose a Member of the ERC - it currently has three, while ICV to keep their members or a way to go win. 
If the electoral calendar will be maintained, however, the next date with the local elections in May 2011. Even then can the People's Party (PP) to be the voice of the scales to put an end to the socialist hegemony, and in four Provinzhauptstädten, and with their majority in the council, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million for 2011. 
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC cities of Barcelona, Tarragona Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists or reach a majority on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV) can fall back on, will lose. 
After the Republican debacle, it is not absurd that this party their representation in the council, in which they reach 5% of the votes should lose. 
The PP, however, recorded an increase in their share in the four Provinzhauptstädten and could lead to a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona. 
The nationalists are convinced that the key role to play in Tarragonas turnaround to be able to where they were before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the People's Party ruled. 
En Lérida lies the PP just 500 votes behind the PSC, Àngel Ros, the mayor maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign, they met several times. 
There are also other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus the People's Party gained a significant increase. 
The PP is currently represented in 34 municipalities of Catalonia and is seeking the formation of lists in so many places as possible.
