Schwacher applause for China 
Taiwan's voters are coming slowly to a closer connection to the mainland. 
What is stopping Taiwan from his big brother across the Straits? 
On 27 November made more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all voters in the five Stadtbezirken to elect mayors and councillors. This is as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou has been interpreted. 
By building cutting-edge business relations, einschl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma, even a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland. His policy has the relationship with the Chinese mainland for the first time since 1949, sustainable changes. 
Ma took the test, but just barely. 
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) three of the five mayors, they did not receive a majority of votes. 
Instead, the director of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates a greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%. 
In a presidential election that would have meant for Ma problems. 
Since his election two years ago, the share of his party has fallen by approximately 8%. 
For the first time the DPP even pulled together with the KMT in the local councilors a. 
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan, such as Lastwagenkonvois, Flaggen-schwenkende Massenumzüge and rarely are. 
There was even the obligatory mysterious assassination attempt. 
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT felt on the eve of the election with a speech at a KMT-Kandidaten 
When he was a man shot in the face from the crowd. Lien was wounded and killed a umstehend spectator. 
Rather, it is not clear whether the shooter Lien kill or wanted to settle a dispute with the candidate. 
Regardless of the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, affected the election and the DPP in a bad light brought what the KMT has brought more voices. 
China was perhaps the biggest winner of the campaign. 
Remarkably, the relationship was not addressed to the mainland. 
Instead, the candidates debated on plans to social housing and the creation of jobs. 
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and are opposed to China's military threat. 
This is why the KMT its relations with the government in Beijing does not like to see in the foreground. 
But this time also avoided the DPP anti-Chinese sentiments to stir up too. 
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China. 
Ma, in turn, would like to confirm that the majority of the Taiwanese people supported its China policy. 
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy, Taiwan attract with economic incentives in the community. 
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei, for a summit to prepare investment security and medical cooperation. 
It also wants a political integration. But first things first. 
It is better to ensure that waiting until after the 2012 presidential election. 
The DPP has now reinvented. 
Before two years ago, she was severely weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was convicted of corruption in the prison. 
During his presidency from 2000 until 2008 he vehemently for the absolute independence a. 
But under Tais reign has developed a new generation of gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the professionals and young people. 
Tsai was held as a presidential candidate of the DPP consent, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen. 
Your party will do everything in order to show that it is also capable of building close relations with Beijing. 
Tsai is planning a of think tank as a contact point between the DPP and China. This would require an unbiased discussions ahead. 
Tsai said publicly that their party will offer a "credible alternative" to Ma's hasty rapprochement with China. 
Chen seems very angry about this change. 
From his cell, he said, the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan independence. 
He urged the pragmatist Su even to forgo the presidential candidacy. 
Even without Chen's interference does the DPP difficult to choose their potential candidate. 
The KMT will undergo its own self-analysis must. 
Ma's values are poor, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT-Kandidaten wanted to conduct their campaigns without him. 
The main reasons for his unpopularity seems unemployment and the increasing gap between the rich and the poor. 
According to testimony, he will be a KMT-Sprechers cabinet and revamp the local facilities. 
The strong emergence of DPP suggests that Taiwan supports only limited a rapprochement. 
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese see the economic cooperation with China as inevitable. 
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no turning back."
