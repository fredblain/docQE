Climate: as France is talking about his financial promises 
A year after the Copenhagen treaty, it is time to observe the fast gelösten funding pledges (including "Fast Start" or premature funding mentioned) to investigate were carried out by the developing countries. 
And already the rough French vulnerable to blandishments revealed. 
With the Copenhagen Treaty have committed themselves to developing countries, 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012 will be set aside. 
The EU has 7.2 billion euros over three years, promised France 1,26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year). 
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16, the EU has taken all register their partners from the fact of their commitment to convince the Fast-Start-Finanzierungen: accurate course report of its Member States, press conference, large side events broschüre distribution. 
The operation of transparency is remarkable and appreciated for their real value: the developing countries and civil society would look like if all developed countries the same made at the same level. 
The EU announced, 2.2 billion euros in 2010 to have released what they on the right path to Respektbezollung its commitment of 7.2 Dollar billion in 2012 will bring. 
But if you look in detail, things are a little more complicated. 
This money should, according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional deployment was introduced without the expense of public development aid. 
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means. 
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonisation, certain member states, including France, have blocked the process. 
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark, which he considers to be the best. 
The European Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for the person of the Year 2009: the international funding will be maintained, and in the framework of the "fast start" funding over three years of 150 million. 
Other countries have similar benchmarks, either on year or about conditions at the level of public development aid will be elected. 
In contrast, France has been of the opinion that the financing "of all the new projects," the year 2010 are "new and additional." 
In other words: there is no guideline in the spending of the previous year, or at the global level of public development aid. 
Specifically, the report said the total amount of French aid can remain stable in the developing countries (or even diminish) - France is its commitment with regard to the "new and additional" financing must be respected. 
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. 
There is still no rule, and each elects its calculation method. 
Some, such as France, for example, 1 borrowed as equivalent to 1 donated. 
This is obviously difficult reasonable: the effort is not comparable. 
If the use of loans for certain profitable investment (often projects tied to emission mitigation, which are based on effektivster technology) can be justified, it is wrong to portray the euro as the equivalent of a donated euro captured... let only the cost of loans for capital donor country to be counted as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate). 
But France has nothing else in mind than the following thought: it "respected" his commitment of 420 million euros by 91,5% loans (389,8 million) for the negotiation and 8,5%) 36,1 million euros) - see also the EU documents in order to convince themselves. 
France is the only EU country that loans in large measure on its territory. 
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) with their obligations to 100% to follow up with donations. 
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union 1 spends to fulfil their commitments, France just 10 cents and meant a similar commitment. 
Schöner! 
Everything is operating in all of France in his fast start with a double rip-off: a part with a Weiterentwicklkung of action over the period and partly with the reality of the financial commitment. 
France will be able to believe that 420 million "new and additional" million has been spent in accordance with its promises, it will save 36,1 million. 
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it would appear that Bercy was carried out of the arbitrage) a double negative impact could entail; even internally (why continue with donations from other member states if it is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries do not completely fooled... 
The chapter of the premature funding only a small matter in a relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions on the climate. 
But it could drop too much in the huge machinery of the UNFCCC. 
Let us hope that this will not be the case. 
As it always is, it is essential to its lesson from this first year to learn verfrühter funding. 
First, France could be a change in his Verbuchungsart parade for the years 2011 and 2012, and in the spirit of respect for its commitments and the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union. 
But, above all, France could be the discussions on the contentious subject of long-term financing forward (another crucial and current topic): you can escape the issue of "Verrechenbarkeit" or the Verbuchungsart of its loans are not. 
France could change its position, as advanced in terms of controversy, as it is in other things. 
The hope is the new Minister for the Environment Kosciusko-Morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun. 
A surprising announcement on the fast starts of France and its vision of the "Verrechenbarkeit," as well as the use of loans would increase by nature of the international trust needed for further discussions.
