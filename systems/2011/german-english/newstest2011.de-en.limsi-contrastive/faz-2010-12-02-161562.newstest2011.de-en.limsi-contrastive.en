Amazon servers - threats against Assange 
Wikileaks gear increasingly in trouble. 
The Internet service providers has banished the investigative platform from its servers. 
Perhaps that is behind this political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret Diplomaten-Depeschen. 
Wikileaks-Gründer Assange is supposedly in England. 
The investigative platform Wikileaks machine in the United States is increasingly under fire. 
The track down lost access to their previous American server and are now seeking an Internet heimat in Europe. 
The senior US Senator Joe Lieberman, meanwhile, called on other countries and companies to boycott of Wikileaks. 
And Wikileaks-Gründer Julian Assange, who is on the wanted list of Interpol, will stop after a newspaper report in Britain. 
"Wikileaks supplanted by amazon server." 
"Free speech in the land of the free," told the Enthüllungs-Aktivisten via short messaging service Twitter on Wednesday (local time). 
In short, the Internet companies had previously banned the Wikileaks-Dokumente from its servers. 
Had the track down to the publication of secret diplomatic diplomatic cables on the Amazon Web Service (AWS) returned to the high level of access to pay to be able to cope with the documents. 
Wikileaks said by Twitter to step further: "Prima - our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe." 
If Amazon have such problem with the freedom of speech, "they should stop to sell books." 
Amazon have halted the use of its servers by WikiLeaks, after staff members of Senator Joe Lieberman any investigation would have told the television station CNN, citing the office Liebermans. 
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Amazon had threatened with a boycott, told the British Guardian. 
"I would have liked that Amazon is taking this measure previously classified information by WikiLeaks in the face of previous publications," said the senator. 
Avigdor Lieberman, meanwhile, called on the platform also to deny the use of servers in other countries. 
"Wikileaks ' illegal, outrageous and reckless action puts our national security at risk and endangered around the globe lives," was in a communication from the parteilos senator. 
"No responsible businesses - whether American or foreign - WikiLeaks should help in its efforts to disseminate stolen material." 
Wikileaks-Gründer Assange, because rape suspects sought by the authorities in Sweden, is on the wanted list of Interpol. 
According to a report by the London newspaper The Independent " follows the 39 year-old Australians in Britain at the exact place Scotland Yard is known. 
The Internet activist investigations in Sweden has always been described as the set-up of his opponents. 
Kristinn Wikileaks-Sprecher Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats. 
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange." 
That is why I fear Assange labeled for his safety, Hrafnsson said. 
The Wikileaks-Gründer will therefore continue to keep hidden. 
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America. 
In America, was the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks-Enthüllungen should be prosecuted and executed for treason. 
In Canada, said an aide of leader Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone." 
And Assange arose between the White House to start a tennis match. 
The spokesman of the US President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asked if they recently leaked Spionage-Aufforderungen is responsible for diplomats. 
"I am not quite sure why we look at the opinion of a types with a website" as Gibbs. 
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its a website." 
The US government is now fully the protection of their databases to the test. 
As a special envoy is the deputy director of the Centre for antiterrorism measures, Russell Travers, has been appointed, told the White House. 
Travers is responsible for "the necessary structural reforms" to develop after the disclosure of the embassy reports by Wikileaks have become necessary. 
The White House also wants to examine the ways, as the entire government information and protects. 
The US government also announced, to ensure the safety of dissidents and most active in trying to let them through the Wikileaks-Veröffentlichung in jeopardy. 
"We have done everything we can to come into contact with them," said außenamt spokesman Philip Crowley. 
"We are ready to protect them if it becomes necessary."
