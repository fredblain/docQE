Rubén Omar Romano looks at three failures at Endspiels back, he has Aufs and Abs experienced in his career, but he has three crucial games had, and he has so far kept well why this opportunity is of particular importance to him. 
The Argentinians has played with the medal for the second champion, he has remained a step behind the winners, and surprisingly, he has fought successive Endspiels with the same team. 
The santistische strategist, reached the first final as a coach in the 'Torneo Apertura 2002 ' than del Morelia had the lead in the hand with which he against Toluca 4-2 learned a great defeat; later, in the 'Clausura 2003 " it reached the decisive match, which he also lost against Rayados 3-1. 
As early as with Santos, Laguna 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010 ', in which it against Los Diablos, played Rubén again had to share a setback, because the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros equalised after 210 Spielminuten, but he was in the penalty kick with 3-1 forward and got two options, accepting his title, but ultimately missed three of his players and the game of the 11 steps on a 4-3. 
Rubén already had two Endspiele with the Diablos Rojos and one in Monterrey, his great rival, lost, and so he would not again be pursued by the disaster and rid themselves of the bad attention in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirmed that the most important thing for him to play the game itself. 
"I would like to be champion, I would like to break no statistics for a club, for my love, I am hingebe, and that is why the title will come to me, but what previously happened, is the most important thing," commented the helmsman when they questioned him about the lost Endspiels. 
The last final in the recall him is still strong, he assured, to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from this is that until the referee is not the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared for the line, the players, too, because the last time with two Elfmetern, we were already prepared to order, and I believe that this is a lesson to be learned before the game is not finished, there is no cause for celebration." 
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shoot-out, concerned him not because he trusted his players: "You never want to arrive at the penalty shoot-out, we would like to finish in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is no alternative, and we must be prepared, we were prepared in the previous Tournee, but unfortunately we gave a bad game the destiny, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the fierce desire to keep the title already in the hands, which left us something for the endgame, and we hope that it will not happen this time." 
It is in Romanso power, not just its second champion and costs for the first time the glory of the title.
