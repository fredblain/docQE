China upheld its targets to reduce greenhouse gases 
The representative of China stated at COP16, his country had made huge efforts to reduce the carbon toe the line and it would maintain its offer by 2020 by between 40% and 45% to reduce its greenhouse gases. 
China keeps its offer the emission of greenhouse gases by the year 2020 by 40 to 45 per cent to reduce assured Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16. 
In his first public appearance at the 15th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei, said that his country would have been huge efforts to reduce the carbon toe the line and made for the conversion of its industry. 
He led from that in the last four years his country 245 million dollars have been invested in order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. 
On the other hand, he said that China would not change its goals, but together with the international community would work on this issue. 
He said that the Chinese strategy on climate change in share four aspects: dialogue, capacity-building, institution building and support of pilot programmes. 
In all aspects of the progress we have made, including the adoption of a new energy law in the last year, the objectives in terms of reducing the emission of gases delivers, he said. 
On the other hand, he stressed that the authorities of the provinces in China with those of the central state and local authorities had worked for the goals for energy saving, an efficient use of energy and to achieve the reduction of emissions. 
He also led several multi-annual plans launched or completed, both those who have been funded by the Chinese government, as well as such, the money received from other countries. 
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy, which was introduced in the last five years and investment from the United Nations (UN), the government and had received from private hands. 
It also runs a project at provincial level to change a long exchange of traditional incandescent light bulbs with energy-saving birnes and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said. 
Martin Krol, scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that the efforts of China are much greater than commonly understood would. 
It showed that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China since six tonnes per person, while in the United States 100 tonnes were. China is for a nine percent total contribution to environmental pollution. 
It also make unprecedented progress in the field of energy use, and energy efficiency has increased by 20 percent in the last five years, and by 2020 will happen a misconduct, he said.
