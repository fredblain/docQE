Arsen-resistente microbe could new life forms on Earth or elsewhere permit 
The discovery of a foreign variety of bacteria, including arsenic can live, opens up new opportunities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere. 
Although scientists this unusual bacterium discovered here on earth, their view, it is a sign that a life even without the previously deemed as essential elements is possible. 
"This organism has two options." 
"He needs to grow, either phosphorus or arsenic." 
"This makes it quite special, even though it is almost a kind of 'fremde ' way of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University and Co-Autor of the report on Thursday appears in the online edition of the journal Science. 
Until now, there have been six main elements considered essential - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur. 
But as the researchers discovered that the bacterium grows in California's mono Lake even further if it has to be replaced by arsenic. 
"One wonders what else is possible," said the report's Co-Autor Ariel D. of Anbar of Arizona State University. 
The discovery is an important step in the search for outside life, as scientist lives and need to see its forms as of Anbar. 
The study deals with microbes that have been found on the planet. 
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were disclosed about the discovery was cause for widespread speculation on the Internet, that the report could act by the discovery of au√üerirdischen life. 
This is not the case. 
The discovery "shows that in other Planetensystemen organisms with the help of other elements biochemical processes can set in motion, and that the 'Standardelemente ', which, in our view, are absolutely essential, are not necessarily fixed prescribed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University in the United Kingdom from Milton Keynes. 
Cockel was not part of the research team. 
"This work is a new thing, because it shows that in an element of fundamental biochemical processes and structures can be replaced by another," said Cockell will be added. 
This discovery was not accidental. 
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrobiologischen Institute, who led the study, chose the mono Lake as a result of the high Arsengehalts. 
Since arsenic and phosphorus chemical equal, they thought that microbes, which are both suspended, possibly an element can be replaced by the other. 
"The toxicity of the Arsens above all is that it is chemically similar phosphorus." 
"It is difficult, the organisms to distinguish one element from the other." 
"But the difference is so great that arsenic if it works differently than phosphorus. It ends up in our biochemisches system, where it verschmiert at almost everything," said of Anbar. 
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 rising arsenic concentration. It wanted and grew. 
The microbe grows in phosphorus better, but it can also survive in arsenic, shows that a life form can happen, of course, either on the Earth or another planet or moon, the arsenic occurs more frequently. 
According to Jamie S. Foster, believe in microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new but so far there has been no functioning example. 
Arsenic was more frequently in the early Erdjahren, she says, so the science is based on the assumption that early life forms have used it. 
"The reason the assumption that life may have developed differently than in the early geologically important," as Forster, which is not a member in Wolfe-Simons research team was. 
The research were from NASA, the Energy Department and supported the national health authorities.
