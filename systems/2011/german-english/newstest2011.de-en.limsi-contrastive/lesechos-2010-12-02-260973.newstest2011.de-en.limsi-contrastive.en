Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain their buying of government securities 
The final assembly of the Governing Council of the ECB in the past year should provide an opportunity to explore ways to show how it can emerge from the crisis, or at least the layout of a large number of unconventional measures of monetary policy, will announce the end of the year will come to its conclusion. 
The crisis in the European sovereign debt obligation, the Central Bank in Frankfurt can afford without any doubt, even today, more than tense situation in the European bond markets ambitions, not the cause. 
The political cost would be far too high. 
The French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde had yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference by the European Central Bank adopted an active role in favour of the resolution welcomes the state budget deficits in Europe. 
It has not dared to say whether they thought the central bank could do even more, for example, by reviving its program of buying government bonds. 
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...)." 
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank had the day before in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament is not very articulate about his project demonstrated, but rather to point out that the programme of purchases of government securities in the secondary market "to continue to be operated" would be and that we in the Assembly on Thursday "will see how the decisions will emerge." 
The only certainty: the ECB is its key interest rate untouched at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009. 
In practice, the bond purchases were the treasure chamber of the European Central Bank last week to about 1,35 billion has doubled. 
And according to leaks by some traders to yesterday's new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government securities. 
Overall, the central banks of the Eurosystem since May 2010 made purchases totalling 67 billion euros. 
Among the dealers is the anticipation of a follow-up of the Kaufkurses not in any way in doubt (see page 29). 
Already, the economists do not expect any notable change more. 
If the Anleihengeschäfte of more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter still in the full Geldmittelreserven to create freigiebige type, and over a period of a week of up to three months. 
The economists are already taken today that this measure will extend even for a few months. 
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will amend its programme on fundamental way." 
"Otherwise they would risk provoking new tensions in the short term," as alleged, Michael Schubert, economist of Commerzbank. 
"One for the course of the first quarter of 2011, progressive exit seems likely," for its part, anticipates, Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal. 
Oppenheim. 
In the area of its interventions in the market for sovereign debt, "the ECB should such a purchase volume of bonds to maintain that stimulates the sluggish market," Mr. Bräms adds. 
In view of the relevance of the exposure of European banks in the markets of the national debt in the euro zone, the Central Bank has no other choice than to maintain their presence in the market. 
"At any price, you must come to the Steller of the lack of investors in the market and so to act to prevent the premature enthusiasm about the paid returns to the most vulnerable states," bezeugte yesterday, an important bond holders. 
The fact is that if interest rates start to the exuberance, the states would be prevented from doing more to reduce their debt, or even to stabilize. 
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
