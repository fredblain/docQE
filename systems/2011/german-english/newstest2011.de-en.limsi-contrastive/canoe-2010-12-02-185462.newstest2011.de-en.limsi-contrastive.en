The new unit will take place no unanimity 
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new frame unity on the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public committee of inquiry on this issue. 
Robert Dutil, minister of public security, claimed this idea come not from yesterday: Quebec had already last January, the New York Department of Investigation consulted on this issue. 
The metropolis has at its disposal for fastest on a standing unit against corruption. 
However, the announcement on Wednesday was more than just a surprise. 
We must say that this measure on the occasion of the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebecer police service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils has not been discussed in the slightest. 
It also lacked not due to the fact that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and a member of the Parti Québécois, this announcement in terms of public safety as a "gezaubertes rabbit from the hat" and "a table of the Council rightly cobbled solution" to qualify. 
Minister Dutil did turn appealed to those who fear that the political power to much influence on the contest took responsibility for the future unity. 
"You will see the result, if we will announce it," he was to confirm. 
"We are aware of this problem." 
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public opinion poll. 
"The more insistent M. Charest, to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry to try to, the more people like you and I think that he has something to hide," he said. 
"The only means to be able to form a committee of inquiry, the resignation of Jean Charest" so, in turn, said Yves bois, a teacher of ethics and policy systems of the ENA (staatl. high school for the training of senior administrators). 
In order to emerge from this impasse, proposing the Quebec, to give a specific mandate from the financial auditing control, so that the appropriate investigations into corruption and collusion can make. 
"You should be able to extend the mandate of the audit control," as he decided. 
He also takes the view that the Quebec of audit control the same powers as commissioners could give, which would also allow her to commit people to the statement. 
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the government Charest. 
The Quebec will also ask Ottawa to amend the penal code to better at this type of crime to be stopped. 
This demand comes from the public prosecutor in the Operation Marteau, the Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier has informed that the case law in this kind of prosecution is not clear. 
Vic Toews, minister for public security, for its part, confirmed his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, currently committed to certain portfolio offending update apart. 
During the operation Printemps 2001, which affected the groups of Motorradpolizisten, 131 people have been arrested, although the criminal law has not been revived. 
Ottawa has as a result, the law enforced against gangsters.
