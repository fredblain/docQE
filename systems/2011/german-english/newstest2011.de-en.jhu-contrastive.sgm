<seg id="1"> The right matratze and wish the right bettenrost? women are different than men </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Not the tollste bettrahmen, but the quality of the liegefläche - matratze and rost are the good bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, these must be harmonious complement, in order to meet the wishes of the specific user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In choosing a role - play many things the weight, the size of the health and, last but not least, the sex of the schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The interieur, is just as important in the matratze and rost above. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> A typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a wochenendhaus, in which not regularly heated, latexmatratzen are not good, because you need a much longer, in order to "warm." </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition, they are much more difficult than normal polyurethan-matratzen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And, they should be changed regularly. </seg>
<seg id="10"> When they do not have enough at the heart of entlüftungskanälchen and even to be on a permanent record staut moisture in, so it is not ruled out that under its is built. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> , of course, also plays a role in the election, in which people are used. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Who was for a prolonged period of time abroad, where very high matratzen with weichschicht are common, will be difficult can get used to a low matratze through hard surface. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "Certainly all eishockeyspieler, from the nhl have returned, have complained to me that they can no longer right sleep here." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "for their abgeschundenen shoulders, fersen and hüften they need just a weichschicht being solved from visco-schaum - Memory foam - a formgedächtnis-polymer -." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "These among other things, I advise diabetics people who suffer from a disturbance of the nervous system, so that the" information "from the gelenken and skin can receive a bad thing," says Sylva hadamcziková, a reference to polstermöbel specific. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> That is why I have many years ago eishockeyspielern being solved, but also other customers this matratzen with visco-schaum - Memory foam - Concerned. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Today, it is no longer a problem, because such matratzen offer including manufacturers to tempur tropico to the Italian firm magniflex or the Czech producers." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And we should not necessarily be a famous eishockeyspieler, learn to appreciate the benefits of the visco-schaums. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" actually works quite simply. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The foam optimalisiert its severity and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, he schmiegt well and truly a warm body. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Nowhere is it, during the night shifts as after a major fight around it is not. </seg>
<seg id="22"> We sleep much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The viskoelastische foam also provides protection against dekubitus - wundbrand -. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In the choice of the matratzengröße it should contribute to height is still the length of the fußsohlen hinzurechnen, or some 21 to 34 cm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Men as women, who are in the 180 cm high, need this kind of 210 to 220 cm long bed. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Each of the schläfer should at least 90 cm liegebreite available, so together 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In einzelbetten, for example in singles, are 120 to 140 cm appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Be half of the komforts and also for any visitors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise the following faustregel applies to the ideal bettbreite: "If one is on the back, there should still be enough room for the easy angewinkelten poor," advises ing. helena prokopová, the zunftmeisterin of polsterer and raumausstatter, which has been for many years, the issue of healthy schlafes and covers the ergonomie of furniture and this matter on University has put forward. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> In a doppelbett, each with its own rost and his own matratze, but to watch the purchase by the matratzen are high in a moment. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise have no alternative but to fit, than the roste at different levels and that is not in every bettrahmen possible long ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, matratzen with federskelett 15 cm, of which should have at least three centimeters on the formschicht and the feinpolster rejected. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "With the hand or to sit down, we can see the feathers in no way," helena warns prokopová. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Any matratze requires a special rosttyp. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Ganzgepolsterte beds with matratze and documents as zusammengewachsene siamzwillinge have no place in the bedroom. </seg>
<seg id="36"> These matratzen cannot be drop and the relation cannot be washing, what today is already commonplace. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And as you are in a single night between 0.2 and 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the matratze after five to seven years, is becoming a huge - and congested colander -. </seg>
<seg id="38"> That is also why reject experts werbeslogans, the matratzen a life of up to 25 years, and even life guarantee promise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Every thing has its but if and. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And that is why a practical COUNCIL OF THE dealers: in matratzen of 120 or 140 feet wide should not shy away from the hygiene of the waschbaren, abziehbaren salary, yet, it is recommended that a matratzenschoner, it's easy to use and washing can pull out. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even if today in the rule matratzenbezüge with rundumreißverschluss will be produced, so to get open after the two halves - immensely important for the waschvorgang and the waschmaschinengröße! -, the manipulation with greater matratzen, especially alone is carried out, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> You have a firm in bed rather than a rostes plate? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Out with it. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or a maximum of for a bed for Cinderella guests and for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Also the plate should be better to have lüftungslöchern oversight - if not in it are - and matratzen with federskelett and 15 cm minimum allocation with sog. taschenfederkern and feinpolster use. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethan-matratzen do not belong to in such a documents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For not verstellbare lattenroste with 14 to 18 federleisten - lamellen - are latex- or - perhaps also combinations of latex and kokos - likely sandwichmatratzen, always pay is roste with an increased lattenanzahl, about 28 and more federleisten from, with lordosenstütze in lendenwirbelbereich, and the possibility to regulate the lattenhärte. </seg>
<seg id="48"> On verstellbare lamellenroste not include matratzen with federskelett, since it is not on the ergonomische verstellung respond. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> In addition to the attitude of the stiff federleisten are being offered the Special flexible schultermodule. </seg>
<seg id="50"> We are talking about a special federleisten Gaza, which will make it possible to implement the federleisten einzudrücken or even to verwinkeln, as it is the isolated einsinken allow the shoulder of the schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Especially for men with broad shoulders an important matter. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There are even matratzenhersteller, which have started to use in "herrenmatratzen" weichzonen for the schulterbereich. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Is also to the ladies thought, you gönnt this weichzonen in the hüftgegend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For demanding consumers are punktelastische flügelfedersysteme - lattoflex - or roste with punktelastischen kontakt-pads with sog. multitorsionsfederung determined. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure on a number of points will be distributed, which the tension decreased. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But, if it at the right matratze and right rost a bad - too much and fülliges - kopfkissen used, lost most of the benefits are off. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Faustregel here, too: the kopfkissen is the head is based, Its leaders should only up to shoulder the rich, so that the schultermuskeln can ease. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Ideal is therefore a 50 x 60 cm wide kissen, for example, as it may the Scandinavians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In the seitenlage should the kopfkissen - together with the schulterentlastungszone in rost or the weichzone in the matratze - compensate for the schulterhöhe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Have our modern matratzen have something in common with the former - with Hay so - strohsäcken but. </seg>
<seg id="61"> More and more natural materials, or at least their mixtures use modern producers. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Also in matratzen is the new magic formula "organic." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of erdölrohstoffen is used to produce polyurethanschäumen naturelle oils, for example, rizinus- and sojaöl becoming more common. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soya is likely to be used by all known manufacturers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> "Organic is to say in matratzen, that your heart is composed of materials purely natural origin," said Petr vašíček tropico plus of the company. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Naturstoffe but will also be used in the manufacture of matratzenbezügen - one of the first was aloe Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> But we can also be mikrokapseln sleep on the fresh wald- or lavendelduft spread. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Also here is there is a difference between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While the men a "kühlender" pflanzenextrakt birkenblättern is used, so that the matratzenbezug can absorb the heat and cool the body, have the salary for women "wärmende" to be effective. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Extrakte from red paprikaschoten rain the blutzirkulation to, the weaker sex to sleep so wohlig warm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> And today's favoriten? </seg>
<seg id="72"> Matratzen from kaltschaum - he has more poren with devastated zellstruktur and is therefore atmungsaktiver than standard - polyurethan and also much more flexible. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Through the combination of the various stiff - tough - of kaltschäumen and visco-schäumen mehr-zonen-matratzen, create the know exactly where head, hip and fersen are. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> For a quality matratze has, however, to berappen 7000 kronor and more. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Gesundheitsmatratzen but usually with lower VAT is, since they are considered medical tools. </seg>
<seg id="76"> Receiving the first Czech companies have gumotex this advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> You see, in the matratze and on to save rost is not as easy as it seems. </seg>
<seg id="78"> From time to time there are sonderangebote of manufacturers and traders, the two matratzen offer for the price of one. </seg>
<seg id="79"> So the brand magniflex provides the matratze duofreeze with in regard verstepptem being solved visco-schaum memory for 11.990 czk. </seg>
<seg id="80"> The second we get free to do so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the material tempur that the era of viskoelastischen schaumstoffe launched with open zellstruktur and high density in almost kosmischem speed. </seg>
<seg id="82"> No surprise, they have been developed for the NASA, because the astronauts are with the launch huge überbelastungen suspended. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83"> Tempur in heat soft, in a cool setting it, in turn, strengthens. </seg>
<seg id="84"> So it is perfect to the human body and distributed on the körperdruck optimum way. </seg>
<seg id="85"> It is, therefore, not only to prevent druckbrand ideal, but generally the schlafkomfort increased. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86"> Viskoelastische schaumstoffe but not only in matratzen, but also in other gesundheitsprodukten, for instance, used in particular fußpolstern to give the legs and the gefäßen relief. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Local manufacturers use for example of the schaumstoffe eucatherm C, twinsaver or similar products. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Czech Army be released 445 kilometres, purchased zündschnüre with explosives were used. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the year before the Defense Ministry had already 224 km zündschnur delivered to the armeelager. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have ausgesorgt for 225 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The problem is only the span of the zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The army, bought the zündschnüre the company stv GROUP a. s. for läppische 40 million kronor. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In his justification for the purchase of this huge amount of zündschnur said the General Staff issued mf dnes, the soldiers would each year from the 60 kilometres zündschnur use. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to the research of armeepyrotechnikern mf dnes point raised, it is clear from this indication that the whole army, would have a very intensive pyrotechnic training every year - all generals and officers of the armeekommandos, right up to the secretaries and putzfrauen. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Defense Minister alexandr Vondra, and army general vlastimil picek not excluded. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Only in this way could be significant annual consumption of 60 kilometres zündschnüren reasonably justified. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This length calls for 25,000 detonationen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> But even so they could armeebestände rich for more than ten years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But if nor the old rule of experts is that the training of any new military professionals two metres zündschnur is quite sufficient, then, by this, the army has neueinkäufe - from the point of view of the increased needs of the pionier- and special units - created a reassuring stockpile for the already mentioned, 225 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> However complained soldiers of the schnelleinsatzbrigade recently on Secretary of Defense Vondra, they had almost no patronen for small arms, so that schießübungen are severely restricted because of the lack of funds. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Not to mention the unterhosenmangel. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="16"> "Me, is also not, why they buy such quantities of zündschnüre from us." </seg>
<seg id="17"> But this is your final decision, they are already know what they need to." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "For us, the army is a good customer, which we, as traders largely contrary to want to come," says the vertriebsmanager stv group Jan děcký. </seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Jan děcký talks of the stv group but only by a four years of gebrauchsdauer zündschnüre and police and armeepyrotechniker even only in two years' time. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The four mentioned years possible "with perfect storage are likely," puts one of them, but wants to remain ungenannt in order not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> At the end of the gebrauchsdauer any weapons must be thoroughly tested, whether it is reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But these tests are not in vain, but cost more money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Another argument in the Defense Department is the mengenrabatt for the 445 kilometres zündschnur. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "It cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 244 miles," the spokesman pejšek tells us the position of the einkäufer of the Defense Department. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Only for comparison, the annual consumption of zündschnüren pyrotechnikern the police, the ammunition in the Second World War, or the Soviet bruderarmee withdraw, even for a number of years hardly exceeds 1500 metres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> And the police only ever ordered such quantities of these weapons, which it before the end of the gebrauchsdauer can use. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The security is already the pyrotechniker because of, it is also the opportunity to flexible purchases more advanced and therefore reliable zündschnüre open. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The Defense Ministry has already massive problems for the liquidation tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition in times of the Warsaw treaty, when the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak prepared People's Army in its campaign on the Rhine. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="11"> He added that the army will not have to do without zweisitzige fighter planes, because the Defense Ministry in May 2009, with aero vodochody a 200-millionen-vertrag on the reorganization of the four unnecessary l-159 signed to the zweisitzigen version. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="21"> The purchase of aircraft Casa also may still have a legal sequel. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The European Commission, sued the Czech Defense Ministry at the European Court of Justice. The reason? It should have been the aircraft due to select a ganzeuropäischen tender and not by a single mention producers. </seg>

<seg id="5"> There lie is on the banks of the Euphrates; the next major city, 30 miles away, is dair as-saur. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Its name comes up in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency - IAEA - when it comes to the reactor, the Syria said to have built with aid from North Korea in the quader, hidden in a valley, which the electricity does not have. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing of the us-auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA from 2008, would be the end of April, under the name of the Middle ortschaft el-kibar have been geläufige reactor is a good way to produce plutonium - from which could build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Is the technology from the fifties are not against for other purposes. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA conducted a videopräsentation before with unscharfen satellitenbildern. </seg>
<seg id="10"> By computeranimation blendete you, where the components of the reactor fell before the destruction due to be have been the copy of the North Korean model from the atomzentrum was yongbyon. </seg>

<seg id="12"> The reactor is just stood in front of the opening, it said, but still not have been with brennstäben apply. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Now, more than three years after the bombing, is little more known as it was then, the mystery have been increasing rather in time. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The former US President George W. Bush has recently in his memoirs, revealed that the CIA before the attack was quite sure that Syria is in el-kibar a reactor was built, but saw little evidence that there was "an active's nuclear weapons programme" in the country. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some geheimdienstler In Europe there is cautious and preferred to talk only of a "Alleged reactor," even if you believe the cia-präsentation for "plausible." </seg>
<seg id="16"> They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Asked how safe it is to have a reactor in front of them, said a high un-diplomat only briefly in the summer, the IAEA have "enough material in order to ask questions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The rubble of supposed "lost militärgebäudes" created the Syrians in a hurry to one side and planierten the site thoroughly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, iaea-team took place in June 2008 under the former chief inspector Olli heinonen in el-kibar trace amounts of uranium, which was made by people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Also received the IAEA on a Member State satellite commercial providers from the period immediately after the attack, which might be stronger than the presented by the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="21"> To get these recordings on the market are not, however, because of the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - it has bought exclusively. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The IAEA can therefore not independently verify their authenticity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always claimed that never operated a clandestine nuclear program or to have built a reactor. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium come by the Israeli weapons, Damascus declared. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But the, the IAEA according to analysis of the particles as unlikely back. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it, just like on the satellite. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the ashes of the zerbombten building. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But Israel, too, is adamant. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We will never comment on that," confirmed recently at the time of the attack acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert the official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> So the investigation of the case since June 2008 schleppt out fruitless and "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority," as a high Western diplomat on the IAEA headquarters in Vienna for - it is a serious violation of the NPT in the room, watching over the the IAEA. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As a key to making progress on the information, the IAEA appears to be three more bodies, the need to be "in functional link" with the alleged reactor - and in a different way than this still exist. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In doing so, the UN weapons inspectors have not yet disclosed to the facilities that are involved, or what role they have or what they are suspicious can. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to information provided by the süddeutschen newspaper they will be in the IAEA internally as marj as-sultan, masyaf and iskandariayah calls, in turn, derived from nearby cities. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington - isis - has identified these places and on satellitenbildern a gebäudekomplex in masyaf tracked down, where it is most probably is one of the suspicious objects. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It is probably in or directly next to a base - just with Syria denied that argument the IAEA access to the three places. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In Vienna, the Syrians who feared a fishing expedition, it states that the IAEA will vorgeschickt by the United States so as militäranlagen auszuspähen. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Since the nukleardetektive were by a tipp of us-geheimdienste become aware of the institutions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has evidence, including satellitenfotos that lie between the three places and the quader on Euphrates material back and was moved. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the sites "in connection with the brennstoffproduktion" could stand. </seg>
<seg id="40"> But there was "no evidence of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes, which are needed to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The reaktortyp will be pursued with uranium that is not enriched. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But where the uranium should have come from and where it will have on the plutonium for the bomb should be separated on these key issues, there are at most plausible conjecture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> What is also unclear is whether pieces of debris that could be the valuable traces Mountains have been stored in the three places. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As if the hundreds of lastwagenladungen disappear from the ground, no one wants to have any information as to where the remaining rubble. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Which is only a few kilometres from el-kibar lie on the other side of the Euphrates to salzmine al-tibni, the Syria in 1998 on their competence as a camp for radioactive waste has investigated, the IAEA is regarded as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The former iaea-inspektor Robert kelley had it in a recent analysis of satellitenbildern for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review associated with the reactor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Recordings from the orbit but show that Syria is undertaking in the three suspects places erdarbeiten and large container distant, after the IAEA had requested access. </seg>
<seg id="48"> This can be a coincidence, but has done little to dispel the suspicions. </seg>
<seg id="49"> It is also in diplomatenkreisen, the IAEA have spent many months to develop a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to respect any militärgeheimnisse - alone shows how large the interest of the inspectors is the effort. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Damascus, however, bügelte this proposal as well. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Western diplomats in Vienna have had a year ago contained the reactor is destroyed, therefore have no high sense of urgency, brings about the matter us-botschafter Glyn Davies' sonder-inspektionen comes in for a few months, one of the strongest possible means, the Vienna atombehörde has to enforce controls. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Iaea-chef yukiya amano that inspections should propose that has been of "an option, for which I am open in the future," but he still is spoken. </seg>
<seg id="53"> There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand it needs to ensure a majority in the gouverneursrat of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries are represented there anything other than keen on an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other hand, as a diplomat to bear in mind: "What if they find nothing in the end?" </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The democracy movement in Latin America will be stronger, as the support of private companies. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Crime is a bigger problem than the unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil's larger than that of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="5"> At these results, the latinobarómetro-umfrage, carried out in 18 countries and exclusively in The Economist has been published. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This poll will be held regularly since 1995 and shows that the meinungswechsel in this region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Fall two facts in this year's survey in September and October particularly in's eye. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First of all the good mood in Latin America </seg>
<seg id="9"> And, secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In many countries of the South American pazifikküste has increased greatly - S. Table 1 - the Democratic Movement. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In Peru, for instance, where the economy grows by around 6 percent each year since 2002, the number of demokratiebefürworter rose from 40% in the year 2005 to 61% this year. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Also in Mexico, where the economy recover for the sharp drop in the last year, is such a trend. </seg>

<seg id="14"> Some 44% of the respondents said that they be satisfied with the democratic practice of their country. That is much as in the last year, but 25% - diagramm 3 - more than in the year 2001. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some 34% trust the Congress of your country and 45% of their government. Both figures are those of last year, but show a sharp increase in comparison with 2003 - 17% and 24% -. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> A decade ago undermined Latin America's economic crisis the efforts to achieve more democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> That lasted during the Great Depression, this is probably due to the fact that the countries of Latin America saw only a brief rezessionsphase and a speedy recovery. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, the poor by a stronger sozialnetz instead. </seg>

<seg id="20"> But from country to country, there are strong stimmungsunterschiede -. diagramm 4 -. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread fortschrittsdenken. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Mount was in Mexico and Central America, where the recession and heinous crimes have increased, it is less the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Only the second time since umfragebeginn see many asked in Latin America in the crime in their country a greater problem than in the unemployment -. diagramm 5 -. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Around 31% to say that either themselves or a family member last year have been victims of a crime. but to reach 38% in the last year, dropped to the values and thus was the lowest since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The increase in economic performance is reflected in the Greater support of the private and the market economy: around 71% of those surveyed überregional said that the private sector is vital for the development, there were 56% in the year 2007 -. diagramm 6 -. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Some 58% said that only the market economy can bring their country progress, compared with 47% in the last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly, 62% of the surveyed in Venezuela this view - and 80% are in favour of a private sector - maintained, although their left president, Hugo Chávez, many private companies nationalized. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil has according to 19% of the surveyed - 18% in the last year - the greatest weight in the region, followed by the United States - 9%, unchanged since last year - and Venezuela - 9% in comparison with 11% last year -. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The respondents in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, but this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua will be followed by Venezuela. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández emerged a wave of sympathy that their beliebtheitsrate shoot upwards to more than 50% by 20 points. This is the highest level since its election in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Whether it to be a reelection next year will, however, depend on whether or not the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández kompromissbereiter than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner néstor Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The signs are not clear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Néstor Kirchner, even after the election of his wife, drew the economic policy, often budgets to are not fully take into account the tax revenues, the economic growth and inflation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This allowed the präsidentenpaar to spend the extraeinnahmen after its own views. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On paper, the fernández-regierung lost the majority in Congress in the last year. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is divided and Kirchners death after a heart attack leading to further zerwürfnissen on October 27. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some dissidents in the ranks of the ruling peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But after chaotic meetings - in which a parliamentarian another in the face, and others, the government proposed the bribery bezichtigten - managed the Congress not to adopt the budget for 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I will not discuss this matter," the president. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The 2010 budget is now for the next year, which the President still has more opportunity to spend money to its own views. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy is hot: Probably it will increase by up to 9% in this year. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official rate of inflation is z.z. 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions, are driving the value to nearly 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner, who took over the post in 2003 when Argentina was ridden with economic crises, said to his main objectives, and not the inflationssenkung growth and poverty reduction. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He refused the cooperation with the IMF, singled out for the private sector and säuberte the National Institute for Statistics and Census indec, which then the official inflationsstatistiken schönte. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Fernández can take a mäßigeren route now? </seg>
<seg id="18"> It has called on the private sector and the trade union leaders for talks. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And according to official statements should be limited to 18% wage increases in the next year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The high prices in Argentina's agricultural products have been a strong boost the economy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the inflation undermined the wachstumsschub by a great devaluation in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Cristina Fernández For this reason, Argentina finanzwirtschaftlich probably wants to return to join in the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="23"> At the beginning of this year, the government is an agreement with wertpapierinhabern, which had rejected the previous rescheduling of the country in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Now appears Fernández on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club to press, which it owes about $6.7 billion. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Kirchners have had a review by the IMF, as usual, always rejected elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But last month, the economy minister amado boudou, announced that the Fund in the drafting of a new national index of consumer prices will make "technical assistance." It seems that this would be the first step towards the cleansing of the indec. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not known whether Fernández after ending its term of office, even without the support of her husband will be politically active. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If so, it needs to get the support of the middle class, most of which have enough from the kirchnerismus. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the Argentines in March from their return to their summer holidays, will be the wave of sympatie, which has been shown to their abgeebbt. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If they win another election, they must decide whether they would like to many of her husband's political decisions quietly are lifted. </seg>

<seg id="9"> In a presidential election would mean that for MA problems. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Since his election two years ago, the support of his party has fallen by about 8%. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For the first time, the DPP even in the councillors together with the KMT. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> During the election, there was the usual events such as lastwagenkonvois with krawallmachern in Taiwan, flaggen-schwenkende massenumzüge and only sparsely clad tänzerinnen. </seg>

<seg id="21"> The Taiwanese people love their de facto independence, and reject China's militärbedrohung. </seg>
<seg id="22"> For this reason, the KMT its relations with the government in Beijing do not like to the fore. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But this time also avoided the DPP, the anti-chinesischen feelings to stir up too much. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy without China cannot survive. </seg>

<seg id="18"> Paul coggins, hauptverteidiger what Mr ensign, said in an interview on Monday that he had received a telefonanruf of a Public Prosecutor and another the next day, in which he has been told that no complaints against his clients will raise the Ministry. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Mr ensigns defenders had cooperate with the public prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator, as his office in a statement on Wednesday repeated once again, has "acted in accordance with the law." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr coggins rejected it, the legal arguments that he had put forward to the public prosecutors to explain more closely. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "I am not aware of this, in the gesprächsdetails between the Ministry of Justice and I only to go. As far as I was saying: we believe to have made the right decision," he said. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Thursday, the process of Steven J. hayes, closely following the cheshire was accused of three members of a family, connecticut to have killed, a formal end to find, if the richterspruch has spoken out about the death sentence, which the jury, to do it. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But Mr hayes lawyers have already submitted requests in courts to explain the reasons for appeal and the courts will deal for years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> One of the provozierendsten reasons is that as a result of the intensive coverage of the process, through the extensive use of twitter of durchschnittsreporter - a zirkusatmosphäre "and a" widespread, immediate penetration aufrührerischer details had come, so that the jury had been influenced by the public indignation in an improper manner. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This appeal the appelationsgerichte could lead to deal with the question of whether the new rules in the court needed to be new technologies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "As I have seen it during this process, I believe, that there really is a danger if the entry of new technologies in the court each individual's right to a fair trial," said Thomas J. ullman influenced, Mr hayes hauptverteidiger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The presiding judge, jon C. blue by the Supreme kammergericht, rejected the applications last week by entscheid back In summary, when he said that the new media," would be carefully controlled," and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But that was with safety is not the last word in this matter. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For decades, gerichtseinsprüche have ascertained that the coverage of famous cases can doubt on the fairness of the process. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In its historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States the judgment against Dr Sam sheppard, a osteopathen from cleveland to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that lifted it because of the new media would have been a "karnevalsatmosphäre in the court,." </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some people believe that the fernsehserie and the spielfilm "on the run" is based on this crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some lawyers say that gerichtseinsprüche what Mr hayes conviction could look at half a century later, followed by the argument that new rules are necessary, for the kommunikationswege from the Court at the time of the case Dr sheppard were still inconceivable to regulate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "There is a good reason for about the influence of the new media in processes that are pursued by the general public, to be concerned," said John J. donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School, according to the death penalty in connecticut has investigated. His report, it will arbitrarily imposed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor donohue said, some of appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction a prompt communications out of the court could make the processes fair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The twitter-angelegenheit is just one of many that the lawyers of Mr hayes explain to delay for years to discuss, and therefore a conviction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defender, for example, claim that Mr hayes could already have been regarded with hostility under any circumstances, as a judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential juroren by granting them during the jurorenauswahl grausige tatortfotos showed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some of the juroren said that photos of the victims, jennifer hawke-petit, 48 years, and their tüchter, hayley, 17 years, and michaela, 11 years, they have met with disgust. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defenders say they would call into question the Constitution verfassungsmäßigkeit the death penalty, and argue that the judges a false juror have exchanged views, which would have been a critic of the Public Prosecutor's office, and that it is an improper manner would have exerted pressure on the ruling, when he had made the unusual decision to ask the panel to decide free over the weekend. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The juroren were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But their arguments about the influence of the detailed coverage of the process is attracting perhaps the biggest interest. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In a urteilsanfechtung which they have submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in connecticut and during the election campaign for the position of governor and for the US Senate has been discussed by the candidates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They argued that the new media constantly had reopened the flames of the emotions on the case. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "Such a equipped to cope daily surge of medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the gerichtssaals," the lawyers wrote, "it has been previously seen in New Haven and perhaps even Nationwide has not yet." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Its focus to the reporting by Twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct news are aufwieglerischer than reports, which are reimbursed, a technikfeindlicher look is slowing, the reporting about future trials verarme. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> But some lawyers said that appelationsgerichte would often faced with the argument, social and technical changes need the adaptation by the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr hayers lawyers reinforce this claim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In their appeal in relation to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the condemnation of Dr sheppard because of the reporting has been lifted and made it clear that the new rules require new media. </seg>
<seg id="32"> "This case," they wrote, "represents sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Zapatero and the Red Line Germany </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin has opted for the beibehalt of the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the whole of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tension in the markets have sparked a double response from the government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero put forward new adaptation measures, starting with steuerermäßigungen for small and micro, the regulation of the zeitarbeitsunternehmen or the lifting of 426 euro support for the unemployed, no unemployment benefits concern, through to the privatization of 49 percent of aena, the management of airports barajas and El prat and 30 percent of the state lottery. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, supports the Deputy regierungschefin, Mrs salgado, with the help of the former regierungspräsidenten Felipe González criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible herausbeschwört have the current crisis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How are these events to understand? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their public relations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it is about a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is Germany a fundamental new perspective to shape our future, the clashes with the maintenance of the old traditions of much of its partners. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In the face of the opposition in Europe one begins in Germany to spekuliern about three possible ways out of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first: a strong euro, with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro area. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The second: the return of the German mark - although it sounds currently more to science fiction -, supported by a majority of the public opinion, around 50 percent of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The third: a transformation of the euro in accordance with German proposals. It means that more macroeconomic control and strict management; punishment of the countries that the targets; some countries möglichereweise zahlungseinstellung broken, and the extension of the cost of possible adjustments to the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is clear and saw the beginning of has for some time. This is why there are no excuses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First 2009, as both the IMF as well as the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German Government will come up with a constitutional reform, in order to prevent it from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It was the first sign of the auseinanderdriften between what Germany for necessary - Strict steuerpläne and stable public finances - and the practices of its European partners, including France. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second sign, the Central European country, as Merkel the decision to rescue of Greece hinausschob painful. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Back then, it was. But the fact is that severely criticized the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were totally opposed to the rescue of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally, Merkel is in the last oktobertagen again with a clear position clear. It calls for a review of the agreement of the European Union, in order to allow for the rescue of a country and at the same time to hold private darlehensgeber On a bear part of the cost. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position has been interpreted as antieuropäisch, since they irlandkrise and the following on everything. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But her proposal, if somewhat sweetened, has been approved. In the next few months, we will be on the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures as of 2013, participate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has drawn a red line, the intends not to exceed it. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Says it all that, even if unpopular measures must be taken now - from that date to the old functioning of the euro, there will be no more. </seg>
<seg id="24"> 2013 will be the geburtsjahr of a new currency zone, in which the zuwiderhandelnden countries will be severely punished, can be forced to do so, to explain to go bankrupt and in this case the private sector must play a part of the cost. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows us that we need to take a hard wachstumskurs, with high savings and investitionsraten moderation of consumption, improving the productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive foreign trade salden. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The other option, which is based on debt and construction industry with huge löchern in the balance of payments, as it has been mentioned by Spain in boom times, simply will not be tolerated. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would do bad, not to understand it. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not just a question of the deficit by the year 2013 to three percent runterzufahren. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much tougher. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the worst thing we could do is to deceive ourselves in these conditions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Move I hope that the current turmoil in more calm. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And that we have the capability of the US will be offered, will use by the spring of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero has taken this so well, and his double Announcement - The promised reforms, after the meeting, with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday - points out that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, to create order in our own house, their way has caused. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But the Red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look so that would change anything in this. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Among the damaged options is that we take into consideration the with little serious countries fully leave gestopften euro area that should not be ruled out. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In this case, Germany still tell us, it could have warned us. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Tricks, like those of alonso and Ramos in the game against the ajax show erfindungsgeist, but not the will to avoid a penalty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Real Madrid - xabi supposedly of two players of the alonso and Sergio Ramos - has instigated exclusion a term in the game of 23 November against the ajax in the Champions League result, that has been shed much ink about whether it was a unsportliche act or not and whether any both players of the UEFA should be sanctioned. </seg>
<seg id="4"> As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before spielende - their team had already clearly won - time and played several fouls, so that the referee showed them the second yellow card. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way, and as the Real Madrid would give his group, the two players will meet the next ligaspiel mandatory sanction against the auxerre and embark on the next spielphase without cards. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Finally, the disziplinarkommitee the UEFA the coach of the clubs, José mourinho and the players with different amount of money involved, with two to play. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is so widespread that it part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport befolgten rules. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of that debate about the case is to set forth suggestions that a team of the club Real Madrid - the claims in its anthem edelmut and honour and on other occasions, his players for similar incidents had played the lead role, and it - on the dramatisierung punished by mourinho an episode has added to its long history more than theatralischer and provozierender engineers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case, the debate about whether this is not explicitly banned by the statutes action contradicts the principles of sport, that is to say whether these actions constitute a regelumgehung. In fact, this course of action is to avoid the Statute of the sport, but whose sense seem to. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this matter, the damage caused will lose the sporting spirit should be investigated. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sport spirit, defended the physical integrity of the counterpart, an aspect by these actions were not at risk because it was not aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the zuwiderhandelnden players an unjustified benefit from the gegenteam. It did not happen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradox of activity of the Real Madrid player is that it does not coincide with what we usually mean by falschspiel or regelumgehung made, because the avoidance of the rule was not secretly, in order to avoid a penalty, but it should be so long as possible so that they will be punished by the referee. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players from the penalty, happily waited. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is what kind of advantage the zuwiderhandelnden from the deliberate fouls Drew. </seg>
<seg id="17"> It should be pointed out that the rival either in a less favourable position was still benefits for the gespielte game were erheischt, because the obvious result of this action was that one's own team with less players had to continue to play. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have this players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Obviously, the advantage is that the next spielphase of Champions League without the players cards, which could threaten their participation in a future game, begin. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a long, up to a certain extent, uncertain advantage, given that the team could eventually leave. Moreover, it will the players with this kind of approach a penalty and go on in the second kartenzyklus, in which it because of kartenanhäufung with a card less than in the first cycle of retirement. </seg>
<seg id="21"> That means that it is not as clear, whether it really is an advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Ultimately do not against such incidents will lose the sporting spirit, belong to the strategic decisions, in order to benefit from the provisions of the broadest possible. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case, wanted to avoid the players not a sanction - that would be a clear case of regelumgehung real - rather, they wanted to choose when they undergo this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> It took a strategic decision to flee without a penalty to avoid or before her. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Although blur the line between imagination and regelumgebung is, I believe that this matter is a clear case of imagination. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the dispute has arisen as a result of two factors: because it came to two selbstausschlüsse and because of the nature of provoking regelübertragung. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The damage was done, the principles of the sport by these acts, is less ethical rather than aesthetic. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Wikileaks affaire has a double meaning. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On one side, it has, a scandal, the emerging as obvious scandal is just a scandal in sinner hypocrisy, which ruled the beziehunge between the states, the people and the press. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand, it has announced to extensive changes at international level, and is a taste of the dominated by recession future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But let us take one thing at a time. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file prepared by a Secret Service - of any nation - exclusively made up of zeitungsausschnitten. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits Berlusconi's throw from no more than what you to read for months - in any case in any old journal had - except for those whose owner was Berlusconi - and the shocking karikaturierte face gaddafis offered kabarettkünstlern already substance for their sketche for a long time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule, after the secret files should only from, is already known news is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go to a library, which covers esotherischen publications, they will discover that every plant - about the grail, the mystery of rennes-le-chateau, the templer or the rosenkreuzler - exactly a repetition of what has already been written in previous works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is therefore not alone, that the author will not publish research okkulter texts - yet, therefore, that he does not know where to find news on the nicht-existierende would be -, but because those who are the okkultismus to think of nothing different from what you already know, and confirmed what you already have learned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the erfolgsmechanismus by Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> As the geheimakten. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informer is wrong, and lazy - or limited spirit - is also the head of the Secret Service - he could otherwise be whatever libération - editor, for example, the only deemed to be true what he recognizes. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The top-secret information about Berlusconi, the American Embassy in Rome had sent the staatsdezernat were the same as those who newsweek already had published the week before. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> So why was such a fuss over the revelations that dossiers made? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On one side, is this what each educated person already know, that the messages, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then, the government can take each other could appeal or an aircraft, in order to make up for the dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small repräsentationsaufgaben, have turned in spionagezentren. </seg>
<seg id="17"> All of ermittlungsfilmen old viewers know this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that we should do to ignore this. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Still, the fact that it publicly to repeat, violates the task of hypocrisy and is used to set the American diplomacy in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In second place: the idea that a x-beliebiger hackers can tap the geheimsten SECRETS OF THE most powerful country in the world, carries the significant blow to the prestige of the staatsdezernats. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Furthermore, rather than the victims,, the scandal brings the "scharfrichter in trouble." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we are giving the deep nature of what has happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Former to combine Orwell times, it was all power as a Big Brother, the every gesture of his subjects controlled. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwell's prediction would be able to turn out to be quite right since then, where one can control every movement thanks to the telephone, each transaction made the hotel, visited the elected motorway and so on; the citizens would be in a total victims of auges of power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> However, what if we introduce, what is going on today that even the secret krypten of power can no longer the control of a hackers escape, it is said to be directed the kontrollgang to unilaterally and will zirkelförmig. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power to monitor all citizens, but every citizen, or at least the hackers, erwählt than vindicator of the citizen - can bring the secrets of power in experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> But how can keep a power, which is no longer in a position to maintain their own secrets? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is true, Georg simmel said earlier that A real secret is an empty secret - and an open secret can never be reveals -; it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's, in fact, is free of geheimis a secret, since it reveal the public sphere; but the styles of WikiLeaks disclose that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, meant to deprive them of any power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> WikiLeaks has done neither he nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama against it. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What will be the consequences of this violation, such a huge power has been done? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the States will make in future no reserved more online information - that would be a on the street corner angeklebten amount to aushang. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is also clear that it with the latest technologies in vain is hoped to be able to keep confidential reports on telephone secret. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is easier than moved to find out if and when a Head of State in a plane has contacted and one of his colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could be private and only for some ears certain relations in the future? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I am well aware that my prediction after science fiction and romanhaft sounds, but at the moment I am compelled to present the regierungsagenten, in a secret way preoccupied to uncontrollable marschrouten moving, order with their communications anywhere else, than the mere memory, and also the few written information they have, in the schuhabsatz verbergend. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information would be stored in single copy in closed existence: In fact, the Watergate spionageversuch had less success has been made, as WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity to write the technology today as a cancer is moving ahead, namely backwards. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A century after the wireless telegraf had revolutionized communications, a telegrafen reconstructed the Internet with - Telephone - draht. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The - analogue - videokassetten had allowed the filmforschern, a film volume for volume auszukundschaften by one from behind forward spulen and was able to reveal all of the secrets of the montage while the - numerical - CDs today allow nothing other than to jump chapter by chapter, which is in makroportionen. </seg>
<seg id="39"> With the fast trains going one within three hours by air from Rome to Milan, while this including the umsteigens requires three and a half hours. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It is therefore not exceptional return to car and horse that politics and communication technology. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> A final observation. </seg>
<seg id="42"> In ancient times, the press tried to understand what kind of secrets between the embassies were forged. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At present, it is the messages, call for the confidential information provided by the press. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Climate: as France its finanzversprechen schönredet </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A year after the Copenhagen, it is time to compliance with the Treaty quickly dissolved finanzierungsversprechen - also known as "almost start" or premature Finance - to investigate the developing countries have been dealt with. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And the rough French schönredereien are exposed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries have committed to allocate $30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France - which is 420 million per year - 1.26 billion euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> At the opening of the cop16, the EU held all the stops in order to convince its partners from the fact their commitment with regard to the fast-start-finanzierungen: detailgetreuer, large nebenevents, broschürenverteilung vorgehensbericht of its Member States, press conference. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The operation transparency is remarkable and extent of its real value estimated: the developing countries and the civil society would like to see all developed countries on the same präzisionsniveau made the same. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The EU announced to have released 2.2 billion euros in the year 2010, what you are on the right way to respektbezollung brings its commitment of 7.2 billion in the year 2012. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But if you looking into the details, things are a little more complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should be according to the Copenhagen treaty "new, and an additional," in order to ensure that an additional use has been tabled, without be to the detriment of the official development assistance. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what means "new and an additional." </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the EU Commission had recommended a harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today, everyone chooses the benchmark, which it regards as best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The EU Commission has, for example, a benchmark for those of the year 2009 for: the international finance are maintained, and is within the framework of the funding," fast-start "About 150 million for three years to do so. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries have similar guidelines, either in terms elected year or about conditions at the level of official development assistance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> By contrast, France was of the opinion that the funding of 'new projects "in the year 2010 are" new and an additional." </seg>
<seg id="17"> In other words, there are no guidelines on the spending of the previous year, or at the global level of official development assistance. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In practical terms, the total value of the French support the developing countries can remain stable - or even decline - - France is pretending to comply with its commitment with regard to the "new and additional funding." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another key element is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is still not rule, and each elects its rechenmodus about it. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, such as France, for example, are 1 lend _ as equivalent with 1 donated _. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This is apparently only it is hard to support them: the effort is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loans for certain profitable investment - often projects that are based on effektivster technology - allied to the emissionseindämmung can be justified, it is misleading, to present the euro, and we as a word for a Euro donated... should also captured only the cost of loan for the kapitalgeberland than commitment - that is to say the equivalent of interest rate - to be counted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France has nothing different in the sense than the following reasons: it '"respect its commitment of 420 million euros, making it 91,5% loans begin - 389,8 million euro - and 8.5% accorded - 36,1 million euro - -, see the EU documents in order to convince themselves. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only country of the EU that loans up on a large scale. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or the Slovakia - among other things - follow up their commitments to 100% with donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In other words, the vast majority of the European Union 1 _ spends to meet their commitments, France just 10 cents and understands including a similar efforts. </seg>
<seg id="28"> A hokuspokus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> All in all, France in its fast-start-finanzierung operates with a double fraud: to be part of a weiterentwicklkung of the action at the time, and the other part with the reality of the financial contributions. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France will be able to let it, believe that it 420 million "new and additional" has spent millions in accordance with its promise and saves it 36,1 million euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of Ministry of Finance - as it was in fact it seems that bercy to have carried out the arbitrage - could lead to a negative effect twice; even eu-intern - why the other Member States with the donations will continue, but if there is enough to lend? - and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries is not fully be fooled... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter of the premature finance only a small problem in a relatively short period of time in comparison to the whole of discussions on the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it could be the drop too much in the scale of the unfccc machine. </seg>
<seg id="34"> We hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As it always was, it is vital to its lesson to learn from this first year verfrühter finance. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In the first place, France could announce a change in its verbuchungsart for the 2011 to 2012, and in a spirit of respect for its obligations and of the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> But above all, France could make progress on the discussions on the long term streitgegenstand Finance - another, decisive and currently discussed subject -: you escapes the issue of "Not verrechenbarkeit" or the verbuchungsart of its loans. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could change its position, in order to be equally ahead of the curve on the disputes, as is the case for other things. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> So the hope is based on the new Environment Minister kosciusko-morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A surprising announcement on the fast-start of France and its vision of the "verrechenbarkeit" as well as the use of loans would naturally is necessary for The International Trust to raise the place for further discussion. </seg>
