Tech Toys is your gifts budget in balance. 
This year "s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, perhaps followed by a Microsoft Kinect Videokonsole. Both games can be a considerable hole in your gifts budget. 
The iPad will cost as much as five BMX-Räder for $99, while the price for a Kinect-Spiel about 10 classic Echternach rush or approximately 48 cans of Play-Doh. 
But you can protect your gifts budget. 
I recently visited in search of three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, and BJ's wholesale club. 
I was immediately clear that Moore's law came into force this year, was the technology toys are more efficient and cost slightly less than the same time last year. 
And while fewer new toys with their own website, will take place in the best known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, a wider offer. 
There are always more Knopfzellen-betriebene toys on the market, and many of them contain wiederaufladbare batteries. 
Here are some recommendations. 
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices of Toys "R" Us). 
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for children from the age of 3 years) are Plüschfiguren, as big as guinea pig to sing a note, if you are on their belly. 
Even with a push by mehrmaliges power, we can play a song. 
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony. 
Respect: When you started with the power that you can no longer stop. 
For a combination of Gesand and dance is the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60 for children from 2) the best choice. 
On the basis of the last year, developed Elmo doll live technology offers the animatronische change games such as' Simon says, 'and, thanks to the new interface feet with Radblockierung Moon-Walk they dominated. 
Children who use the device testeten, Mickey as a dance teacher, and their parents, however, complained about the lack of loudness. 
If you are a child of the 1980s, you surely remember in Alphie, one of the first computerized Lernspielzeuge. 
Now he is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for children from the age of 3), with a whole bunch of issue cards with a car journey to school can be an hour, with a preached with Autokorrektur-Funktion as a teacher. 
If you do not want your child to entrust your Smartphone, here are three independent alternatives. 
MobiGo of VTech ($60 for children 3 to 8) is the cheapest and benutzerfreundlichste solution with a qwerty-Tastatur. The Games, however, are not included as instructive as the on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children 3 to 12), the first major revision of the Leapster-Reihe Leapfrogs with a new, brighter screen. 
None of the versions is compatible with old cassettes. 
IXL from Fisher-Price ($90 for children 3 to 7) for the Games and eBooks used a system similar to iTunes and, thanks to the SD-Kartenlaufwerks can also be said to be family photo. 
Last but not least, there are still Scrabble Flash ($30 by Hasbro, for children from the age of 8). Five blocks are no bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED-Bildschirm. 
In the game, it is a question of the blocks to words together, before the time. It is a great thing for an improvised Buchstabierwettbewerb. 
More and more toys have a kind of Online-Verbindung. 
If you alone after the supply in the toy shops, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important. 
Is your child a Online-Tier in Club Penguin, for instance, you can pay a Disney's Club Penguin 2 'mix' N match figures package ($5 for children 6 to 12), buy a coin with a secret code. 
If you the code Online, keying in your child receives the club Penguin Store enough of the bill for a further two parts. 
The rolling shoes or a Puffle-Stofftier. 
The latest Kopfzellen-betriebene micro-supervisory robots, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not bigger than the head of your toothbrushes. 
The Käfer moves quickly to 12 vibrierenden silicone legs in any direction. 
It makes fun of him, through a maze of Klötzen. 
And he has quite a lot. 
Our fell from the kitchen table and on stage even some time in the mouth of the dog.
