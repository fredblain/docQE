The right mattress and the proper beds Rost? Women are different than men Wënsch 
Not the tollste bed frame, but the quality of the deck area - mattress and Rost make the good bed. 
They must, however, ways to accommodate the specific user. 
In choosing to play a role - many things the weight, size, the state of health and, last but not least, the gender of the Schläfers. 
Just as important is the Interieur, in the mattress and Rost. 
Typical example? 
In a Wochenendhaus, which is not on a regular basis, it is heated Latexmatratzen not well suited for much longer, as they need to be "warm". 
In addition, they are much more serious than usual Polyurethan-Matratzen. 
And, it should be changed regularly. 
If they do not have enough Entlüftungskanälchen the core and have to have a strong record, snarled up moisture, so it is not impossible that, under her mold. 
In the election, also plays a role, of course, what we used to. 
Anyone who has been a long time in the country, where very high with mattresses soft class, will be difficult to a low mattress with hard surface can get used to. 
"Probably all an ice-hockey, which have come back from the NHL, have complained to me about the fact that they are no longer able to sleep properly." 
"For their abgeschundenen shoulders, and hips will give out they need simply a soft layer from Visco-Schaum Foam (memory - a Formgedächtnis-Polymer)." 
"This, I recommend including sugar sick people is a disorder of the nervous system, so that they the" information "from the ligaments and skin can receive bad," says Sylva Hadamcziková to cushion furniture. 
That is why I have many Eishockeyspielern years ago, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco-Schaum Foam (memory). 
"Today, it is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer the manufacturer Tempur, among other things, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico." 
And one does not need to be a famous an ice-hockey the benefits of Visco-Schaums learn to appreciate. 
This "miracle" actually works quite simple. 
The sparkling optimalisiert his toughness and form absorbierten in the heat, in other words, it is downright schmiegt on warm body. 
Nowhere is it, passing in the night as it is not around after a major fight. 
You simply sleep much better. 
The sparkling viskoelastische also offers protection against Dekubitus (gangrene). 
In the choice of Matratzengröße should be to body size, the length of the Fußsohlen still add some 21 to 34 cm. 
Man as a woman, to the 180 cm big need as a 210 to 220 cm bed. 
Each of the Schläfer should at least 90 cm is widely available is 180 inches. 
In the case of, for example, Singles Einzelbetten are 120 and 140 cm appropriate. 
The own comfort and also for any visitors. 
Otherwise, the rule of thumb for the ideal bed broad: "If you are on the back, there is enough room for the easy angewinkelten arms," advises mine Prokopová. Helena, the Zunftmeisterin the Polsterer Raumausstatter and for years the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture, devoted to this issue in schools presents. 
In a Doppelbett needs every one of his own and his own mattress, but take care when buying products, so that the mattresses also are high. 
Otherwise, there is no other option but to the Roste different amounts of assembling and that is not, by a long way, in every bed framework possible. 
Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with the skeleton 15 cm, it should at least three centimetres on the form of class and the fine buffer. 
"With the hand or the Hinsetzen the feathers, we cannot in any way," warns Helen Prokopová feel. 
Every bed is a specific Rosttyp required. 
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and in a situation such as increased Siamzwillinge together have no place in the bedroom. 
These mattresses will not open and the reference you cannot wash of what is already the practice. 
And because you are in a single night between 0.2 and 0.75 ltrs sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years ago, becoming a huge (and congested 17). 
That is why experts are also advertising slogans in mattresses has a life span of up to 25 years, and even lifetime guarantee. 
Every cause has its ifs and buts. 
And that is why a practical advice of dealers: Mattresses of 120 and 140 cm breadth of the hygiene waschbaren abziehbaren, not shy, however, it is recommended that a Matratzenschoner, it is easy to use and can wash. 
Even if today usually Matratzenbezüge with Rundumreißverschluss be produced, so it would be after the opening two halves gets (immensely important for the Waschvorgang and washing machines size!), is the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially alone, often as the unequal fight between David and Goliath. 
They are in bed instead of a Rostes a solid record? 
Get out of it. 
Or a maximum of a bed for unloved guests and for a single night. 
The record, they should also be better equipped with ventilation holes (if not already in) and mattresses with the skeleton and 15 cm floor with so-called pocket the core and buffer. 
Polyurethan-Matratzen are in such a situation. 
For not verstellbare Lattenroste with 14 to 18 pen (Lamellen) are Latex- or Sandwichmatratzen (perhaps also appropriate combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay is Roste with a larger Lattenanzahl, from 28 and more stroke play, with Lordosenstütze in Lendenwirbelbereich, and the possibility of the Lattenhärte to regulate. 
At verstellbare Lamellenroste are no mattresses with the skeleton, because they do not respond to the ergonomische pretexts. 
In addition to the suspension of stiff the pen will provide specific, flexible Schultermodule required. 
This is a specific strengthen the pen, which allows the pen, or even to make einzudrücken verwinkeln that the one-off Einsinken Schläfers of the shoulder. 
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important matter. 
There are even Matratzenhersteller which have started, "Herrenmatratzen" soft zone in the shoulder area. 
The ladies also thought - is fighting them these soft Hüftgegend in the zones. 
For most demanding customers are punktelastische wing pen systems (Lattoflex Roste with points), or mixing with the so-called Multitorsionsfederung Kontakt-Pads burden. 
The pressure will be distributed to a number of issues, causing the tension is reduced. 
But, if you are on the right mattress and right Rost a bad (and big) Kopfkissen fülliges used the most benefits are lost. 
Here, too, a rule of thumb: The Kopfkissen to the head, his top should only up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles to relax. 
Ideal is therefore a 50 x 60 cm big cushions, for example, the Scandinavians. 
In the pages of this situation should Kopfkissen (along with the shoulder discharge area in Rost or the soft zone in the bed) the shoulder level. 
Some have mattresses have our modern with the old (with hay full) Strohsäcken but common. 
Increasingly modern manufacturers use natural materials, or at least their mixtures. 
Also in mattresses means the new magic word "organic." 
Instead of raw oil is used to manufacture Polyurethanschäumen frequency of natural oils figures - for example, Rizinus- and soya oil. 
Soya is used by all the well-known manufacturers. 
"Organic mattresses, in other words, the core of it is purely natural materials," says Petr Vašíček Tropico Plus by the company. 
Natural substances, but they are also used in the manufacture of Matratzenbezügen - one of the first was Aloe Vera. 
But you can also indulge in the capsules micro-supervisory sleeping in fresh woodland or Lavendelduft spread. 
Here, too, there is a difference between a man and a woman. 
While the men a "kühlender" Pflanzenextrakt from Birkenblättern Matratzenbezug is used in order to absorb the heat and cool the body can have the salary for women "wärmende" effect. 
Extracts from red Paprikaschoten stimulate blood circulation to the weaker sex with the sleeping wohlig so warm. 
And today's favorite? 
Foam mattresses from cold (he has greater Poren with devastated Zellstruktur and, therefore, is breathing more active than usual Polyurethan trade, and a much more flexible). 
The combination of various stiff (severity) by Kaltschäumen and Visco-Schäumen Mehr-Zonen-Matratzen arise who know exactly where head, hip and closely. 
For a high-end mattress, though, has 7,000 SKR and more to fork out. 
Gesundheitsmatratzen, but usually with a lower value added tax, but as a medical device. 
The first Czech companies were Gumotex this advantage. 
You see, in the bed and the Rost to save is not so easy. 
Now and again there is a special offer of manufacturers and dealers, the two mattresses for the price of one. 
It offers the brand Magniflex the mattress Duofreeze with the memory for 11.990 verstepptem Visco-Schaum CZK. 
The second will be free to do so. 
It was the evidence that the era of the Tempur viskoelastischen sparkling materials with open Zellstruktur and high density in almost kosmischem pace was launched. 
No wonder they were but for NASA because the astronauts are taking off in the enormous excess strain. 
Tempur will heat soft, cool environment cemented it in turn. 
So it fits perfectly in the human body and distributed in an optimal way the physical pressure. 
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent pressure fire, but generally the sleep increased comfort. 
Viskoelastische sparkling substances will not only with mattresses, but also for other health products, such as used in specific Fußpolstern, the legs and the Gefäßen to provide relief. 
Use local manufacturers, for example, the sparkling substances Eucatherm C Twinsaver or similar products.
