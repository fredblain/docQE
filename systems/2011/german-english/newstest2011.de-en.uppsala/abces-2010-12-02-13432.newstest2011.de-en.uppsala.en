Popular Party won four seats in the US Congress and the PSC lost 9 
With the results of 28 November could the PP in the city of Tarragona Lérida, and Barcelona have a crucial role to play 
After the major Stimmen- and Members increase in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking forward to the general election - or not their expectations are more than positive because the number of votes that the party in the elections, is usually twice as high as that in the elections, in Catalonia. 
So, the Catalan People's Party 610.473 votes in the parliamentary elections of 2008, while the figure in the regional elections in 2006 only 316.222. 
Last Sunday the PPC reached 384.091 votes. 
If these rising trend - result of the diversion of the vote share of the PSC and the capture of the electorate - should encourage the PP, analysts predict that the People's Party in the parliamentary elections the PPC from 8 to 12 members of Congress could also rise, while four (CiU it now has 10) before and the PSC at least 9 people (25). 
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE. 
According to the analysis of the People's Party would lose the ERC a Member of Parliament - at present, she has three - while ICV their members could keep or a will. 
The election calendar should be retained, however, the next date with the local elections in May 2011, and then the People's Party (PP), the voice on the scales for the Socialist leadership to an end, and in four provincial capitals and with their majority come in the City Council, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million for 2011. 
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC cities Barcelona, of Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona in which the Socialists neither a majority still on its traditional allies (ERC and ICV) can draw is going to lose. 
After the Republican debacle, it is not absurd that this party their representation in the local council emblematic, in which they should reach 5% of the vote is going to lose. 
The PP recorded, however, an increase in their share of the vote in the four provincial capitals and could the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona. 
The nationalists are convinced that the main role in Tarragonas turnaround to be able to play, where they were before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP government. 
Lérida It is the PP just 500 votes behind the PSC, Àngel. The mayor Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the recent election campaign leaders met on several occasions. 
In other important places, such as, for example, or Reus Castelldefels Badalona in the People "s Party, has been a significant growth. 
Currently, the PP in 34 city administrations of Catalonia, and aims to represent the creation of lists in so many places as possible.
