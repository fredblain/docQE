Controllers in Zwielicht 
EFSA is the European Food Safety Authority is the experimental Genpflanzen vitiation industry. 
This accusation now the group of experts expressed Testbiotech, the independent institute for the impact of the biotechnology industry. 
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have it well documented," said Christoph Testbiotech-Chef then on Wednesday in Munich. 
The head of the Efsa-Expertengruppe for genetically modified crops, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa-Experte for years, are also under contract with the lobbyists Ilsi Association. 
The will of companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer paid. 
Kuiper have been instrumental in the Efsa-Prüfvorschriften worked for Genpflanzen and am in a clear conflict of interest, then criticised. 
The EFSA regulations are (way with position papers by the same wording Ilsi and deceive so that the imprint of the industry, which is the authority in Italian Parma will be checked. 
It is the second time that Testbiotech bemängle a conflict of interest. 
It was a high-level Efsa-Managerin recently without restrictions or transitional period for the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta - and have changed sides. 
The Central German radio (MDR) had recently personal links between kontrollierender authority and industry lobby, reveals what the Federal Environmental Office, as well as EU parliamentarians deconstitution has made. 
The EFSA, however, can see no conflict of interest. 
We will take every serious data back, even in the industry, as long as they are of the highest technical quality, it says in a statement. 
For the experts, the EFSA work, demand it not that they have no contact with the industry. 
But they would have to disclose it. 
Kuiper, his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US. 
This calls himself as a neutral forum for experts in science, industry and politics - among other things, the risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying contract. 
In the matter of independent experts and then criticise that genetically modified crops are currently without any feedingstuffs attempt in animals be allowed and that the response to environmental influences Genpflanzen not tested. 
"We want to know what, for example, in the field of genetically modified maize power," says then. 
Current practice is quite simply, isolated proteins, but not the whole Genpflanze to test how such an artificial no reliable results. 
"If you take the risks, as they are to be then?" Asks then pointed. 
It also provides Angelika Hilbeck so. 
The academic research since 1994 in the genetic engineering and is currently in the Technical University of Zurich. 
The industry in this area, as in the United States now in Europe is becoming more and more critical to influence or scientists to discredit. 
There is therefore hardly researchers, corporations are intertwined. 
For companies critical studies were in the rule was published. 
"The industry has controlled the security research," claims Hilbeck.
