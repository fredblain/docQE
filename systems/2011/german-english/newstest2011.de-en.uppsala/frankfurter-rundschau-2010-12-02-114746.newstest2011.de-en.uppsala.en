The trail of stones 
Uli Gsell has also what concerned that a total of about 400 kilos. 
On Monday night, he stood over Stuttgart station, the Tuba on the back. 
It was Demo. 
It was snowing. 
The history is well known: In September were the dredger angerückt and had started a large chunk of the northern wing. 
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against S21 Tieferlegung, the appeal of the railway station. 
The freeze when it came, was a big part of the wing in ruins.

The 44-Jährige with old stones. 
He has bought all of the demolition in Stuttgart fell. 
"It would be a shame for Schotter gemahlen or in the landfill will disappear," he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen, which was once a Wachhäuschen. 
They have insulted and threatened him, he explained, in September in the newspapers that he remains of the northern wing of the demolition company bought. 
But he has spoken with the S-21-Gegnern, for days on end. 
And he has told them that it now, however, nothing for the demolition. 
And if it is, then it is the most sensible, but if the stones to be used. 
Around 200 S-21-Gegner then took a serious Quader, on average, 80 kilos, little price 6,50 to 14 euros. 
As memory, but some in the hope of him on a reconstruction to be able to return. 
500 tonnes Rongen had bought 25 great truckloads. 
About half are still being stored in the forest, the rest has been sold. 
Garden owners, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer. 
From wherever they are and have been, as weggeschleppt boot and supporters were able to carry. 
The Stuttgart stones of contention have long turned in "Mäuerle" or limits of Kräuterbeeten. 
"In fact, this stone nothing special," says Rongen. 
"Would not be in the political component." 
He is in his SUV, makes a tour by 20 hectares great kingdom. 
He studied law and later broken off, biology, he has an interest in computers, and, after all, is stone dealer. 
Honey-lover and stone.

In the snow are skilful behauene sand stones. 
"They were even in the Dresden Marienbrücke," he explained. 
Elbsandstein, yellow and hot, he schwärmt. 
"My favourite stone". 
It is the way much of the forest. 
It shows a bunch: Red limestone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe train station. 
And on. 
"Beautiful Travertin." 
Once were the Stuttgart Neckarstadions Quader to the gallery. 
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart police Bureau, rötlicher stone is complemented with from the cathedral, St Blasien, Tuff Heilbronner from the hospital. 
What kind of work and what kind of effort, the sweat. 
If Rongen to think about how the stones by hand and drove past with simple bottles trains and horse carts were moved, he will very reverential. 
"It would be a scandal if Schreddern something like that." 
He is not rich have become immensely rich. 
But 14 people, the stone dealer today, moreover, in the forest Steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a Glasbläser and horticulturalists resident. 
"We are working very hard, but it is a good one," says the Resteverwerter. 
He must soon after Cologne. 
There, too, there are obstacles to save.
