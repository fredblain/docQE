Sport and rule bypassing 
Tricks such as Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will, a sanction. 
The supposedly of two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) has instigated exclusion in the game on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League that caused much ink has been spilled about whether it is a unsportliche action or not acted and whether both players should be punished by UEFA. 
As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before the end of the game (her team had clearly won) and played several Fouls time, so that the referee showed them the second yellow card. 
In this way, and, because the Real Madrid, his group would be the two players the statutory penalty for the next league match against Auxerre and without tickets to enter the next phase of the game. 
Finally, punished the Disziplinarkommitee of UEFA, the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players with different sums of money. 
The provocation of a yellow card in this or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football. 
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this game - following rules. 
Part of the debate about the images that have arisen case to the fact that a team of football clubs (Real Madrid and honour his anthem Edelmut and on other occasions, his players for similar incidents had punished play a major role in the process), and the drama by Mourinho, an episode more to its long history as a technician and provocative theatralischer has added. 
In any case, the debate is about whether this is not explicitly by the statutes of banned behaviour contradicts the principles of sport, this means a rule, if these actions bypassing. In fact, is this approach to the statutes of the sport, but it seems to make sense. 
On this issue, should the damage caused to the sporting spirit be investigated. 
The sporting spirit defended the physical safety of the players, an aspect that has been put at risk by these actions not, because it was not an aggressive game. 
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that, the zuwiderhandelnden players an unjustified benefit from the draw against a team that has not been done, too. 
The paradox of the action of the players of the Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally under wrong game or rule bypassing understand, because the circumvention of the rule was not made in secret to avoid a sanction, but it should be as noticeable as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. 
The players waited and the sanctions to go. 
Another question is what kind of advantage of the offender from the deliberate Fouls. 
Here it should be emphasised that the rival either in a worse situation still has advantages for the feigned erheischt game, because the obvious result of this was that your own team with fewer players weiterspielen had to. 
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not, on these players. 
The benefit is obvious, is that the players of the next phase of the Champions League game without a ticket that makes their participation in a future game could begin to threaten. 
But it is a long-term, up to a certain extent, uncertain advantage, because at some point, leaving the team could get to the players, and with this approach, a sanction and go in the second round on the cards for cards with a card accumulation less than in the first round of departures. 
So it is not clear whether it is a real advantage. 
In the end, such practices are not against the sporting spirit, including strategic decisions, in order to escape from the rules a maximum benefit. 
In this case, did not sanction the players handle (that would be a clear case of rule to bypass), they wanted to vote, when they will be. 
They met a strategic decision, without a penalty or avoid it. 
Although the border between inventiveness and regulatory environment blurred, I believe, is that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness. 
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: Because two even exclusions, and because of the type of provoking Regelübertragung. 
The damage done to the principles of the sport was caused by these actions, it is less of an ethical as aesthetic.
