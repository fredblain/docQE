Czech children appreciate with 'Fernet and rum, beer is out - it is simply too slowly 
'Fernet, rum and vodka, this time, for once, a good whisky, the father from the Hausbar has stolen. 
These are the drinks after enjoyed drunken Czech teenager below 15 most notbehandelt. 
No exceptions are the children their hangovers ausschlafen repeatedly in the hospital. 
This is from the experiences of doctors in similar cases in the arrival of the children's departments of clinics. 
"Beer or wine are totally out of fashion, because it is simply too long before you get drunk". 
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief doctor of the children in the resources department Hořovice Bohemian clinic. 
"Whisky, if it succeeds, the father of a bottle to deprive Hausbar, and if not, then at least 'Fernet or vodka. 
"Vodka has the advantage that it can interfere with juice, then he did not smell so strong," said the chief doctor. 
The speaker of the school hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him right. 
"Most often is' Fernet or rum." 
"This is today's alcohol trend, particularly in primary schools. 
"Sometimes it was also about slivovice of it at home," Mrs Jurinová led direction. 
Chief doctor Pelikán according to three 10 or 14-year drinkers in the hospital admission for a long time no exception. 
Before the clinic in Hořovice in which he has been working this year, he has been ten years in the Pädiatrie-Abteilung Motol of the hospital, where the ambulances angetrunkene ablieferten pupils from both near and far. 
"The girls had to be" allergic four times. 
"She started her career with 12 years ago, when it first time with 3.5 per mille alcohol in the blood and in combination with" Extase "was taken, described the doctor was" a very serious case. 
"She was in the exhibition site in Holešovice on any dance party." 
"The interesting thing is that it was her mother was not strange at all that their daughter came home 48 hours not surprised," the chief doctor. 
It is precisely the lack of interest by parents or their incredible tolerance in with its own Sprösslingen infringed, is regarded as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children. 
A true addiction in the true sense of the word, according to experts, it is not for children. 
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependency on alcohol and all related phenomenon to understand these children and this is not the case." 
Among those who have repeatedly alcohol, is mostly a negative familiär-sozialer background, "says characteristic Pelikán chief doctor. 
The spokesman for the hospital, according to Mrs Jurinová Motol by the middle of November, has around 40 drunken children in our department assigned medicine for children and young people. 
However, only the cases with serious alcohol poisoning, a hospital stay was needed, in the statistics. 
Drunken children, the ambulatory care of the parents or possibly brought home by the police are not registered. 
In addition to the cases in which children just so a bottle of spirits in at a school desk austrinken there is, in the opinion of Mr Pelikán Amplituden three year period, to the 100% is good: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year. 
"The latter for two reasons - either because of poor testimony from pain or pleasure for the holiday." 
"I have already Walpurgisnacht seven drunken children at once seen in the reception," stresses Dr Pelikán. 
A betrunkenes child the night under medical supervision authorities, that is, paradoxically, better off, as a child, the next day, only with a nasty hangover. 
Then the headaches in the morning, and the consequent Glukosemangel, it is in the hospital with an infusion of flüssigkeitsspendenden with glucose and nutrients to the body is missing. 
"Clearly they are better off, because after the" fantastic "experience in the evening, raise them with good humour, something that without somewhere hurts." 
"They are just a little confused as to where they are," admits Dr Pelikán the patients, and he sometimes goes at least the good mood by showing them the cost itemises the treatment will cost. 
Because of the transport with the ambulances and the night in the acute beds are well and happy to a few tens of thousand kronor. 
"Sometimes I have it as an educational tool, when I used to visit the children have calculated what their drunkenness has cost, and that it may well happen is that they look at the entire holiday on the need to work for money for a single such Fete to earn more", added Dr Pelikán. 
In his view, the impact of health insurance but not to redress procedures in order to cure the trunkenen children necessary cost of the parents.
