Weak applause for China 
Taiwan's voters are slowly a closer connection to the mainland. 
What is Taiwan by its big brother across the Strait? 
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the electorate, to in the five districts of city mayors and city councils, and this is to choose a broad assessment of the President Ma Ying-jeou. 
Through the development of cutting-edge business relations, einschl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland, and its policy has the relationship with the mother country for the first time since 1949, lasting changes. 
Ma has the test, but only barely. 
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT), three of the five mayors, it received a majority vote. 
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has a greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the votes, the KMT was 45%. 
In a presidential election, it would have for Ma problems. 
Since his election two years ago, the share of the votes of his party by approximately 8%. 
For the first time, indeed, the DPP, coupled with the KMT in the city councils. 
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as convoys of lorries with Krawallmachern, Flaggen-schwenkende mass parades and only scantily clad dancers. 
There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt. 
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT held on the eve of the election, a speech at a KMT-Kandidaten 
When he was a man out of the deal in the face of schoß was wounded and a lien and umstehender spectators were killed. 
Bizarre wiser is not clear whether the shooter Lien kill or settle a dispute with the candidates. 
Regardless of the attack, according Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the election and the DPP in a bad light, as the KMT has brought more votes. 
China may have been the biggest winner of the campaign. 
Remarkably, relations with the mainland was not raised. 
Instead, the candidates debated on plans to social housing and the creation of jobs. 
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence, and China "s military threat. 
For this reason, the KMT their relations with the government in Beijing is not like to be in the forefront. 
But this time, the DPP, also steered clear of the anti-Chinese feelings too much. 
They reacted to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy without China cannot survive. 
Ma, in turn, would not confirm that the majority of Taiwanese its China policy. 
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy, Taiwan with economic incentives to attract in the community. 
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei for a summit to investment security and medical collaboration. 
Certainly it also wants a political integration, but the most important thing first. 
So it is better to wait until after the presidential elections in 2012. 
The DPP has now reinvented. 
Two years ago, she has been greatly weakened, the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption. 
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was strongly for the complete independence. 
But under Tais reign has developed a new generation of gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the professionals and the young. 
Tsai of the DPP took place as a presidential candidate, Su Tseng-chang great approval under Chen. 
Their party is doing everything to show that it is also in a position to build close relations with Beijing. 
Tsai is planning a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China. This, however, presupposes open-minded discussion. 
Tsai said publicly that their party "will offer a" credible alternative to massage vorschneller rapprochement with China. 
Chen seems very angry about this change. 
From his cell, he said of the candidates, the DPP would have done better to Taiwan's independence. 
He called for the pragmatists Su even to the presidential candidacy. 
Chen also without interference is the DPP difficult to their possible candidate to choose. 
The KMT will own analysis of their own. 
Ma's values are bad, in spite of rapid economic growth; the KMT-Kandidaten wanted their election campaign without him. 
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor. 
According to the testimony of a KMT-Sprechers his Cabinet, he will, as well as the local facilities. 
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is a rapprochement only restricted. 
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese economic cooperation with China as inevitable. 
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is a point of no return".
