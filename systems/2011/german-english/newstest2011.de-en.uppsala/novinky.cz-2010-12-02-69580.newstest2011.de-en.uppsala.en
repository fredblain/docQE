Pilsner soil Fund - arrests by the police in a public tender 
In the building of the soil Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police in the last few days of arrests. 
It was the European media entrepreneur and property dealer Luboš G. of the Detektiven in handcuffs. 
This was supposed to be held to a particularly public competition handling Restitutionsansprüchen to manipulate that the competition offered land a specific stakeholders zufielen. 
This should Luboš G. to have paid more than half a million. 
"At this stage, I can only confirm that the police a person for the offence of fraudulent activity in a public competition is Antonie Zelená," said the head of the Public Prosecutor of the newspaper "Právo Pilsner," further details regarding she could not provide the ongoing investigation. 
Twenty-four hours later, the business again 46-jährige released by the police. 
How he was able to manipulate the public competition, we can, given the paucity of official information only speculate. 
The speaker of the soil Fund Lubomír Černá led to the question of Právo, the police have the soil Pilsner fund actually arrests and this during a public competition. 
"It was about a client and nothing to do with our staff," took it. 
The public competition was Mrs Černá that the correct name 'call for tenders of demands for the transfer of land, in accordance with the law "and would be held in cases in which a number of applicants interested in the land bezeigen offered. 
"These persons are in the context of a higher value of their through the transfer to begleichenden Restitutionsansprüche than the declared value of the property." 
"In line with the offer of claims will be the order of the potential acquirer, then gives the soil fund the land on the person with the highest offer," said the spokeswoman of the fund. 
Luboš G. were obviously information is available to anyone who had registered on the request, and as he himself was justified because he had bought a number of Restitutionsansprüchen, he offered a basic piece of interests that he was going to withdraw from the competition. 
Obviously against a fat compensation. 
It would also be a sufficient explanation for why he his detention in such a large amount of money to be had. 
Luboš G. had been in the past, very good contacts to the Pilsner land fund. 
So he also played in the issue of the former leaders of the soil Fund Václav Sankota a role to which he was prosecuted because in Ersatzrestitutionen plots, which already location decisions on construction projects had been taken. 
At the time, acquired Luboš G. from the soil Fund, for example, land for the construction of public roads that were destined to be more precise, on the site of the construction of the Zufahrtsmagistrale the industrial area Borské Pole was planned. 
He later exchanged this very well with the government against a house directly in the historic centre of the city, the value of the land far exceeded. 
At the town hall had to be taken with a heavy heart that works not by blocking of the land.
