The old nursing home that the deaths are not due to "lack of action" are 
The owners of the old home in Olot does not preclude their carers of elderly people killed eleven 
The leaders of the old nursing home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) yesterday a press conference, in which she revealed the damage the criminal acts - Joan Vila Dilmés of nurses, during his work at least eleven old people, for which he was responsible, was killed - the establishment had caused. 
The director of the elderly home, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, in court, Joan Cañada on and announced, "La Caritat would like the responsible (for the deaths accuse)," but the "right and our liability force us the process and civil liability". 
The establishment is not only a society to lose, because they see the criminal acts of the Pflegers not found in time, but there is now also a high amount of compensation to be paid by the legal representatives of the families of the victims will be calculated. 
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime in August 2009 and that further since then, he has been murdered. 
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - the former patients of the old nursing homes - because it was suspected that no doctor personally have investigated the dead, but the formalities because of their age and diseases have been handled by phone. 
The head of La Caritat prominent this point, and has stated flatly that "lack of action any time the cause of the incidents may have been". 
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "there was no evidence in the legal dispute for negligent acts a person other than the accused." 
The "Angel of Death" getaufte 11 murders confessed to the other day and said that the first crime committed on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later, the second old lady. 
In this case he killed with an overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first crime in which he was a mixture of various sedatives. 
The head of La Caritat said the access of staff to the drugs is difficult to control. 
The insulin injections and cocktail of sedatives, the nurses in six of the nine crimes committed in patients with the death of her suffering. 
But the results of the lab tests are to be seen whether Vila is lying and his first victims actually have a less gruesome death, or whether it is this from the inside, by offering them Bleichlauge ausbrannte verabreichte according to the confession, as he had done in three women, between 12 and 17 October. 
In La Caritat listens to the testimony of the Pflegers no faith, not even say what the number of murders, which could be much more. This attitude is justified that Vila very different statements made in court, and that it would make no sense, his approach after eight successful murders suddenly change. 
They say that they did it for that reason, and in order to raise awareness of the impact of the events of the judiciary.
