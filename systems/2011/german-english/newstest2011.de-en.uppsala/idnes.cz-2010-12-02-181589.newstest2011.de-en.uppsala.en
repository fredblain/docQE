The army has so many Zündschnüre that you keep in the Czech Republic could umwickeln but only two years. 
The Czech army, 445 kilometres Zündschnüre be released, bought with explosives. 
In the year before, the Ministry of Defence already 224 miles powder to the army camp. 
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces for ausgesorgt 225 years. 
The only problem is the shelf-life of Zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years. 
The army bought the Zündschnüre of the Company, including STV Group. For a mere 40 million kronor. 
In its justification for the purchase of the huge quantity of powder DNES MF the General Staff said that the soldiers would be 60 kilometres a year to use the powder. 
According to the research by Armeepyrotechnikern, MF DNES point raised by this data shows that the whole army every year a very intensive pyrotechnische training course - of all of the generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaners. 
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and army General Vlastimil Picek is no exception. 
Only in this way can the substantial annual consumption of sixty kilometres Zündschnüren reasonably justified. 
This length to 25,000 Detonationen. 
But would these army stocks for more than ten years. 
But if the old rule of experts is that the training of any new professional soldiers two metres powder is quite sufficient, then the army by this Neueinkäufe - in the light of the increased needs of the pioneering special units - a reassuring supply for the above-mentioned 225 years. 
It complained the fast deployment Brigade soldiers recently to the defense ministers Vondra, they have almost no cartridges for hand-held weapons register more so because of the lack of resources are severely restricted. 
The underpants shortages. 
"Me is not why they are such huge Zündschnüre buy." 
But it is ultimately their decision, they are already know what they need to do that. " 
"For us, the army is a good customer, the dealer and, as far as possible we want to come forward," says the marketing manager of STV Group Děcký Jan. 
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defence for the purchase of hundreds of miles of powder with the army had it for at least ten years, with the "ammunition" heckle him. 
Jan Děcký of STV Group but talks only of a four-year duration of use and police and Armeepyrotechniker Zündschnüre only two years. 
"In perfect storage are probably also mentioned possible" the four years, one of them, but wants to remain unnamed, not as a soldier accused of criticism of the army. 
After the end of the long term must use any ammunition to be tested thoroughly whether they still are reliable and not the lives of soldiers at risk. 
But these tests are not free of charge, but will cost more money. 
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantities of rebate for the 445 kilometres of powder. 
"It cost us 60 per cent less than last year's supply of 244 miles," says spokesman Pejšek the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence. 
Just for comparison, the annual consumption of Zündschnüren Pyrotechnikern of the police, the ammunition from the second world war and the Soviet Army liquidate excess brother, several years almost 1,500 metres. 
And the police have only ever ordered such quantities of ammunition to use it before the end of the long term can consume. 
Already the safety of Pyrotechniker because, in addition, there is the possibility of a flexible purchases more modern and reliable Zündschnüre open. 
The Ministry of Defence has already huge problems with the winding up of tens of thousands of tonnes of munitions from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, as the Czechoslovak zweihunderttausendköpfige People's Army on their campaign to the Rhine. 
The Pyrotechnikern DNES MF raised, according to the Czech armed forces, expected in a couple of years ago, the same problem in the killing of hundreds of miles of old Zündschnüre today that it has bought as "good".
