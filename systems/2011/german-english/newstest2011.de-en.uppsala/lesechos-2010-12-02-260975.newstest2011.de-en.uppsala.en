The Berlusconi government is in Italy to cover 
For Italy after a worrying weeks early, the situation yesterday with the decline of Eckzinsen to 10 years a little more relaxed. 
A return to the deceptive silence. 
At the end of the meeting with the finance ministers from the region have had Giulio Tremonti the situation as "unentzifferbar" and qualify it with a "weekend" unvorhersagbaren have to listen to what to expect, but was denied by the person immediately. 
On Tuesday at least, the gap with the German interest rates, to its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk are on 263 points, which caused a certain Kopflosigkeit in Rome. 
Silvio Berlusconi was in the Council of Ministers, pointed out that the discrepancy of Spain to the German interest rates 400 basis points. 
His right hand, Gianni Letta, was, however, as "seriously concerned" by the "market turmoil" and the possible contagion from Ireland. 
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the eurozone, such as Greece or Ireland is not." 
"The bad news is that Italy, like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, the economist on the Hudson Institute. 
In plain English, that may be part of the problem is Absenz of economic growth and the attendant, schwinds√ºchtigen tax receipts, the government put at risk to its financing needs no longer be able to cover. 
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government. 
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 2012 of 1.4% in years... although the Senate is expected to consider this budget with 1.3% and 2% ahead. 
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculated that the budget deficit next year, 4.3% of GDP (as opposed to the governments of the projected 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%). 
Hence the uproar about a new budget, which collectively after the holidays to a sum of EUR 7 billion could be used. 
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says accountant Olli Rehn. 
For the time being, given Italy the support of international institutions. 
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts, which are already regulated, we have been saying for a long time," assured Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF is charged with Italy. 
"At the moment there is no problem, either short-term or long-term view, since Italy, despite its high levels of debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011, A. that R.) lower Stabilisationsfortschritte than of other countries are required", observed Pier Carlo Padoan, Chef-Volkswirt the OECD. 
There remains the question of the political Unstetigkeit. 
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi is a motion of censure, the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the preferred facing elections at the end of March, could be organised. 
It is, therefore, a little window period for a decision in a severe crisis.
