World will continue to plan for the renewal of the lighting 
The UN yesterday in Cancun a plan to regenerate the lighting of households, commerce and industry in 100 countries, with a view to achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (CFC's) suggested that almost a third of the additional reduction is the equivalent of that must be implemented by 2020, in order to stabilize the earth's climate. 
This ambitious plan adopted his position on the steps of the specific major projects, which it hopes to implement the UN in Cancun, in the absence of compelling reduction commitments to compensate for the developed countries. 
After yesterday's plan would the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the lighting of the earth's CFC be avoided if the white glowing pears, which has a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, from fluoreszierende or, better still, by light-emitting diodes (LED) were to be replaced. 
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. 
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet. 
In Copenhagen, the last year the large Abgasemittenten such as the United States, China, Europe, and others, including Canada, to voluntary reduction plans to the global CFCs emissions of 53 Gt Gt to 49 should be downsized. 
By this account, you would have to withdraw, but still 5 Gt from now until 2020 climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius to stabilise to prevent this out of control. 
In the know fervent pears hole 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and produce the remaining 5% of the light. 
With the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, with the new LED bulbs, reduced the need for energy is once again at twice that. 
Keep the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen, on average, between 6,000 and 10,000 hours. 
The new LED bulbs, such as those that the producer Philips this week has put them on the market, the company has also taken part in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white ardent pear, with a hint of the savings of the Auswechselungsplanes over 100 countries, is to be applied. 
In addition to the fact that iese entirely new light bulbs very little heat, they can rule with a resistance work. 
And they do not contain any mercury. 
Several specialists have shown that Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves, because they contain mercury and that it must therefore as hazardous waste dump, which, in the developing countries is not always possible, except the producers are an adoption centre. 
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, not the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit far more mercury of the white glowing pears wasted to generate electricity. 
In the United States alone that coal-fired power stations are 25,000 tons of mercury each year. 
The report sets out in detail the profits, which each country thanks to this international program would generate. 
Indonesia, for example, would be a billion dollars a year in buying electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means save the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose spiritual Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
