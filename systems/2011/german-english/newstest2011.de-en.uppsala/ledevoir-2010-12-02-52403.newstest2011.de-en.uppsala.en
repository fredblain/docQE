Mystery of komplexgeschüttelten Canada lifted 
The new American diplomatic cables by Wikileaks were spread to reveal the secret about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of the Canadians to the Americans think they are, but with the same blow the superiority the latter to Canada. 
Consequently, the American diplomats surprised that the Canadian voters to the ballot not the kanadisch-amerikanischen relations in the country, and they believe that the visit by President Obama, would have helped the Conservative government, its budget from 2009. 
The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which have been circulated to the public yesterday, still offer more juicy details than the substantive content, in which it has a very bad outcome. 
A carved from 22 September 2008, in other words, the period in which the federal Wahlkampage claimed in full swing, it was reported, the point at which the United Nations to the operations of their political leaders are discussing. 
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American Ambassador in Ottawa used. 
Mr Wilkins statement offers different opportunities in this situation. 
"The Canadians almost innewohnender inferiority complex, possibly led the Canadian, political leaders are more likely to do so, on the internal issues of everyday life, as the United States in this election the buck (as in 1988, when the campaign on free trade)", as he describes. 
The United Nations, and, thus, end, he concludes, "the proverbial Goliath of this election: Omnipresent, but potentially to threatening to to talk about him." 
The ambassador, understands the "deafening silence" the less, given that the two countries have close political and economic ties. 
"Logically," he should be assessed, "the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leaders to drive such a crucial relationship, the voters at the polls as a key factor in the end." 
The other expression of this sense of importance is read on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business sources in Ottawa, sent communication, which President Barack Obama, on his first visit to Ottawa to prepare. 
"Their trip will help in the continuation of the government in a confidence vote on the federal budget at the beginning of February, with the Canada its first deficit after more than a decade, will announce the result of a recovery programme in the $30 to $40 billion in Breese," was born. 
Nowhere, he had said that the government had to postpone parliamentary session before Christmas, in order to prevent Parliament from the coalition would be overthrown and the conditional the opposition parties on the quality of the proposed recovery plan. 
Another, in January 2008, and carved from the ambassador wrote communication Wilkins agreed by Washington is becoming increasingly negative image that the broadcast on CBC, dramatic series from the United States. 
The ambassador is concerned about programmes such as Border, little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle innuendo to Maher Arar, "or even the" No-Fly-List contributions for the purposes of the CIA interrogations conducted by Muskelprotze could see. 
Other communication reported in detail about how Hillary Clinton remarked in its French counterpart, Bernard Kouchner, in their first bilateral meeting then asked whether Europe was ready, some of the detainees from Guantanamo Bay. 
Mr Kouchner will have answered yes to the question, but on the basis of an individual 'case to case "decision. 
Àm the end of the meeting, which he has described as "a piece of paper the Secretary of State in terms of Omar Khadr was handed over to a 15-year Muslims Canadian origin." 
"The Secretary of State, has agreed that the Act again by and watch". 
Finally, we note that the mood on the website Wikileaks heated. 
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper set very close advisers, was on CBC said that those responsible for this massive leak "should be killed". 
He was here to Mike Huckabee speaking from the United States.
