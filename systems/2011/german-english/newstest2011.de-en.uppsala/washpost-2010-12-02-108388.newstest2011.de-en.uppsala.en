Portrayed as Moscow Durchgesickertes US-Dokument port of corruption 
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and they are a part of the bribes and the protection money they einsammelt, the Kremlin. As reported in February, the U.S. Embassy in Russia in a memo. 
Both police and the state security services, protection money, ransom high with their expensive standard of living in Moscow, so it is claimed. 
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also by organised criminal gangs. 
Each layer of bureaucracy, and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as a "vertical line of power" - takes its part of the money that the head to the top. 
The memo, which under the name of the Ambassador John Beyrle, has been sent to Washington on Tuesday published by WikiLeaks on its web site. 
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited. 
It was written while Moscow's mayor Yuri Luzhkov still was, and it accuses him of corruption. 
In October, he was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is little evidence that, in the meantime, it would have been sorted out. 
Luzhkov, and his wife, Yelena Baturina, a prominent construction company has over the years, have repeatedly rejected allegations of corruption, and he has a number of libel actions against such accusations. 
In September he told a Russian TV channel, when he was asked after a documentary, which suggests that he was corrupt: "It is crazy, it is a bad way, it is cloudy." 
Like A huge number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. The polls. 
But it is unusual that, as the report of the Ambassador, individuals mentioned, and it is unheard of that one diplomat from a foreign country. 
"The direct link to the government of Moscow with the crime has led some to describe it as" disturbing "and come to the conclusion that the government is rather like a Kleptokrat as a government," according to the memo. 
"Criminal elements" kryshna enjoy a "(a term from the world of criminals / the Mafia, which literally" roof "or protection means), who, on the police, state security service (FSB), the regulator (MVD) and the office of the public prosecutor, as well as through cover the whole of the Moscow government bureaucracy. 
Professionals have dreilagige structure in the criminal world with Moscow. 
"Luzhkov is at the top." 
FSB and MVD, "the militia are on the second stage". 
"Least follow the ordin√§ren criminals and the criminal inspectors at the bottom." 
"This is a inkompetentes system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city offered no assistance". 
The report goes on to say that the FSB money from the largest firms and from which the police small business people were arrested. 
A source said, "is that Moscow's business owner to understand that it is best for the protection of the FSB and MVD to get (and not by organised crime), because they are not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law." 
"That is why the protection by criminal gangs no longer be required as it once was." 
The memo notes that, while the collection of the money is fully protected, which itself is very modest, even those who do not pay are sometimes arrested. 
Those who do not pay their business to find very quickly - on the basis of one or other Vorwands. 
Medvedev has spoken on several occasions, to combat corruption, but at the same time he said that he has made little progress. 
The memo the message contains descriptions of men who with suitcases full of money, which probably were in the Kremlin. 
"In its fight against corruption must be left to the bureaucrats Medvedev," said Georgy Satarov, Recalling, the director of a Moscow think-tank, in a recent interview. 
"But it is a part of this bureaucracy." 
"It is not part of the political class, because a political class in Russia that no longer exists." 
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable. 
Across the country, estimated by the corruption of Russia, will cost more than $300 billion a year. 
The country is ranked 154 to a recent study on global perceptions of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparence International (countries are "the least corrupt" to "most corrupt" included). 
The revelation of the Memos of the American embassy in Moscow, which happened late at night time, will certainly displeasure within the Russian government, though, as Moscow accused Luzhkov for the mistake can be for the Kremlin, it also could be a way to claim that it is the answer to problems. 
In an interview with Larry King on CNN, that the WikiLeaks-Dokumente Putin claimed a fake could be, and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats him Batman and Robin Medvedev mentioned. 
"The truth is that it is about our interaction is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said. 
"But to be honest, we did not expect that to happen with this arrogance, with a kind of pressure and with such unethical way, you know."
