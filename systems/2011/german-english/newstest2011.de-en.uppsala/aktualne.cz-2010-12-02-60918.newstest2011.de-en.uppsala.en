What should they do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague are not aware of, nor the "Konditorei Voldemort." 
The new Council members of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously some language barriers, have to overcome their alt-neuen colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and representation at all in the town to be able to understand. 
The newspaper has Aktuálně.cz members of the new Council from ČSSD a little "abgeklopft," as they dominate the notorious Slang, which in recent years has established practice, in which the current coalition partners, in Prague at the helm. 
The encoded vocabulary verflossenen in the era of Mayor Pavel Bém of the Prague political elite was introduced, is some of the most famous actors, situations and Causae borrowed. 
Surprisingly, the new councils in relation to these new notions of something in the dark. 
They say the least. 
"Who is Voldemort?" 
"I have no idea." 
"I am more a newcomer in the Prague policy," responded Lukáš Kaucký, the new Council Mr for culture, the test of the "Paten-Wortschatzes." 
But the Council Mr Karel Březina, a political veteran, reacted to a similar way. 
For example, the term "Gulf hole". 
"This is the only expression of those who are here with me, I am now and again." 
"Otherwise, I think often infiltrated by slang not much." 
From the vocabulary, the newspaper Aktuálně.cz in this year "s June before the election, Congress of the ODS, pickte the editorial six terms, especially those that are notoriously with the Prague government. 
The Social Democrats Voldemort the terms "should," "greatest Prague Gulf hole in the Konditorei," "go," "bull neck", "betrayal" and "verblechen the capital". 
Three Prague President-in-Office gentlemen voted in favour of the test, the fourth - Mr Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised that his participation in the first interview since then, but not even the headphones. 
The fifth President-in-Office Mr, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test in the first place. 
"These things are, and I don't care how the Civic Democrats themselves develop it, I am not." 
"For me, it is how we in the framework of our programmes to understand," he countered. 
As already mentioned, Lukáš Kaucký in the aforementioned headline claim not recognised that the influential entrepreneurs and friend of Ex-Oberbürgermeisters Bém, Roman Janoušek the speech. 
The term "Voldemort" says Kaucky absolutely nothing and the only concept, the test correctly erriet, was "the greatest Prague Gulf hole". 
"It is the tunnel," says Kaucký Blanka, added to safety but added: "But I know that there is more in the newspaper." 
And jokingly: "I am going to have to prove that a language course." 
The "Gulf hole" will not only matador Karel Březina, but also the councillor for the Environment Lukáš Plachý Blanka entziffert right as a tunnel. 
Both Social Democrats know but also, for whom the notion of Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find this figure is and what it means to go "in the Konditorei." 
"I believe that that is, in some kind of Prague gastronomy", is to go operational Plachý pretty close to the conundrum hit solution, when we know that this is the headquarters of Janoušeks firms. 
He claimed Březina in line with this knowledge, but rather from the newspaper to have been accessed, and that this would be their own vocabulary. 
The test participants to judge by, it seems, with the Social Democrats in fact no similar eingebürgerten Slang. 
"I have asked my colleagues, but it is clear that there are something like that for us is not really." 
"We call on us, and we will also use the acronym, or moniker," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - of his party of "casual" Hulda. 
"At school I was (Birke Bříza), but I do not know whether to call my colleagues," Karel Březina his moniker tells us. 
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried and behold, it works. 
Mr Weinert Council is for the party of the kind of "Opa" or less friendly to the 'old', the Representative, Miroslav poche before the elections through the machinations of party sponsorship come to our attention that some colleagues' Igráček "(famous Czech Lego-Figur). 
Moniker are the only one that the Social Democrats in whose use of language. 
Hulínský it may supposedly not if it calls ", but" Hulda Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman. 
His nickname "Dr the rubber truncheons rights", supposedly to do with its title, that Petr Hulínský doctor iuris Bratislaver in the police academy.
