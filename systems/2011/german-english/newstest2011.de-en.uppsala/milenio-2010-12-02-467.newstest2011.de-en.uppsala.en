China considers its targets to reduce the greenhouse gases maintain 
The Chinese officials said at the COP16, that his country had enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints, and it would be made to maintain his offer of 40 to 45 percent by 2020, to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. 
China considers his offer the emission of greenhouse gases by 2020 by 40 to 45%, Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16. 
In his first public appearance in the 16 world climate change summit COP16 (United Nations), Su Wei, said his country would have enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and to convert its industry. 
He said that in the last four years, his country have invested $245 million, in order to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. 
On the other hand, he said that China would not change its objectives, but together with the international community on this issue would work. 
He said that the Chinese strategy in terms of change in the four aspects sub-parts: Dialogue, capacity building, development of institutions and support for pilot programs. 
In all aspects of the progress we have made, including the adoption of a new energy law in the last year that the targets for the reduction of the emission of gases involved, he said. 
On the other hand, he states that, in China, the authorities in the United States with those of the central state and local authorities working together to achieve the aims to save energy, effective use of energy and reducing emissions. 
In addition, he has already taken some multiannual plans or have been completed, both those who were paid by the Chinese government, and as such, received the money from other countries. 
For example, he was referring to the programme to Wirksamen use of energy, which in the last five years was introduced and investment by the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands. 
It is a project at provincial level on climate change, another exchange of traditional incandescent light bulbs with energy-saving pears and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said. 
Martin Krol, scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts were far greater than is commonly believed. 
He showed that per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China therefore six tonnes per person, while in the United States and China is 100 tonnes for a 9% overall contribution to environmental pollution. 
It is also unprecedented progress in the area of energy efficiency of energy use, which has been in the last five years increased by 20 per cent by 2020 and a further to be done, he said.
