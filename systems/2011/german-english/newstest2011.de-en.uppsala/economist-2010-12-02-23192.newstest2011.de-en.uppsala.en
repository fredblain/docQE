The demokatrische routine 
The movement for democracy in Latin America will be stronger, as the support of private companies. 
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment. 
In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil larger than that of the United States. 
These results came the Latinobarómetro-Umfrage in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist. 
This survey will be carried out on a regular basis since 1995 and it shows that the change of opinion in this region. 
Two facts are in this year's poll in September and October, particularly in 's eye. 
First, the good mood in Latin America 
And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions. 
In many Latin American countries on the Pacific coast, has greatly increased in the democratic movement (s table 1). 
In Peru, for example, where the economy since 2002 to around 6% a year, the number of advocates of democracy from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. 
In Mexico, where the economy has been the sharp fall in the last year, the recovery is such a trend. 
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries of the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (s diagram 2). 
Some 44% of the respondents stated that they will be satisfied with their country's democratic practice, which is as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3). 
Some 34 percent trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values are those of last year, however, show a marked increase over 2003 (17% and 24%). 
A decade ago, Latin American economic crisis undermined the efforts for more democracy. 
Also during the global economic crisis continued, perhaps, is the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a brief recession and a speedy recovery. 
Furthermore, the poor by a stronger social network. 
(According to reports from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week, 2009, the poverty rate in Latin America, only slightly and is again this year by 32%.) 
But from country to country, there is a strong mood differences (s graph 4). 
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread step forward thinking. 
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was much more tangible and violent crimes have increased, it is less the case. 
For only the second time since the start of the survey, see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country is a bigger problem than in the diagram s unemployment (5). 
Some 31% say that either they or a family member in the last year have been victims of a crime, but compared to 38% in the last year, are the values have fallen, reaching the lowest level since 1995. 
The rising economic performance is reflected in the increase in support of the family and the market economy: Around 71% of respondents on regional said that the private sector is essential for development in 2007, there were 56% (s graph 6). 
Some 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress their country, compared with 47% in the last year. 
Interestingly, 62% of those polled in Venezuela this view maintained (and 80% are in favour of a private sector), though their leftist President, Hugo Chávez, many private enterprises nationalised. 
Brazil has under 19% of the respondents (18% in the last year) the biggest force in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared with 11% in the past year). 
The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, with a role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
