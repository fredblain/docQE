The Spanish government has no objections against CIA 
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA with Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners on Spanish territory to Guantanamo, as a telegram of the Ambassador of the U.S.A. in Madrid. 
This reflects the Wikileaks enhüllten and the daily newspaper El País "(cable) support documents. It added that the former deputy leader, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, the Spanish Government should be informed," to show that foreign aeroplanes flying over Spain, appropriately monitored. " 
In June 2006, after the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, where the aid menschenrechtsverachtenden practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, was discussed, the former American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega. 
Deputy leader admitted that the report by the Council of Ministers have met on the sidelines "and Zapatero, Spain has nothing to hide in this matter. 
"De la Vega said Spain have no objection to the intelligence flights over the Spanish territory." 
"They simply want to be informed," not "unprepared to be surprised," Aguirre told via cable. 
The former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, said the ambassador pointed out that the Spanish government is "not a great deal of attention to the issue, although the government may have little influence, as they have in the hands of the judges."

The ambassador expressed his concern for the way in which the PP in this matter. 
"Despite their generally pro-American stance our experience tells us that the PP have no doubt will, an indication that the government of the United States, which Zapatero's actions as a possible human rights violations could be construed to have deliberately ignored or tolerated, capital, even if these revelations have a negative effect on the government of the United States could have an impact," he stresses.
