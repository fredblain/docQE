Arsen-resistente microbe could new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere permit 
The discovery of an alien variety of bacteria, among other things, of arsenic can opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere. 
Although scientists this unusual bacterium here on earth, in their view, it is a sign that a life without the previously deemed vital elements is possible. 
"This body has two ways. ' 
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." 
"That makes it a very particular reason, even though there are almost a sort of 'alien' way of life is," said C.W. Paul Davies of Arizona State University and Co-Autor of the report on Thursday, in the Online-Ausgabe the journal Science. 
So far, there have been six main elements as vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur. 
But the scientists figured out how to grow the bacterium in the Californian mono Lake even further, if it has replaced by arsenic. 
"One wonders what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar Co-Autor of the report by the Arizona State University. 
The discovery is an important step in the search for life, as scientists außerirdischem life and his forms need to be able to see, in Anbar. 
The study, which deals with microbes on Earth have been found. 
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report by the discovery Außerirdischen life. 
This is not the case. 
The discovery "shows that in other planet systems organisms, with the help of other elements biochemical processes can set in motion, and that the 'standard' elements that, in our opinion, is absolutely vital, not necessarily see are imposed," said Mr Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute held University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. 
Cockel was not part of the research team. 
"This work is a first, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures an element can be replaced by another," added Cockell. 
The discovery was not accidental. 
Felisa Wolfe-Simon Astrobiologischen Institute by NASA, which led the study, chose the mono Lake because of the high levels of arsenic. 
As arsenic and phosphorus chemically same, that microbes that both are exposed, may be a factor in the other place. 
"The toxicity of Arsens is based primarily on the fact that there is a similar situation such as phosphorus chemically". 
"It is thus, an element of the organisms is difficult to distinguish from the other." 
"But the difference is so large that arsenic different acts as phosphorus, enter our biochemisches system, where it covered almost everything," says Anbar. 
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 a rising arsenic concentration, it suited to and grew. 
The microbe is growing in phosphorus better, but also that they can survive in arsenic, shows that a Arsen-basierte life form can happen, of course, either on the ground or on another planet or moon, on the arsenic more. 
According to Jamie S. Foster, Dozentin for microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new, but so far there has been no functioning example. 
Arsenic was more common in the early Erdjahren, she says, it is for this reason that the science on the assumption that early life forms of it have been used. 
"There is reason to believe that life may have developed different than the early Erdzeitalter," Forster in Wolfe-Simons, not a member of the research team. 
The research, by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National health authorities.
