State loan for the acquisition of eXcentris 
The Quebecer government, the Société Angus and the companies parallèle was asked financially to the takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris, to participate in a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive loan. 
The developers society Angus and the company parallèle, a donation to the tune of $7 million from the acquisition of Daniel Langlois Kultusministerium which cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent had hoped to restore this function to its actual cineastischen that do not seem to get what they asked for. 
While the government has accepted that in this case, but on their own terms. 
Instead of the expected donation offers the Quebecer government rather a loan in less than initially expected, which is a viable solution to create favourable conditions could, at least in the view of the state from the scaremongers entnehmbaren sources. 
The first plan of action and a question after 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, which was again Bittgesuch overall, since the revised downwards. 
The proposal, along with an action plan has already been made by the President of the "Société de développement of entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola St-Pierre, minister, which is in charge of the Act eXcentris. 
Several days ago, he had to give her a recent technical report. 
The proposal, however, was the SODEC of the Cabinet on Wednesday. 
Parallèle and Angus now have until December 31 to respond this time. 
In any case, it seems that the premise of the state donation really been pushed to the side. 
Let us remember that the Quebecer owners community of cinema and cinema complex against a direct state investment to support the adoption of eXcentris had revolted by making the argument, the Culture Minister, have issued no financial help for real estate projects there, which he does not have other cinema. 
Several other market participants, however, the segment charged in contrast, substantial economic aid. 
Cinema chief Daniel Langlois had the self-financed design of the cinema over ten years with great difficulty, the authors cinema in the premises of its cinema complex, with the exception of the treasury could justify. 
The lack of cinema, the independent films show, it is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew his client on board. 
Société Angus, as well as the companies with Christian parallèle Yaccarini at the top, in turn a privately financed Campagne, of which it is a sum 700 000 $hope to purchase. 
Since early 2009 continues only one continued to screen films in eXcentris, Le parallèle to show. 
The aim of the prospective purchasers, it is that the three cinemas on 27 February of next year, with the spectacle of a very fine film by Xavier Beauvois "The hommes et des Dieux 'open up. 
Christian Yaccarini but the newspaper Le Devoir "not removed, and it ignores what he and his group of the revised downwards proposals to keep them.
