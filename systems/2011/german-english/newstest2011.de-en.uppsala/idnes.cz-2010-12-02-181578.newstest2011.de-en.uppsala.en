A bone House fascinates even after 100 years. If you look at the Interieure by Gaudi to 
The roof is in the back of a prehistoric Echse, the stairs as the vertebral column of Dinosauriers and Balkone aufgerissene Fischmäuler are. 
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. 
Of the local residents, the house, with its organic forms the nickname "bone House." 
Organic forms, wild colors, unusual use of stone and mosaic, Kachelsplittern to shed spectre facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all of these are typical features for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi. 
The façade of the House is playing with dream zärtlichen liable lines, colors and Texturen of nature and living things. 
Only on closer inspection we noted that everything of geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order dominated. 
During the night, the whole facade still plastic, more dramatic and more particular Anleuchtung the glory of the colours. 
The same dynamic lines and tortuous forms also dominate the interior of the House. 
Wood creates ripple effects geformtes copied the Geländer Zierelemente, window frames, doors and even Gucklöcher and trade. 
The House Batlló in the Eixample quarter of the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No 43 was created by the refurbishment of the house, which dates from 1877, the architects Emilio Sala Cortese said. 
The reconstruction took two years, and was completed in 1906. 
The investor, the wealthy industrialists Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a new building, but in the end it agreed to the idea of Gaudís on an unusual and cheaper reconstruction. 
The Casa Batlló Miet House noted, Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone. 
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol together. 
It has been on the drawing board for representative take away the Realitätenbesitzers of housing and also the use of Mosaiken in the facade was his idea. 
In the design of the facade also worked, however, many other Bildner and artists. 
The joint work on drafting the Casa Batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí. 
It is also involved in the construction of Gaudís Jujol Casa Milá Park Güell in the House, where there are also other works, Antoni Gaudí. 
Shortly after its completion, the house of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the moniker of 'bone House. " 
Others described it as the specific Fensteröffnungsmechanismus due to the "yawning House." 
It also says that at the top of the building is the sword of Saint George, the existence of Catalonia. 
But also further bildhauerische elements symbolize hidden religious motives. 
Gaudí was in the house for the time unique central heating system with Entlüftungskanälen and typical Kaminen. 
Their 45-Grad-Neigung already seems a little weird. 
In his creative Gaudí consistently ignored all the time building regulations and did not influence this. 
Before the start of construction - although he lifted the appropriate planning permission by the city but one of the claims made about the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers two years later, in the completion as appalled by the result was that they were asked to help. 
The Council House, among other things, also found that the building, with its pillars, even in the public sidewalk intervening. 
Change, however, it was no longer quite the opposite - just 15 days after the call from the urban community, Josep Batlló an application for approval of the hire of the two highly pertinent floors of the House, and he was promptly given. 
The homeowners themselves, in the lower floors. 
In the gallery, in the second floor was a Gesellschaftssalon, on the third floor were the bedroom and private areas of the house. 
The ground floor has been leased to a Juweliergeschäft. 
The whole building is going through a set of stairs sechsstöckige the Dachterrasse. 
The main elements of the transformation were all right corner and straight lines removed and replaced by bent and geschwungene walls. 
Gaudí worked but with a modern approach to mutual combination of places. 
The social part through the opening of the completely Salontüren and a larger society was chatting comfortably without vertraulicheren in talks at a certain level of intimacy. 
The House, by Gaudís reconstruction but a new facade a very unusual roof and a further two floors. 
Impression is also Gaudís game with the light, as well as the blue and white glasierten Kacheln with which the courtyard dressed, and the light courts. 
The game of these two colours all the floors of the House gives maximum light. 
He made it plain that the principle to better reflect the light, white and dark colours, the light from the sun, on the contrary, to absorb. 
Casa Batlló the House in 2005, the World Heritage List, Unesco, included everyone can visit today. 
The first floor is the geräumigste and prächtigste housing made available to the public. 
The house owner decided it was only in the years to take this step and this on the occasion of the 150.Geburtstags of the famous designer. 
When it was pointed out that this is a very profitable business, kept the surveys, so we assumed it to other common and Dachgeschossräume, including Dachterrasse. 
The price for the visit of an is, however, no trifling matter, he is 16,50 euro, students, retired people, groups and holder of tourists cards get 20% reduction. 
This figure dwarfs the prices to other Gaudí-Bauten in the city. 
Who are the real atmosphere of the House with his Drachentürmchen acquaintance, should try to friendship with one of the inhabitants and visit him at home.
