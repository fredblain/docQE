Can courtesy what divides us? 
After a campaign to Schimpfwörtern and negativity is little courtesy this week in Washington. 
It is the sign of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion, before it was quickly back to the struggle of the parties in the capital, returning? 
The meeting on Tuesday between President Barack Obama and leaders of Congress produced no breakthrough on the big issues to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck" session of the sitting at the end of a period of government in which no decisions had to be made to look. 
After all, that is what we hear, it was either a polite discussion between two sides still a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan collection points. 
The public meeting of the deficit commission of the president on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences between the members to continue. 
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months can give a kind of mutual respect, the ideological divide that still divides members of concealing. 
It is not enough to say that it was a new era of cooperation arrived. 
Both sides are now in a test phase, in one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise, while you tried to the limits of public opinion and the patience of the electorate, according to a new parties warfare. 
This was the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants on a minimum requirements or accusations limited. 
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep, and that there is a rapid change of atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, might expect. 
Whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or pension is, the two sides are miles apart. 
Lastly, the November election Washington, at least for a short period of time, to say the least. 
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official of the Bush administration, which is now in the "Ethics and Public Policy Center," is working. 
"It is inevitable after elections. 
Elections give partisan passions, to die. 
And that is a good thing. " 
On some issues, particularly on those who will be on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. " 
Bush's tax cuts, at the end of the year, and no one in favour of it. 
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all of it, either temporarily or permanently. 
It is a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that, it believes, the favoured tax cuts for the rich, support unemployed workers while they refuse. 
After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House is of the optimism has grown that these issues during the "lame duck" session and, at the same time, some of the New START Treaty, cannot ratify. 
But William Glaston of Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation on pressing issues of the lame duck session "to a lasting cooperation of the parties must, if the new 112. Congress will convene in January. 
Instead, he says, is a period of not more than once immensely more likely, perhaps even necessary. 
"After the things that are done that need to be done in the short term, it will shift the psychology in confrontation," he said. 
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many, the courtesy to real cooperation. 
"I see a lot of what is happening from here until 2012, as Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event in 2012," he said. 
The reasons have a great deal to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House, and to do it with the Teeparty-Wählern, which have been instrumental in their education. 
How worried the Republican leaders also may be that they have too high pokern, they know that they must try to their promise to cut government spending and the healthcare reform, to be adhered to. 
This party lines are already in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which is a tax reform and raising some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and reduce government spending. 
The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles are one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, according to their own assessment, insisted that the deficit issue on the public agenda that they could no longer be ignored. 
But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes with its plan to official recommendation and they are very much, too, just in the proximity of this figure. 
The biggest resistance is the elected representatives of the body, as in financial issues, today at least, little room for compromise or little sympathy. 
Galston says two stages of the battle between the White House and Republicans in Congress. 
The first campaign will next year in the form of party clashes take place, if the Republicans Obama in terms of the budget of the state, the taxes and the health system, challenging then followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation. 
What will this change? 
Public opinion. 
It has been proved that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together. 
If confrontation at an impasse, as it happened in 1995, then both sides must look carefully at the public reaction. 
Whoever the losers being condemned will change tack and seek compromises. 
This may, in fact, a more optimistic view. 
Partisanship and polarization are now greater than it is in the middle of the 1990's, and they seem a more ideological gap between Obama and the Kongress-Republikanern at the time to be between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. 
At the same time, the defenders of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a much broader consequences in the 2012 election. 
Such courtesy may have seen the greatest display of this week, will be welcomed by many Americans. 
On both sides, but it will be a great deal more effort, a common denominator in the issues that the two still separated.
