World Cup: The FIFA appoints the 2018-2022 Ausrichterland 
In a state of great excitement because of suspicions of corruption, which appoints the executive committee of the FIFA on Thursday the Ausrichterländer of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a highly political election, in which the rangeln for influence, as well as the lobbying the technical criteria to push into the background. 
One thing is certain: The spending 2018 FIFA the King discipline in Europe, its traditional stronghold, (the four candidates: England, Russia, Spanien-Portugal, Netherlands and Belgium). 
The 2022 will then be somewhat exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be the first on the African continent in the 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) to be able to win, or its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to follow. 
The list of people to be part of the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch leader, Beckham, Zidane, Cruyff) is a measure of economic and political use of the World Cup. 
The machinations behind the scenes to threaten until the last minute. 
Difficult otherwise, a hierarchy of the candidates. 
After the evaluation report of FIFA, the English, offer spanisch-portugiesische (2018) and American (2022) acts bessseren arguments than that of its competitors. 
But these considerations for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees the time of the election is not so important. 
The Sunday Times that with the finding of the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, might as well have the opportunities for their own country, cradle of football, can ruin that only once the World Cup was allowed to fight, 1966. 
The BBC had again been the ground on Monday, giving it a broadcast own had three senior members of the Kommitees, Ricardo Teixeira and Issa Hayatou, Nicolas Leoz is under fire. 
Reason enough, FIFΑ to annoy and the English authorities to embarrass in the first place, with David Cameron in recent weeks an intensive lobbying. 
The head of the government is hoping for a repeat of his predecessor Tony Blair successful chess train, in 2005 for London, the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games had achieved. 
This intensive use would be enough to allow the image of England before the Kommitee upgrade again? 
Nothing is less safe, because the duo Spanien-Portugal there is no shortage of assets, with its already finished stadiums, his expertise (World Cup in Spain, 82, 92 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture. 
But the economic and financial downside of the two countries could dampen its ambitions. 
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal are the chances of Russia, which despite its flaws in the dossier (stadiums, hotels and transport) has become the influential outsiders, to rise. 
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided that the treaty candidly suggestion to the Bezichtigungen the English press "an unfair competition in the run-up to the vote" on the part of the Kommiteemitglieder. 
"One bewirft it with dirt, trying to compromise," Putin lashed out. 
For 2022, the United States, encouraged by the experience of 1994, the logical favorite. 
First economic world power, the seat of the FIFA-Hauptsponsoren, the country seems a long list of advantages to Japan and South Korea, which separately a very good project. 
But these new nominations seem premature for two countries which co-organised the competitions in 2002. 
Another threat: The long-awaited approval for the World Cup, FIFA 2026 for China, the Asian chance in 2022 lapses. 
With Australia and Qatar, with the Aufwartung futuristischer stadiums had pulled out all the stops, the FIFA its expansion into new areas, however, these two countries a greater risk for certainty. 
Australia may as well as Japan and South Korea under the European countries akquittierten weakness in television (due to the time shift), the sensitive nerve FIFA.
