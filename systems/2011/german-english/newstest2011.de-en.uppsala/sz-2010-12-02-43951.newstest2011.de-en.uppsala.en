Mysterious Erdarbeiten 
The International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria. 
The country, however, refuses to comment on that - nor is it controls. 
At about midnight on 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 Ι fighter-planes a mysteriöses, würfelförmiges building in Syria. 
It is on the banks of the Euphrates, the next major city, 30 miles away, is Dair as-Saur. 
Her name appears in documents to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, which Syria allegedly with help from North Korea in the Quader built hidden in a valley of the electricity. 
According to a briefing of the US-Auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA at the end of April 2008 would be the under the name of the nearest town el-Kibar normal reactor have been well placed to produce plutonium, which can build nuclear weapons. 
For other purposes, however, the technology is hardly in the fifties. 
The CIA ran a video presentation with fuzzy satellite images. 
They ignored by Computeranimation, where the components of the reactor before the destruction, of a verkleinerte copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyong nuclear centre. 
Moreover, it presented photographs of the buildings in the vicinity, or even the indoor show. 
The reactor was shortly before the beginning of the operation, it said, but not yet with Brennstäben peppers. 
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more than it was then, of course, the mystery with the time were more likely to be greater. 
Former President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack is fairly sure that Syria had built a reactor in el-Kibar, but little evidence that it is in the country, "an active nuclear weapons programme. 
Some intelligence officers in Europe are even more cautious and prefer to speak only of an "alleged reactor," even if the CIA-Präsentation for "plausible". 
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. 
Asked how certain he was a reactor, said to have a high UN-Diplomat only flat in the summer, the IAEA "has enough material to ask questions". 
The rubble of the alleged "unused military building" the Syrians eager to one side and planierten the site thoroughly. 
However, it took place in June 2008, a IAEA-Team under former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people. 
Moreover, the IAEA on a Member State commercial providers of satellite images from the period directly after the attack, which is likely to be more powerful than the CIA. 
The recordings, however, are not on the market, because of the unknown mandator - perhaps Israel - they bought the exclusive. 
The IAEA can therefore not independently verify its authenticity. 
Syria has always claimed that never run a secret nuclear programme or to have built a nuclear reactor. 
The uranium has come from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus. 
But it pointed out the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely. 
Damascus since then refuses to discuss the issue - as well as on the satellite images. 
In addition, the inspectors were denied a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the rubble of bombed-out building. 
But Israel is sticking. 
"We will not comment on", confirmed recently the time of the attack on the office of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position. 
So the investigation of the case has been dragging on since June 2008 in vain and "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the agency," as a senior Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna for - there is, after all, a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the IAEA. 
As key to making progress in the investigation, the IAEA apparently three more bodies, the "functional link" with the alleged reactor will be different than this - and still exist. 
In doing so, the inspectors have not disclosed what facilities they are, or what they are or what they appear to be suspicious. 
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they will have to the IAEA and internally Marj as-Sultan Masyaf Iskandariayah, and that, in turn, are derived from nearby towns. 
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS advises) has identified these locations and a complex satellite images identified in Masyaf where it is most likely to be one of the suspicious objects. 
It is probably in or adjacent to a military base, this is precisely what grounds Syria denied the IAEA access to the three locations. 
It is in Vienna that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will vorgeschickt by the United States military installations auszuspähen. 
Because the nuclear detectives were the result of a tip of the US intelligence services to discover the bodies. 
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos that, between the three locations and the Quader the Euphrates material was moved back and forth. 
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna, said that at least one of the facilities could "in connection with the fuel production". 
"But there is no evidence of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or reprocessing and processes which are required to build nuclear weapons. 
Is the type of reactor with enriched uranium, which is not. 
But where the uranium could have come from, and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated, these central issues there are only plausible assumptions. 
It is also unclear whether the valuable pieces of debris, could carry traces of the three places were stored. 
As if the hundreds of truck loads of the disappeared, no one wants to have information on where the debris. 
Only a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, salt mine al-Tibni, the Syria 1998 to their suitability as a camp for radioactive waste has investigated, the IAEA as unlikely. 
Robert Kelley, a former IAEA-Inspektor it was, in a recent analysis of satellite images on the venerable magazine Jane's Intelligence Review in contact with the reactor. 
Footage from the orbiting but show that Syria in the three suspect sites Erdarbeiten and large container distant, after the IAEA access had requested. 
This can hardly be a coincidence, but it has helped to dispel the suspicion. 
Furthermore, it is said in diplomatic circles, have spent many months, the IAEA, in a plan for inspections to develop, it should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - of the effort shows how much interest the inspectors. 
Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte this one too. 
Still, Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago, to appease the reactor was destroyed, therefore, have no great urgency of the matter is, for example, US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a couple of months' special inspections of the game, one of the harshest means Vienna nuclear authority to control. 
IAEA-Chef Yukiya Amano, these inspections should propose, has been of "an option, for which I am open in the future, however, is reluctant to talk about it. 
It is a high risk in this way: On the one hand, it needs to ensure a majority of the board of governors of the IAEA, and several of the 35 countries represented there are anything other than eager for an escalation. 
On the other hand, as a diplomat to bear in mind: "What if they find nothing at all, in the end?"
