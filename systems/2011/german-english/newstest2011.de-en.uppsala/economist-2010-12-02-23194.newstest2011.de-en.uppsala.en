In the middle is secretly 
In the weeks after the sudden death of a man who was told Argentina's President, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy that their popularity rate by 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest value since its election in 2007. 
If it does, however, in the next year to get re-elected, depends on whether the compromise is visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández and her late husband, her predecessor, Néstor Kirchner and political partner. 
The signs are not clear. 
Néstor Kirchner, who was also his wife, after the election, the economic policy, was often budgets, tax revenue, economic growth and inflation are not fully into account. 
This allowed the presidential couple, the extra income to spend as they see fit. 
On paper the Fernández-Regierung lost in the past year the majority in Congress. 
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October, leading to further Zerwürfnissen. 
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández. 
But after chaotic meetings (in which a member of a different face, and others accused the government of corruption, not the Congress, the budget for 2011. 
"I am not going to discuss it," the President. 
The 2010 budget is now for the next year, allowing the President more opportunity to spend money as they see fit. 
The economy is likely to be disputed: This year by up to 9%. 
The official inflation rate, at 11.1% z.Z., but many private estimates - and wage demands of the unions, pushing the value to nearly 30%. 
Kirchner, who took over the post in 2003, when Argentina was beset by economic crises, growth and poverty reduction to its key objectives, and not lowering inflation. 
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, the private sector and säuberte singled out for bullying as the National Institute for Statistics and census INDEC, the official inflation statistics schönte. 
Fernández now can we take? 
It has private business and union leaders to talks. 
According to official statements and wage increases over the next year to 18%. 
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products, has given a strong boost to the economy. 
But the growth spurt the inflation undermined by a large devaluation in 2002. 
Cristina Fernández would probably why Argentina financial economically back to the rest of the world to follow suit. 
At the beginning of this year, the Government made an agreement with holders of the securities, the earlier restructuring of the country in 2001, had rejected. 
Fernández now appears on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which it owes about $6.7 billion. 
The Kirchners have had a review by the IMF, as is usual elsewhere, always rejected. 
But last month, the economy minister, Amado Boudou know that the fund is in the process of drafting a new national consumer price index "technical support". It looks as if this is the first step in cleansing the INDEC. 
It is not known whether Mr Fernández after the end of their term even without the support of her husband will be politically active. 
If so, it needs to get the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of Kirchnerism. 
If the Argentinians in March from their summer holidays, is to return to the wave of Sympatie it was, fizzled. 
If they want to win another election, it must decide whether to many political decisions her husband quietly lifted.
