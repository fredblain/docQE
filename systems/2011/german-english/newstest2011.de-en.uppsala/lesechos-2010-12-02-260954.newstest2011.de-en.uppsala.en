Second mandate: Offenkundigkeit 
De Gaulle had clipped really. 
Mitterrand had stutze believe that he was. 
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation. 
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than that. 
A mandate in the Elysée, the next. 
The current head of state will, therefore, be a candidate in 2012. 
But the Offenkundigkeit Mysteriums is the side of the presidential function, not look good. 
So he has to pretend that the doubts now. 
In one sense, as well as in the other. 
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac, a third mandate is not excluded, without even to believe that. 
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy has assured in any serious by his decision "some time in the autumn of 2011". 
On Tuesday evening that he was in the Elysée before the UMP-Parlamentariern the prospect of "two mandates" would therefore, had let slip a little Fieberhaftigkeit widespread. 
This was the official announcement of his candidacy? 
Far from it. 
The President was simply to point out that the constitution in 2008, the number of people on only two, five-year terms. 
He made a statement, no announcement. 
It is not the first time that he is the presidential election, at such meetings in a humorous tone. 
"You still with me in the worst case, seven and a half years, or, at best," he told them in July 2009. 
In May 2010, a new, "does not believe that I am not thinking about the stage after that." 
His words of yesteryear does not make him more about the candidate than the previous day, but also no less. 
They should comment, then from a double reason. 
The acceleration of the candidacy Wettlaufes with the PS on one side. 
But it is not the start of the competition, with Ségolène Royal, Nicolas Sarkozy, to reveal to itself. 
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, the many members of the PS early than to challenge a red card. 
The bad polls on the other side. 
For the first time, voters would the rights a candidacy of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to the survey of BVA-L 'Express). 
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion with the UMP," responded immediately and the environment of the Prime Minister. 
"If it is a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin with shares. 
"He will always believe that they can win," corrected Alain Juppé, who is with the Offenkundigkeit has resigned.
