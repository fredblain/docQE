Cheshire-Berufung power on Twitter closely 
Tippten half a dozen of them in the row in the courtroom. 
In the minutes of tact verschickten it on Twitter their reports about grey cent witness statements. 
In the end, such as the defence, there were more than 140,000 Twitter-Meldungen on the process in order to rape and beds gekettete children in a house, the flare-up. 
On Thursday, the closely followed process of Steven J. Hayes, was accused of three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, to have killed an official end to the ruling on the death sentence, the panel has said. 
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted applications to court to explain the grounds for appeal and the courts in years to come. 
Most provocative one of the reasons is that the intense coverage of the process, but also by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - to a "circus" atmosphere and such a widespread, instant penetration rebel details come, so that the jury was improperly influenced by public outrage. 
This protest might encourage Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question of whether the new technologies necessary new rules in the court room. 
"As I have seen during this process, I think that it really is a danger, when the arrival of new technologies in the courtroom every individual" s right to a fair trial, "said Thomas J. influenced Ullman, Mr. Hayes main defenders. 
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue House, rejected by the Supreme Court last week, applications by referendum, succinct and when he said that the new media would be "carefully monitored", and that there is no proof that the jury had been driven by passions. 
But this was certainly not the last word on this matter. 
For decades, about a court found that the reporting on notorious cases doubt on the fairness of the process. 
In his historic decision by 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, is to have his wife killed, and said in his ruling that it was because of the new media "Karnevalsatmosphäre in the courtroom". 
Some believed that the television and the movie "On the flight" based on this crime. 
Some lawyers say, court judgments, what Mr. Hayes veroordeling half a century later, the argument might be that new rules are necessary, and with the channels of communication from the courtroom at the time of the case, Dr Sheppard were unimaginable. 
"There is a good reason, about the impact of the new media in trials, which will be followed by a general public to be concerned about," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut, according to his report, will they arbitrarily. 
Professor Donohue said some Appelationsgerichte could be intrigued by the idea that restricting a prompt communication from the courtroom, could make the process fair. 
The Twitter-Angelegenheit is just one of the many lawyers of Mr. Hayes, in order to discuss for years to come, and a condemnation of war. 
The defenders argue, for example, that Mr. Hayes might have been already explanation, judge Blue not to allow them, the reactions of potential judges to test them by while the Jurorenauswahl grey cent scene photos showed. 
Some of the judges said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years, they would have been met with revulsion. 
The defenders say they are also the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution into question, and argue that the judge wrongly a jury have exchanged views, a critic of the department, and that he was improperly exerted pressure on the ruling, as he had the unusual decision was made by the panel to free over the weekend. 
The judges were not isolated. 
But their arguments about the impact of the extensive coverage of the process is perhaps the greatest interest. 
In a judgment, the challenge that they have tabled last month, made it clear that the case has dominated the news in Connecticut, and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American Senate candidate was discussed. 
They argued that the new media constantly the flames of the emotions on the case would be reopened. 
"Such a daily crush of Medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "has previously in New Haven and maybe even nationwide," not yet seen. 
Their focus to the reporting by Twitter is controversial. 
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that the direct messages are rabble-rousing but more slowly than reports which are reimbursed, a technology hostile view is that the report on future processes verarme. 
But some lawyers said, were often Appelationsgerichte with the argument, social and technological changes need the Adaptation through the courts. 
Mr. Hayers lawyers step up this assertion. 
In her appeal, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, in which the conviction of Dr Sheppard because of the reporting has been lifted and made it clear that the new media, new rules require. 
"This case," they wrote, "Sheppard represents against Maxwell of the 21st century."
