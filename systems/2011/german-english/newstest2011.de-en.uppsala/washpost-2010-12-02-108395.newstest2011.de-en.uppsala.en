Belarus agrees not to collect weapons-grade uranium 
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. 
The deal has been in a joint statement after a meeting of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in additional articles of the security summit. 
The US government had for years sought to convince Russia knows more highly enriched uranium, not to collect and last spring seemed to have reached a hurdle. 
But officials of the US government told the Washington Post that, in the last two months, two secret agreements with Belarus has been made to 187 pounds of weapon-grade uranium from a Belarus research center. 
The setting the stage for the agreement on Wednesday, the rest of the material to be removed, according to an official staff, because of the sensitivity of the matter, the anonymous, about £500. 
The agreement seems to be one of the main findings of Obama's "nuclear security summit of 47 nations" from April, the Belarus had ruled out. 
And it was, of course, good enough for the invitation of the former Soviet republic of the next summit in 2012. 
"I was really excited by the fact that they have a seat on the nuclear security summit (from 2012)." 
"It shows me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group promoting nuclear security. 
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, very important step" of Belarus. 
Obama promised, in Prague in April 2009, within the space of four years to secure all vulnerable nuclear material. 
Since then, the US government helped her six countries to get rid of highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus will be the seventh. 
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush. 
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, the white Russian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never abandon their uranium. 
"How to maintain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is capable of radically weapons, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time. 
"This is our commodity... We will not derive any dirty bomb and we will sell it to anyone". 
"We will use it solely for research purposes, and that is it." 
Belarus approached yet just a few months ago, the United States, as it is interested in meeting anzeigte of an agreement. 
The first port of call, the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material is easily contaminated by radiation was, say officials. 
It was loaded into a Spezialzug, of the more than 1,300 miles of a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, officials say. 
The second attempt was decided on Monday and has been carried out by plane, according to the officials. 
The US government will pay for this effort $14 million, with much of the money in the Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons. 
"This was a carefully coordinated to build confidence," to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton led, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, this is due to the global threat reduction. 
The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende studies estimates that Belarus this year, at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium, and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus under the joint agreement will be in stores by the end of 2012. 
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, first and foremost because of Lukashenko's harsh abuse of human rights. 
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement. 
"The progress this global security issues, welcome heißend the United States of America and Belarus known that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus is a central theme in the improvement in bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," it said.
