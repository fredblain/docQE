A Dupont partly reprimanded 
The Quebecer radio presenter, Mr Dupont said in the Canadian boards for broadcasting standards (CCNR) because of his controversial statements on social care and Haitians, as well as for its ausfälligen way of talking about a partial setback. 
The CCNR believes, M. Dupont and his CHOI 98,1 FM-Team had the right to their own opinion, but it would have certain statements "inaccurate information on the social care and unjustified negative portrayals of the Haitians and also ungehobelte speech in such a way that the commercials broadcast during the day is not adequate." 
The supervisory board also had finally concluded that a discussion about suicide, contains the names of two people who have committed suicide, is against the code of Rundfunkübertragung. 
The CCNR had a number of complaints relating to the during of in the period between 2008 and 2010, broadcast comments made broadcasts. 
The first was made available as a result of a complaint of "frontline commun of personnes assistées sociales du Quebec". 
The activist organisation had complained that the figures quoted in the programme were inaccurate. 
The hosts should be solid and misleading information. 
On the issue of suicide had a moderator, Mr Dupont said that the suicide was an expression of cowardice. 
The majority of the board members had the conclusion that the message conveyed was that suicide is not a solution to the crisis of life should be considered. 
"The majority of the oversight council to take into account the uncertainty of the effects of the" Dupont le Midi "a sensitive topic in families, fairer and more appropriate manner" had raised. 
So it was with no censure against his person. 
The last point of contention concerned the claims, which referred to the earthquake in Haiti. 
Jean-René Dufort Stéphane Dupont and media had an effective argument that we have a range of reactions. 
The CHOI-Moderator had said, not for the benefit of the Haiti-Hilfe to have donated that, because we do not know with certainty whether those who need it, really would receive the donations. 
The supervisory board is of the opinion that these comments were not abusive nature, but their cumulative effect of an unwarranted negative picture of the Haitians. 
"I have already received my three-day suspension penalty abgebüßt in this matter." 
"My acts is jungfräulich for a year and a half," said the presenter. 
In all decisions denounces the supervisory board the spread of a ungehobelten way. 
In all cases the CHOI-FM Rundfunkansager "beyond its obligations". 
The consequences for the radio stations, which among other things, his decisions during the prime time unique within a period of three days, had intended to inform, is negligible.
