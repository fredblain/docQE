An electoral defeat 
No one had expected that the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect. 
But the facts, the fears of election workers who rushed to the aid of the beleaguered country. 
Overcrowding in polls, several votes cast, election notes in Rinnstein, polling stations and intimidation were only a part of the problems.

Shortly before the start of the election were approximately 250,000 cards to the election will be needed, not yet been distributed.
