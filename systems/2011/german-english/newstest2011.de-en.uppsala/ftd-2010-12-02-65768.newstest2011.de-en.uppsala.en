Ogoniland is burnt 
The water in the river is ölbraun, it looks very much as petrol stations: Billion litres of oil spills have the natural in Ogoniland in Nigeria. 
People live by theft, corruption and illegal Ölkochen. 
Celestine Akpobari thinks it is a good thing. 
"Consuming you do," reassured the Ökoaktivist the journalists: "You still enough oily slime before the lens." 
The 37-year-old Nigerian has the attempt, one to the chest in the water with the boys surround him watenden Schlieren abzulichten regenbogenfarbenen glamour: In the water, the scene almost beautiful. 
That, under the surface of the brown Rohölschwaden system, is not to see. 
In the past, have a bucket, shrimp, told Esther Badom on the shores of Bodo-Jetty-Flusses. 
Now is the lazy river waters entirely dead. 
Five years ago from a geborstenen poured tons of crude oil pipeline in the vast wetland. 
Fishermen from nearby city Bodo must now row to six hours in fischhaltige waters: In the heart of the Niger Delta in Ogoniland is regarded as one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world. 
On the journey through the river basins Mangrovensümpfe criss-crossed the full extent of the devastation is apparent. 
Instead helles water wühlt the motor boat brown brew was on who his hand into the water, prefers ölige finger. 
The roots of the Mangrovenbäumchen as black Lakritzstangen sticking out of the ground, sad I sometimes present their Wedel palm trees. 
Vogelschwärme in wetlands, as usual, are meted out: Once the external Border quiet, is spreading in the as a filling station riechenden former paradise gespenstische rest. 
"What has occurred here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari gloomy: "We live in constant threat to his health." 
The war comparison is appropriate. 
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a controversial battleground for decades, more than 60 years ago, the first Explorateure from Europe, are organised in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, here in 1993 to Shell-Konzern his cease production because it was too dangerous for the oil workers. 
Today, the company is yet to return after Ogoniland denied: While from the whole of the delta region of the three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 Bohrquellen and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines every day, more than two million barrels of the black gold, are being pumped the oil fields in Ogoniland, the corporation is too unstable the situation. 
Every few hundred metres sticking stählerne Gestelle as fanciful sculptures from the water: "Christbäumchen" the heads of the boreholes much to zärtlich. 
They are up to 50 years old, most korrodiert to the core. 
Always promoting good-quality such a Bohrkopf, says Akpobari rinne, then a constant stream of crude oil into the water. 
More than two billion litres, experts estimate that in 50 years, has flowed into the ecosystem of the Delta: Year after year, as is the amount of oil in the wreck of the super tanker, "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the sea off Alaska became one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind. 
Who should pay for the continuing ultimate environmental catastrophe is to blame, it will be argued. 
During the Shell-Konzern sabotage and the organised Öldiebstahl for more than 90% of the pollution, see environmentalists berstende Bohrköpfe and lecke pipelines as the main culprit. 
In Nigeria, Shell safety standards to significantly lower than would otherwise have been in the world, the usual US-Wissenschaftler Richard Steiner the company in 2008, the rate of defects of the lines was "much higher than elsewhere." 
In one place, which from a distance as an abandoned, ölverschmierte open-air garage looks, from the mangroves characters: They are cluster naked ölverschmiert and right up to the neck. 
Under one of the many cellars, sometimes with tubes, sometimes random scattered on the site, have come to identify a fire: An illegal small refinery. 
In the barrel of crude oil on the fire, it will be several hours long, heated, explains Michael, the leader of the group. 
First seen petrol through the pipes in the Auffangtopf spits, later, at the end of the pipeline, kerosene and diesel. 
So Michael and produce four employees on a daily basis by up to four barrels of diesel à 300 litres: "This brings us 34,000 Naira a" - around 22 dollars. 
The delta residents take advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state of black Africa. 
Nigeria has a single refinery. 
The nearly 40 euro cents per litre ridiculously low price of diesel oil can still undercut the illegal Kocher: Because they get their raw materials free of charge. 
It comes from "Bunkerern" that the pipeline network across Ogoniland on tap: This is the way to go in the country, according to experts in the entire Niger Delta at least 16 million litres of crude oil per day. 
Only a tiny portion of the raw materials, however, will be between stored illegally veredelt fill: The lion's share of the organised criminal networks, which also includes politicians and high-level military tankers and in command on the world market. 
The debate on whether the environmental disaster more to the particular population or the over-liberal production due to the activist Akpobari for purely academic. 
"The oil companies were not as invaders, and they would have the livelihoods of the fishermen not as thoroughly destroyed, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal mills." 
Now is the relationship of the Ogoni especially for Shell but so destroyed that only a withdrawal of the group in question would be: 'Maybe some other nationalities are, of course, as the Chinese and better. " 
There is Michael nervous. 
"High time for her to disappear," says the muskulöse Ölmann. 
"Every minute the soldiers can come." 
The illegal Ölveredler of the special unit of the armed forces, they are caught not arrest, but a painful bribes. 
The mainly from the country's north to soldiers - as all Nigerians, from the raw material. 
"This damn stuff has our country in every respect to the dog," says Akpobari brought.
