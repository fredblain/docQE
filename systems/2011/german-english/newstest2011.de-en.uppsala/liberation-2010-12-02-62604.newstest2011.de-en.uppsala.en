Climate: How France is its financial promises 
A year after the Copenhagen treaty, it is time to comply with the financial promises (also quickly resolved "fast start" finance) or premature to investigate by developing countries, which have been implemented. 
The rough French are already vulnerable to blandishments. 
With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries committed to $30 billion between 2010 and 2012. 
The EU has 7.2 billion euros over three years, promised France 1.26 billion euros (420 million per year). 
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has pulled out all the stops for its partners from the fact their efforts to persuade about Fast-Start-Finanzierungen: Detailgetreuer approach report of its Member States, press conference that large events, as well as the distribution of brochures. 
The operation is a remarkable transparency and precisely for its estimated value: The developing countries and the society would like to see all the developed countries do the same for the same level of precision. 
The EU announced that in 2010 to 2.2 billion euros, which they released to the right path to Respektbezollung their commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012. 
If you look into the details, however, things are a little more complicated. 
This money should be according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional use was introduced, to the detriment of the public development aid. 
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means. 
While the Commission had proposed a harmonisation have certain members states, including France, the process deadlocked. 
Today everyone chooses the benchmark, which he regarded as the best. 
The European Commission, for example, as a benchmark for those of the year for 2009: The international funding will be retained, and in the context of the funding "Fast-Start" 150 million over three years. 
Other countries have similar standards, either in terms of the year, or about conditions at the level of public aid. 
In return, France was of the opinion that the funding "of all new projects" of 2010 were "new and additional". 
In other words, there are no references in the spending of the previous year, or at a global level of public aid. 
In practical terms, the total amount of the French support of developing countries remain stable (or decrease) - France claims that his commitment to the "new and additional" funding. 
Another key factor is the breakdown in donations and loans. 
There is no rule, and everyone chooses his Rechenmodus. 
Some, such as France, are lent €1 as being equivalent to 1 donated €. 
Obviously, this is hard to justify that the effort is not comparable. 
If the use of loans for certain profitable investment (often linked to emissions control technology projects on effektivster based) can be justified, it is misleading to present the euro, known as the equivalent for a donated euro captured... also should only the cost of the loan for the capital donor country and commitment are counted (i.e. the equivalent of the interest rate). 
But France has not in the sense that, as the following comment: "Respected" his commitment of 420 million euros, making 91.5% loans (389,8 million euros), and 8.5% donates) 36.1 million euro) - see also the document, in order to persuade yourself. 
France is the only land the EU that loans to a great extent. 
Germany 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands, or Slovakia (among other things) to 100% of its commitments with donations. 
In other words, if the overwhelming majority of the European Union to fulfil their obligations to €1, France spends just 10 cents and understands including a comparable effort. 
Beautiful Hokuspokus! 
All in all, operates France in its Fast-Start-Finanzierung with a double fraud: A part of the action with a Weiterentwicklkung on time and partly with the reality of financial support. 
France, manages to believe that there are 420 million "new and additional" million, in line with his promise and has spent it saves 36.1 million euros. 
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it appears that it was the arbitrage Bercy, which has carried out a double negative effect) could entail; even internally (why the other members states with the donations, if there is enough to lend?), and then to the negotiations, as the emerging countries are not completely fooled... 
The chapter of the premature funding only a small matter in a relatively short period, compared to the entirety of discussions about the climate. 
But it could drop too many in the vast machine of the UNFCCC. 
Let us hope that this will not be the case. 
As it always had, it is essential that his lesson from this first year of premature funding to learn. 
First and foremost, France could be a change in its accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, and to do so in a spirit of respect for his obligations and compensatory justice with the other countries in the European Union. 
But above all France could the discussions on the subject of a dispute of long-term financing to move forward (another key topic), and at the moment: You can escape the question of 'Verrechenbarkeit "the recording kind of its loans or not. 
France could alter its position, just ahead of the curve in terms of the contentious issues, as it is in other areas. 
The hope is based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, which will arrive in Cancun next week. 
A surprising announcement on the Fast-Start of France and his vision of "Verrechenbarkeit" as well as the use of loan would inherently the international trust to raise the necessary for further discussions.
