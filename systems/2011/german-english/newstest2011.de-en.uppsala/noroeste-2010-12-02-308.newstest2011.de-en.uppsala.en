NASA announces the discovery Außerirdischen life 
The American space agency summoned a press conference tomorrow to a Fund vorzustelle, the implications for the search for life in space. 
The National air and Space Agency (NASA) of the United States tomorrow, Thursday, a astrobiologische aware of the discovery of the existence of the theory Außerirdischen life could confirm. 
The Fund will tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington from experts presented the Astrobiologie. This is a science that is at the root of the development, distribution, and future of life in the universe. 
When convening of the press conference, assuring NASA that it will be "a supervisory impressive Fund for the search for life" außerirdischem imagine what triggered speculation in experts in other countries. 
The discovery could prove the theory that it is in hostile environments, which it has held for unbwohnbar, human-like creatures exist. It has raised the possibility that these are intelligent creatures - and as human - could transform, if their living conditions are improved. 
Apparently, it is a microbe, which is at the bottom of the mono Lake in Yosemite-Nationalpark, California, has been found, and they live in an environment that was too toxic for all possible ways of life, because the sea was kept arsenhaltig is strong. 
The Mikrobie used in any way the arsenic than survival resource. With this ability to increase the chances that the other planets, which do not have our friendly atmosphere, similar life could be. 
If these organisms verstoffwechseln the arsenic is in accordance with the Astrobiologen shown that "it really is a different way of life, a second form of life, which is, as we know." 
The space agency is tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference the real scope of their funds. 
In the conference's Geobiologin Pamela Conrad, the possibility of life on Mars, and a biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, the Titan (the largest moon Saturns), the question is whether its chemical composition similar to that of the Earth.
