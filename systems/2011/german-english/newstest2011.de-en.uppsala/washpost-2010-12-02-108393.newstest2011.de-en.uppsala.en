Veterans, the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past. 
In a weak pointed betonierten class room with dirty and abbl채tternden walls, recalling the director of Anlong Veng High School to the man that he has built, in the Ta Mok, the Khmer Rouge leaders. 
"Everyone here loves" Ta Mok. 
"He was a good leader, and he has gone about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years. 
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge reign, known as the "butchers," is the military commander in this remote former Rouge Rouge-Hochburg in the north west of Cambodia's popular, where he built bridges, hospitals and the infrastructure has developed and where thousands of former soldiers still live. 
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, are long-time supporters in Anlong Veng challenged. 
In April, allowed a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum the victims of public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime. 
In June, the government distributed an object that children of former soldiers for the first time in the history of the Khmer Rouge are told. 
And in July, a Community tribunal the UN and Cambodia for the first time, a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, sentenced to 35 years in prison. 
With each of these developments, the fear among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, hindered their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia. 
"There is still fear in the opposition and former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Youk Chhang, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime. 
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." 
"It disrupts own families." 
During the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, overwork or diseases. 
When the Vietnamese invaded in 1979 and the pole Pot-Ied government then fled the remnants of the regime and its military to the Cambodian border to Thailand. 
Widely-spread here until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered, the anxiety. 
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary the guerrilla war from its base in the West, the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok, the next generation in Anlong Veng. 
But in the mid-1990s, as a peace agreement supported by the United Nations in 1993, is one of the first democratic elections in the country, began large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, the government, which is to cross the Kapitulationen of Ieng Sary in 1996 and 1998, Khieu Samphan Nuan Chea and led. 
Pol Pot died in 1998, and a natural death, the Ta Mok, was not given in 1999 by government forces in the Dangrek Mountain were arrested. 
He died in 2006 at the prison in Phnom Penh, where he was waiting for his trial. 
As their benefactors they no longer protected, fled most former Khmer Rouge fighters in the exhausting poverty of rural Cambodia and many were nostalgic for the movement. 
Even if a few elitist officials of the Khmer Rouge their local government posts, because they laid down their arms, but the ordinary soldiers poor, uneducated farmers. 
"These people have only benefited very little of the capitulation," said Sok Leang by the Center for Justice and reconciliation across Cambodia in Anlong Veng, also, public forums, 
"They are enshrined in the utopian Agrarideologie of the regime". 
"They grew without any professional know." 
Sor Lim, 55, who as a teenager in 1974 had joined the Rhmer Rouge, fought in the jungle to Anlang Veng, before he was defeated in 1998, a life as poor rice farmer. 
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was a good thing," he said. 
"TA Mok each has something to eat." 
"But now, the life is difficult, because we need to look to ourselves." 
The Khmer Rouge tribunal has also concerns out here. 
At the beginning of next year, will be the court try Nuon Chea president Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to court. 
The mission of the court, it is that the old leaders and those most responsible for atrocities are to be condemned, but it has not said whether it has these four cases, other acts will follow. 
That has done little to fear in Anlong Veng, the works. 
Current media speculation at In Chaem, 64 years, during the time of Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's district leader in the province was Manteay Meanchey. 
In 2007 it had a representative of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, told they have to build the dam Trapeang Thma steered a project in which thousands of forced labour probably died. 
On a hot night, In Chaem of the work in the fields for her wooden house on a filthy streets outside of Anlong Veng. 
As the sun long shadow over the desiccated grass threw rejected In Chaem it, about their past when the Khmer Rouge. 
The court should they vorladen, they would refuse to go, she said. 
"Cambodia live in peace and stability," she said. 
"There would be no prosecutions more would be in war." 
Prime Minister Hun Sen, in 1878 from the Khmer Rouge has fled, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, would the court more suspects on trial, even though experts and historians to discuss this. 
"Digging a hole and Cambodia must bury the past," he said. 
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to be able to go forward, Youk Chhang said the documentation center. 
"Reconciliation with the Khmer-Zeiten means bring together the broken pieces," he said. 
"It is our duty to put parts together, these broken, so that they can understand how everything." 
The centre has created the first of the government, the object of the Khmer Rouge, the 75seitige "history of Democratic Cambodia." 
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng than annex to the history books for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which is less than four sides on the Khmer Rouge. 
As so often in Cambodia know the young people in Anlong Veng little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the links of the city to the regime. 
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new object is helping students, is an important part of their history. 
But his parents were sceptical when he came home with the book, to be read. 
"My family rejects many parts of the book, and the court," he said. 
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people the court to be sentenced." 
Such a resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Leang said Sok. 
But the public forums, the object and the court and gain influence, "he said. 
Still, the Khmer Rouge is a powerful attraction.

Pol Pot's body after his death in 1998, was on a pile of tyres have been burnt. 
Sothea Nuom, 31 years, a Handyverk채uferin at the side of the road, said she does not know much about the man who was to have been burnt. 
"But he has a strong spirit, and many of the people here are going to pray for him," she said. 
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday later in the day and it wanted to to Pol Pot's final resting place, where they will take a more mature bush bananas - in the hope that he will bring her luck.
