In the hunt for the head of Wikileaks 
Obama appoints a high responsible for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new revelations. 
Interpol has a red warning to track and detect Assange. 
Everything with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated maze, in the bottom of the facts just difficult. 
Yesterday Interpol had a "red alert" to "discover and persecution" of Assange. 
It is, however, not to be a traditional order to arrest. 
In addition, it is not new, it comes from the 20 November. 
It also has nothing to do with the recent revelation of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but also to do with the accusations of sexual abuse, which the Australians are in Sweden. 
The lawyer also assured the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they have been in contact with Mr Assange." 
Already on 20, the international police agency based in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden the order, but it was up to yesterday after receiving authorisation by the Swedish authorities have not been announced. 
As things are, the 188 Interpol countries are instructed, Assange to identify and locate, "to arrest and extradite him for the time being." 
Although Interpol the arrest of a red warning affected individual cannot issue orders, many member countries, according to the organisation the red warning as a licence for a Arrestierung - the national police force must be carried out, particularly when they are on a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange presumably. 
The move outraged Assanges lawyers gesten, published a letter in which they were informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is prepared by video conference to answer questions from the Swedish authorities. 
They also recall that Assange exit from Sweden, and from the state, a lawyer with the sagenumwobenen Pavlovich Lavrentiy Beria, security chief of Stalin, compared to the corresponding authorization. 
"It is a race, not as a legal persecution" in the letter. 
While the world is him, and his mother of Australia from the innocence of their son claimed - believes Assange to an unknown place, however, in silence. 
On Monday he gave the head of the magazine Time, by Skype of a vague place for an interview during the conversation, he called for the resignation of the Secretary of State of the USA, Hillary Clinton. 
"If it can be shown that it was responsible for ordering North American diplomats, the UN, and therefore to spy on the United States has violated international agreements signed, they would have to resign," he said. 
His opinion was yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, condemned the request for his resignation as "ridiculous and absurd". 
"I am not sure why we value to the views of a type with a website should be," he told the station, CNN reported. 
Obama himself has a lot of people responsible for the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, with the prevention of new documents revelations. 
The attempt by the spokesman of the Pr√§sidenden Barack Obama, Assange less attention, is in contrast to the views of the conservative politicians and commentators in recent days. 
The Congressman Peter King of January chaired the National Security COM Mitee of the House of Representatives, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "in order to put their money to seize and everyone they supported or contributes to follow." 
Tom Flanagan, adviser of the Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to his statement, Assange must be murdered "revoked". 
"Obama should turn it into a target and a not so what use bemanntes or aircraft." 
Anyone not apologising, Mike Huckabee, was baptistischer minister, a former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate. 
"Whoever it was, always in the government leaked the information, he is guilty of treason and everything is eiine no execution is too lenient punishment," he told the station, Fox.
