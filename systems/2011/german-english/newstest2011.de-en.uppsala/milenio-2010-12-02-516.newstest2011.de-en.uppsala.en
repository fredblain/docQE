The santistische strategist, the first end game as coach of the 'Torneo Apertura 2002, when del Morelia in the driving seat, with which he has had against Toluca 4-2 with a great defeat; later, it was in the' Clausura '2003 he achieved the crucial duel he lost against Rayados to 3-1.

Rubén already had two Endspiele with the Diablos Rojos and Monterrey, his major rivals lost. This is why he would not be prosecuted by the accident and the evil sorcerer lift in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, even though he said that for him the most important thing is the game itself. 
"I want to be champion, I would like to, it is not statistics break for a club that for my affection, I hingebe, and so will the title come to see me, but what happened before, is the most important thing," commented the tax man, when we asked him about the lost Endspiele. 
The last end game is still very much in our minds, he has been assured, he learned a lot from it, and to have said: "The only lesson that we can draw from this is that, until the referee not the end of the act, can we not celebrate in the line that we are prepared, that the players, too, because the last time we were with two Elfmetern already prepared to depart, and I believe that this is a lesson not until the game is over, there is no cause for celebration." 
To know that this series be decided by shootout, concerned it could not, because he trusts his players: "You never want to get in the shootout, we would like to finish in the regular game time, but sometimes there is no alternative, and you have to be prepared in the previous tour, we were prepared, but unfortunately, we were the fate of a bad game, sometimes as a result of the intense desire of nervousness, or that the title already in the hands of the left us something for the final, and we hope that this time it will not happen." 
Romanso it is in power, not just the second to be a champion for the first time, and the glory, the cost to the title.
