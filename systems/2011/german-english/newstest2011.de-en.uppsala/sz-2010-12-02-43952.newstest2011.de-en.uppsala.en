For Angelina Jolie in the summer with the work of the still nameless stage debut has begun, there is trouble. 
The script she has even written a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man. 
Not much more we know about it - but even that is enough for alarm. 
The myth persists that the woman, a Muslim, Verliebe during the Jugoslawien-Krieges in her Serb rapist. 
Bosnian women's groups immediately protested in Sarajevo, after which some planned Drehtage in the short term, have been transferred to Hungary. 
In the meantime, the film in Hungary and marginalised in the post production, but it is still protested in Bosnia. 
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female victims of war, wrote about the UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerk UNHCR of Jolie and asked for a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper, has now told the ambassador, Jolie is even UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerks. 
Diplomatically, it is not, she has taken the women to a few weeks ago at a meeting in Hungary, which rejected the offer, though. 
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, Hasecic. 
Love stories in rape camps have not been, and Jolie attitude towards the victims - her enough on the script. 
Her organisation has recommended the UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerk Jolie as ambassador, according to the Guardian, reported.

The young author even claimed that they do not follow the political intentions with the film, is said to be in a lot of trouble in the Jugoslawien-Konflikt incorporated wanted the terrible consequences of the war, and show to give a voice to all the parties involved. 
The content, however, remains vague. 
So a second Synopsis circulating on the film in the network, which then but rather different sounds: The lovers already knew from war to break out, and, when they are, a Bosnian Muslim, in a Serbian Camp abducted, where he works as a guard. 
Which is considerably different sounds when the variant verknallt "rape victims in torturer." 
That Jolie film actually starts before the war - that much is sure. 
The pressure on them, as Jolie, was "unfair and is based on misleading information." 
Now, they can only the hackers of Hollywood: Make peace by the script, like so many before it, is illegal to be put on the Web.
