Some finger and a ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer, 
Men, whose finger is long, as the ring fingers are obviously a lower risk of developing prostate cancer. 
This is a surprising result of a study on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer, was published. 
This is, in fact, with the levels of the male hormone testosterone. 
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and that it can serve in men up to 60," said co-author of the study, the Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick. 
The finger could help to determine what men should undergo a Prostatakrebs-Test necessarily, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health problems, added Mrs Eeles. 
In the period from 1994-2009 they followed that with their counterparts in Britain and more than 500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men. 
In more than half of the participants in the study was the finger of the right hand is shorter than ring fingers. 
For these men had the same likelihood of prostate cancer, and for 19% of the men, whose Ring- and finger the same period. 
In men, whose finger longer than the ring finger was this risk, however, fell by 33 per cent and in men by 60 even by 87 percent. 
The relationship between the length of the two mentioned above finger, which is already in the prenatal age, apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones, which the child was exposed to in the womb. 
Less testosterone is a longer finger. 
Earlier research found that the testosterone accelerated the growth of prostate cancer. 
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticists and a former chairman of the National Academy of Sciences, said that he did this study ČTK Lives, however, he is aware of the relationship between its length and the risk of cancer for "has not been proven."
