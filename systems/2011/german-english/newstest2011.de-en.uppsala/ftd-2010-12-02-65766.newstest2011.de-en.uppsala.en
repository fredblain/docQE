Obama stop new drilling 
US-Bundesstaats off the coast of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the next few years there will be no new oil drilling. 
The government has a similar ban in Washington - and therefore definitively revoke its earlier plans. 
Even before new drilling along the Atlantic coastline will remain for the time being. 
This told Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Wednesday. 
The trigger for the strict ban that for at least the next five years, is the explosion of Bohrplattform "Deepwater Horizon" in April. 
Before the disaster, which claimed the lives of 11 workers and the world's biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had led to pressure from the opposition and the industry is its willingness to new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico. 
Advocates want the extent of US dependence on foreign oil. 
Who was responsible for the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf, is still not finally resolved. 
At the heart of the criticism of the British energy group BP, which is faced with billions of demands. 
An investigation commissioned by Obama during the December 2008 to submit their results. 
In October, Home Secretary Ken Salazar the Bohrstopp imposed after the explosion. 
After various oil companies had immediately applications for new Bohrvorhaben. 
With tighter control and stricter safety regulations to Obama and Salazar a new disaster. 
At present, the competent authority, after numerous allegations of corruption, was in disrepute, radically reformed. 
At the same time, Obama has announced that lucrative tax breaks for the oil and Gaskonzerne to close. 
The industry warns now publicly that the output in the Gulf by a stricter regulation that would be substantially smaller than it is now. 
"The government's plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a recent industry survey by consultant BDO - before the Bohrverbot of Wednesday. 
The American Energy Alliance also complained about the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows what will happen with the regulation that is going to change." 
Investment in new projects would be postponed until further notice, at the expense of growth.
