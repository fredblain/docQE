Since Hampton recently in Ensigns election team was, it was a year, he was not lobbying for his former employers or accept the whole Senate.

Prosecutors "are obviously scared detention," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the association, "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organisation, which aims to combat corruption in parliament and government circles in the United States), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr. Ensign brought before the courts. 
"This means that, in general, high-profile government officials now assume that the law does not apply to them," she added. 
Paul Coggins, the main defenders of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had a telephone call on Monday, a prosecutor, and another the next day, where he was told that the department does not levy charges against his clients. 
Mr. Ensigns defender had cooperated with prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator as his office, in a statement on Wednesday, again repeated, "in accordance with the law". 
Mr. Coggins refused, the legal arguments which he had presented to prosecutors, to explain. 
"I think it is not in the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice, and I just want to go, and, we believe, to have made the right decision," he said. 
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided that the investigation of a separate appeal by the group, after the payment of $96,000 of Mr. Ensigns parents to the Hamptons against the federal election law. 
The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that anything other than the money was a gift. 
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which for a long time, the Senator was one of the firms, in which Mr. Hampton, thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign Lobbyisten-Arbeit took place. 
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that, since the company has helped Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a conversation with Mr. Hampton had him, in which he said that he, the Interior Ministry because of a cause "anklopfe." 
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and other customers for Nevada, and Allegiant Air, agreed to lunch and asked the transport minister, in a meeting in the name of the airline, to reconcile after Mr. Hampton for lobbying had stopped. 
Last year, for the first time, information about this case, Medellín apologize to the public, Mr. Ensign was in his constituents and his position in the Senate, where he is in the ranking of Republicans in fourth place.

In an announcement that Mr. Ensign no longer the target of police inquiries, said his press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, the senator hope that the Ethics Commission quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and its investigations unit once.
