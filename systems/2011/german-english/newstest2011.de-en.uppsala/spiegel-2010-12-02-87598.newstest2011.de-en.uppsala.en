To hell, warriors. 
Splatter fit for the art of cinema? 
The director Nicolas Refn is testing, with its winding Kämpfer-Epos Walhalla "Rising" old Genre-Grenzen new. 
To what audience may the Danish director Nicolas Refn winding than he could have imagined, "Rising Walhalla, revolved around"? 
A captured Wikinger-Krieger with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) exempt themselves from his Peinigern and places with almost superhuman forces rushed to his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, it is because our hero like rough killing methods and his enemies to Gedärme from the vibrant physical, if he has a bad mood. 
On the other hand, says Einauge, as he is called, indeed, the whole film about a word, and the other characters are on, at most, one or two sentences or shout a few painful death. 
Otherwise, it will be silent and the gruselig beautiful hill landscape of Scotland geschwelgt the Wikingerwelt of about a thousand years, to the scene. 
Ideal for adult Cineasten with interest for Existentialismus and very calm camera journeys. 
Nice if a film has several target groups, it is a shame, if they are mutually exclusive. 
Orchestrator winding Refn, since his wild and gestylten Drogendealer-Trilogie "Pusher" as a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, refuses stoically his works, but with a little more humour the mainstream or something less brutality the Arthouse accessible. 
Most art films friends are around the mass and the Gedärmen spritzenden brain to be deterred. 
The Action-Fans at least we will die from boredom when Einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem; and an eternity in the doldrums and fog before the team is apparently in America, are still and silent. 
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany, no cinema lending, and now only on DVD. 
This is particularly because of the magnificent images of a shame, but also because the prätentiösen until bluttriefenden facade hiding a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention. 
In this film, it is not about the dialogues or a stringent action, it is all atmosphere, a film, attributed a fever dream. 
And there is no means of escape for the viewer. 
Refn hardly takes him a moment of relaxation and drawn images of him, with its icy and the dark Trance-artigen Sound track the throats very slowly, but above all with the incredible hatred of him from the heart of the characters badge. 
Only a small boy, the blonder Einauge faithful to the side, does preserve something as innocent, all the others are driven by anger. 
The vast majority of the one-eyed man hero, whose motives are never explained, but for enemies temporary allies and at some point will the Warriors from hell, to the Ambassador of the devil. 
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the already verdorbenen. 
Walhalla "Rising" is a more puzzling film, which we hate, and admire the angry, upset and surprise. 
An eerie experience.
