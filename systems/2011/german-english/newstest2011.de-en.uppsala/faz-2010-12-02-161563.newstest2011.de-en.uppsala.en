The Eis-Universität 
"Gelato in the" University in Bologna Eiskonditoren times of year to be better prepared. 
The three-day basic rate for future Gelatieri has the largest pool of recruits and visitors from around the world. 
Why, in fact, the entire ice? 
The Gelatiere and the Gelataio. 
The Gelatiere, in German, is something old-fashioned the Eiskonditor the cream, following all the rules of the Italian Eismacherkunst ago. 
The Gelataio is catching up with a Spachtel the ice cream from the Kühltheke, it highlights in the Waffel and then selling them. 
For this to know, you do not have to Anzola Dell Emilia in the province of Bologna. 
But who still want to know more about the ice, which is not in the "Gelato-University" the Italian firm Carpigiani over. 
The Eis-Universität, the manufacturers of Eismaschinen set up in 2003, so that the ice cream from their machines everywhere the high Italian ideals. 
The three-day basic rate for future Gelatieri has the largest pool of recruits and visitors from around the world. 
But there are also mehrtägige Spezialkurse around the Schokoladeneis and internships Eisdiele own in the House. 
Some dreams in the Midlife-Crisis of a new career, other cars simply times on the treacherous ice its vague aspirations. 
This time, there are 40 players from 19 countries on all continents, of Brazil on Hungary to Saudi Arabia. 
Jacky, art teachers from California, loves Slow-Food-Bewegung and wants to be in the country of the future, a European industrial Ice-Cream quality product. 
Anke from Berlin, is a business adviser and after years in a nerve-racking eintüten their job. 
Two young Egyptians dream of a Eisdiele in Cairo to open. 
A man from Malta and one from Brazil and the quality of the ice cream in its bars improve - and the Canadian House, Mrs Julia is because their children love Italian ice cream. 
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari declared the participants initially the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream. 
What is crucial is not only good taste but also the seidige fluidity and good consistency. 
Luciano forgets in its training but not the icing on the cake of the national and even südländischen excessive building: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and that is still a lot of romanticism in that." 
The first step in the production seems quite simple. 
Luciano dump the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a major Mixgerät with an electronic programme everything to 85 degrees heated and then cools to four degrees. 
Then he turns off the engine, and out comes a pasteurised white base cream, Milcheissorten basis for all. 
The teacher immediately bestürmt with questions: Can you ice cream only with natural substances without stabiliser? 
How can one of their own Experimentierlust free rein? 
Luciano warns that in the spirit of the time. 
Those of ice cream "natural ingredients only" talk, perhaps still stabilisers is used, often a product of nature, for example, from the Guarbohne Guarkernmehl. 
Of course you can hold even without a binding agent, only it must then be sold within a day, otherwise sackt it in, and the customer will bite on Eiskörnchen louder. 
Certain variations of the reason crowds are allowed. 
Exciting it will be with the flavourings. 
For the taste of ice in different Maestro Luciano between the ingredients in the fruit department or in the sweets of supermarket buying. 
In addition, there are powder and Pasten. 
"The suppliers are you all are trying to foist onto dozens aromatised supplements." 
"But you should just experiment." 
Either the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruits. 
Or in ice cream from the white mass, and reason with eggs to yellow cream and cocoa powder as the basis for all sorts of Schokoladen-Verführungen. 
Now the course participants in the Eismaschinen. 
Luciano, they each of four different types of Vanille-, Schokolade- Mokka- Haselnuss-Eis, and produce - with or without eggs in the mass, with more or less Vanillearoma or other natural supplements. 
The same experiment will also undergo Fruchteissorten. 
More flavourings, more Frucht-Püree taste - is not necessarily better. 
Haselnuss-Eis tastes not necessarily nut, if it contains the hazelnuts. 
The most popular Kiwi-Eis, the working group, the more fruit used, less water and a little less stabiliser. 
Only a balanced mix will highlight the taste of a gelato clear, says Luciano. 
Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: Will Pfirsich-Püree used with a lot of sugar, the sugars in the basic recipe be reduced. 
For Zitroneneis is an extra dose of sugar needed. 
Luciano prefers a piece of equipment, with the sugar content of the fruit varieties (vine-growers measure determined the Oechsle in the grape must). 
Fortunately tables which facilitate the benefits. 
Ice to no longer require so much physical use as in the past. 
Not only the equipment for the automatic restoration of basic mass helps. 
There is also a device at the same time, the ready-made Eis-Mischung cremig beaten and to minus temperatures cooling. 
Despite all the automated remain small glitches. 
The Brazilian Gustavo late and its rate of colleagues from top to bottom with Fruchtpüree than it is the colossal hand blenders out of control. 
"In every direction," says Maestro Luciano, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens."
