Grand Paris Métro: First financial vignettes 
Since the debate about the modernisation of the transport industry, on the Ile de France is in full swing, it rains billion. 
At least in the discussions. 
We call this in particular the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris in the memory, the Société du Grand Paris, is being built. 
At the start of construction - the SGP to get under way, the state is a Kapitaldotation of 4 billion euros. 
In the theoretical system, it is the sum of the SGP then that would allow the markets, a part of the financial sum on her double. 
Today, it is the first projections. 
The supplementary budget from 2010, this morning looked at by the finance committee of the National Assembly, contains the measures, the first part of that money. 
It is about two things: The creation of a special tax to Erschließund and higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France. 
The former, just remove Article 15 of the draft law, "for the benefit of the public corporation Société du Grand Paris." 
This is quantified: "The product of these tax amounts to 117 million euros per year". 
Zweitere is an overhaul of the existing corporate taxation: "In order to modernise that directs it to increase product and this increase of Société du Grand Paris on to future generations". 
How much would it make? 
A mystery. 
That sum is not included in the text. 
Of the 4 billion is a long way off. 
"It is said that the fiscal resources to the 4 billion euro of Kapitaldotation to be added by the government, which will be found and the Société du Grand Paris, and that is for the project to be done", the explanatory statement. 
The SGP will take place this system is not offensive. 
"For the moment, in which revenue has been recorded (the two taxes, R.), can we put on for three years, and then from the 4 billion windfall", it is claimed. 
"That will be taken in the budget and gradually withdrawn." 
The SGP is estimated that, starting in 2013, it will be 4 billion for the budget to make a note of 2014. 
This measure, which promised 4 billion will be able to look for a long time yet, is in danger of a very eventful, parliamentary debate. 
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
