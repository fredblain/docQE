<seg id="1"> What should she do, the ČSSD? The Czech social democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort, nor the "pastry shop." </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new councillors of the capital from the rows of the ČSSD will have to overcome obviously certain linguistic barriers to be able to understand her old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague advice and in the town representation generally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The newspaper Aktuáln ě. cz has "knocked off" members of the new advice from the ČSSD sometimes a little as they control the notorious slang which has become naturalized during the last years in which the today's coalition partners were in Prague in the oar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The coding vocabulary which was introduced in the ex-era by chief burgomaster Pavel Bém of the Prague political élite is borrowed from some of the best known actors, situations and Causae. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Astonishing proofs appeared that the new councils grope about concerning these new concepts something in the darkness. </seg>
<seg id="6"> They maintain this at least. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Wer ist Voldemort?" </seg>
<seg id="8"> "No notion." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am rather a novice in the Prague politics," reacted Luká š Kauck ý, the new councillor for culture, on the test of the "godfather's vocabulary." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But also councillor Karel Březina - a political ex-serviceman - reacted in similar manner. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example, on the concept "Gulf hole." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "This is the only expression of those which you present to me here which I use every now and then." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Otherwise I do not hold a lot from slang." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> From the vocabulary, the daily paper Aktuáln ě. cz had published in this year's June before the electoral congress of the ODS, the editorial staff pecked out six concepts, above all those which are connected notoriously with the Prague City Council. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The social democrats should go the concepts "Voldemort," "the biggest Prague gulf hole," "to the pastry shop" define "bull nape," "betrayal of the capital" and "verblechen." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín wagonbuilder, the future boss of the Prague school system - promised first his participation in the conversation, then did not answer, however, sometimes the phone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the start. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "These things make no difference to me and how the middle-class democrats talk together, about that I do not judge." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "For me is important as we get on within the scope of our programmes," he countered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> As already intimated, Luká š Kauck ý would not have recognised in the headline mentioned on top supposedly that from the high-powered enterpriser and friend of the ex-chief burgomaster Bém, Roman Janou š ek the speech is. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The concept "Voldemort" says Kaucky purely nothing at all and the only concept which he guessed with the test correctly, was "the biggest Prague gulf hole." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kauck ý, still, however, added to the security: "But I know this rather from the newspaper." </seg>
<seg id="23"> And jokingly: "I will have to book a linguistic course." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Then the "gulf hole" is deciphered not only by matador Karel Březina, but also by the councillor for environmental issues Luká š Plach ý properly as a tunnel Blanka. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> However, both social democrats also know for whom the concept Voldemort stands and Luká š Plach ý anticipates even where this figure is to be found and thereby also, what it means, "to the pastry shop to go." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "I believe to go that is to any Prague catering trade company," Plach ý is quite near in it in the riddle solution if one knows that it concerns, on this occasion, the seat of Janou š eks companies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> However, agree with Březina he protests to have scooped this knowledge rather from the newspaper, as that this vocabulary would be own to him. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> To judge by the test participants, there seems to be among the social democrats really no similarly established slang. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I have also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is not such a thing with us really." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "We calls us with the name, every now and then we also use abbreviation or nickname," says the chairperson of the Prague Petr ÈSSD Hulínsk ý - from his party members casually "Hulda" called. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "At school I was called Bříza (birch), but I do not know whether me also my colleagues call so," Karel Březina betrays to us his nickname. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The newspaper Deník Aktuáln ě. cz has tried out the name and see there - he functions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Councillor Weinert is for the party members friendly the "grandpa" or less friendly the "old person," the representative Miroslav Poche who drew the attention before the elections by machination with the party sponsorship to himself, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Nicknames are thus the only one which the social democrats admit in the inner-party usage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Hulínsk ý does not like it supposedly if one calls him "Hulda," but Deník Aktuáln ě. cz registered one more nickname of the Prague chairperson. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> His nickname "doctor of the truncheon rights" deals supposedly with the fact that Petr Hulínsk ý his title Doctor juris has acquired in the Bratislaver police academy. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The government wants to prevent the torture of "witches" and published a pamphlet </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The women who are stamped in Burkina Faso to witches show as a rule some common social signs. </seg>
<seg id="3"> They belong rather to the older generation, they find no work - for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> If one of these women "becomes" the witch, it is strictly isolated, so that she cannot become dangerous for the rest of the village. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Men are concerned by this destiny rather seldom." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "Also have young and healthy women this remains saved, because they help at the work and bear children," a sister describes the situation which looks in the capital of the West-African state Burkina Faso at a special home after more than 100 women who were expelled by her communities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Now the local government resolved to go forward against this unusual "social measure." </seg>
<seg id="8"> And if a pamphlet which should prevent the "witch's pursuit" gave change that's why. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> However, the thing has a hook. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "derStandard" pointed out to the dilemma of the written clarification. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> However, of the witchcraft is to be accused also in other African countries quite usual ones. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, it was tormented the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová by three women and two men to death - they poured over them with paraffin and simply lighted them. </seg>
<seg id="13"> About this incident the server reported among other things also BBC. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> However, the culprits stated, the thing would have been only one meeting of unhappy circumstances. </seg>
<seg id="15"> According to your version the oil which is used to ritual Salbungen would be roused. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Namely, after the group has tried "to drive out" "a bad mind" from the woman. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The people support the isolation of "witches" here without taking into consideration her education. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "The standard" cited moreover a 42-year-old enterpriser from Burkina Faso: "Gluttons of human souls are former like today a danger," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> While the government tries in Burkina Faso at least to defuse the witch-hunt, the gambianische president has been involved last year the president substantially. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "President Yahya Jammeh kindled after the death of his aunt a monstrous witch-hunt, because these had supposedly portion in their deaths and would try now to kill also the president even by black magic." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "He shouted to it shaman from close Guinea for help, in company of policemen, soldiers and the body guard of the president at random arrested women and men by force from gambianischen villages kidnapped and brought on the farm of the president in Kanilai," the organisation amnesty stated Internationally in her report. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> On the farm the incarcerated people were made drink an Absud from plants with hallucinogenic effect which caused, however, also intestinal problems and nephritic problems. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Only on account of the international pressure nearly thousand prisoners were released again. </seg>

<seg id="1"> A tenant of Bakala: Though he heats in the stove - nevertheless, pays higher rent </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> An older stocky man leaves just the client's centre of the society RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the biggest private owner of flats in Czechia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Under the arm a briefcase with three new hire contracts to three flats: for the own and the flats of his daughters and his son who serves just a prison sentence. </seg>
<seg id="4"> To all three just the rent was raised within the scope of the so-called "deregulation." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Instead of from 3500 crowns of month rent the son should fork out 4100 crowns next year for a 2-room flat with kitchen of the second category. </seg>
<seg id="6"> "And there is not in the flat sometimes fluently warm water and must heat one in an easy coal stove," he taps angry with the finger on the new hire contract of the son for whose signing he has an authority. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "But what - I have signed" he explains half annoyed and half resigns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The civil union BytyOKD.cz which called the new rent terms as "incorrectly and immorally" advises the tenants not to sign the new contracts simply and to wait up to the 7th of December in which she thinks to publish instructions as one goes forward against such contracts. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But the man only declines. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "One says this, the other this," makes he a dark face. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The region of Ostrava becomes thus the big "deregulation lab." </seg>
<seg id="12"> After New Year this deregulation approaches most flats in Czechia whose tenants pay up to now no rent in line with market requirements. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Aktuáln ě. hence, cz decided to visit this "lab" personally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The RPG waiting room in Havířov is crammed full one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Immediately beside the door there stand the bodyguards of a security agency and with her a call device. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "Rent 2011," so there shines a special field Tast on the touchscreen. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Briefly tapped and already the device spits out a number slip of paper. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Hardly we have deciphered the number "157" and already it cheeps on the big display in the cover of the waiting room. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Half a second later one is in the row. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> A little later an older married couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but apparently the rush in the waiting room is not valid at all for the new rent. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance problems and the similar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> From the middle of November flutter in the region of Ostrava the envelope with the new hire contracts to most tenants of a total of 44,000 flats of the port folio of the RPG in the mailboxes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> A rent rise of approx. 15 to 38 percent suggests the RPG Byty to them in the writings. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The special counter for the new rents in the client's centre is opened since the 18th of November. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "The action runs something more than one week, that is this is only the beginning," answer the ladies behind the counter after one moment hesitation when the "client" turns out journalist. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The deregulation and Bakalas former miner's flats are an explosive subject. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before the elections the parliament vice president Lubomír Zaorálek coming from Ostrava of the ČSSD had taken up this subject quite at the top of the voice, no miracle that today the newspapers are fully of it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> "Twenty years I want from them a new floor." </seg>
<seg id="29"> "Not sometimes besch. They could exchange WC glasses," the at the beginning mentioned man air comes along. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Till present stand in a queue according to the employees before all pensioner in the counter to convince itself whether they receive the promised tenant's moderation really which promises to them RPG if they sign the special offer on time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The other tenants who sign the new hire contract up to the 15th of December should also come to the pleasure of a February rent reduced half of it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Till present, however, "deregulation counter" in Havířov is all other, than overloaded from inquiries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> "From yesterday's 360 clients from only about 40 to 50 of the rent were in 2011 because of here," estimate the counter officers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Besides, RPG offers on her web pages, as well as chalkboards individual rent arrangements where it seems necessary. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Should the rent parties not agree, however, on the new rent, it is fixed by an independent court. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> "This should be no threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and absolutely legitimate legal approach," explains RPG on his web pages. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> "Here nobody goes in court," believes one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street before the client's centre agrees with her at least partially. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> "I have 13,000 (crowns) of pension, of it 5,000 are left to me for food where I should get the money for a court quarrel," he believes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Then, nevertheless, the employee becomes unsafe. </seg>
<seg id="40"> "Time see." </seg>
<seg id="41"> "Mr. Zaorálek says them about the media, they should not sign and thus the people still wait," she points out. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The adjusted rent ends in the biggest part of Czechia at New Year in 2011 and according to RPG Byty the rent rise is an economic need. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> "The existing height of the rents is not sufficient sometimes to the maintenance of the residential fund," Pavel Klime š argues, the manager of the flat sport folio of the society RPG Byty and - just the disregard criticised by the angry tenants of the flat fund is according to opinion of the house-owners the principal reason for the rent rise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> While RPG could invest four milliards in the flats during the years between 2005 and 2010 from the taken rents, during four years from 2011 to 2014 these should be 5.2 milliards. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> On the large-size LCD display in the cover compared with the upholstered chairs in the waiting room of Havířov some red shining information appears occasionally over and over again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> "The rent rises in 2011 about 15% and less concern 31 200 flats, that is more than 90% of the flats by RPG." </seg>
<seg id="47"> "Always means these at most 7.50 CZK per square metre and month," is to be read on the LCD monitor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> Only with 400 flats from the port folio of RPG the rent increases by 38 percent. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "In these cases it is about the rise of extremely low rent prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG. </seg>
<seg id="50"> With 2600 flats the rent remains next year on the same height. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> RPG Byty promises that the deregulation forces up the rents not by leaps and bounds, but gradually occurs within four and eight years. </seg>
<seg id="52"> What imposes more - the enterprise on itself an other obligation: The enterprise wants to put all income from the rent rise (see diagramme) again in the flats, above all in warm savings - in new windows and in the heat insulation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> But - with priority these should be of benefit for those people who sign the arrangements about the rent rise. </seg>

<seg id="6"> In wise foresight, because most of his 90 employees (inside) are at the baby boom age and the company is due to the fact that the Projektantinnen and architects return as fast as possible to her job. </seg>

<seg id="1"> An osseous house still fascinates after 100 years. Look the Interieure of fun </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The roof seems like the back of a prehistoric saurian, the stair like the backbone of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn open fish mouths. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio fun in Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="4"> From the local inhabitants the house by his organic forms got the nickname "osseous house." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Organic forms, wild colours, the unusual use of stone, tile splinters and Mosaiks, the facades reminding in scales and omnipresent soft lines, all this are typical signs for the Jugendstil of Antonio Gaudi. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The facade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, affectionate colours and textures which remind of nature and living being. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Only on looking more carefully one notes that everything is controlled by geometry, rhythm and thought-out order. </seg>
<seg id="8"> At night the whole facade still looks even more sculptural, more dramatic and the special Anleuchtung increasingly the shine of the colours. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The same lively lines and winding forms also control the inside of the house. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wave-like formed wood copies the window frames, railings, ornamental elements of doors, even peepholes and strips. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The house Batlló in the quarter Eixample in the animated shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 originated from the rebuilding of a house from 1877 which explained architects Emilio Sala Cortese. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reconstruction took up two years and was concluded in 1906. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The investor, the well-to-do industrial Josep Batlló, existed originally on the demolition of the old one and the construction of an absolutely new building, but at last he agreed to the idea Gaudís on an unusual and also cheaper rebuilding. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The block of flats Casa Batlló sketched Antoni Gaudí, nevertheless, not only. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Besides, he worked together with architect Josep Maria Jujol. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Just on his drawing board the decorations originated for the representative flat of the reality owner and also the use of mosaics in the facade was his idea. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Nevertheless, in the creation of the facade co-operated also numerous other Bildner and artists. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The common work on the draughts for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fertile cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Thus house Casa Milá took part Jujol also in the construction of Gaudís in the park Güell in which also other works of Antoni Gaudí are. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Already shortly after his completion the house of the local inhabitants of his organic forms agreed because of the nickname "osseous house." </seg>
<seg id="21"> Other called it again of the special aperture mechanism because of the "yawning house." </seg>
<seg id="22"> One also says, completely on top on the building is the sword of holy Georg, shown the patron of Catalonia. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But also other bildhauerische elements symbolise concealed religious motives. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Gaudí sketched a central heating system unique for the past with ventilation canals and typical chimneys for the house. </seg>
<seg id="25"> A little bit weirdly her 45-degree inclination already seems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> With his creating ignored Gaudí strictly all construction specifications at that time and can be disconcerted by no means by these. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Though before start of construction work he caught up from the town the suitable planning permission, however, the information provided by him about the planned reconstruction were so vague that the town fathers were shocked by the result two years later with the completion so that they required remedy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Among the rest, the councillors also knocked themselves against the fact that the construction with his pillars intervened even in the public sidewalk. </seg>
<seg id="29"> However, for changes it did not come any more, on the contrary - only fifteen days after the relevant request of the town quarter Josep Batlló made an application to the approval of the renting of both höchstgelegenen floors of the house - and it was promptly given to him. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The house-owner himself entered in the lower floors. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a society drawing room, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the flat. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The ground floor was leased to a jeweller. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The whole 6-storied building goes through a stair to up to the roof terrace. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> All right corners and straight lines were removed by the basic elements of the rebuilding and were substituted with crooked and curved walls. </seg>
<seg id="35"> However, Gaudí also worked with a modern draught to the mutual connection of rooms. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The social part joins by opening the drawing room doors completely and thus a bigger society could chat comfortably without having to renounce in more confidential talks a certain intimacy. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="37"> The house received by Gaudís rebuilding except a new facade also a rather unusual roof and two other floors. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Impressive it is also Gaudís play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the inner courtyard is dressed up and the patios. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The play of these both colours lends a maximum to light to all floors of the house. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> When one found out that this is a surely profitable business, one maintained the inspections, one expanded them also on other common ones and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have other wishes than men </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Not of the most great bed frames, but the quality of the couch surface - mattress and rust put out the good bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, these must be complementary harmoniously to do justice to the wishes of the concrete user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With the choice many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and not least also the gender of the Schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The interior in which mattress and rust have to submit is as important also. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a country house in which is heated not regularly latex mattresses are not well suitable, because they need much longer to become warm "." </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition, they are clearly heavy as usual polyurethane mattresses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And - they should be turned regularly. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If they do not have enough little ventilation canals in the core because and lie on top of that on a firm record, humidity accumulates: It is not excluded that forms under her mould. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> With a choice of a role also plays of course to what one is accustomed. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Who was a longer time abroad where very high mattresses with soft layer are usual, will hard be able to get used to a low mattress with hard surface. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "Probably all ice hockey players who have come back from the NHL have complained with me that they cannot properly sleep here any more." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "For her abgeschundenen shoulders, heels and hips they simply need a soft layer from Visco foam (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I recommend this, among the rest, also to diabetic people who suffer from a disturbance of the nervous system, so that they can badly receive the "information" from the joints and the skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková which specialises in upholstered furniture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Therefore, I have already procured years ago for many ice hockey players, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam). </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Today this is no more problem, because such mattresses offer among other things the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And one must not necessarily be a famous ice hockey player to come to appreciate the advantages of the Visco foam. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" quite simply functions, actually. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The foam optimalisiert his hardness and form according to the absorbed warmth, in other words, he properly nestlles up in the warm body. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It nowhere presses, at night one does not roll himself like after a heavy fight. </seg>
<seg id="22"> One simply sleeps much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In addition, the viskoelastische foam also offers protection from Dekubitus (gangrene). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> With a choice of the mattress size one should include to the body height still the length of the soles, so approx. 21 to 34 cm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Man like woman who are 180 cm to them need thus a 210 to 220 cm long bed. </seg>
<seg id="26"> At least 90-cm couch width should be available to each of the Schläfer, together 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> By single beds, for example, by singles, 120 to 140 cm are right. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Of the comfort half and also for possible visitors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise the following rule of thumb is valid for the ideal bed width: "If one lies on the back, still enough place should be for the slightly bent arms," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, the guild master craftswoman of the upholsterers and interior decorators who devotes herself quite for years to the problems of the healthy sleep and the ergonomics of pieces of furniture and reports this subject also on technical schools. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> By a double bed every one own rust and his own mattress needs, but pay attention with the purchase, so that the mattresses are also equally high. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise nothing else is left, than to mount the grates by different height and this is not possible long ago with every bed frame. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, of it should be cancelled at least three centimetres to the form layer and the fine upholsterer. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "With the hand or while putting one may feel the feathers by no means," warns Helena Prokopová. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Every mattress requires a special rust type. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Whole-upholstered beds with mattress and base like grown together Siam twins have to search in the bedroom nothing. </seg>
<seg id="36"> These mattresses cannot be ventilated and one cannot wash the relation what is quite quite usual today. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And because one loses at one single night between from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat, is clear that the mattress becomes after from five to seven years slowly gigantic (and congested sieve). </seg>
<seg id="38"> Also so the experts reject advertising slogans who promise with mattresses a life span from up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Every thing has to her If and, However. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And, therefore, a practical advice of the traders: With mattresses of 120-or 140-cm width one should not avoid the hygiene of the washable, drawable off relations, still it is advisable to use a mattress schooner which one can easily draw off and wash. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even if today as a rule mattress relations with all-round zipper are produced, so that one gets two halves (immensely importantly for the washing process and the washing machine size after opening!), the manipulation with bigger mattresses, above all only explained, often like the unequal fight seems between David and Goliath. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> Do they have in the bed instead of a rust a firm record? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Out with it! </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or at most for a bed for unbeloved guests and for one single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Also so they should provide the record rather with airing holes (provided that already none is in it) and mattresses with feather skeleton and 15-cm least with sucked. Pocket feather core and fine upholsterer use. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a base. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For not adjustable duckboards with from 14 to 18 feather strips (lamellae) latex or sandwich mattresses (if necessary also combinations of latex and coconut palm) are likely, always pay to themselves, besides, grates with a bigger slatted number, so from 28 and more feather strips, with Lordosenstütze in the lumbar vertebra area and the possibility to adjust the slatted hardness. </seg>
<seg id="48"> On adjustable lamella grates belong no mattresses with feather skeleton, because they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Beside the setting the stiff of the feather strips special adaptable shoulder modules are also offered. </seg>
<seg id="50"> On this occasion, it is about a special connection of the feather strips which enables to push in the feather strips or so very to verwinkeln that they allow selective sinking of the shoulder of the Schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="51"> In particular for men with wide shoulders an important thing. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There is even mattress manufacturer who have started using soft zones for the shoulder area with "man's mattresses." </seg>
<seg id="53"> Also to the ladies is intended - one grants to them these soft zones in the hip area. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For the most demanding customers are point-elastic wing feather systems (Lattoflex) or grates with point-elastic Kontakt-Pads with sucked. Multitorsionsfederung determines. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure is distributed to several points by which the tension decreases. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But - if one uses pillow to the right mattress and right rust bad (to big and corpulent), most advantages get lost again. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Also here a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, his points should reach only up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Hence, ideally appears a 50 x 60 cm cushion how it, for example, the Scandinavians may. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In the side situation the pillow (together with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should compensate the shoulder height. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Our modern mattresses have something have with former (with hay full) to straw bags, nevertheless, commonly. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern manufacturers use more and more often natural materials or at least their admixtures. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Also with mattresses the new magic word "biology" is called. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of oil raw materials one uses to the production of polyurethane effervescence more and more often naturelle oils - for example, castor oil and soy-bean oil. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> "Biology is called with mattresses which passes her core of materials of purely natural origin," Petr Va š íček from the company Tropico explains plus. </seg>
<seg id="66"> However, physical materials are also used in the production by mattress relations - besides, one of the first ones was an aloe Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> However, one can also allow himself microcapsules which spread while sleeping fresh forest smell or lavender smell. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Also here one makes a difference between man and woman. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While with the men a "cooling" plant essence from birch sheets is used, so that the mattress relation can absorb the warmth and cool the body, the relations for women have "warming" effect. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Essences from red peppers stimulate the blood circulation, to the weaker gender becomes while sleeping pleasantly warm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> Und sterben heutigen Favoriten? </seg>
<seg id="72"> Mattresses from cold foam (he has bigger pores with destroyed cell structure and, hence, is more cellular than customary polyurethane and also is much more adaptable). </seg>
<seg id="73"> From the combination the different stiff (hardness) of cold effervescence and Visco effervescence originate more zonal mattresses which exactly know where head, hip and heels are. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> However, for a high-quality mattress one has to fork out 7000 crowns and more. </seg>
<seg id="75"> However, health mattresses are normally loaded with lower value added tax, because they are valid than medical aid. </seg>
<seg id="76"> As the first Czech enterprise this advantage was given Gumotex. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> One sees to save in the mattress and in the rust is not so light. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Every now and then there are special offers of manufacturers and traders who offer two mattresses at a price of one. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Thus the brand Magniflex offers the mattress Duofreeze with Visco foam verstepptem in the relation Memory for 11,990 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="80"> One gets the second one free in addition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the material Tempur which initiated the era of the viskoelastischen foamed plastics with open cell structure and high density in nearly cosmic tempo. </seg>
<seg id="82"> No miracle, nevertheless, they were developed for the NASA, because the astronauts are put out by the starts to huge overloadings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83"> Tempur becomes soft with warmth, in chill environment it hardens again. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Thus it adapts itself to the human body perfectly and distributes in optimum manner the body pressure. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Hence, it is not only ideally for the prevention of pressure fire, but raises in general the sleeping comfort. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86"> Viskoelastische foamed plastics become not only with mattresses, but also uses with other health products, as for example with special foot upholsterers who should get the legs and the vessels of relief. </seg>
<seg id="87"> For example, the foamed plastics Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products use local manufacturer. </seg>

<seg id="1"> More and more parents want person-supervision devices to have the kids under control </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The fear around own children grows and thus more and more parents consider supervising them by GPS. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The system which was invented originally to the search after cars can locate because as well people what would be also helpful in such cases, how recently with the disappearance without a trace of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The device is possibly as big currently as, however, a cigarette box might not be bigger soon it, than a wristwatch. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The case of the disappeared Anička has moved many people into fear and terror and thus they keep after means and ways a lookout to protect her children better. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Also for the price of an interference of her private sphere. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "We try to say all that it is on no account a matter, on this occasion, about Herumspionieren, but to reduce effective means, the likelyhood that it comes to the tragedy," Petr Pilin of the society of Macro Because states, one of the suppliers of GPS-detection devices at the Czech market. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> "I admit that it can come in particular cases to the abuse of such devices, for example if one puts it to somebody in the pocket, without he knows about it, but we had to register up to now no such case." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "Most customers really buy it for safety reasons to themselves," Pilin adds. </seg>
<seg id="10"> However, according to his opinion the child should always know which purpose the "box" serves and how one uses them if necessary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Nevertheless, the child psychologist Dana Bočková points out to the fact that a child if it may not carry such a thing it simply rids himself his. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "Also very small children show big creativity if it is a matter of losing intentionally certain things if they do not want to be controlled." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "In the beginning already the mobile phones woke up big expectations in the parents, but they can be switched off as easily, like these new supervision devices," means Mrs. Bočková. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> In her opinion it is also argumentative whether such an equipment helps in case of an attack really. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "By planned kidnapping the kidnapper controls practically always whether the child has some electronics with himself with which it could be located." </seg>
<seg id="16"> "Today it is the mobile phone." </seg>
<seg id="17"> "If such supervision devices found broader use, they would also search this, because her sales would be certainly accompanied by massive advertisement." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "In these cases the criminals of the police are always a 1 step ahead," believes the psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Nevertheless, she puts away that similar devices can be absolutely helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Roberta Čech of the society RC according to monitoring, the detection services for cars, as well as for people offers, the existence of such a device can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> "The device is regulated because in such a way that it announces the respective position in certain intervals." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "Even if it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the affected person is available." </seg>
<seg id="23"> "By more expensive devices even an inclination knife is integrated, that is if one falls down and remains lying without moving, the device sends immediately a warning under information of the position," states Mr. Čech. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> According to his opinion similar services could also do intelligent mobile phones with navigation, one needs to play in only one special software. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The problem of the present detection devices consists in the fact that it is, on this occasion, either about devices in match box size which resemble followers or around smaller mobile phones. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Always so the danger insists that one loses them. </seg>
<seg id="27"> One tests Mr. Pilin of the Macro Because according to, hence, in the present the devices which look like normal digital watches. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> "This has the advantage that the possible attacker must not recognise at all that it concerns a supervision or detection device. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "Or he notices only after certain time what gives a time projection to the police," he adds. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The army has so many fuses that one could completely wrap Czechia you, however, only two years hold </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Czech army has bought 445 kilometres of fuses, with blasting compositions are lighted. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the year the ministry of defence had delivered before already 224 kilometres of fuse to the army camps. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is to be known quite reassuringly that the armed forces have for 225 years ausgesorgt. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The problem is only the durability of the fuses - two, at most, however, four years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The army bought the fuses from the corporation STV Group, a. see. for silly 40 million crowns. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In his grounds for the purchase of this immense amount of fuse answered the general staff MF DNES, the soldiers would use yearly to 60 kilometres of fuse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> To the searches of Armeepyrotechnikern according to, the MF DNES responded to it, it arises from this information that the whole army would have to finish annually an extremely intensive pyrotechnische education - all generals and officers of the army command, up to the secretaries and cleaning ladies. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Defence minister Alexandr Vondra and army general Vlastimil Picek not excluded. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Only so the substantial annual consumption of sixty kilometres of fuses can be justified more or less. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This length corresponds, by the way, 25,000 detonations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> But also so these army supplies would reach for more than ten years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> If, however, still the old rule from experts is valid that to the training of every new regular soldier two metres of fuse are completely sufficient, then the army by this new shopping - also under the point of view of the risen need of the pioneer's unities and special unities - has created a reassuring stock for already mentioned 225 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Besides, soldiers of the quick application brigade recently complained with the defence minister Vondra, they would have almost no cartridges for hand-held weapons more, so that shooting exercises of the missing means are limited because of strongly. </seg>
<seg id="15"> To be quiet completely from the underpants lack. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "To me also does not come, why they buy such vast amounts fuses from us." </seg>
<seg id="17"> But at last this is her decision, they will already know to what they need them." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "For us the army is a good customer whom we would like to meet as a trader as much as possible," says the distribution manager Jan STV Group Děck ý. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Jan Pej š ek, the speaker of the ministry of defence founds the purchase hundred kilometre of fuse with it, the army would have stocked up so at least for ten years with this "ammunition." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Nevertheless, Jan Děck ý from the STV Group speaks only of a four-year-old use duration of the fuses and police and Armeepyrotechniker even only from two years. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "With perfect storage are fine also four mentioned years possibly," one of them puts away who wants to remain, however, uncalled not to be accused as a soldier of the criticism of the army. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> At the end of the use duration any ammunition must be tested thoroughly whether it is still reliable and not the life of the soldiers threatened. </seg>
<seg id="23"> However, these tests are not free of charge, but cost other money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Another argument of the ministry of defence is the amount discount for 445 kilometres of fuse. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "You cost sixty percent less to us than the last year's delivery of 244 kilometres," informs us speaker Pej š ek the position of the buyers of the ministry of defence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Only for comparison: The annual consumption of fuses of Pyrotechnikern of the police which liquidate ammunition from the second world war or the Soviet brother's army exceeds already during some years hardly 1,500 metres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> And the police orders always only such amounts of this ammunition which it can still use before the use duration. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Already of the security of the Pyrotechniker because of, moreover, one keeps open to himself thus the possibility for adaptable purchases more modern and therefore also of reliable fuses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The ministry of defence has already gigantic problems by the liquidation 10 thousand mark note tonnes of ammunition from times of the Warsaw contract when zweihunderttausendköpfige Tschechoslowakische national army prepared for her campaign to the Rhine. </seg>
<seg id="30"> According to the Pyrotechnikern, the MF DNES responded, the same problem expects the Czech armed forces in a few years by the liquidation hundred kilometre of old fuses which she has bought today so "favourably." </seg>

<seg id="4"> Karel Ž ďársk ý, the owner of the company of Farmet accepted the price of the first rank of the competition Vodafone company of the year in the past year. </seg>
<seg id="5"> At that time the jury appreciated the strains with which he rammed from the small tool construction in Česká Skalice an enterprise from the ground which makes hundreds of millions turnovers. </seg>
<seg id="6"> "I can say that this acknowledgment has encouraged not only myself, but also all my employees and has encouraged our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," says the last year's winner. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At the beginning of the company history of Farmet stood the effort to do something useful. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And when then the state offered to his father Karel Ž ďársk ý as a compensation for the property confiscated by the communists a small workshop to the lease, he did not hesitate long, scrapped his career in the company in which he was occupied till then, and founded with a few companions of his father own company to the production of plastic tubs. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Short time later they started to concentrate upon vegetable oil pressing. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Within 18 years they have climbed up to the biggest manufacturer automatic pressing in completely Central Europe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But only by the success in the mentioned competition and his Medialisierung she has also entered into the consciousness of the not professional public. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "Not only that our customers perceive the brand Farmet now clearly intensive, also our foreign partners began to the fact to be able to work together with a company which has gained the greatest possible success in her country to attach bigger value," says Karel Ž ďársk ý. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The last year stood with Farmet, however, not only in the sign of the victory euphoria. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The acknowledgment went out from the economic results of the enterprise in 2008 and a part of 2009. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And just in 2009 the most difficult year was for the sales of tool building products. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The crisis which shook at that time still less the citizens, but before all enterprise reached just her climax - many companies were made put her investment projects and limit the purchase of new facilities and technologies. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "We could also not escape this situation of course." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "The turnovers decreased about 40 percent, we had to limit the production and reach even for dismissals," explains Karel Ž ďársk ý </seg>
<seg id="19"> A capable of surviving enterprise must take every now and then also such unpopular measures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> However, one succeeded in gaining control of the situation and in holding the company in the black figures, even if with lower profits, than before the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="21"> With one the enterprise was not determined to make deductions - with the investments in the research and development. </seg>
<seg id="22"> "From the subsidy we built a research and training centre, we encouraged our presentation on international fairs and acquired first prizes from home exhibitions," says Ž ďársk ý. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Everything testifies of the fact that we have overcome the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The turnovers grow again and with them also the number of new employee. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "I wish the new winner a lot of joy in the victory - but in quieter atmosphere," Karel Ž ďársk ý allows to aim. </seg>

<seg id="1"> An opinion poll which clears up with senseless regulations </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The opinion poll around the "absurdity of the year" is for the fourth time a part of the enterpriser's competition. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Some senseless regulations one already succeeded in creating from the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> To the dubious winner of the next year of the opinion poll "absurdity of the year" rose the duty to create documents on authorities, the on-line are available. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Thus decided more than one third of not completely 4000 vocal-delivering enterprisers. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Thus the social security management required a paper extract from the commercial register, even if him the official could have called away by two mouse clicks. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Now thanks to the opinion poll this changes. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "The Czech social security management will require in future with controls of social security payers no extracts from the commercial register more," the speaker of ÈSSZ Jana Buraňová stated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Sense and the purpose of the opinion poll "absurdity of the year" is to take all regulations and orders under the magnifying glass which enterprisers have to fulfil in Czechia and the senseless ones to lift. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is this year already for the fourth time a part of an enterpriser's competition, from tsch. Economic newspaper (HN) is organised and to itself in public of growing popularity pleased. </seg>
<seg id="11"> If took part last year in 3000 people in the vote, these were this year already 4000. </seg>
<seg id="12"> There is no miracle, because still an amount of legal duties which serve solely to hinder the enterprise activity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "What concerns, for example, the number of the income tax forms, we take a front rank in the world," notes Karel Havlíček of the union of small and medium constant enterprises and businessmen of Czech Republic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The simplification of the enterprise activity is the proclaimed aim of all governments during the last years. </seg>
<seg id="15"> However, in comparison to the world the situation has hardly made amends in Czechia. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In accordance with the world bank Czechia takes the 74th rank, in comparison to the year before an order worse about eight places concerning the enterprise terms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The competition absurdity of the year was exclaimed for the first time in the year and happens every year after the same scenario. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Each can announce from April up to the time of going to press of the competition at the end of September administrative and bureaucratic nonsense. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The web address www.firmaroku.cz serves for the registration. Then the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-price" and puts to the vote the public the Internet on the web pages www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There wins that absurdity which gets most voices. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> To this year's opinion poll 105 pointless regulations and orders were announced already more than hundred, more exactly said. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The tips come not only from enterprisers, but also from professional organisations and journalists. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are so, for example, also regulations that maintenance vehicles have to pay toll for highways and motorways or that enterprisers with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must prepare all two years. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The list of this year's "seven" is published on the sides of the competition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The proclamation of the competition in each case at the beginning of November on the Prague place Wenzels is a part of a happening in which regularly also personalities of the political and public life take part. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This year were, for example, Eva Svobodová, the manager of the association of small or medium constant enterprises and businessmen of the Tsch. Republic as well as Petr Ku ž el, the president of the chamber of commerce of the Tsch. Republic with the climax of the competition with from the part. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "Where the state throws to the enterprisers bat between the legs, there can be no real economic impetus, therefore, it is my aim to lift at least thirty sections every year which still complicate needlessly her enterprises today to the enterprisers," informed Martin Kocourek, the minister for industry and trade. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The efforts to create senseless orders from the world show effect. </seg>
<seg id="29"> In 2007 disturbed the people mostly the enterprisers imposed duty to have to announce the intention to the trade office at the place of her constant company site three days in advance, to want to go with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or fair. </seg>
<seg id="30"> This duty was lifted by virtue of a novella of the trade law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The duty which received in 2007 the second largest number of the voices - to have to announce the duty, to the labour office to official journeys of employees in the extent up to 30 days - became by the law about them "green map" abolished sucked. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> And - all good things three are: </seg>
<seg id="33"> The absurdity of 2009 was chosen the order which imposed it on physiotherapists, in the speech room a mirror, a fridge and two personal scales are to have. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This order was somewhat reduced by the health ministry this year - the fridge duty was lost. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Pilsner ground fund - arrests of the police with a public advertising </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen the anti-corruption police during the last days carried out arrests. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Besides, the local media enterpriser and estate agent Lubo š G. was led away from the detectives in handcuffs. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This had tried supposedly to manipulate a just taking place public competition for the winding up of restitution claims in such a way that the properties offered in the competition closed to a concrete prospective customer. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This should have paid Lubo š G. for it half a million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "At that time I can only confirm that the police pursues a person because of the offence of deceitful machination with a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the boss of the Pilsner public prosecutor's office of the newspaper "Právo," other details cannot grant them in view of the running investigations. </seg>
<seg id="7"> 24 hours later the 46-year-old enterpriser was dismissed by the police again. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In which manner he could manipulate the public competition, one can only speculate on it in view of the scanty official information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The speaker of the ground fund Lubomír Černá stated on the relevant question of Právo, the police has carried out in the Pilsner branch of the ground fund really arrests and this during a public competition. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "It was about a client and by no means about one of our employees," she concretised. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The public competition had Mrs. Černá according to the correct name "Request on the offer delivery of claims for the transportation of properties according to the ground law" and would take place in cases in which several applicants show interest in the offered property. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "These people offer a higher value of her restitution claims to be paid by the transference, than the exclaimed plot value within the scope of the request." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Accordingly of the offered claims the order of the potential acquirers is fixed, afterwards the ground fund transfers the property on the person with the highest offer," explains the speaker of the fund. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Lubo š G. were available obviously information who had announced himself upon the request and because he himself was an entitled person, because he had bought a row from restitution claims to himself, he offered to a property interest that he withdraws from the competition. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Obviously against a fat compensation. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This would also be an enough explanation of it, which is why he had such a big amount of money with himself in his arrest. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Lubo š G. already had in the past much too good contacts with the Pilsner ground fund. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Thus he also played in the Causa of the former boss of the ground fund Václav Sankota a role who was pursued criminal because he published in spare restitutions properties to which already location decisions had been liked to building project. </seg>
<seg id="19"> At that time Lubo š G. of the ground fund acquired, for example, also properties which were determined for the construction of public streets, more exactly said, here where the construction of the Zufahrtsmagistrale was planned to the industrial area Borské pole. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Later he exchanged this very favourably with the City Council for a house directly in the historical centre of the town which exceeded the value of the properties far. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The city hall had to do of then heavy heart Kleinbeigeben not to endanger the building project by the blocking of the properties. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The households must count from January not only on higher costs for all energy kinds, but also with higher water fees and sewage fees and for district heating and in some places also there grow the rents. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Families will have to pull thus from January several hundred crowns monthly more from the purse than up to now. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Stream becomes to at cost of 4.6 percent, one will have to pay gas about 2 percent and more, in some towns up to a tenth more for water deliveries and in some places the district heating deliveries also raise the price of. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Only the stream price increase costs the flat households yearly to some hundred crowns more. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Besides, the strong stream prices were lowered by all main suppliers, the clear support of the stream production from renewable springs, in particular from Fotovoltaikanlagen is responsible. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Though gas will have only moderately more expensive, this, however, exactly when the people must heat mostly and the highest consumption. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Also here is to be calculated on some hundred crowns more per year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> While stream and gas become more expensive in completely Czechia, the prices of district heating of town to town have passed away. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Above all of bigger places to level price increases. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Thus, for example, the households must pay in Pardubice and Hradec Králové from January for district heating monthly up to 50 crowns more, more than 1000 crowns more per year pay families in Liberec. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> 9 percent higher water fees and sewage fees and this threaten the inhabitants of Prague again for the case that the town raises the infrastructure rent. </seg>
<seg id="13"> If the rent does not change, there are only 6.8 percent. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The price in Prague belongs in comparison to completely Czechia, nevertheless, also furthermore to the lowest ones. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In the north Bohemian where the prices belong by now to the highest ones water fees and sewage fees should rise by 7.4 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Huge rent price increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 flats, with which from January the so-called. Rent regulation is lost. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Thus plans, for example, the flat enterprise CPI Byty which owns 2500 flats in Ú stí nad Labem to raise the rents from January immediately by hundred percent. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Who does not agree with this rent rise, those wants to prosecute the enterprise judicially. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The adjusted rents which one pays even today in roughly 300,000 flats might rise the next year about more than 10 percent. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Fernet, rum and vodka, exceptionally also sometimes a good whisky which one has stolen from the father from Liveable. </seg>
<seg id="3"> These are the drinks after whose pleasure drunk Czech teenagers must become most often emergency-treated under fifteen. </seg>
<seg id="4"> No exception are the children who must sleep off her cat repeatedly in the hospital. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> This arises from the experiences of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of the child departments of medical centres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "Beer or wine are complete out of fashion because it simply lasts too long, until one is got drunk." </seg>
<seg id="7"> "The today's trend is unambiguously hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the head of department of the child department in the mittelböhmischen clinic of Hořovice. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "Whisky if one succeeds in stealing a bottle from to the father Liveable and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka. </seg>
<seg id="9"> "Vodka has the advantage that one can mix him with Juice, then he does not smell so strongly," explains the head of department. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The speaker faculty hospital of Motol Eva Jurinová agrees with him. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Most often it is about Fernet or rum." </seg>
<seg id="12"> "This is the today's alcohol trend, in particular in elementary schools." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Sporadically it was also about Slibowitz which one takes from home," Mrs. Jurinová stated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> According to head of department Pelikán 13-year-old or 14-13-year-old alcoholics are no special appearance in the hospital admission long ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Before the clinic in Hořovice on which he works since this year he was active during ten years in the Pädiatrie department of the hospital of Motol where the rescue cars delivered drunk pupils from Near and Far. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "A girl had to be hospitalised four times." </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Your career began them with 12 years when it was delivered the first time with 3.5 thousandths alcohol in the blood and on top of that to combination with "Extase"," the doctor described an especially heavy case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "She was in the exhibition area in getting š ovice on any dance party." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "The interesting was present that it seemed to her mother not at all strangely that her daughter came 48 hours not home," the head of department is surprised. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Just the missing interest of the parents or their unbelievable tolerance while pushing with own sprigs is valid as one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism of children. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is not about a real dependence in the true sense of the word according to expert with children. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "A long-standing chronic dependence on the alcohol is to be understood by alcoholism with all phenomenon hanging together with it and this is with these children not the case." </seg>
<seg id="23"> With those which enjoy repeatedly alcohol a negative informal-social background is typical mostly," explains head of department Pelikán. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Of the speaker of the hospital of Motol, according to Mrs. Jurinová, were sent till the middle of November to approximately forty drunk children in the local department for paediatrics and youth medicine. </seg>
<seg id="25"> However, only the cases with heavy alcohol poisoning which required a hospitalisation come into the statistics. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The drunk children who are brought after ambulant treatment by the parents or if necessary by the police home are not registered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Except the cases in which children just such a bottle of schnapps in the school desk drink up there are according to opinion of Mr. Pelikán three seasonal amplitudes on which by hundred percent reliance is: Whale pure G sharp night, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> "Last-named for two reasons - either from grief because of the bad report or from joy on the holidays." </seg>
<seg id="29"> "At the whale pure G sharp night I have already experienced seven drunk children all at once in the admission," stresses doctor Pelikán. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off, as a child who has to fight the next day only with a disagreeable cat. </seg>
<seg id="31"> One can expel the headaches in the morning afterwards which are due to the Dehydration and to the glucose lack, in the hospital because with a liquid-making a donation drip with glucose and nutrients which the organism lacks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> "You are unequivocal better off, because after the "marvellous" experience in the evening, they wake with good mood, without somewhere something hurts." </seg>
<seg id="33"> "You are only a little bit confused about where they are," doctor Pelikán puts away and he spoils every now and then at least thereby the good mood for the patients, while he enumerates them the costs which it will cost the treatment. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Since the transport by the rescue car and the night in an acute accent bed come well and with pleasure on a few 1000 crowns. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Every now and then I have used as an aid to education if I have reckoned up directly for the children with the round what has cost her drunkenness and that it can absolutely happen that they must work sometimes the whole holidays to earn the money for one single such party," doctor Pelikán added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Nevertheless, according to his opinion the health insurance schemes do not reach for recourse procedure around which to the healing of the drunken children to necessary costs call in the parents. </seg>

<seg id="15"> "Hence, it is a thing of the buyer in which manner he realises the thing," Pej š ek stated. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The economic newspaper (HN) had reported before that the Spanish government has no interest to L-159. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The barter of five L-159 against a transport plane Casa and the purchase of other airplanes for 3.5 milliard crowns had been approved last year still by the government of Mirek Topolánek. </seg>
<seg id="18"> At that time the ministry of defence had written out no advertising procedure to the purchase, but appealed to EADS directly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The defensive velvet at that time argued, this exchange will support the future export L-159 abroad. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines from which she uses only 24, she wanted to dispose of the rest. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The purchase of the airplanes Casa might have, by the way, still a judicial sequel. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The European commission sued the Czech ministry of defence because in the European Court of Justice. The reason? It would have had to select the airplanes on account of a whole-European advertising and by no means by appealing one single manufacturer. </seg>

<seg id="23"> The army has already taken over three airplanes Casa, the last should land within fourteen days on the airport Kbely. </seg>

<seg id="1"> A longer forefinger than ring finger means a lower risk to fall ill with cancer </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The men whose forefinger is long as the ring finger, are put out obviously to a lower risk to fall ill with cancer of the prostate. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This is the astonishing result of a study which was published on Wednesday by the British journal of Cancer. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This should hang up together because with the mirror of the male hormone testosterone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as an easy test for the risk of cancer of the prostate and this in particular with men to sixty," explained the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor in the cancer research institute at the university in Warwick. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The finger could help so to determine which men should absolutely undergo a cancer of the prostate test, above all if genetic risks or other risk factors exist, as for example informal health charges, added of Mrs. Eele. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In the period of 1994-2009 she pursued with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with cancer of the prostate, at the same time, however, also 3000 healthy men. </seg>
<seg id="8"> With more than half of the participants of the study the forefinger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The same likelyhood of cancer of the prostate was valid for these men, like for 19 percent of those men which ring and forefinger were equally long. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Nevertheless, with men whose forefinger was longer than the ring finger this risk sank by 33 percent, with men to sixty even about 87 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The relation of the length of the both mentioned finger which already form at the pränatalen age reflects obviously the different mirrors of gender hormones to which the child was put out in the womb. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Less testosterone corresponds to a longer forefinger. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Former researches proved that just the testosterone accelerates the growth of cancer of the prostate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticist and former chairperson of the academy of the sciences, said ČTK, to him this study would be known briefly, still he does not hold the relation between the finger length and the cancer risk up to now for "complete proved." </seg>

<seg id="4"> The Japanese group of Fujitsu shifts his establishment in bath Homburg to Frankfurt. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As on computer and her servicing specified branch giant informed on Wednesday, 400 women and men will move in July of the next year her job of the present office building in the Marien's barber-surgeon place in bath Homburg in the Astro park, this is a big office complex in the Lyoner street in the Frankfurt part of town low wheel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> A speaker of Fujitsu explained, in the medium term even other 100 jobs of the group which are distributed up to now to the region should be accommodated there. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The rent offer has been extremely attractive, besides, the high-capacity offices would meet in the Astro park of the approach of the employees better. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Also in bath Homburg Fujitsu had been merely a tenant. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Responsible manager Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt-low wheel we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure." </seg>
<seg id="10"> The excellent binding to the airport is just for a global enterprise like Fujitsu of great importance. </seg>
</p>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Wikileaks gets increasingly in distress. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The Internet service provider Amazon has exiled the exposure platform of his servers. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Political pressure after the publication possibly puts behind it 100 thousand mark note of confidential diplomat's telegrammes. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Wikileaks founder Assange stays supposedly in England. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The exposure platform Wikileaks comes under fire in the United States stronger and stronger. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Internet activists lost the access to her present American server and now search an Internet native country in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The prominent American senator Joe Lieberman called meanwhile other countries and enterprises for the boycott of Wikileaks. </seg>
<seg id="9"> And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange who stands on the search lists of Interpol should stay according to a newspaper report in Great Britain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> "Wikileaks of Amazon server edges out." </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Free speech in the country of the open air," informed the exposure activists by news in brief service Twitter on Wednesday (local time). </seg>
<seg id="12"> Shortly before the Internet enterprise of Amazon had exiled the Wikileaks documents of his servers. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The Internet activists had fallen back by the publication of the confidential diplomatic telegrammes on the Amazon web service (AWS) to be able to master the high access figures on the documents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> By Twitter Wikileaks explained to the step further: "Excellently - now our dollars are given to occupy people in Europe." </seg>
<seg id="15"> If Amazon has such problem with the freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Amazon has stopped the use of his servers by Wikileaks, after employees of senator Joe Lieberman would have made inquiries, reported the television broadcasting station CNN with reference to the office of Liebermans. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The chairperson of the senate committee for home protection had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "I would have wished that Amazon this measure earlier seizes in view of the previous publications of classed information by Wikileaks," said the senator. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Lieberman appealed meanwhile for keeping the use to servers the platform also in other countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "Wikileaks' unlawful, prodigious and thoughtless action risks our national security and endangers life all around the globe," were called it in a communication of the independent senator. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "No responsible enterprise - whether in American manner or foreign - Wikileaks should help in his efforts to spread stolen material." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The Wikileaks founder Assange who is searched because of rape suspicion by the authorities in Sweden stands on the search list of Interpol. </seg>
<seg id="23"> According to a report of the London newspaper "The Independent" the 39-year-old Australian stays in Great Britain, the exact place would be known Scotland yard. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The Internet activist has called the inquiries in Sweden always intrigue of his opponents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Wikileaks speaker Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London, there have been threats. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "There were even calls after a murder of Julian Assange." </seg>
<seg id="27"> Therefore, Assange fears rightly around his security, said Hrafnsson. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Therefore, the Wikileaks founder will keep himself further hidden. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Hrafnsson reacted obviously to statements from North America. </seg>
<seg id="30"> In America the former republican governor had demanded of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, that the person responsible should be accused for the Wikileaks exposures of betrayal and be executed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In Canada said an adviser of head of government Stephen Harper - obviously ironically - on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could use "a drone." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Between the White House and Assange an exchange broke out meanwhile. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The speaker of the American president Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, it called "ridiculously and absurdly" that Assange had demanded the resignation of foreign minister Hillary Clinton, if she is responsible for recently known spy requests to diplomat. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "I am not quite sure, why we look after the opinion of a type with a web page," according to Gibbs. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Our foreign affairs and the interests of this country are far significant as his one web page." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Now the American government puts the protection of her data banks extensively on the test bench. </seg>
<seg id="37"> As a special representative the vice manager of the centre for anti-terror measures, Russell Travers, has been appointed, the White House informed. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Travers is responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" which have become necessary after the disclosure of the message reports by Wikileaks. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The White House also wants to check up the ways as the whole government exchanges information and protects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Besides, the American government announced to want to provide for the security of dissidents and most active, they should get by the Wikileaks publication in danger. </seg>
<seg id="41"> "We have undertaken everything to step with them in contact," said Ministry of Foreign Affaires speaker Philip Crowley. </seg>
<seg id="42"> "We are ready to protect them if this should become necessary." </seg>

<seg id="2"> In "Gelato University" near Bologna ice confectioners are prepared for better seasons. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The 3-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the biggest inflow and visitor from the whole world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Where from does the whole ice come, actually? </seg>
<seg id="5"> From the Gelatiere and from the Gelataio. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The Gelatiere, on the a little bit ancient ice confectioner in German, produces the cream according to all rules of the Italian ice doer art. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Gelataio gets the ice cream from the chill bar with a spatula, strokes them in the waffle and then sells them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> To know this, one must not go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province Bologna. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But who would like to know even more about ice, that does not go past to the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The manufacturer of ice makers has furnished the egg university in 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines does justice everywhere to the high Italian ideals. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The 3-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the biggest inflow and visitor from all over the world. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, there are also special courses of several days all around the chocolate ice cream and training periods in the in-house ice-cream parlour. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Some dreams in the Midlife-Crisis of a new career, others simply venture sometimes on the smooth ice of her vague longings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> These are this spot 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil via Hungary to Saudi Arabia. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow Food movement and wants to offer in the country of the industrial Ice-Cream in future a European high-class product. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and wants to bag after years in a nerve-wracking job something own. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice-cream parlour in Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in her bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream to the participants first. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is vital not only good taste, but also the silky litheness and the good consistency. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Luciano forgets with his training, however, also not the cream bonnet of the national and generally südländischen superstructure: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then a lot of romanticism is still present." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first step to the production seems quite easy. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Luciano tilts the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a big blender which heats up with an electronic programme everything on 85 degrees and cools then immediately on four degrees. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Then he turns up in the machine a cock, and out there comes a pasteurised white base cream, basis for all milk ice kinds. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Immediately the lecturer with questions is stormed: Can one produce ice cream only with natural materials without stabilizer? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How does one leave to own experimental desire free run? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Luciano warns against letting mislead from the spirit of the times. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Who talks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients," has used possibly, nevertheless, stabilizers - mostly a natural product, possibly Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Of course one can produce ice also without stabilizer, then only it must be sold within one day, but it slumps in itself, and the customer bites on nothing but ice granule. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Certain variations in the basic mass are permitted. </seg>
<seg id="31"> More full of suspense it becomes with the aromas. </seg>
<seg id="32"> For the taste in the ice maestro Luciano makes a distinction between the ingredients which one buys in the fruit department or with the sweets of the supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Besides, there is gives powder and pastes. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "The suppliers will try everybody to turn on dozens flavoured additions to you." </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Nevertheless, you should simply experiment sometimes." </seg>
<seg id="36"> Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Or just with the ice cream from the white basic mass which becomes with eggs the yellow cream and with cocoa powder to the basis for all possible chocolate seduction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Now the course participants are allowed to the ice makers. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano lets them in each case produce four different kinds of vanilla egg, chocolate egg, mocha egg and hazelnut egg - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with vanilla aroma more or less or other natural additions. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The water ice kinds are also submitted to the same experiment. </seg>
<seg id="41"> More flavouring materials, more fruit puree - are not necessarily better in taste this. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of hazelnut egg tastes not necessarily nussiger if it contains more hazelnuts. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The most popular kiwi egg produces the working group which uses more fruits, less waters and a little less stabilizer. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Only a well-balanced mixture emphasises the taste of a Gelato properly, says Luciano. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Ice production is an arithmetic job: If peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar portion must be reduced in the basic prescription. </seg>
<seg id="46"> An extra serving sugar is necessary for lemon ice. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano pulls a device out with which he determines the sugar salary of the fruit kinds (winegrowers measure with it the Oechsle in the grape must). </seg>
<seg id="48"> Luckily tables make easier the Rechnerei. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> To make ice does not require any more so much physical application as earlier. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Not only the device for the automatic production of the basic mass helps. </seg>
<seg id="51"> There is also a device in which the ready egg mixture is hit at the same time creamy and is cooled on deficit temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Of all automation in spite of small breakdowns are not missing. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The Brazilian Gustavo bespatters himself and his course colleagues from the top to the bottom with fruit puree when the colossal stick barman gets to him out of control. </seg>
<seg id="54"> "In every course," believes maestro Luciano, "it is only one matter of time, to such a thing it happens." </seg>

<seg id="5"> The leader of the Efsa-expert's group for genetic-technically changed plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert are for many years also in the lobbyist's association of Ilsi under contract. </seg>
<seg id="6"> He is paid by groups like Monsanto, Fastening or Bavarian. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Kuiper has decisively co-operated in the Efsa-test regulations for genetic plants and stands with it in a clear conflict of interests, criticises Then. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The Efsa regulations are sales-wise word by word with position papers of the Ilsi and deceive with it the manuscript of the industry which should be controlled, actually, by the authority in the Italian Parma. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It is already the second spot that Testbiotech criticises an interest collision. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Thus a high-ranking Efsa manager is recently without editions or transition period to the Swiss agrarian group of Syngenta - and has changed with it the sides. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also the Medium German broadcasting company (MDR) had recently revealed personnel connections between controlling EU authority and industrial lobby what has made the federal environment office just as EU parliamentarian light dependent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Efsa can recognise meanwhile no conflict of interests. </seg>
<seg id="13"> One falls back on all serious data, also on such of the industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, one says in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="14"> From the experts who work for Efsa one does not require that they have no contacts with the industry. </seg>
<seg id="15"> However, they would have to disclose this. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Kuiper puts away his work for the Internationally Life Sciences institutes of (Ilsi) in the USA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This calls himself neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among the rest, to the risk evaluation for biotechnology without lobby order. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In the thing independent experts criticise like Then that genetic-technically changed plants are admitted currently without every feeding attempt with animals and the reaction by genetic plants is not tested for environmental factors. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We want to know what, for example, genetic-technically changed maize on the field makes," says Then. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Present practise is to test merely isolated proteins, but not the whole genetic plant what delivers no dependable results. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "If one does not search the risks, how should one find them then?," asks Then reproachfully. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> This also sees Angelika Hilbeck in such a way. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The scientist does research since 1994 in the genetic engineering and is active currently in the Technical college of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The industry tries in this area like in the USA now also in Europe more and more to influence critical scientists or to discredit. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Therefore, there is hardly researcher who are not interwined with groups. </seg>
<seg id="26"> For enterprise critical studies would not be published as a rule. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "The industry controls the security research," states Hilbeck. </seg>

<seg id="6"> The history is known: In September the excavators had approached and had begun to break off a big piece of the north wing. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Stuttgart world was not any more the same: Zigtausende demonstrated against S21, the deep lapping heavy to milliard of the railway station. </seg>
<seg id="8"> When it came to the building freeze, a large part of the wing lay in remains. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Crailsheimer mussel lime, a soft coarse stone, between 1914 and 1920 obstructs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Gsell is 43 years old sculptor in Ostfildern. </seg>

<seg id="16"> When he aufsägte, has smelt of cigarette smoke. </seg>
<seg id="17"> What he will make with the lumps, he does not know yet. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Stones have time. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Uli Gsell also. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The track of the Stuttgart stones leads in a wood near Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army where Manuel Rongen has established his stone empire. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The 44-year-old acts with old stones. </seg>
<seg id="22"> He has bought everybody which resulted with the demolition in Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "It would be a disgrace, they would disappear to grit ground or in the dump," he says in his office, a little wooden booth which was once an awake small house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Has insulted and has threatened one him, he tells when stood in September in the newspapers that he has bought the rests of the north wing from the demolition enterpriser. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But he has talked with the S-21 opponents, for days. </seg>
<seg id="26"> And he has explained to them that he is able to do, nevertheless, now nothing at all for the demolition. </seg>
<seg id="27"> And if it anyway happens, nevertheless, it is the most reasonable if the stones became further used. </seg>
<seg id="28"> As a result about 200 S-21 opponents took to themselves one of the on an average 80-kilo-ashlars, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros. </seg>
<seg id="29"> As memory, some, however, also in hope to be able to return him by a reconstruction. </seg>

<seg id="47"> "My favorite stone." </seg>
<seg id="48"> It goes the way high by the wood. </seg>

<seg id="50"> And further. </seg>
<seg id="51"> "Of nice Travertin." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Talentekampf um Hohe Potenziale </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It rules of active Andrang in the refreshment bar. </seg>
<seg id="3"> 16 students crowd around salmon bread roll, tomato soup and sweet. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The mechanical engineering and design students have invited the University of Technology of Brunswick and the automaker Volkswagen to a Workshop. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In a sort of idea competition they should get to know together with VW developers over the car of the future fachsimpeln - and completely, besides, Volkswagen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In the competition around the cleverest heads many enterprises go meanwhile to the close fight and place, like VW, on cooperations with the universities. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Their mission: To recruit the most gifted graduates very early in the auditoriums, before they come on the job market and are courted by others. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And because the universities publish no installations about the achievements of her students, one tries to spot of the special talents in practise projects and to bind to himself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> On the second day of the Workshops in the University of Technology of Brunswick the autogroup advertises around the talents. </seg>
<seg id="10"> A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pen, little elastic bear and briefcases with VW logo. </seg>
<seg id="11"> She tells the hopeful Jung's talents about training period programmes and student jobs and indicates to them ways in the group. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Nico Selle of the University of Technology of Brunswick looks after the project with VW. </seg>
<seg id="13"> He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students step in contact with the industry and collect experiences." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "VW can get to know at the same time students, look at interesting candidates to themselves closer and consider who would be possible than employee." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Such cooperations, according to Selle, are not unusual. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It is new that is courted so offensively the students. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Otherwise, the main focus lay rather on the technical project," says Selle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The fight for the freshly postgraduates will become even harder fine. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In many branches the enterprises cannot select to themselves her employees any more from a big crowd of applicants. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But they must recommend themselves and court particularly around highly qualified manpower. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Besides, before all graduate from the engineer's disciplines are in an excellent negotiations position. </seg>
<seg id="22"> According to the association of German of engineers VDI more than 40,000 engineer's places remained in October unoccupied. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And the so-called engineer's gap will become even bigger according to VDI forecasts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> For the economic check enterprise and consulting firm KPMG goes Roman Dykta on the talent hunt. </seg>
<seg id="25"> He organises costly Recruiting-events as for example the KPMG-Race, a sort of modern shred hunt with which the participants must find her way on the basis of GPS co-ordinates. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The enterprise wants to send eight promising students thus next year straight through the USA. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Completely, besides, the participants can have a look at KPMG branches and get to know the enterprise. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Who is allowed with, decides in two choice rounds in the approach. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Nur die de la Crème der vielen BEWERBER FLIEGT IN DIE USA. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> With the mattock and jump-off around the High potential at the universities the Geschütze become bigger and bigger according to Dykta. </seg>
<seg id="31"> "We want to contrast with the Race from the mass." </seg>
<seg id="32"> "Only an easy Segeltörn was to us not enough." </seg>
<seg id="33"> For talent hunter Dykta the calculation seems to rise. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "We have till this day with all participants of a similar action last year contact." </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Some stand shortly before her end and soon want to apply with us," he says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Beside the direct paramour in the campus above all small and small and medium-sized companies also go quite classically with occupational measuring on the deerstalking. </seg>
<seg id="37"> "We try to reach graduates on trade fairs." </seg>
<seg id="38"> "Possibly on Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, personnel manager with the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The Bonn enterprise occupies about 1500 employees in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Stübe knows around the promising problems. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Currently 35 places are written out on the enterprise website. </seg>
<seg id="42"> "It is just very difficult to take vacant positions." </seg>
<seg id="43"> "This costs a lot of time and money," she says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Another way is the contact about the university professors. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Solarworld co-operates with different colleges, possibly of the university in Freiberg. </seg>
<seg id="46"> "The professors give instructions that one can make training periods with us or write his dissertation." </seg>
<seg id="47"> Expensive publicity campaigns are not announced with the solar specialist. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The enterprise with other advantages tries to advertise to it for itself: Personal atmosphere, level hierarchy and light communication. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "A great group cannot often offer this," says personnel manager Stübe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> Money does not play with the job search long ago any more the leading role. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Adaptable working hours, care of children or good opportunities for advancement are other determining factors. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Solarworld booked with a study of the Great Place to Work of institute the 55th place among 100 best employers of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The institute provides an annual top list of German employers. </seg>
<seg id="54"> It questions about it employee as contently them with her work and her job sphere are and looks at the basic conditions of the employees. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Personnel manager Stübe also hopes for pluses with the job-searching from the order. </seg>
<seg id="56"> "I think that applicants look particularly after external assessments about a potential employer," she says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57"> Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding academy discusses enterprise which want to be based a good call as an employer with a long-term strategy. </seg>
<seg id="58"> He advises his customer more authenticity. </seg>
<seg id="59"> And this means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures. </seg>
<seg id="60"> "The best way to make itself attractive as an employer leads about own employees," he says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> In the branch jargon the internal Employer Branding, so employer's brand education within own staff is called. </seg>
<seg id="62"> "Contented employees are the best ambassadors." </seg>
<seg id="63"> If one treats his people well and they identify with the enterprise, then they would completely advertise by itself with friends and friends to her employer. </seg>
<seg id="64"> "This is like a play with gang," says Kriegler. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Before the coast of the US federal state Florida in the gulf of Mexico there will be during the coming years no new oil drillings. </seg>
<seg id="3"> A suitable ban has remitted the government in Washington - and with it has revoked her former plans finally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Also before the Atlantic coast new drillings remain for the time being prohibited. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar informed of this on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Trigger for the strict ban which should be valid at least for the coming five years is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Before the misfortune which cost to eleven workers the life and led to the biggest environmental disaster of the USA president Barack Obama had signalled his readiness under pressure the opposition and the industry to admit new drillings in the eastern part of the gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The advocates want to reduce with it the dependence of the USA on oil deliveries from abroad. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Who bears the responsibility for the disastrous oil plague in the gulf, is not cleared till this day finally. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In the centre of the criticism stands the British energy group BP which is confronted with milliard demands. </seg>
<seg id="11"> A board of inquiry by order Obamas should present her results in the course of December. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In October Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the drilling stop covered after the explosion. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In the connection different oil groups had made straight away applications for new drilling plans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> With more sharp controls and stricter safety regulations Obama and Salazar want to exclude a recent disaster. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Currently is basically reformed the responsible controlling authority which had got after numerous corruption reproaches in discredit. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In parallel in addition Obama has announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil groups and gas groups. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Now the industry warns publicly about the fact that the output was clearly low than in the gulf by a stricter regulation up to now. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "The plans of the government are the biggest brake for the growth of the oil industry and gas industry," the result of a topical branch survey is by the firm of consultants BDO - still before the drilling ban of Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Besides, the insecurity deplores the American Energy Alliance in the branch: "Nobody knows what will exactly change with the regulation." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Ogoniland is burnt down </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like in the filling station: Milliards litres of run out crude oil have destroyed the nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The people live on theft, corruption and unlawful oil cooking. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Celestine Akpobari meint es Eingeweide. </seg>
<seg id="5"> "Does not struggle to you," the ecological activist calms the journalists: "You will get even today enough oil mud before the lens." </seg>
<seg id="6"> The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to photograph of one up to the breast in the water wading boys with the streaks surrounding him: In the rainbow-coloured water shine the scene looks almost pretty. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The fact that under the surface brown crude oil swaths float, is not to be seen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Here earlier she has collected in bucketfuls shrimps, tells Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo Jetty river. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the meantime, the sluggishly flowing waters are completely dead. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Five years ago vast amounts crude oil poured forth from a cracked conduit to the gigantic humid area. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Now fishermen from the nearby small town of Bodo must row six hours to reach in fish-containing waters: In the heart of the Niger delta situated Ogoniland is valid as one of the regions polluted most badly of the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> On the journey by the mangrove marshes durchzogenen from courses of a river the whole magnitude of the devastation becomes obvious. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Instead of bright water the motorboat turns up brown broth who dips his hand in the water, pulls out oily fingers. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The roots of the mangrove small trees rise like black Lakritzstangen from the ground, sadly hang sporadically palms to be found her whisks. </seg>
<seg id="15"> One searches bird's dreams, as they are usually usual in humid areas, in vain: As soon as the outboard is quiet, eerie rest spreads out in him like a filling station smelling former paradise. </seg>
<seg id="16"> "What happens here, is ecological leading of the war," says Celestine Akpobari grimly: "We live in constant danger for the health." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The war comparison is right. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battlefield fought since decades: Here the first Explorateure from Europe penetrated more than 60 years ago, here organised in the 80s with the later executed author Ken Saro-Wiwa the first opposition, here the Shell group had to put in 1993 his production because it became too dangerous for his oil workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Still today the return is kept the enterprise to Ogoniland: While from the whole delta region are pumped by the triple size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling springs and 7000 kilometres of conduits daily more than two million barrels of the black gold, the oil fields lie fallow in the Ogoniland, too unstable is to the group the situation. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Every few hundred metres rise steel racks like weird sculptures from the water: "Christian's small trees" are called too affectionate the heads of the bores. </seg>
<seg id="21"> They are up to 50 years old, most to the core corroded. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Over and over again such a drilling head breaks, Akpobari believes, then run a steady stream crude oil in the water. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> More than two milliard litres have flowed according to expert's estimates in 50 years into the ecological system of the delta: Year after year the amount of oil, as it penetrated with the average of the supertanker "Exxon of Valdez" 21 years ago into the sea before Alaska - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of the humanity. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Who is to be held responsible for the persistent ecological region, about that is argued. </seg>
<seg id="25"> While the Shell group holds responsible sabotage and the organised oil theft for more than 90 percent of the soiling, environmentalists see cracking drilling heads and leaky pipelines as a main cause. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Shell puts on in Nigeria substantially lower security standards than, otherwise, in the world commonly, the US scientist Richard Steiner accused the group in 2008: Only the rate of defects in the pipelines is higher "around a multiple than somewhere else." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> At a place which looks from a distance like a desolate, oil-smeared workshop under free sky, figures appear from the mangroves: They are stark naked and are oil-smeared up to the neck. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Under one of many barrels which are to be put out partly with tubes linked, partly arbitrarily scattered on the area flickers a fire: an unlawful small refinery. </seg>
<seg id="29"> In the barrel the crude oil about the fire is heated up during several hours, explains Michael, the boss of the group. </seg>
<seg id="30"> First petrol penetrates by the pipes into the rallying pot, later kerosene and, finally, diesel trickles at the end of the management out. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Thus Michael and four employees produce daily up to four barrels of diesels à 300 litres: "This introduces us 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel shortage in the biggest oil state of Black Africa. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Nigeria disposes only of one single refinery. </seg>
<seg id="34"> With just 40 euro-cents per litre ridiculously low diesel price the unlawful cookers can still underbid: Since they get her raw material free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="35"> He comes from "Bunkerern" which tap the pipeline net straight through Ogoniland: In this manner at least 16 million litres of crude oil get lost to the country according to expert in the whole Niger delta daily. </seg>
<seg id="36"> However, only a vanishing small part of the temporarily interstored raw material is improved illegally: The organised criminal networks to which also politicians and the high-ranking military should belong in tankers and verscherbeln him at the world market fill the lion's share. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The activist Akpobari holds the debate whether the environmental disaster is owed rather to the machinations of the population or the lax production method for purely academic. </seg>
<seg id="38"> "If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and had not destroyed them the life basis of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor theft and unlawful refineries." </seg>
<seg id="39"> In the meantime, the relation of the Ogoni would be destroyed above all to Shell, however, so that only one deduction of the group would be possible: "Maybe other nationality turns out like the Chinese than better." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Michael gives wird nervös. </seg>
<seg id="41"> "The highest time that you disappear" says the athletic oil miller. </seg>
<seg id="42"> "Every minute the soldiers can come." </seg>
<seg id="43"> If the unlawful Ölveredler are got by the special unity of the armed forces, no arrest, probably, however, a painful bribe threatens them. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Also the soldiers particularly coming from the land north want to profit - like all Nigerians - from the raw material. </seg>
<seg id="45"> "This damned stuff has brought our country in every regard to the dog," says Akpobari. </seg>

<seg id="5"> The winter frostet Germany: At icy temperatures nearly the whole republic is at night for Thursday zugeschneit - what leads in many places to traffic chaos. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the north and in the east partially lie 15-centimetre-thick snowy covers. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On several highways and many streets the traffic is strongly limited. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the A7 near Flensburg the winter service was in the long-term application, however, did not finish with the constantly newly blowing up snow. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Besides, violent gusts about the Baltic coast swept. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Federal Office for sea navigation and Hydrographie (BSH) expects on the Baltic coast of Schleswig - Holstein from the morning in storm floods with water levels of 1.2 metres above the normal state. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="18"> According to German railways it comes in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and in the north of Bavaria for considerable disturbances. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Snow on the rails, fallen trees on the rails or destroyed directions and points are the main problems. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In Saxony the long-distance traffic from Leipzig had to be put to Nuremberg. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In the Thuringian hall field an intercity express to Munich had to stop his journey. </seg>
<seg id="22"> 165 passengers were supplied by firefighters and rescue assistants with woollen blankets, food and drinks in the train. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> More than 10,000 people have thought in New Zealand of the buried miners who were explained after several explosions in a mine for dead. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The corpses could not be still rescued because the security situation is further precarious in the misfortune shaft. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Just two weeks ago it had come in the pike River mine near the city of Greymouth to a violent explosion. </seg>
<seg id="5"> 29 miners at the age between 17 and 62 years were buried underground. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> A probe had become in the misfortune shaft hinabgelassen, however, no track of survivors had discovered. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On grounds of the high concentration of toxic gases and the other following explosions no rescue forces could descend for safety reasons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the second violent detonation the authorities and experts had assumed from the fact that there is no more survival chance for the mates any more. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The corpses could not be rescued up to now. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Now members and friends with a commemoration ceremony reminded of the dead people. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Ten thousand of people had assembled with beaming sunshine in Greymouth on the New Zealand south island. </seg>
<seg id="12"> During two minutes they were quiet. </seg>
<seg id="13"> To honour of the buried miners 29 tables on which helmets, lamps and the names of the mates were to be seen were put up. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Also pictures and personal objects, under it clothes and surfboards, found here her place. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Before the government buildings of the country the flags on blew at half-mast. </seg>
<seg id="16"> New Zealand has hoped that the miners "from the depths of the earth" would come again to the surface, said the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the commemoration ceremony. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "But they have never come home." </seg>
<seg id="18"> He cannot conclude with the death of his son, as long as he has not seen his corpse, said Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the pit. </seg>

<seg id="1"> To the hell, warrior! </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Does Splatter fit to the art cinema? </seg>
<seg id="3"> The director Nicola Winding Refn plumbs with his fighter's epic "Walhalla Rising" old genre borders anew. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> To which audience may the Danish director Nicola Winding Refn have thought when he has turned "Walhalla Rising"? </seg>
<seg id="5"> A caught Viking's warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) escapes from his torturers and puts down with nearly supernatural forces by the dozen his opponents - sounds ideally for young male spectators in search of bloody action, just because our hero helps himself with pleasure of rough homicide methods and tears from his enemies already the intestines from the living body if he has bad mood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On the other hand, says Einauge how he is called actual, the whole film about no word, and also the other figures get involved only sometimes to or two sentences or some agonising death yelling thrill. </seg>
<seg id="7"> But is quiet and indulged itself in the creepily nice hill scenery of Scotland which offers the scenery to the Viking's world from about thousand years ago. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Ideally rather for adult cineastes with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera journeys. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Nice if a film has several target groups, a pity only if they exclude themselves mutually. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Director Winding Refn is valid since his wild and stylish drug dealer's trilogy "pusher" as a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, however, refuses stoic to make his works with a little bit more humor to the mainstream or a little less brutality to the Arthouse accessible. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Most art cinema friends might be deterred from the around splashing cerebral mass and the intestines. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The action fans die at the latest before boredom when Einauge for freely interpretable reasons with a troop opens more violently of Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and pins an eternity in stagnation and fog, before the team apparently comes in America and is quiet there further. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> No miracle that "Walhalla Rising" has found no film rental company in Germany and has appeared now only on DVD. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is particularly because of the splendid pictures misery, but also because behind pretentious to facade dripping with blood a sometimes exciting piece of cinema hides which has earned some attention. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In this film it is not about dialogues or a stringent action, it is of all atmosphere, a film-become fever dream. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> And from him there is for the spectator no escape. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Refn grants no moment of the relaxation to him and knots to him with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack quite slowly the throat, above all, however, with the unfathomable hatred which confronts him from the hearts of the figures. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Only a small blond boy, the Einauge faithfully aside stands, retains integrity a sort of innocence, all the others are done by rage. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In the most one the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained who becomes, however, for enemies and temporarily allies sometime the warrior from the hell, possibly to the ambassador of the devil himself. </seg>
<seg id="20"> He means downfall, maybe, however, even for the anyway spoilt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> "Walhalla Rising" is a puzzling film which one can hate and admire, for annoying, exciting and amazement. </seg>
<seg id="22"> An experience. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The nuclear energy authority IAEA has new tips to a confidential nuclear programme in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the country defends itself to take stand on it - still it admits controls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> About midnight of 5. on 6th of September, 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 attack I fighter aircraft a mysterious, cubic building in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It stands on the shore of the Euphrates; the next bigger town, 30 kilometres away, is Dair as-Saur. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Their name appears in documents of the International nuclear energy authority (IAEA) if it is about the reactor which Syria has built supposedly with the help of from North Korea in the ashlar, hides in a valley which goes off from the stream. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing of the US-foreign Secret Service CIA from end of April, 2008 familiar reactor would have well been likely also under the name of the close place el-Kibar to generate plutonium - from which nuclear weapons can be built. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes against it the technology from the Fünfzigern is hardly good. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA led a videopresentation before with blurred satellite pictures. </seg>
<seg id="10"> By computer animation she faded in where which components of the reactor should have been before the destruction which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the nuclear centre of Yongbyon. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Besides, she presented the photos which show the building at close range or even the interior. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor has stood shortly before the introduction, one said, but not yet with fuel sticks been equipped. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombardment, is hardly known more than at that time, the riddles became rather bigger with the time. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The former US-president George W. Bush has revealed recently in his memoirs that the CIA was sure before the attack though surely that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly saw clues for the fact that there was "an active nuclear weapon programme" in the country. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some secret service workers in Europe are rather even more careful there and speak only of a "supposed reactor," even if they hold the CIA presentation for "plausible." </seg>
<seg id="16"> You lack hard proofs, just as the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Asked, how sure he is to have a reactor before himself, a high UN diplomat answered in summer only tersely, the IAEA has "enough material to put questions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Syrians put aside the rubble of the supposed "unused military building" though in a great hurry and levelled the area thoroughly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> An IAEA team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar still found in June, 2008 tracks of the uranium which had been produced by people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Besides, the IAEA about a member state received satellite pictures of commercial suppliers from the time directly after the attack who might be more expressive than those of the CIA presented arms. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Indeed, these admissions at the market are not to be got because the unknown principal - maybe Israel - has bought them exclusively. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Hence, the IAEA cannot verify her genuineness independently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always protested, has never pursued a confidential nuclear programme or a reactor to have built. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium comes from the Israeli weapons, explained Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="25"> However, this rejected the IAEA according to the analysis of the particle as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since that time there refuses Damascus to discuss this - just as about the satellite pictures. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Besides, it keeps the controllers the second inspection in el-Kibar and the access to the remains of the bombed building. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But also Israel is quiet iron. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We will never comment on this," premier Ehud Olmert being in office at the moment of the attack confirmed recently the official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Thus the investigation of the case drags on since June, 2008 unsuccessfully and "develops increasingly to a serious credibility problem for the authority" as a high western diplomat in the seat of the IAEA concedes in Vienna - finally, a heavy offence against the Non-Proliferation Treaty stands in the space over which the IAEA watches. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As a key to progress with the clarification the IAEA apparently sees three other facilities which should stand "in functional connection" with the supposed reactor - and differently than this still exist. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Besides, the inspectors have neither disclosed up to now which arrangements it concerns, nor which function they have or what she demonstrates suspicious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to the information of Süddeutsche Zeitung they are called in the IAEA inside Marj ace sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, are derived again from nearby towns. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent institutes for Science and Internationally Security in Washington (Isis) have identified these places and in satellite pictures have found a complex of buildings with Masyaf with which it concerns most probably one of the suspicious objects. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It is possibly in or immediately beside a military base - exactly with these grounds Syria of the IAEA keeps the access to three places. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In Vienna one says, the Syrians feared fishing expedition - that the IAEA of the USA is sent forward to spy out military arrangements. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Since the nuclear detectives had become attentive by a tip of the US Secret Services to the facilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has tips, under it satellite photos that between three places and the ashlar on the Euphrates material became there and hertransportiert. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A high western diplomat in Vienna said, at least one of the arrangements could stand "in connection with the fuel production." </seg>
<seg id="40"> However, there are "no tips to sensitive activities," so uranium enrichment or reworking; the processes which are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Though the reactor type is pursued with uranium which is not fortified. </seg>
<seg id="42"> However, where the uranium should have come and where from it later the plutonium should be separated for the bomb, to these central questions there is at most plausible supposition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> It is unclear also, whether the remains which could rescue valuable tracks in which to three places were stored. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As if the hundreds of truck loads from the surface of the earth had disappeared, nobody wants to have information about where the rubble has remained. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The only few kilometres of el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates the situated salt mine al-Tibni which has examined Syria in 1998 for her suitability as a camp for radioactive garbage is valid for the IAEA as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had associated them recently in an analysis of satellite pictures for the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> However, admissions from the orbit show that Syria carried out earthworks at three suspicious places and removed big containers, after the IAEA had required access. </seg>
<seg id="48"> This can be a chance, however, has served hardly to clear the suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Besides, one says in diplomat's circles, the IAEA has used several months ago to develop there a plan for inspections which should allow to Syria to protect any military secrets - only the expenditure points, how big the interest of the inspectors is. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Meanwhile, Damascus also ironed this proposal from. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> If western diplomats had appeased in Vienna still one year ago, the reactor would be destroyed, hence, the thing has no high urgency, possibly US ambassador Glyn Davies brings since a few months of so-called special inspections into the play, one of the most sharp means which has the Viennese nuclear authority to put through controls. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Though IAEA boss Yukiya Amano who would have to suggest these inspections already has from an "option for which I am open in the future" spoken, still, however, he hesitates. </seg>
<seg id="53"> A high risk lies in this way: On the one hand, it needs for it a majority in the governor's advice of the IAEA, and several of 35 countries represented there are anything but keen on an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other hand how a diplomat points out: "What is if they find at the end nothing at all?" </seg>

<seg id="1"> Love in times of the war </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Since Angelina Jolie has begun in summer with the work on her still anonymous directorial debut, there is annoyance. </seg>
<seg id="3"> She herself has written the screenplay, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Even more one does not know about that - but already this reaches for restlessness. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Stubbornly the rumour, the woman, a Muslimin keeps, falls in love during the Yugoslavia war with her Serbian rapist. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Bosnian women's associations have protested immediately, whereupon some rotary days planned in Sarajevo at short notice to Hungary were moved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In the meantime, the film is turned in Hungary and in the postal production, but it it is still protested in Bosnia. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Bakira Hasecic of the organisation of female war victims wrote about the UN-refugee's charitable organisation UNHCR in Jolie and required a meeting with the actress, now a Bosnian newspaper has reported - Jolie is even an ambassadress of the UN-refugee's charitable organisation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> She is not diplomatic - she has already offered a meeting in Hungary to the women weeks ago what they rejected, however. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The meeting must take place in Bosnia, according to Hasecic. </seg>
<seg id="11"> There have not been love stories in rape camps, and Jolies position towards the victims betrays to her enough about the screenplay. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Their organisation has recommended according to the UN-refugee's charitable organisation to dismiss Jolie as an ambassadress, reports to the guerrilla warfare. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> What has written exactly, however, Jolie for scenes? </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Bosnian cultural ministry which got to read her screenplay has given to some and Here a rotary approval for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear, why Jolie did not come then, nevertheless. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Jung's author herself protested, they pursues no political intentions with her film, has got used to the work with a lot of trouble in the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the awful results of the war and give a voice to all involved sides. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, with the contents she remains vague. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Thus the second Synopsis still circulates to the film in the net which sounds nevertheless quite different: The lovers knew themselves in it already before outbreak of war and meet again when it, a Bosnian Muslimin, in a Serbian camp is kidnapped in which he works as a guard. </seg>
<seg id="18"> What sounds, nevertheless, considerably differently than the variation "Rape victim falls for torturer." </seg>
<seg id="19"> The fact that Jolies film begins really already before the war - so much is sure. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The pressure on them, according to Jolie, is unfair "and is based on misinformation." </seg>
<seg id="21"> Now only the hackers of Hollywood can probably get her peace: While they put the screenplay, like already so many before, illegally in the net. </seg>

<seg id="20"> If the forecasts prove to be true, it comes to an emigration wave comparably with that from which Ireland suffered in the eighties. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Now after a decade of the impetus which brought big prosperity with itself for the Irishmen dreariness spreads once more. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Besides, the economic crisis unnerves above all the young, well qualified Irishmen for whom it went up to now only uphill. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Job loss and social descent seemed absurd during the boom years. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Everybody was used, there was money in the abundance. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In the meantime, however, three of ten women and men are under thirty without work. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> In the Irish Times there is zuhauf the letters to the editor of young emigrants which complain: "Everything goes in Ireland brook under it." </seg>
<seg id="27"> "There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who is able, leaves and our country a whole generation loses with it." </seg>
<seg id="28"> "Then the last puts out please the light." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, sees a sombre future gathering because the government pursues only eyewash and offers to the young people no more future prospects. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "You reduce the minimum wages, but they have no strategy as new jobs should be created," says the 20-year-old. </seg>
<seg id="31"> She observes how her fellow students to themselves from an unpaid training period work the way along to the next. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Their biggest worry, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years independently. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "Dieser Gedanke ist traurig und deprimierend." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Besides, men like Stephen McLarnon try to take the subject positively. </seg>
<seg id="35"> McLarnon organises the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a fair which offers an all-round service on the subject Work abroad. </seg>
<seg id="36"> "Nevertheless, for first-time employees the work is abroad a great chance to take the first steps on the career leader," says the manager. </seg>
<seg id="37"> On his web page photos show surfer in Australia and Snowboarder in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The message is clear: Abroad work is no galley service, but brings also freedom and fun. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> How it feels to build up somewhere else something, Seán O'Donovan knows for half a year. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Because there was to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland nothing more, now he works with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In Gelsenkirchen they pull up just a fashion house. </seg>
<seg id="42"> In January it further goes to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> His native country sees O'Donovan, in the meantime, only rare, because he makes extra layers to be able to pay off the loan for his house at home. </seg>
<seg id="44"> "The situation is already crazy a little bit," he says when he steps after long time for the first time about the threshold of his house. </seg>
<seg id="45"> "I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland in which I practically never again am." </seg>
<seg id="46"> He laughs something move and goes through cooled down rooms. </seg>
<seg id="47"> The small house stands in a fine residential area with cultivated front gardens, in the entrances big, expensive cars park. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Together with a sister O'Donovan has bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent loan-financed. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "These were mad times, there was an easy money without many questions," he says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> Does he have fear that it could fail with the loan? </seg>
<seg id="51"> O'Donovan considers for a while, adds hot tea and says: "I have no children whom I must feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start anew." </seg>
<seg id="52"> The structural engineer does not like the lamentations which at the moment he often hears. </seg>
<seg id="53"> "Nobody must starve - nevertheless, our situation is not so dramatic by far as in former times here on the island," he says. </seg>
<seg id="54"> "For a while abroad work, this is not the worst what can happen - maybe we thereby feel only when Irishmen." </seg>
<seg id="55"> He laughs and then tells about his father who has gone in the last big economic crisis to England. </seg>
<seg id="56"> "After seven years he was there again and the life went on in Ireland, quite simply." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57"> Cian Tanner likes this thought. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The future leave open and simply sometimes look like it runs with the life somewhere else. </seg>
<seg id="59"> He has a few years of work in London already behind himself and which is why should it not run in New Zealand also well for him and his friend? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> However, a thing is there still which disturbs him during these days severely: the celebration for his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin. </seg>
<seg id="61"> He fears that it could degenerate into a farewell party. </seg>
<seg id="62"> "Only not too many emotions," he says and drinks a big gulp of his beer. </seg>
<seg id="63"> "Nevertheless, farewell, this sounds frightening." </seg>
<seg id="64"> "If we call it rather a road walking party, quite laxly, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few plays." </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1"> The demokatrische routine </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The democracy movement in Latin America becomes stronger, as well as the support of private enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Criminal activity is a bigger problem than the unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In many parts of the region the influence of Brazil is bigger than that of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="5"> To these results came the Latinobarómetro survey which was carried out in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This survey is carried out since 1995 regularly and indicates thus the opinion change in this region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two facts fall in this year's survey from September and October particularly in the eye. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First the good mood in Latin America </seg>
<seg id="9"> and secondly the growing interest in democracy and her most important institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In numerous countries on the South American Pacific coast the democratic movement has strongly increased (see. Table 1). </seg>
<seg id="11"> In Peru, e.g., where the economy grows since 2002 yearly about approx. 6%, the number of the democracy advocates of 40% rose in 2005 on 61% this year. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Also in Mexico where the economy recovers since the strong burglary last year again such a trend is to be recognised. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> However, only half of the interviewees in Mexico and Brazil, the countries richest in population of the region, are convinced democrats what lowers the regional average (see. Diagramme 2). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Approx. 44% of the interviewees explained, that be contented they with the democratic practise of her country. This are so many like last year, however, 25% more than in 2001 (diagramme 3). </seg>
<seg id="15"> About 34% trust the congress of her country and 45% of her government. Both values correspond to those of the last year, however, show a clear increase towards in 2003 (17% or 24%). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Decade ago economic crises of Latin America undermined the efforts towards more democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This also continued during the worldwide economic crisis, is possibly due to the fact that the Latin American countries experienced only one short recession phase and have recovered fast again. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, the arms were caught by a stronger social net. </seg>
<seg id="19">  (According to reports of the UN-economic commission for Latin America of this week the poverty rate rose in 2009 in Latin America only slightly and has liked this year again about 32%.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> However, from country to country there are strong mood differences (see. Diagramme 4). </seg>
<seg id="21"> Strong economy of Brazil and the popularity of the parting president Luiz Inácio Lula there Silva is reflected in a widespread progress thinking. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In Mexico and Central America where the recession was stronger perceptible and violent crime have increased, this is less the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Only for the second time since survey beginning many interviewees see a bigger problem than in the unemployment (see in Latin America in the criminal activity in her country. Diagramme 5). </seg>
<seg id="24"> Approx. 31% state that either they themselves became or members of the family last year victims of a crime. However, compared with 38% last year the values have sunk and reach therefore the lowest state since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The rising economic achievement is reflected in the stronger support of the private sector and the market economy: approx. 71% of the interviewees gave national that the private sector is indispensable for the development, in 2007 there were 56% (see. Diagramme 6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> Approx. 58% explained that only the market economy can bring to her country progress, compared to 47% last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly 62% of the interviewees in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although her left president, Hugo Chávez, many private enterprises nationalises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil has according to 19% of the interviewees (18% last year) the biggest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, consistently since the last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year). </seg>
<seg id="29"> However, the interviewees in Mexico and most countries of Central America see the most high-powered country in the USA and this role is taken over in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela. </seg>

<seg id="1"> An electoral setback </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Nobody had expected that the elections would be perfect on the 28th of November in Haiti. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But the facts excelled the fears of the electoral assistants who hurried to the sieved country for the help, by far. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Congested electoral urns, several times given votes, polling cards in the gutter, destroyed polling places and intimidations were only one part of the problems. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Polling places opened with delay of several hours. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Many Haitians from whom many had become homeless by the earthquake in January wandered around in search of an option. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Some surrendered, finally, completely. </seg>
<seg id="8"> One dozen presidential candidates, under it some supposed front runners, required on account of a supposed deception the abolition of the election results. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the whole country it came to partly forcible protests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Edmond Mulet, the leader of the UN mission still called in Haiti, the choice "rather good in many interests." </seg>
<seg id="11"> According to a careful statement of observers of the organisation of American States and the Caribbean Community "make these irregularities, so seriously they may also be, the process not necessarily invalid." </seg>
<seg id="12"> In anderen Worte geht die Show weiter. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The electoral authority which is obliged supposedly to the unpopular parting president René Préval and his candidate, Jew Célestin, will announce the temporary results on the 7th of December. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The expected ballot is fixed for January. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> There is still hope in the choice. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Both leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former ridge lady Mirlande Manigat, have pulled back her initial invalidity complaint. </seg>
<seg id="17"> If the Jew Célestin who meets with the voters with only low or no approval from which Wahlberhörde explains to the winner of the ballot could lead this to problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> On account of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents a low election turnout was feared. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Many Haitians were hindered in the election day by lacking organisation in the casting of votes. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Shortly before electoral beginning approx. 250,000 identity cards which are needed for the choice were not not yet distributed yet. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It gets up a lot. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The donor countries look at a legitimate, approved government as an important step by the reconstruction of Haiti. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Secretly in the middle </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> During the weeks after the sudden death of your man president of Argentina, Cristina Fernández, found out a wave from the sympathy which did her popularity rate about 20 points on more than 50% upwards. This is the highest value since her choice in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Whether to her this, nevertheless, next year helps to a reelection, depends on whether obviously mourning Cristina Fernández is more prepared to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor sexton. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The signs for it are not unequivocal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Néstor the sexton who steered the economic policy also to the choice of his wife often put up budgets which considered the inland revenue, the economic growth and the inflation not fully. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This allowed to the presidential pair to spend the extra income at own discretion. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On the paper the Fernández government last year lost the majority in the congress. </seg>
<seg id="8"> However, the opposition is divided and sexton's death after a cardiac infarction on the 27th of October led to other disagreements. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some regime critics from the rows of the ruling Peronisten positioned themselves behind Cristina Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> However, after the chaotic meetings (with which a parliamentarian to another hit in the face and other the government of the bribery accused) the congress did not succeed in dismissing the household for 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I will not discuss this," according to the president. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Now the household in 2010 is also valid for the next year by which the president has even more opportunity to spend money at own discretion. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy overheats: probably she will grow this year around up to 9%. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official inflation rate lies at present with 11.1%, however, numerous private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - do the value on nearly 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The sexton who assumed in 2003 the office as Argentina by economic crises was shaken, explained growth and poverty fight to his principal purposes, and not the inflation lowering. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He refused the cooperation with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned the national institute of statistics and census INDEC which clarified as a result the official inflation statistics. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Can Fernández smash now a more moderate way? </seg>
<seg id="18"> She has called the private sector and the trade union leaders for talks. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And according to official statements pay raises should be limited next year to 18%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The high world prices for agricultural products of Argentina have given a strong impetus to the economy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, the inflation undermined the growth push by a big Devaluation in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> That's why Cristina Fernández would possibly like to connect Argentina finance-economically again to the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In the beginning of this year the government concluded an agreement with the security owners who had rejected the former conversion of debts of the country in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Now Fernández seems to push the club to which she owes approx. 6,7$ billion for an agreement with the financiers from Paris. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The sexton had always rejected an examination by the IMF, like elsewhere commonly. </seg>
<seg id="26"> However, last month the Minister for Economic Affairs Amado Boudou announced that the fund performs "technical support" by the production of a new national consumer price index. It looks in such a way as if this was the first step to the purge of the INDEC. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not known whether Fernández is politically active after ending of her term of office also without support by her husband. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If so, she needs in addition the support of the middle class, mainly enough has from the Kirchnerismus. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the Argentines return in March from her summer vacation, the wave of the Sympatie which was brought to her will have died down. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If she liked to win an other choice, it must decide whether it lifts many political decisions of her husband quietly and quietly. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Weak applause for China </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Voters of Taiwan slowly approach a narrower connection with the mainland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> What does Taiwan of his big brother hold beyond the strait? </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the 27th of November started more than 7.5 million voters, these are 70% of all voters, to choose mayor and town councils in five town districts. This is evaluated as a wide assessment of the president mA Ying-jeou. </seg>
<seg id="5"> By the construction of pioneering business relations, incl. a partial free trade agreement, there is mA itself a symbolic figure for the relations with the mainland. His politics has changed the relation to the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949 with lasting effect. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> MA has passed the check, however, only scarcely. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) three five mayors puts, she received no voice majority. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Instead, received the democratic progress party (DPP) which recommends a bigger independence of Taiwan, nearly 50% of the voices, the KMT received 45%. </seg>
<seg id="9"> By a presidency choice this would have meant for mA of problems. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Since his choice two years ago the percentage of votes of his party has liked about approx. 8%. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For the first time drew the DPP even together with the KMT in the town councils. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> During the choice it came to the incidents usual in Taiwan like truck convoys with riot doers, flag-swinging mass moves and only meagerly dressed dancers. </seg>
<seg id="13"> There was even the compulsory, mysterious murder attempt. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honourary chairperson of the KMT made in the eve of the choice a speech on a KMT candidate, </seg>
<seg id="15"> when to him a man from the amount shot in the face. Lien was wounded and a next spectator was killed. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Weird-wiser it is not clear whether the shooter Lien wanted to kill or settle a dispute with the candidate. </seg>
<seg id="17"> No matter the poster according to Tsai has affected engineer-whom, to the leader of the DPP which choice has moved and the DPP in a bad light what has given more voices of the KMT. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> China was possibly the biggest winner of the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Remarkably it was not picked out as a central theme the relations with the mainland. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Instead, the candidates debated plans to social flats and the creation of jobs. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The Taiwanese love her actual independence and reject military menace of China. </seg>
<seg id="22"> That's why does not place special emphasis on the KMT her relations with the government in Peking with pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="23"> However, this time also avoided the DPP to poke the anti-Chinese feelings too much. </seg>
<seg id="24"> She reacted with it to the new consciousness that economy of Taiwan cannot survive without China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> MA on his part would like to be confirmed that the majority of the Taiwanese recommends his China politics. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The government in Peking will pursue furthermore his strategy to lure back Taiwan with economic stimulating in the community. </seg>
<seg id="27"> China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipeh to prepare a summit to investment security and medical cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Absolutely it also wishes a political integration. But the most important first. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It waits with it rather to the presidency elections in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The DPP has anew invented itself, in the meantime. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Two years ago it was strongly weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat because of corruption in the prison. </seg>
<seg id="32"> During his presidency from 2000 to 2008 he entered vehemently for the absolute independence. </seg>
<seg id="33"> However, under Tais Regentschaft a new generation of temperate politicians and the DPP developed fights for the voices of the working persons and the youth. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Tsai met as a presidential candidate of the DPP with big approval, how Su Tseng-chang under Chen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Now their party does everything to show that also it is able to build up close relations with Peking. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Tsai plans idea smiths as a contact point between the DPP and China. Nevertheless, this assumes unprejudiced discussions. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Tsai explained publicly that her party a "trustworthy alternative" offers to Mas of rash approach to China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Chen seems very much angry about this change. </seg>
<seg id="39"> From his cell he explained, the candidates of the DPP would have done better to exist on independence of Taiwan. </seg>
<seg id="40"> He even asked the pragmatist Su to renounce the presidency candidature. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Also without Chens interference does to itself the DPP hard to choose her possible candidate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The KMT will have to undergo own selfanalysis. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Mas values are bad, in spite of the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run her election campaign without him. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The principal reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the other and other scissors between arm and empire. </seg>
<seg id="45"> According to statement of a KMT speaker he will reshape his cabinet as well as the local facilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> The strong appearance of the DPP lets assume that Taiwan recommends a reapproach only restrictedly. </seg>
<seg id="47"> At the same time most Taiwanese see the economic cooperation with China as inevitable. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was distinguished astonishing-wise in the category Newcomer of the year </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> If you on inquiry of a president auftritts, the people will note it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to appear with the ceremony on the occasion of the Nobel prize lending in 2009. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer überrachsenderweise was nominated for this year's Grammy in the category Newcomer of the year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In view of the fact that Spalding is a famed star since her album "Esperanza" in 2008 in the jazz scene already the nomination seems a little unusual. However, she corresponds to the Grammy rules according to which an artist might have published at most three albums before publication of the album with whom he became known in the wide public. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Their ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society," is absolutely a 1 step forwards. And with her buoyant voice and a good feel for pop, radio and Latin Music, one can compare Spalding quietly to Norah Jones in 2003 whose big success comes in 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category of the nomination most near Spaldings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Further the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer trios was nominated in the category Instrumental albums. This darling of the critics thereby experienced a huge success. </seg>
<seg id="7"> To the competitors Iyers belong among other things "Moody of 4B" of the experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the Keyboarders John Beasley. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Trombone Shorty, a Rau-legged favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBOs "Treme," was distinguished in the category contemporary jazz in which, otherwise, rather albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber are to be found. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Probably deserving attention received in the category great group the Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue. He steps therefore in against Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and adventuresome Dave Holland and his octet whose Life-Ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic tape leader. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Microbe resistant to arsenic could allow new life forms on the earth or somewhere else </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The discovery of a foreign bacterial kind which can live among other things on arsenic opens new possibilities for new life forms on the earth and somewhere else. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on the earth, it is to her view after a sign for the fact that a life is also possible without up to now as of vital importance judged elements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "This organism has two possibilities." </seg>
<seg id="5"> "He needs to the wax either phosphorus or arsenic." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "This makes it a little bit completely special, although it is nearly one kind of 'foreign' life form," explained Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report who appears on Thursday in the on-line issue of the magazine Science. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Up to now six main elements were looked as of vital importance - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> However, as the scientists found out, the bacterium grows in the Californian Mono brine also even further if it substitutes for phosphorus with arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "Nevertheless, there one asks himself what is else possible," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is an important step with the search for extraterrestrial life, because scientists must recognise life and his forms, according to Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study deals with microbes which were found on the earth. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The announcement of a press conference in which no details were announced for the discovery gave occasion for widespread speculations on the Internet that the report of the discovery of extraterrestrial life could act. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "shows that in other planet systems organisms can get going biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements' which are absolutely of vital importance according to our opinion are not necessarily firmly given," explained Charles Cockell, professor in the Planetary and Space Sciences Research institutes of the open university of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockel was not a part of the research team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "This work is a novelty, because she shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures an element can be substituted with another," Cockell added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> This discovery was not accidental. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the astrobiological institute of the NASA which led the study chose the Mono brine on account of the high arsenic salary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Because arsenic and phosphorus are alike chemically, she supposed that the microbes which are put out to both can possibly substitute for an element with the other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "The poisonousness of the arsenic is based above all on the fact that it behaves chemically similarly like phosphorus." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "Thereby it is difficult for the organisms to distinguish an element from the other." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "Nevertheless, the difference is so big that arsenic looks different than phosphorus. It reaches in our biochemical system where it virtually smears everything," explains Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers put out the bacterium to GFAJ-1 of a rising arsenic concentration. It adapted itself and grew. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Though the microbe grows in phosphorus better, however that it can also survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based life form can seem of course, either on the earth or on another planet or moon, on the arsenic it seems more often. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> According to Jamie S. Foster, lecturer in microbiology in the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be substituted with arsenic, not anew. But up to now there was still no functioning example. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Arsenic seemed during the early earth years more often, she says, therefore, the science has assumed from the fact that early life forms have used it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> "This gives reason for the acceptance that life could also have developed differently than in the early geological era," according to forester whom member was not in Wolfe-Simons research team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The research projects were supported by the NASA, the energy ministry and the national health authorities. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The lion roars again after judicial approval of the MGM restructuring </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Now, finally, after 18-month turbulence and uncertainties MGM got green light for a fresh start. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A New York bankruptcy judge sanctioned on Thursday offiziel him Gläuberplan "prepare" to erase the debts at the rate of 5$ billion and to pave the way the 86-year-old entertainment enterprise for new films and variety shows. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to the statements of Thursday the plan fulfils the demands of the US-bankruptcy right, so that nothing is in way of the new start of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass entertainment. Barber and pear tree will project to the a little bit shed studio as a general manager. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The employee's number is lowered from more than 400 upon approx. 320. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For MGM Chapter 11 comes into force really when JPMorgan Chase has concluded a planned loan of 500$ million for the financing of the new MGM productions. </seg>
<seg id="7"> At the moment a syndicate of the investment bank which itself introduces 75$ million leads the enterprise. The financing should stand till the middle of December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The restructuring of the studio began in May, 2009 with the order to the investment bank Moelis & Co to help the enterprise management which fought $ million / years with interest payments at the rate of 300, in the solution of her financial problems. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In August the manager Harry Sloan was substituted with Stephen Cooper, to a former CEO with Enron and restructuring expert who became known by his activity with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> To solve the efforts of Moelis & Cooper, the finance worries MGMs and to pay out more than 140 Gläuber of the studio, lasted longer than expected. </seg>
<seg id="11"> After discussions of many months the parties decided in the end of 2009 to offer the enterprise to the purchase. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, the auction drew only few bidders and nobody wanted to pay the 2 demanded by the Gläubigern to $ billion. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In the spring this year everything began from the front when the MGM team began with the reorganisation plan which was signed after debates of many months and internal disputes at the end of October, finally, by the Gläubigern. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> If MGM has officially got over the bankruptcy during the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper for her work receive a bonus at the rate of several million dollars. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The portion for Moelis & Co. which have already received 1,2$ million, amounts to 9,5$ million. </seg>
<seg id="16"> $ million receive a "successful bonus" from 4 Cooper to which for the management of the enterprise monthly 375.000$ was paid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Barber and pear tree plan to take up the production with MGM again. This year the studio brought out only one film and provided a plan for one year with seven or eight films which should come in the beginning of 2012 to the cinemas. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Further they plan two films after the "small Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The studio needs in addition a separate loan between 265$ million to 275$ million for his financial portion in these both films which should originate under the direction of Peter Jackson. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The investor Carl Icahn who has financed approx. 18% of the MGM advance tried a coalescence of the studio with Lions gate entertainment whose biggest stockholder is he. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, the last negotiations between both enterprises led to no result. </seg>

<seg id="4"> But you can spare your gift budget. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Recently I visited in search of three electronics toys under 80$ three national toys traders - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a club BJ's Wholesale. </seg>
<seg id="6"> To me it became clear immediately that of moor law was come into force. This year the technology toys are more efficient and cost at the same time a little less than last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> And although less new toys with own web page appear, is found in the best known this kind, Webkinz and club of Penguin, a broader offer. </seg>
<seg id="8"> There come more and more button cells pursued toys on the market, and a lot of contain chargeable accumulators. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Here some recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="10">  (If differently given, are not all prices of Toys "R" Us.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, for children from 3 years) are plush figures, as largely as guinea pig which sing a mark if one presses her belly. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Once press corresponds to a mark, by repeated pressure one can play a song. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Attention: If you have started with the pressure once, you cannot stop any more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> For a combination of Gesand and dance the dance star Mickey (Fisher-Price 60$, for children from 2) is the best choice. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The animatronische doll interplays like offers 'basis of the Elmo developed last year live technology Simon says', and thanks to the new hinge feet with bicycle blocking she controls the Moon-Walk. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The children who tested the device use Mickey as a dancing instructor. Nevertheless, their parents complained to the missing volume control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> If you are a child of the 80th, remember absolutely Alphie, one of the first computerised learning toys. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Now he is there again (Hasbro/Playskool, 40$, for children from 3), with a whole heap of interrogative maps with which a drive can become one teaching hour with a know-it-all with auto correction function as a teacher. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> If you did not like to entrust with your Smartphone your child with pleasure, are here three independent alternatives. </seg>
<seg id="21"> MobiGo of VTech (60$ for children of from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. Nevertheless, the plays contained on it are not so instructive as on the Leapster Explorer (70$, for children of from 3 to 12) which is equipped to Leapfrogs of the first big reworking of the Leapster row with a new, brighter screen. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Keine der Versionen ist mit älteren Kassetten kompatibel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> iXL from Fisher-Price (90$ for children of from 3 to 7) uses for the plays and eBooks a system similarly iTunes, and thanks to the map disk drive SD family photos can be also looked on it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Finally there is still Scrabble Flash (30$ of Hasbro, for children from 8). Five blocks are not bigger than a match box and dispose of own LED screen. </seg>
<seg id="25"> With the play it is a matter of folding up the blocks to words, before the time runs out. It is suited splendidly for an impromptu Buchstabierwettbewerb. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> More and more toys have a sort of on-line connection. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If one goes alone after the offer in the toys stores, Webkinz and club of Penguin are the most important ones. </seg>
<seg id="28"> To give an on-line animal in the club of Penguin to your child, you can buy, e.g., Disney club of Penguin 2" mixes ' N match the figure package (5$ for children from 6 to 12) which contains a coin with a confidential code. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If you give the code to on-line, your child receives enough Credits for two other parts in the club of Penguin net curtain. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These can be roller skates or a Puffle soft toy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Of the newest head cells pursued microrobots, Hexbug Nano (10$ for children from 5) is not bigger than the head of your toothbrush. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Public prosecutor will not accuse senator Ensign </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Public prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have acquitted senator John Ensign of the accusations which were raised after his Affaire with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to get a lobby activity her husband against him, announced the lawyers of the senator on Wednesday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This decision finishes the heaviest legal reproach against senator Ensign, to the Republican from Nevada. Up to the scandal which nationally provided for headlines and moved to his career a damper he was valid as a possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As senator Ensign office announced, he was high pleased with the judgment according to the one-year-old investigation "." </seg>
<seg id="5"> Nevertheless, the ethical committee of the senate could cover one more Disziplarstrafe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> After statement of Ensigns to lawyers they were informed by the Ministry of Justice about the fact that the investigations were put against senator Ensign and that in this matter no other accusations are given. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Ministry of Justice did not want to express itself to the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The judgment was for many ethical lawyers beyond the Ministry of Justice a surprise. In her opinion there were enough proofs of the fact that Ensign has ignored the lobbying ban. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Interviews, e-mails and other documents which were disclosed for the first time in October, 2009 in the New York Times gave occasion for the supposition that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, to lucrative orders helped to buy his silence about an Affaire with Hamptons wife Cynthia. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Cynthia Hampton was active during an electoral campaign Ensigns as a treasurer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Ensign got in touch with some political friends to get Hampton work. According to the documents and questionings he took over for them after the setting Hamptons lobby work. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Because Hampton was an electoral team recently still in Ensigns, it was he might take over during 1 year no lobby work for his former employer or the whole senate. </seg>
<seg id="13"> According to statement of ethical experts the unusual agreement offended between Ensign and Hampton which were friends before the Affaire closely against the so-called ban of the Drehtür-Lobbykratie. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> According to the published clues "it concerns apparently an arrangement and the offence against the revolving door statutes," according to Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who has specialised in the defence of clients who stand in the visor of the government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> While the Ministry of Justice refused officially to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, said Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers, the ministry seems very carefully in taking up political accusations after a huge number of defeats which were pursued by the media with big interest, including the decision last year to drop the accusation against the former senator Ted Stevens because of failure on the part of the public prosecutor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Public prosecutors "are obviously fright-like," said Melanie Sloan, the chairperson of the union "of Citizen for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organisation whose aim is the fight against corruption in parliament and government circles of the USA), a group of lawyers which has brought different accusations against Mr. Ensign in court. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "This means basically that government officials of high standing can assume now from the fact that the laws are not valid for them," she added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Paul Coggins, main defender of Mr. Ensign, said during an interview, he has received a phone phone call of a public prosecutor on Monday and next the next day in which was informed of him that the ministry will lodge no complaints against his client. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Of Mr. Ensign defender had co-operated with the public prosecutors to persuade them of the fact that the senator, as his office repeated in an explanation on Wednesday once more, has "according to the law traded." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Of Mr. Coggin it declined more exactly to explain the juridical arguments which he had brought forward towards the public prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "To me is not about to go to the conversation details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much would be said: We believe to have made the right decision," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The last month the federal choice commission has decided to put the inquiries because of a separate complaint by the ethical group after which a payment of 96,000$ of Mr. Ensign parents has offended to the Hamptons against the federal choice law. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The electoral commission said, there have not been enough proofs that the money has been something else than a present. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> NV Energy, a big company in Nevada which supported the senator long time was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign Lobbyisten-Arbeit. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Eine E-Mail vom Dezember 2008 belegt, dass, sterben nachdem Firma Herr Hampton als Lobbyist weitergebracht Hut, Herr Ensings Stabschef, John Lopez, eine Unterredung mit Herr Hampton hatte, in der er ihm mitteilte, dass er beim Innenministerium wegen einer Sache "anklopfe." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Krieg von Herrn Ensign außerdem mit Herr Hampton und einem anderen Kunden aus Nevada, Allegiant Luft, zum Mittagessen verabredet und Fledermaus-Bastelraum Verkehrsminister, ein Treffen im Namen der Fluggesellschaft zu vereinbaren, nachdem diese Herr Hampton zwecks Lobbyarbeit eingestellt hatte. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> When the last year for the first time information about this affair penetrated to the public, Mr. Ensign apologises to his voters and gave up his position in the senate where he had stood in the order of rank of the Republicans at the fourth place. </seg>
<seg id="28"> After he had not struck many months any more, told Mr. Ensign two weeks ago to the reporters at which he aims the third term of office in the senate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Not be in the announcement, that Mr. Ensign more investigations longer police the aim, explained his press agent, Jennifer Cooper who hopes senator that the ethical commission follows very fast the example of the Ministry of Justice and puts his inquiries. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "Senator Ensign is glad to continue his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Cheshire appeal draws the attention to Twitter </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Half-dozen of them typed themselves in the riots in the courtroom away. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the minute tact they sent about Twitter her reports on terrible witness's statements. </seg>
<seg id="4"> At the end, according to the defence, there were more than 140,000 Twitter announcements about the process around rape and in beds chained children in a house which rose in flames. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Thursday becomes the carefully presecuted process of Steven J. Hayes who was accused to have killed three members a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to an official end come if the judgement about the death sentence which has pronounced the jury falls. </seg>
<seg id="6"> However, of Mr. Haye lawyers applications have already submitted at court which demonstrate reasons for an appeal and which will occupy the courts for years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> One of the most provoking reasons is that that it has come by the intensive reporting about the process - also by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - to a "circus atmosphere" and an immediate penetration widespread so far of riotous details, so that the jury has been influenced in inadmissible manner by the public indignation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This objection could arrange the Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question whether the new technologies make new rules in the courtroom inevitably. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "As well as I have experienced it during this process, I think that it is really a danger if the move of the new technologies influences the right of every singles on a fair process in the courtroom," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye main defender. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the uppermost chamber court, rejected the last week the applications by decision concisely when he said that the new media are controlled "carefully" would become, and that there would be no proof of the fact that the jury has been done by passions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> However, this was not with certainty yet the last word in this thing. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Since decades court objections have found out that the reporting about famous-infamous cases lets arise doubt about the fairness of a process. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In his historical decision of 1966 the Supreme Court of the United States has lifted the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, to an Osteopathen from Cleveland who should have killed his woman and said in his decision that there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some one thinks that the TV serial and the feature is based "on the run" on this crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some lawyers say, court objections which look at Mr. Haye conviction half a century later could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication ways from the courtroom which were still inconceivable at the moment of the case Dr. Sheppard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "There is a good reason, about the influence of the new media in processes which are pursued by a wide public, disturbs to be," said John J. Donohue III, professor to Stanford Law School who has examined the capital punishment in Connecticut. According to his report it is covered arbitrarily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor Donohue said, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of an immediate communication from the courtroom could bring the actions more fairly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Twitter matter is only one of many which the lawyers of Mr. Haye demonstrate to discuss for years and to put off therefore a conviction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defenders also state, for example, that of Mr. Haye could have been already precondemned when judge Blue had not allowed to them to test the reactions of potential jurors, while one showed them during the juror's choice terrible scene photos. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some of the jurors have said, they would have fulfilled photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and her Tüchter, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, with loathing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defenders say, they would also question the constitutional moderation of the capital punishment constitution, and argue that the judge has exchanged falsely a juror who has been a critic of the public prosecutor's office, and that he would have exercised inadmissible Wise pressure on the judgment when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury about the week-end. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The jurors were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> However, the biggest interest on itself pulls her arguments about the influence of the detailed reporting about the process maybe. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In a judgment challenge which they have submitted the last month they found out that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American senate by the candidates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They argued that the new media would continuously have anew kindled the flames of the emotions about the case. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "One has not experienced such a day-to-day Andrang of the media beepers, cameras and reporters beyond the courtroom," wrote the lawyers, "before still in New Haven and maybe even nationally yet." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Their main focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> During interviews some journalists said that the assertion, this direct news are incendiary as reports which are made more slowly, a technology-hostile look is which becomes impoverished the reporting about future processes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> However, some lawyers said, Appelationsgerichte would be often confronted with the argument, social and technical changes would need the adaptation by the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Of Mr. Hayer lawyers strengthen this assertion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In her objection they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 in which the conviction was lifted by Dr. Sheppard on account of the reporting and made clear that the new media require new rules. </seg>
<seg id="32"> "This case," so they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Can politeness connect the separating? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> After a campaign in terms of abuse and Negativität this week has broken out little politeness in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Is it the omen of a real bipartisan cooperation or one moment of the illusion, before one returns fast again to the fight of the parties in the capital? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The meeting on Tuesday between president Obama and points of the congress brought no breakthrough in the big questions with which one to yourself during so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government period in which no more decisions are made, had to occupy. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After all what one hears it was to be governed neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor an attention of her divided responsibilit, but rather an empty episode of a parteilichen point collecting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meeting of the deficit commission of the president on Wednesday was also civilised, in spite of the political differences which exist between the members furthermore. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems to be clear that a narrow interaction for a period of months lets arise a mutual respect which separates the ideological gap, furthermore the members of each other, veils. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> This hardly is enough to state, it has broken a new era of the cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Now both sides are in a test phase - in which one calls in the other sign of the willingness to co-operate and compromise readiness, while one himself tries to weigh the borders of the public opinion and the patience of the voters after a renewed party leading of the war. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Hence, were limited the meeting on Tuesday and his appraisal by the participants on a minimum of demands or accusations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep, as that one could expect a quick change of the atmosphere which ruled during the past two years. </seg>
<seg id="12"> No matter whether it is about taxes, donations, health or claims, both sides are kilometre-far removed of each other. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Finally the November choice has mildly tuned Washington at least for a short time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush's government who works now for the "Ethics and public Policy centre." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "This is unavoidable after elections. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elections wake parteiliche passions which die again. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And this feels well in such a way." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In some questions, particularly in those, on the agenda "lame duck session" stand, Republicans and democrats have no other choice, than to find a solution." </seg>
<seg id="19"> Bush's tax lowerings end at the end of the year, and nobody recommends this. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way, around some or even everybody receives to, now it is passing or lasting. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Also a compromise is to be expected with regard to the raised unemployment benefits, even if only because the Republicans it cannot afford that one believes, the favoured tax lowerings for the empires, while they refuse a support to jobless workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House the optimism has risen that one itself in these questions during "lame duck session" to some and at the same time also the new START contract can ratify. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> However, William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent questions lame duck session" not compelling to a lasting cooperation of the parties must lead if the new 112th congress calls up in January. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead, so he says, a phase of the Nichtübereinstimmens is more likely, is maybe even unavoidable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "After the things which must be done are done, this short-term psychology will overturn in confrontation," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is divided by many - which leads politeness to true cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "I see a lot what happens from today till 2012, as a prefight, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons for this deal a lot with the presentation of the new republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who were useful their education. </seg>
<seg id="29"> How anxiously the republican leaders may also be about the fact that they play poker too high, they know that they must try, her promises to lower the issues of the government and to cancel the health reform to keep. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> These party lines become already clear in the first reactions with regard to the recommendations of the deficit commission which contain a tax revision and beginning some taxes as well as the increase of the retirement age and the depressions of the state expenses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The acting chairpersons Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have pressed, according to her own appraisal, so much to bet the deficit question on the public agenda that these cannot be ignored any more. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need within the commission 14 18 voices to make her plan the official recommendation and they fight very much to come even to the nearness of this number. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The biggest opposition is found in the elective representatives of the committee, because in finance questions, at least today, only little elbowroom or little sympathy is for compromises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Galston forecasts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in the congress. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The first fight will take place the next year in the form of party collisions if the Republicans Obama challenge concerning the budget, the taxes and the health system, later then followed from a phase of bigger zweiparteilicher cooperation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will lead to this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> The public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> One proves that, in spite of the partiality of the topical choice, the majority of the Americans still wishes that both parties work together. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If confrontation leads in a dead end how it has happened in 1995, then both parties must pay attention carefully to the public reaction. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Whoever is condemned to the losing, will change the course and must search the compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> Indeed, this may be an optimistic perception. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Today partiality and polarisation are bigger than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem to be a bigger ideological gap between Obama and the congressional Republicans than at that time between president Bill Clinton and the Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At the same time the activists of both parties see in 2010 as a pure prelude for a choice by far more far-reaching in consequence in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Thus seen the politeness which is carried this week to the show may be welcomed by many Americans. </seg>
<seg id="45"> However, it will require much more trouble on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions which separate the both still of each other. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Trickled through US document portrays Moscow as a harbour of the corruption </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The control of the town lies in the hands of the "Kleptokratie" and she transmits a part of the bribes and the protection money which she collects, to the Kremlin. Thus the American message reported in February in Russia in a memo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Police as well as the state security service blackmail high protection money, so that they can hold her expensive standard of living in Moscow, one says. </seg>
<seg id="4"> They collect money not only from legitimised shops, but also from organised criminal gangs. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Every layer of the bureaucracy - what has called prime minister Vladimir Putin "vertical of the authority" - takes his part of the money which walks the leaders upwards. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The memo which was sent under the name of the ambassador John Beyrle to Washington was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The memo is based on springs whose names were edited. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It was written, while Yuri Luzhkov was still a mayor of Moscow, and it accuses him of the corruption. </seg>
<seg id="9"> He was fired in October by president Dmitry Medvedev, however, there is no proof of the fact that would have been cleared up in the interim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Luzhkov and his woman, Yelena Baturina who owns a known construction company have rejected for years corruption reproaches over and over again, and he has won numerous actions for slander against such accusations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In September he explained to a Russian television broadcasting station when he was asked for a documentation which suggests, he is corrupt: "It is crazy, it is filthy, it is dirty." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> > Think an incredibly big number in Russian that her society is corrupt. Surveys have proved this. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But it is unusual that, happen how in the report of the ambassador, single people are called, and it is unheard that this happens by a diplomat of a foreign country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "The direct connection of the government of Moscow with the criminal activity has led to the fact that some they call "disturbed" and come to the end that the government acts rather like a Kleptokrat than a government," according to the memo. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "Criminal elements enjoy "kryshna" (a concept from the world of the criminals / of the mafia, what word for word "roof" or protection meant) which as applies about the police, the state security (FSB), the official supervisory authority (MVD) and the office of the public prosecutor as by the whole Moscow government bureaucracy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Experts have discovered a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Luzhkov stands at the uppermost place." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "FSB, MVD and the militia stand on the second step." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "Last follow the common criminals and the criminal inspectors on the lowest step." </seg>
<seg id="20"> "This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the town offers no help." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The report repeats that the money FSB of the biggest companies takes the money and arrests the businessmen small the police. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> A spring, so is called is, "explained that storekeepers of Moscow understand that it is the best to get the protection of the MVD and FSB (and not from the organised crime), because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law." </seg>
<seg id="23"> "That's why the protection is not as asked by criminal way any more as earlier." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The memo notes that, while the collecting of the money is comprehensive, the protection even very much give his nobody; even those who pay are sometimes arrested. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Which do not pay find her business very fast closed - on account of the one or other pretext. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Medvedev has spoken several times of fighting against the corruption, however, has marked at the same time that he has made only little progress. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go with with suitcases which presumably were fully with money to the Kremlin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> "In his fight against the corruption Medvedev must count on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, manager from While, a Moscow expert's commission, recently during an interview. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "But it is a part of this bureaucracy." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "It is no part of the political class because a political class does not exist in Russia any more." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of the powers, so he says, corruption is unavoidable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Nationally, so estimates While, the corruption costs Russia more than 300$ of milliards per year. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The country ranks on place 154 of a newer investigation for the global perception of the corruption by the non-state organisation of Transparence Internationally (countries are performed from "in least corrupt" "too mostly corrupt"). </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> In a weakly illuminated, concreted classroom with dirty and defoliating walls, the manager of the Anlong Veng reminds High School of the man to whom him has built, to the later Khmer blusher leader Ta Mok. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> "Here everybody loves Ta Mok." </seg>
<seg id="4"> "He was a good leader and he has looked after his people," said Sreng Choosing mA, 42 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Because of his brutality during the Khmer blusher rule famously as the "butcher," the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in the northwest of Cambodia where he has developed hospitals and bridges built, which infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> However, this year, 12 years after the capitulation the Khmer blusher compared with the government, are challenged long-standing followers in Anlong Veng. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In April a local truth and reconciliation forum permitted the public confrontation with the people who have supported once the regime to the victims. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In June the government distributed a school book which tells the history the Khmer blusher for the first time children of former soldiers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And in July a communal tribunal of UN and Cambodia condemned for the first time a former member the Khmer blusher when it condemned the former boss of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known than Duch, to 35 years of prison. </seg>
<seg id="10"> With each of these developments the fear grew under the Khmer blusher ex-servicemen Alnlong Vengs, complicated her efforts towards reconciliation and Reintegration in the society of Cambodia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "There is still refusal and fear in the former Khmer blusher, but they deal no power, something," said Chhang Youk, leader of the documentation centre of Cambodia, an independent organisation which investigates the regime. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "For them the life was glorious under the Khmer blusher, but the regime has become a symbol of the bad person." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "It splits itself families." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> While the Khmer blusher rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, were executed approximate 1.7 million people or they died of illnesses, reworking or before hunger. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When the Vietnamese occurred and overthrew in 1979 Pol Pot-Ied government, the Überbleibsel of the regime and his military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Here they spread till December, 1998 when the last movement capitulated, restlessness. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war of her base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta pulled up Mok the next generation in Anlong Veng. </seg>
<seg id="18"> But in the middle of the 1990s when a peace agreement promoted by UN led in 1993 to the first democratic elections of the country big groups of Khmer began blusher to fighters to overrun to the government what led to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Pol Pot died in 1998 a natural death, and Ta Mok which had not given way was arrested in 1999 by government forces with the Dangrek Mountains. </seg>
<seg id="20"> He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh where he waited for his process. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> When her Gönner did not protect them any more longer, fighters fled most former Khmer blusher in the backbreaking poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic recollection. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Even if some elitist official the Khmer blusher kept her local government posts because they laid down her weapons, the easy soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> "These people have profited only a little from the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the centre for justice and reconciliation which holds in completely Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng, public forums </seg>
<seg id="24"> "Sie sind verankert in die utopische Agrarideologie des Regimes." </seg>
<seg id="25"> "You grew up without any occupational knowledge." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Sor Lim, 55 years which had joined in 1974 as a teenager the Rhmer blusher fought in the jungle for concerning Veng, before he sat down in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> "The life under the Khmer blusher felt well," he said. </seg>
<seg id="28"> "Ta Mok has to eat to everybody something given." </seg>
<seg id="29"> "But now the life is difficult because we must look after ourselves." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The running Khmer blusher tribunal has also roused here worries. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In the beginning of the next year the court will try to put blusher minister, Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his woman as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer in court. </seg>
<seg id="32"> It is the order of the court, the old leaders and those who are responsible primarily for the atrocities for condemning, but it is not said whether it pursues other actions after these four cases. </seg>
<seg id="33"> This has served a little to reduce the fears in Anlong Veng. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Topical media speculations have concentrated on in the Chaem, 64 years, which had been a blusher rule in the late 1970s years district boss in the province of Manteay Meanchey during the Khmer. </seg>
<seg id="35"> In 2007 she had told representatives of the documentation centre about Cambodia, she has escorted the construction of the Trapeang Thma of dam, a project with which thousands of forced laborers presumably died. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> In a hot evening came back in the Chaem of the work on the fields to her timber house in a dirty street outside from Anlong Veng. </seg>
<seg id="37"> As the sun long shades on the withered grass threw it refused in the Chaem to discuss blusher her past with the Khmer. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Should the court summon them, it would to go for herself deny, she said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> "Cambodia lives in peace and in stability," she said. </seg>
<seg id="40"> "If there was no more pursuit, would be here war." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> Moreover, prime minister Hun the sen which has fled in 1878 from the Khmer blusher has warned repeatedly about the fact that the situation became unsafe, the court would accuse more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> "Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> But the confrontation with the past is that what must do Cambodia to be able to advance, said Chhang Youk of the documentation centre. </seg>
<seg id="44"> "Reconciliation with the Khmer times meant Gather of the broken pieces," he said. </seg>
<seg id="45"> "It is our duty to compose these broken parts, so that can understand like everything." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> The centre created the first school book approved by the government about the Khmer blusher, the 75-sided "history of democratic Cambodia." </seg>
<seg id="47"> It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the history book for the High School of the ministry of education which contains blusher less than four sides about the Khmer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> How often in Cambodia the young people know blusher, in spite of the connections of the town with the regime in Anlong Veng only a little about the Khmer. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Air Valeak, 19 years, a student in the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps the students to understand an important part of her history. </seg>
<seg id="50"> But his parents reacted doubtfully when he brought the book with home to read it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> "My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said. </seg>
<seg id="52"> "You are distrustful because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> Such an opposition brings the reconciliation action complicated and complex, said Sok Leang. </seg>
<seg id="54"> But the public forums, the school book and the court attain bit by bit influence," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> The Khmer still owns blusher here a powerful attraction. </seg>
<seg id="56"> On top in the Dangrek to mountains one of shrubs overgrown and with plastic garbage muddy way leads to a rectangle of black soot, covers with a rusty metal roof. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Pol Pot's body had been burnt here after his death in 1998 on a tyre heap. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a mobile phone shop assistant in the street edge, said, she does not know a lot about the man who had been burnt here. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> "But he has a strong mind and here many people go to him to pray," she said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> It was Nuom Sotheas a birthday and later on the day it wanted to go to the Pol Pot's last place of rest where she will file a bush of ripe bananas - in hope that he brings her luck. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Byelorussia agrees not to collect further weapons-grade uranium </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In an astonishing victory for president Obama Kampagne for the worldwide protection of nuclear material the government of Byelorussia has announced on Wednesday that one will not collect any more longer highly fortified uranium which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The deal was announced in a common statement after a meeting of the foreign minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belorussian foreign minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the security summit. </seg>
<seg id="4"> For years the US government had tried to persuade Byelorussia, not to collect highly fortified uranium any more and seemed to have reached the last spring a hurdle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> However, official of the US government told Washington Post that during the past two months two secret treaties by Byelorussia were met to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belorussian research institution. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This prepared the stage for the arrangement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous on account of the sensitivity of the subject, about 500 pounds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obamas "to nuclear security summit of 47 nations" from April, Byelorussia had excluded. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And it felt well enough obviously to protect the invitation of the former Soviet republic for the next summit in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I was really enthusiastically from the fact that they want a seat in the nuclear security summit (from 2012)." </seg>
<seg id="10"> "This proves to me that it functions," said Ken Luongo, president of the partnership of global security, a group for the support of the nuclear security. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" from Byelorussia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Obama promised in April, 2009 in Prague to protect all precarious nuclear material within four years. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since then the US government has helped six countries to get rid of her highly fortified uranium. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Byelorussia will be the seventh one. </seg>
<seg id="15"> It did one dozen countries under the government of George W. Bush. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At the moment from Obamas to nuclear security summit the Belorussian president Alexander Lukashenko has explained that give never up the nation her uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "As kept highly fortified uranium - hundreds of kilos what is basically weapons-grade, and at that time less fortified uranium," said Lukashenko. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "This is our raw material... We will make from it no dirty bombs and we will sell it to nobody." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We use it exclusively for research purposes, this is everything." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Byelorussia still approached few months ago to the USA when it indicated interest in the meeting of an agreement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The first approach, the uranium of Byelorussia in October to remove, was particularly complicated because the material was easily contaminated with radioaktivity, say official. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It was loaded in a special train, more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say official. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The second approach was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the official by airplane. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The US government pays 14$ of millions for these efforts and a large part of the money flows into the Belorussian research with weakly fortified uranium which cannot be used for nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "This was co-ordinated extremely carefully and tuned to build up trust" which led to the agreement which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the energy ministry which works on the global danger reduction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> James Martin Zentrum for Nichtweiterzugebende studies estimates that Byelorussia had at least 88 pounds of waffenfähhigen uranium as well as hundreds of pound in highly fortified uranium this year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Byelorussia wants to dissolve his camp till 2012 according to the common agreement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> For years the relations between Byelorussia and the USA were tightened, primarily, because of Lukashenkos harsh disregard of the human rights. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approach. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> "The progress of these global security questions greeting, announce the United States of America and Byelorussia that a raised respect for the democracy and the human rights remains a central subject in the improvement of the bilateral relations in Byelorussia and it is essential for the progress of the country and his citizens" she explains. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="8"> Also the former foreign minister, Miguel Á ngel Moratinos, pointed out the ambassador to the fact that the Spanish government "wants to give to this matter no big attention, although the government has only little influence, because these would lie in the hands of the judges." </seg>

<seg id="12"> "This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our strains to the discreet use between governments," deplores Aguirre. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="13"> With a lunch in March, 2007 in which the ambassador of the USA and the Spanish Minister of the Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba took part latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are anxious incredibly strongly of her independence and did this what they hold for adequate," he has given to his employees instructions "to avoid conceitedly rhetorical comments to let abate the tension." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The ambassador also expressed his concern about the approach of the PP in this matter. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "In spite of her generally proamerican position our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from a tip that the government of Zapateros actions of the USA which could be laid out as possible human rights abuses, have tolerated or have ignored deliberately capital will hit, even if these exposures could affect negatively the government of the USA," he emphasises. </seg>

<seg id="2"> With the results from the 28th of November a determining role could play the PP in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> After the important voice increase and delegated increase by the last regional elections directs the PP her look already upon the parliamentary elections - early or not. Their expectations are more than positively, because the voice number which achieves this party by these elections is ordinarily twice as high than by the elections in Catalonia. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Thus the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 voices at the parliamentary elections from 2008, while this figure amounted to only 316.222 by the regional elections in 2006. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the last Sunday the PPC 384.091 achieved voices. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> If this climbing up trend - result of the diversion of the percentage of votes of the PSC and the connection of the electorate of the PP - should stop, forecast the analysts of the PP that at the parliamentary elections the PPC of from 8 to 12 congressmen could climb up, while also CiU four (they has now 10) dazugewinnen and the PSC at least 9 representatives (from 25) would lose. </seg>
<seg id="7"> These calculations book the basic meaning of Catalonia for PP and PSOE. </seg>
<seg id="8"> According to the analysis of the People's Party would lose the ERC a representative - currently she has three - while ICV hold her representative or dazugewinnen would be able. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Should the electoral calendar be maintained, nevertheless, the next appointment with the local elections falls in May, 2011. Also the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue in the scales to put an end to the socialist supremacy, namely in four provincial centres and with her majority in the town council of Barcelona, one of the city administrations with the biggest household: 661 million euros for 2011. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The nationalists as well as the People's Party agree in the fact that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona in which the socialists can achieve neither a majority, nor fall back on her traditional allies (ERC and ICV). </seg>
<seg id="11"> After the republican debacle it is not wrong that this party will lose her representation in the district council of Barcelona in which she would have to achieve 5% of the voices. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> However, the PP registered an increase of her percentage of votes in four provincial centres and could become the determining strength in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The nationalists are persuaded to be able to play the leading role in Tarragonas change. There they had ruled before the present mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP. </seg>
<seg id="14"> En Lérida lies the PP only 500 voices behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Also in other important places, as for example in Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus the People's Party could register an important increase. </seg>

<seg id="4"> The Spanish Minister of the Interior assigns to these investigations a great importance which goes so far that he assures, with "Operation Kampai" the forgery apparatus Al Qaidas has been "weakened" worldwide and "therefore their legal capacity." </seg>
<seg id="5"> The researchers assume from the fact that during two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia thousands of passports to Thailand were sent where these were sent phoney and afterwards to the groups of which the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda consists, so that their "fighters" could cross unpunishedly the borders of European and other western countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The uncovered cell is not the only one of the dschihadistischen net which was active in Europe. Therefore, other European sheriff's departments have helped except the Thai investigation organs also in the investigations. It is not to be excluded that it will come in the area of the EU during the next days to similar attempts like that which was explained on the last Tuesday in Barcelona. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="7"> In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) an other one with which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar flounder and Zeeshan Ehsan flounder as well as the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested was carried out in Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="8"> They had escorted from Bangkok in Spain and other European countries lowered cell. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The Catalan net - a part of it had been ruined in 2009 - stole in particular from tourists passports according to the default of the so-called "international Islamic front." </seg>
<seg id="10"> This means that the documents on the name of men had to be issued at the age of from 25 to 45 years and be valid still several years; they might show no visa stamps. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In investigation circles it is underlined that till present no connections between in Catalonia could be proved to arrested and the attempt in Bombay, although the author of this attempt, "Laschkar e-Taiba" was, one of the receiver's groups in Spain stolen and as a result in Thailand to phoney passports. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Nevertheless, it should be reminded of the fact that some days before the attempt from Catalonia by means of a monetary transfer enterprise several thousand dollars had been dispatched which were "invested" in the purchase of Prepaid maps for mobile phones which later from the members of the "command," an end prepared for the life of 106 people, were used. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yesterday the chairperson of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, perceived the opportunity to present her conditions to the support of his assumption of office as a Prime Minister of the Generalitat to Artur Mas personally. These do not differ from already during the election campaign put and can be summarised with the priority of the economic reimpetus and omitting by regionalistischen independence adventures, like a financial adjustment arrangement which the regionalistische leader wants to suggest at the height of his mandate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The chairperson of the Catalan People's Party turned with the security to Artur Mas which you lent 18 representatives whom she had won on the last Sunday - a figure which is more than enough to feel inalienable. Since the candidate of the middle-class regionalistischen party of CiU depends on the fact that at least one of the opposition parties abstains by the vote with his assumption of office of the voice. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The future alliances who want to enter the regionalists at the coming parliamentary elections in the congress depend on a possible entente with the PP. The conversations, the Mas at the moment with the remaining party chiefs carries on, however, turn on Catalonia. </seg>
<seg id="5"> What concerns the party leader of the PPC, she demands that to the support of the assumption of office "all discourses which concern the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as an arrangement about the financial adjustment between state and the autonomous region - like in the Basque Provinces - and which the party chief of CiU wants to subject even to a referendum are done behind. </seg>
<seg id="6"> To both political leaders it is common that they want to make the blown out political apparatus of the regional management more slender and abolish the death tax and gift tax. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The nursing home for the elderly confirms that the deaths are not to be led back on "missing measures" </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The owners of the old people's home in Olot do not exclude that her orderly killed more than eleven older people </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Yesterday the people responsible of the nursing home for the elderly La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference in which they put outside which harm the criminal actions Joan Vila Dilmés - the orderlies who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible during his work - had done to the equipment. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The leader of the nursing home for the elderly, Joan Sala, appeared in company of his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced, "La Caritat would like to accuse the person responsible (for the deaths) ," but "the right and our liability duty make to us the process and the civil law liability" accept. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The equipment must accept not only a social respect loss because she had ascertained the criminal actions of the orderly not on time, but now also pay a high amount of damages which is calculated by the legal representatives of the members of the family of the victims. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime decreases to August, 2009 and that he has further murdered since then. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The judge arranged the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home for the elderly - because he supposed that no doctor has examined the deads personally, but the formalities were unwound on account of their age and illnesses by telephone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The leader of La Caritat denied this point flatly and explained that "being missing measures keinerzeit the reason could have been for the incidents." </seg>
<seg id="9"> The lawyer of La Caritat added that there would be no clues for careless actions of another person than the culprit "in the lawsuit." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Already as "a death angel" baptised eleven murders confessed the day before yesterday and explained which commits the first crimes 29th of August, 2009 and one and a half months later the second old lady to have murdered. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this case he killed with an overdose insulin, as opposed to the first crime with which he had given a mixture of different tranquilizers. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The leader of La Caritat explained, the access of the staff to the drugs is only difficult to control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The orderly used the insulin injections and the tranquilizer cocktail with six of nine committed crimes to release the patients with the death of her suffering. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But the results of the lab investigations will put outside whether Vila lies and chose for his first victims really a less cruel death or whether he burnt out this from the inside, while he gave them pale lye as he had done it according to confession with three women whom he murdered between the 12th and 17th of October. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> In La Caritat one gives to the statements of the orderly no faith, not even what concerns the number of the confessed murders which could be absolutely more. This setting is justified with the fact that Vila had made very different declarations in court and that it makes no sense to change his approach after eight successful murders suddenly. </seg>
<seg id="16"> They say, they made available them to themselves for this reason and to the clarification of the reach of these incidents of the justice. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Threatening gestures of the European central bank (EZB) </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yesterday the investors reacted sharply to the threat of the EZB president Trichet who warned, "the markets should not underestimate our reactivity." </seg>
<seg id="3"> The risk impacts of the Euro-Peripheriländer have dramatically risen and the shares of the European banks by more than 5%. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Anyhow we had to do the possibility that the EZB can be mistaken and the euro has hardly increased in points what arranges to the worry, do not underestimate. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The events from yesterday are typical for an illiquid market, to such an extent in which he breaks down to himself again recovered, indeed, as a result of the closing short and highly speculative positions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The institutional investor will not still lose long his fear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Today one month ago the European central bank asked us to cancel our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen after which the EZB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably still several time must make in the future, a Rückzieher. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The Central Bank demanded the ending of the plan for the purchase of national debts, because these are ineffective, as well as the abolition of all unusual limited liquidity measures. Only a one-week unlimited access should be maintained. </seg>
<seg id="9"> After the Ireland crisis we expect that the present liquidity measures are extended "at least till March" and the quarterly advertisings with boundless access are maintained at the quarter end to the guarantee of the liquidity till at least June. </seg>
<seg id="10"> We also expect that the programme will be economical for the purchase of bonds continuously and a restorative signal. </seg>
<seg id="11"> If the created expectations are not fulfilled, are thrown back the excellent reaction of the markets from yesterday again and if halstarrig is persisted, to take back our liquidity measures we, only God can help us! </seg>
<seg id="12"> Just as tomorrow with the EZB meeting in May with which the bank confirmed not to consider the purchase of state debt papers and the markets broke down as a result this story could recur. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The EZB it must be plausible and pertinacious. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In May she showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said to have shopped already a lot with which she provoked a new breakdown of the market. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Yesterday the auction of one-year-old state titles was quite weak in Portugal. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The state administration of property spent only 500 millions to 5.28%, compared with 750 millions to 4.81% in the preceding auction. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Nevertheless, the interest rates fell in Portugal about 30 base points in the whole curve and reflected with it a perception change of the markets after the words Trichets. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In Ireland the figures of the debt hole were published by Allied and bank of Irishman's country. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The sum is estimated at about 10,000 millions at short notice and possible other 15,000. There is time till February to procure private capital or these banks are nationalised. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Although Ireland has completely lost his credibility, after it had not recognised the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures are satisfactory within the scope of the rescue plan and help to reduce the uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Indeed, the government on the next Tuesday must receive the parliamentary approval with his new budget. Because she still does not dispose of the sufficient support, Ireland also is furthermore a spring of the uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Angela Merkel has formed her discourse in view of the summit of the heads of state and the government on the 14th of December more mezzo. There political unity is asked to show that we play together them the same score. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Yesterday the Spanish head of the provincial government introduced the measure plan which should be dismissed on Friday by the council of ministers. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions like with the financial institutions, dismantling of the state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job-creating measures. The measures which sound in the ears of the investors like Vivaldis Four seasons. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains, why the Spanish stock exchange has increased about 4.5 percent, twice as much like the rest of the European stock exchanges. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In comparison to February the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and was persuasive, and we profit from the surprise effect. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Today there is a decisive auction of a three-year-old state loan which will derive benefit from the Trichet effect. Therefore, we place on a strong inquiry which will remove all doubts about our conversion of debts ability. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> For Spain the application of an auxiliary plan would be a self-sacrifice. </seg>
<seg id="30"> We would receive liquidity which we do not need. The Treasury has at disposal 40 milliard euros, three spots so much like in March. The interest rates are exceedingly expensive and the access to the markets would be closed without notice. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to the motto of Caesar woman: "Now not only the being, but also the light counts." </seg>
<seg id="32"> We create only courage, this! </seg>

<seg id="3"> David Á lvarez, founder of the Unternehmensgurppe, will contest the companion's meeting of El Enebro which will take place at the request of five of his seven children in 16., because he holds them for "absolutely trifling." His children will try to receive a majority to control the administrative organs of the company - owner of the vineyard Bodegas Vega Sicilia-. </seg>

<seg id="10"> This argumentation is the basis for the challenge of the meeting afterwards to explain them as "absolutely trifling." </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The carriages are improved with software on a real-time basis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Since Red Bull penetrated in 2004 into the world of the formula 1, her history is marked in this select universe of the speed by surprises and results. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the beginning nobody gave to the novice attention and in spite of his precipitously climbing up development during the last seasons everybody placed with the final spurt in the last November on the victory of Ferrari of Fernando Alonso. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Without wanting to lower the abilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the achievement strength of the engine of Renault, is the "secret weapon" which the multinational Siemens Red Bull laid in the hands, and with it a winner's team created, become to the legend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In reality concerns highly competitive software for the simulation of processes which put on the market the German enterprise in 2007 for the purposes which do not deal with car racing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This as a PLM called informatics programme was used for the development by assembly chains in factories in the whole world, energy works and highly exact instruments. </seg>
<seg id="8"> A faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is aimed, before this is really built to avoid thus mistake and superfluous costs. </seg>
<seg id="9"> PLM has made easier the development of the cameras of Canon, the airplanes of Sukhoi and the most famous utility vehicles of Nissan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Siegfried Russwurm, leader of the industrial department of Siemens, explains that with the application of this software in the formula 1 - factory of Red Bull can sketch the changes and improvements which are ascertained on the runnings and with the tests "in few hours, almost on a real-time basis" explain and. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Soot worm explains that in 1992 in the racing stables on an average ten engineers worked who could introduce at most three or four improvements in a season. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Today in Red Bulls team 180 highly qualified young people are occupied. With highly competitive EDP arrangements they carry out analyses and all possible changes in the racer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The Siemens manager explained, the PLM software is able to analyse all components of the racers of Red Bull and to improve, with the exception of the engine for which explains itself excluding Renault responsibly. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the security elements are changed. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The changes can be transferred thanks to advanced production plants and high-tech autoclaves within less than 24 hours by the virtual reality of the simulator in the reality. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The only limit which is set to this mad technical perfectionism, are the 40 million dollars which a formula 1 - team may spend on his races in a season. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Red Bull has built up his high-tech factory for the development and production of his racers in a 50 kilometres of London distant place. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It concerns two buildings in which visits - are strongly limited particularly by journalists-. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Everything what happens there is a top Secret. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The staff encloses 580 people, including two pilots, which world champion Vettel and Mark Webber. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But Red Bulls of true formula 1 - hero is without doubt the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Behind the huge technological resources which the Energy drink manufacturer puts in the services of his participation on the racing distances, other protagonists whose support is incalculably and their fame like zero are hidden. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The Technologichef of the work, Steve Nevey, stresses that one could still say five years ago that the progress contributed in the area F&E for racer with 50 percent to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Today the portion values have changed. The technology puts out 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent. </seg>
</p>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The managing board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He thinks that in 2001 a hard year is for the banks, a new liquidity crisis rejects first, however, and prophesies the end of the debt war. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Nevertheless, he foresees a burglary of the interest margins which the banks try to compensate with rises of the fees and the prices of advance. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Sabadell expects to catch one millions private customers in three years - a still to be passed field. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Sabadell has found the way to exhaust the coming three years, and to survive thus in a very much complicated economic sphere. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The bank will introduce in 2011 a new 3 annual leading plan. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The aim is not only to survive without taking up the public aid from the FROB but to increase, in addition, the share of the market around millions private customers - 700,000 if one draws off the customers whom the bank will lose-. This is the big challenge before which this bank stands, because till present it has dedicated to her clients more attention than her private customer. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This year she has to do 250,000 private customers and 50,000 enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Their share of the market with private customers lies at 3.5 percent, while the clients put out more than 10 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Another principle of the commercial plan in 2011-2013 is the rise of the productiveness, speak Austerität, cost reduction. She will introduce the challenges to which the bank faces with it together with financial report. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Only few banks dare in these difficult times to fix aims and to publish, because by the financial crisis worldwide all plans of the banks have got mixed up. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Sabadell will conclude her leading plan agreed four years ago optima this year. This was laid out at first for three years, but as a result of the market situation he was extended by a business year. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The customers who are left the savings banks are the principal purpose of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="14"> With a breakfast organised by the APIE stressed Guardiola, in 2011 would become a "difficult" year "with big reach." </seg>
<seg id="15"> The manager goes out from it, Spain would come out only "slowly" of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Moreover, it would be "very difficult" to create work in two or three years "" - basically for the survival of the banks. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Even if he assumes from the fact that the war punishes the interest margins around liabilities - him - will abate, the loadings, the banks and savings banks will have to pay for her issues to the preservation of liquidity, as a balance for dwindling profit margins already on the price of loans shifted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "The subjects Liquidity and Financing are of structural kind and they will exert pressure on the loans." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We have not turned the cock, but the interest differentials are very high," admitted Guardiola. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Banesto spent on Thursday already the arrangement to her branch net to limit the assignment of long-term advances and to raise the interest differentials (cf. Cinco Días from the 22nd and 27th of November). </seg>
<seg id="21"> The manager also admitted, the banks pursued at the moment the Stategie "to raise the fees," indeed, "within a frame stamped by the competition ." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Sabadells leading plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as usual, corporate shops does not exclude. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Not free of charge he assures that in Spain "bigger enterprises are necessary." </seg>
<seg id="24"> "Next year everything will change," he assures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> He stresses that the need rises in capital at the moment "terrifically" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will slip off in red figures. </seg>
<seg id="26"> He is of the opinion, the FROB can substitute with Kaptitalaufstockungen for the money market. </seg>
<seg id="27"> After he assures that Sabadell can also survive a passing closing of the markets, he weakens the argument of some bankers who already prophesy a new liquidity crisis. </seg>
<seg id="28"> He stresses, one can bring nothing in circulation, but as opposed to the incidents in June, one can achieve short-term financing about Repogeschäfte and intercept with it the crisis. </seg>

<seg id="3"> When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not insist on it in the first phase on taking part. They reserved themselves the second round. </seg>
<seg id="4"> However, assured the general manager of the Spanish savings bank association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round would not take place. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "I think that the biggest part of the coalescences is concluded. The inclusion of Cajasol in the group Banca Cívica cannot be looked as the second round, it concerned rather adaptations." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "The biggest part is concluded. It can be that we have instead of siebzehen thirteen or fourteen, but all important processes are already completed. They were controlled by Banco de España who has strongly supported all processes." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> With one of the association of the managers and manager Aragonien (ADEA) organised breakfast Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process "was carried out as fast as possible and that we must be contented with the expiry appropriate for term which in the former times, not now within the scope of which commercial plans with Banco de España were fixed" he stressed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> "The crossing of 45 savings banks with on an average 28,000 million property continuances on 17 with 75 500 millions is a historically incomparable process. The number of the financial institutions was reduced about 62 percent and now they are much bigger what we have fulfilled the Basel agreement" with, he emphasised. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Olavarrieta explained, "there would be a row of undissuaded opinions about the slowness of the process which Unseriösität and Unsinnigkeit" revealed, because "Banco de España admonishes us to conclude in time before end of the year." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Yesterday the general manager of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that Spain has one of the most severe financing systems of Europe and "maybe" the whole world and complemented, that those which would act anzweifeltenn this "without deeper knowledge." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The manager noted that we must come along in the present economic economic situation "no worries" about the situation of the financial institutions and the savings banks who have gone through a "very important" concentration process, that is carried out "as fast as possible." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> He also reminded of the fact that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests which the EZB carried out in July very well. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Zapatero and the red line of Germany </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin has decided on the maintaining of the euro, but at the same time has put up conditions on the whole European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tensions at the markets have released a double answer of the government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adaptation measures, started with tax reductions for small enterprise and micro-enterprise, the regulation of time work enterprise or the abolition of the 426 euros of support for the unemployed people who cover no unemployment benefit, up to the privatisation of 49 percent from AENA, the management of the airports bar nannies and El Prat as well as 30 percent of the state lottery. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, the acting head of the government, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former head of the provincial government Felipe González supports the criticism of the chancellor Angela Merkel as the people responsible whom the present crisis herausbeschwört has. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How are these processes to be understood? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It would be anticipated, the Merkels position no mistake of her public relations is. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it concerns a new round in the difficult process of the new definition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Besides, Germany takes a basically new perspective to the creation of our future which collides with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of a large part of his partners. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In view of the opposition in Europe one begins in Germany more than three possible ways out from the crisis to spekuliern. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the eurospace. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The second: The reintroduction of the German mark - although this sounds at the moment rather to Science Fiction - supported by a large part of the public opinion, approx. 50 percent of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The third: A transformation of the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict housekeeping; the punishment of the countries which the default violates; more possible-wise the payment setting of some countries as well as the expansion of the costs of potential adaptation measures on the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is unequivocal and already stands out since some time. Now, therefore, there are no excuses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First in 2009, as the IWF as well as the European commission to incentive for deficits created and the German government a constitutional reform from the sleeve stretched to prevent this from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This was the first sign for drifting apart between that what held Germany for necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the methods of his European partners, including France. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second sign put the Central European country, as a Merkel the decision to the rescue of Greece painfully pushed out. </seg>
<seg id="18"> At that time this was strongly criticised. But fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public one and the published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally, Merkel comes out during the last October days anew with an unequivocal position. She demands a reform of the agreements of the European Union to allow the rescue of a country and to oblige at the same time the private lenders, to carry a part of the costs. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position was laid out as anti-European, because it sped up the Ireland crisis and all the following. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But her proposal, even if something sweetens, was accepted. During the next months we will participate in the reform of the European Union which should allow these measures from 2013. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has drawn a red line which does not think to cross it. </seg>
<seg id="23"> One says all that - even if now unpopular measures must be taken - there is not the old functionality of the euro from this appointment any more. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In 2013 the year of birth of a new currency space will be in which the counteracting countries are punished hard, can be made explain itself insolvent and in this case the private sector a part of the costs must take over. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows us that we must shape a hard growth course, with high savings rates and investment rates, moderation of the consumption, improvement of the productiveness and competitiveness as well as positive foreign-trade balances. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The other alternative which is based on indebtedness and civil engineering with gigantic holes in the balance of payments, as well as it was stated of Spain in boom times, will be accepted simply not. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would do badly not to understand it. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not only about it, the state deficit up to 2013 on three percent runterzufahren. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much harder. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the worst what we could do under these conditions is to be cheated to ourselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the present turbulence goes over in more rest. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And the fact that we will use the possibilities which are offered us up to the spring, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero has also understood so, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the discussion with the large-scale enterprises on the last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) points out to the fact that in spite of the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis to create order in own house for itself has paved her way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look in such a way that would change in it a little bit. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Under the considered possibilities that is not to be excluded that we would have to leave the eurospace crowded with a little serious countries. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In this case Germany could still say us, it has warned us. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Sport and control avoidance </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tricks like from Alonso and Ramos in the play against the Aiax show invention mind, but not the will to handle a sanction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Putatively from two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) instigated exclusion in the play from the 23rd of November against the Aiax in the Champions League led to the fact that a lot of ink was poured about whether it did not concern an unsporty action or and whether perhaps both players should be sanctioned by UEFA. </seg>
<seg id="4"> How is known in general, both players lost a few minutes before playing (her team had already unambiguously won) time and played several fouls, so that the referee showed them the second yellow map. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this manner, and because of Real Madrid would state his group, both players will fulfil the prescribed sanction with the next league match against the Auxerre and get thus without maps into the next play phase. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Finally, the Disziplinarkommitee of UEFA punished the trainer of the club, José Mourinho, with two plays and the involved players with different amounts of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow map under such or similar circumstances is no new practise, it is to be found rather often in the world of the football. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is spread so far that it is a part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport to obeyed rules-. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of the arisen debate around the shown case decreases to the fact that a team of the football club played Real Madrid (which gives generosity and honour in his hymn and had punished with other opportunities his players for similar incidents), besides, the leading role, and on the dramatisation by Mourinho who has added an episode more to his long history than theatrical and provoking engineer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Anyway the debate turns on whether this behaviour pattern not expressly forbidden by the statutes contradicts the principles of the sport, that is whether these actions show a control avoidance. Really this approach keeps to the statutes of the sport, however, seem to handle his sense. </seg>
<seg id="11"> With this matter the damage caused to the sports mind should be examined. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sports mind defends the physical intactness of the opponents, an aspect which was not endangered by these actions, because it was no aggressive play. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another aspect of a clean play insists in the fact on avoiding that the counteracting players derive an unwarranted benefit from the counterteam. Also this did not happen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradoxes of the action of the players of Real Madrid are that she does not correspond to him what we ordinarily understand by wrong play or control avoidance, because the avoidance of the rule was not carried out secretly to avoid a sanction, but she should be so conspicuously as possible, so that it is punished by the referee. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players waited and accepted the sanction joyfully. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is which kind of advantage the offenders from the deliberate fouls pulled. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Here it should be emphasised that the rival was brought neither in a more unfavorable situation, nor advantages were demanded for the played play, because the evident result of this action was that own team with less players weiterspielen had to go. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is also no useful strategy for the next play, because then the club does not dispose of these players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The advantage consists in the fact obviously that the players begin the next play phase of the Champions League without maps which her participation in a future play could threaten. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it concerns a long-term, up to a certain degree of uncertain advantage, because the team could also retire sometime. Moreover, the players with this approach receive a sanction and go over in the second map cycle in which they retire because of map accumulation with a map less than in the first cycle. </seg>
<seg id="21"> With it it is not so clear whether it really concerns an advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> At last are not directed to such approaches against the sports mind to whom also strategical decisions belong to derive the greatest possible benefit from the regulations. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case the players no sanction wanted to handle (this would really be an unequivocal case of control avoidance), they wanted to choose rather, when they undergo this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They made a strategical decision without making way of a punishment or fleeing before her. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Although the border is blurred between imagination and control surroundings, I think that it concerns with this matter a clear case of imagination. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the polemic has originated as a result of two factors: Because it was about two selfexclusions and because of the kind of the provoked control transference. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The harm which was done to the principles of the sport by these actions is of less ethical than rather aesthetic kind. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The dictatorship of the calendar drops this year an avalanche of reservations for the days 16th and 17th of December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The celebrations paid-up by employees spread out. They do not want to be economical more than 20 to 30 euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery there is during the Christmas period also again the group dinner which bring to the catering industry and leisure trade of Barcelona oxygen. But as a result of the economic crisis they release a prize offensive, around the also customer segment which shows the big mass to catch: Almost everybody would like to be economical between 20 and 30 euros on a midday sen or dinner, confirm the questioned enterprisers and associations. </seg>
<seg id="5"> So that the accountancy becomes still more complicated a little bit, the calendar (New Year's Eve has falls on Friday) all orders the week from the 13th of December drop, with the result of an avalanche of reservations of dinner in two Spitzentager (16. and 17.) and almost no orders in the week before it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Since 2008 when the bad times began many enterprises have put the group dinner for budgetary reasons. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Not to have to renounce this tradition, many employees pay this from her own pocket. </seg>
<seg id="8"> How the economic situation also lies always, it are demanded Niedrigstpreise, confirms the chairperson of the restaurant committee of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Till present the representative of the umbrella organisation ventures not to predict himself as the holidays will look this month. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "The people consider it 'umpteen spots, before they book." </seg>
<seg id="11"> "You would like to go out with pleasure, but they strongly pay attention to the prices," he stresses. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The business will go well with those, offer "the quality for good prices with a good service," he adds, and calls us in the memory that the customers save in crisis periods, which is why prices are strongest asked about 25 euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> By a survey in various centrally situated restaurants turns out that the evening of the 17th of December leads the suppliers to the collapse. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The group Soteras says, the inquiries for this Friday with the intention to be economical less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adapted her menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation situation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> With another leading group, Andilana which maintains 16 restaurants in the town (Hostal de la Rita Market, La Fonda and other), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November. </seg>
<seg id="16"> "We have made the impossible possible to maintain the last year's prices with menus for every taste of 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> With in Grup, the El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 bars leads, one does not lose the optimism, after since the second quarter the income blossoms again and good ones, even if is awaited for few days of concentrated views for the Christmas business. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Springs of the enterprise group emphasise that also 18. a hyperactive day with friend's groups, the Christmas precelebrates, will be. </seg>
<seg id="19"> To six group menus a Christmas menu was added for 30 euros or more than prize hit. One has the impression that the customers are ready to spend 10 percent more than in the year before and as a countermove more details wish, as for example Cava. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Also in some companies one sees green rungs sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. This conveys the impression that group food is again in the impetus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Vonseiten of the umbrella organisation Fecasarm (with unions like the bars association, restaurant association and leisure association of Barcelona), the acting chairperson trusts to see Enric Gomà, on it the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are rather "lively all together, although the customers knock out "a maximum." </seg>

<seg id="5"> On the edge of the clearing and juicy details which offer the documents about the contents of the talks and the way of thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad these reveal that the cooperation is not strengthened between both countries in the matter of atomic security, but on the contrary "decreases," and that the unstable Asian country produces more atomic weapons "to a quicker Rhytmus than every other country." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In particular the characteristic of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that the weapons are not composed, but her individual parts are stored to complicate her destruction - ready Washington sleepless nights in a possible attack. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The ambassadress counts the following risks in Pakistan, Anne W.

<p>
<seg id="2"> Obama appoints a high person responsible for the anti-terrorism fight the prevention of new exposures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Interpol spends a red warning to the pursuit and location of Assange. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Everything what hangs together with Wikileaks and his founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the circumstances can be cleared up only difficultly. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Yesterday Interpol spent a "red warning" for the "location and pursuit" from Assange. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Indeed, besides, it does not concern a traditional arrangement to the arrest. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Moreover, she is not new, she comes from the 20th of November. </seg>
<seg id="8"> She also deals nothing with the last exposure of more than four millions diplomatic documents from the USA, but with the accusations of sexual abuse to which the Australian must position himself in Sweden. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Further assures the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police would know about where and how she can get in touch with Mr. Assange." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Already in 20. the international police authority with headquarter in Lyons (France) at the request of Sweden spent the arrangement, but it was not announced till yesterday on receipt of the competence by the Swedish authorities. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Thus lie the things. 188 Interpol countries depend to identify Assange and to discover "to arrest him provisionally and to deliver." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Although Interpol cannot arrange the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member countries after statements of the organisation look at the red warning as a charter for an Arrestierung - which must be carried out by the national police - in particular if they order of a bilateral delivery agreement how it is the case of Sweden and England where Assange presumably stays. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The action outraged Assanges lawyers who published gesten a letter in which they informed about the fact that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference. </seg>
<seg id="14"> They also remind of the fact that Assange applied for the crossing the border from Sweden and is compared by the state lawyer, with sagenumwobenen Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security boss of Stalin, which received suitable approval. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "This is like a hunt, not like a juridical pursuit," it is accused in the writing. </seg>
<seg id="16"> While the world searches him - and his mother protests the innocence of her son from Australia - Assange stays at an unknown place, indeed, not in silence. </seg>
<seg id="17"> On Monday he gave to the leader of the magazine Time by Skype of an uncertain place from an interview. In the conversation he applied for the resignation of the Assistant Secretary of the USA, Hillary Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "If can be proved that she was responsible for the arrangement of North American diplomats, to spy out UN and with it has offended against international agreements signed by the USA, she would have to withdraw," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Yesterday his opinion was condemned by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the application for resignation as "ridiculously and absurdly." </seg>
<seg id="20"> "I am not sure, why we should think highly of the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the transmitter CNN. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Obama itself has instructed a high person responsible for the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, with the prevention of new document exposures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The attempt of the speaker of the Präsidenden Barack Obama to give Assange less attention stands in contrast to the opinions which conservative politicians and annotators announce during these days. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The congressman Peter King who will be in the chair in the national Sicherheitskommitee of the chamber of deputies from January has asked the state department to examine the possibility, to place Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organisations "to confiscate their money and everybody which supports them or a contribution performs to pursue." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Tom Flanagan, adviser of the Canadian president Stephen Harper, had still gone on, and he had to revoke his statement, Assange must "be murdered." </seg>
<seg id="25"> "Obama would have to transform him into a target and use a not manned airplane or something like that." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Who did not apologise, was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "Who was it also always which allowed to trickle through in the government information, he is guilty of the betrayal and everything is what no execution, is eiine too mild punishment," he explained to the transmitter fox terrier. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Huguet suggests a more pluralistic government and the end of the plenary assembly principle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a prescription to go to the 0th time of an internal turmoil in the rows after the loss of 11 representatives and half of the votes for aimless ERC from the way. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The party leader is aware that his resignation threat is not sufficient for the being close of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that today the influence of this sector is so weakened as will not give her mentor and to him the same brainwork, how other former currents. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Therefore, the leader of Esquerra with a winking tries to win the new critics what would protect his position up to the next local elections. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Yesterday for the beginning told in that to more than 200 regional councillors of ERC could express themselves on his remaining in the office secretly. </seg>
<seg id="8"> With electoral slips of paper, not with high hand. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If the Carodisten to the Präsidenen wanted to miss a ticket, they could do this without having to fear repressive measures. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Really the boss would like to avoid the impression of splitting as well as from submission under his person. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He confirmed in several interviews, he would feel not confirmed with half of the voices plus, and he added without information of percent values, a result "in the Bulgarian style" would also not feel well. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Carod being close demand of the president more, than to make available his office only to the party. An insufficient gesture, because Puigcercós controls the uppermost organ of the congresses. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But because they do not dispose of a sufficient majority to the forcing of resignations, they will agree with the board of directors on an action plan from now till May. </seg>
<seg id="14"> For it they expect, in the elaboration of the document about strategical reorientation that the management in 18. will present to the advice for the vote to be able to help. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Their intention is to vouch for Puigcercós. As a countermove this should promise to bring forward the congress the autumn, 2011 what holds the party leadership already for a fact. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The party leader of the ERC is of the view, the "Polyphonie" a pity of the stability and he aims one for all spot at bringing the organisation in the situation, at washing her dirty laundry behind closed doors. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In this sense the article which the acting Conseller Josep Huguet signed in his Blog is symptomatically. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In view of that, the Puigcercós an ideologist is, the owner of Innovació held it for a fact that the party leader is supported "in the exchange against different aims." </seg>
<seg id="19"> He enumerated five from which two are in the foreground. </seg>
<seg id="20"> First, the "restructuring" of the board of directors, so that of these at least 90 percent of the party members represents that the inclusion of new faces from Carods is called sphere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The second could be the big news. </seg>

<seg id="2"> "If you are for the discharge of the Dream Act - law, call your senators and press for the discharge of this law," twitterte the president of the United States in the popular social net. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Today the president Barack Obama supported the national mobilisation to the support of the Dream Act - law of the legalisation of undocumented students with news on his personal Blog in the social net Twitter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "If you are for the discharge of the Dream Act - law, call your senators and press for the discharge of this law," twitterte Obama. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> His short communication contains a Cyberlink to a more extensive document which asks the public to step unterzüglich with her senators in contact, because the vote of the law approaches immediately. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "With your voice for which we wait the time has come to listen to you," he stresses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The news was spread, after 42 republican senators threatened to block all voice for every law, except the expansion of the tax reductions from the times of Bush and the financing of the government would be expanded. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Such a blockade which was announced on a letter signed by 42 republican senators could affect the vote of the Dream Act - law and other projects like the ratification of the new start agreement with Russia against the spreading of nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> About the blockade of the Republicans of the law Dream Act and other projects questioned, said the presidency speaker Robert Gibbs, he trusts in the fact that if once the tax subject is solved a schedule can be put up for the remaining projects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> "I believe, we still have a lot of time..." </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Everybody we agree in the fact that the tax matter must be unwound before end of the year..." </seg>
<seg id="12"> "I think that we can meet about that any time an arrangement and then we can plan the expiry of the rest," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The chairperson of the democratic majority in the senate, Harry Reid, told on Tuesday in, "he would apply for the vote with end of the debate," so that the Dream Act - the law with which the initiative for the legalisation of undocumented students can be tuned from the next Thursday in the senate although the next week would be more likely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The version of the Dream Act - law or the law of the American dream would become about 800,000 young people who immigrated in the United States when they were still sixteen years old none, while to the last five years have lived in this country and into a higher educational institution or with the army are enrolled, legalise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> But the advocates of the law need for the discharge of the initiative sixty voices, which is why they depend on the voices of a handful of Republicans. At the moment the organisations of the advocates of this project organise an intensive influencing control on the discharge of the law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The democrats from whom support the majority the Dream Act order more than 58 seats. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Indeed, said one of them who would be right senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, he against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, has announced his support of the law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Acts must get several Republicans on her side, if other democrats should decide to turn the back towards the initiative. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> To the mostly sought-after Republicans belong from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the senator George Lemieux from Florida who took over the mandate of the senator Mel Martínez. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they declared not to support it with another opportunity any more. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Another Republican who had expressed himself for the law John McCain, has not fixed his position up to now yet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Although the House of Representatives has another version, the analysts agree in the fact which stands the Dream Act in the senate before the biggest obstacles. </seg>

<seg id="1"> With literature lay the finger in the wound </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The second round of the 'desire in the language' was a walk with which the participants made themselves for the story strong </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> "With the sex into language I understand, yes, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected from me?," asked the author Luisa Valenzuela who should open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle which celebrated the Spanish-speaking literature and used with this opportunity the subtitle of her question (on another event was dedicated the round table to the sex into language, she explained). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The finger in the wound... "brings us in difficulties," spitted the Argentine written steles sweetly to the audience which consisted primarily of young people who gathered on the international book fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to be present at this round table presented by Marisol Shultz, in the Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero took part. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Luisa Valenzuela read out a text which she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and marked the Shultz afterwards as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is to be found out on the search what is a "wound," and from doctor to doctor goes from which she receives though no answer, but tips for the guide of her story. </seg>
<seg id="6"> She leaves the Infektologen persuaded: "Patience is not my strength, is maybe my wound." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In the end, after a frustrating approach to the Traumatologen which robbed of the breath her in the middle on the way, and to which you explain, however, that wound is no scientific concept, enthült of the psychoanalysts the secret: "the wound is the really open, the symbolism is the scar." </seg>
<seg id="8"> The central figure of the story sighs made easier and closes which she only found out "from the wound that this is really open and does not exist." But she is persuaded that the desire in the language and their traps mix. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Valenzuela, the author, played with both. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also introduced a delightful story which he called 'praise of the invention' and in which the finger does not mention in the wound though, but is discovered. </seg>
<seg id="11"> With allusions to the magic realism he tells about a famous magician who brought back the clouds touched, widely travelled men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made an about-turn and reported about America, the big novel which did not lack from the outset his own chroniclers, and he cited Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticises the abundance of the stories told about the conquering. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "Cervantes which invited everybody (the authors to us) mocked feigned witnesses who appeared in as true shown stories, but in other manner the history would never have been told America - with the imagination which got lost even the sense of shame." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Indeed, he emphasises, "these are the lunatics and liars who fancy the things best of all," and there reality and lie approach to each other where one does not know any more to which side the story belongs where the fictive literature reaches the summit. </seg>
<seg id="14"> He calls really the 'tradition Cervantes'. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "We have inherited from him to be this what is told." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As a Mayra Montero in the row was, commented and praised the author on the variety of the interpretations to which the invitation of the FIl for the round table 'of The fingers in the wound' had contributed. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The Cuban and Puertorikanerin dedicated her contribution of the big wound of the social power which strikes her country - like completely Latin America - as a result of the fights for the drug trafficking. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent not deliberately planned engagement," she explained, after she had emphasised that literature is a communication and obligation which are based between the author and the readers like with a "chemical reaction." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The Spanish writer Lui García Montero, contribution decided the evening also "this finger of the engaged author in the wound of the author" hevorhob. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> He noted that in a fast-moving world also the intellectual habits and the control of the consciousness run out to dogmatisms, and will forget, "that behind every confirmation a small no stands and behind every denial small Yes." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> "To be our thought and the reality in the possession, we must nuance: And nuancing often indicates to lay the finger in the wound and to bother those which feel much finer if they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in precast ideas without nuances and also of bothering the powerful figures who prefer to divide the world into black and white he noted and loaded in addition the sense to rediscover of the writing. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he played determining plays. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Moreover, in the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey with the final two different, from her respective trainers given styles are confronted, and their meeting marked by contrasts is reflected in the results. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had determining plays, and up to now he has kept himself good, which is why this opportunity of quite special importance for him is. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Argentine has himself with the medallion to the second champion hochgespielt, he has stayed behind 1 step behind the winners and surprisingly he has delivered with the same team of successive finals. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The santistische strategist reached the first final as a trainer with the 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when del Morelia had the reins in the hand with which he got to know against Toluca with a big defeat 4-2; later, with the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the determining duel which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010' with whom they played Diablos against lot Rubén had to pocket a setback again, because the play with went out 2-2 against lot Choriceros after 210 play minutes undecided, but with the 11 metre he made progress with 3-1 and got two possibilities to pocket his title, but, in the end, three his players missed eleven steps and the play turned to 4-3. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his big rival. Therefore, he would not like to be pursued once again by the misfortune and escape from the bad magic to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he confirms that for him the most important is the play itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I would like to become a champion, I would like to break no statistics, this is for a club, for my affection to which I dedicate myself, and, therefore, the title will come to me, but what happens before, is the most important," commented the coxswain when one questions him about the lost finals. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The last final has still strongly been remembered to him, has assured he to have learnt a lot from it: "The only apprenticeship which we can pull from it is that to the referee the end does not whistle, we cannot celebrate, we in the line are prepared, the players also, because the last spot we were prepared with two 11 metres already to retire, and I think that this is an apprenticeship, until the play is not finished, there is no occasion for the celebration." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> To know that this series could be decided by penalty shoot-out, does not disturb him, because he trusts his players: "One never wants to come with the penalty shoot-out, one would like to conclude in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is no alternative and one must be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, unfortunately, the destiny prepared for us a bad play, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the violent aspiration to hold the title already in the hands this something left us for this final, and we hope that it will not come this spot in addition." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> There lies in Romanso power not to be the only second champion any more and to cost for the first time the fame which the titles with themselves bring. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="6"> The new procedure has certain advantages for the candidates, count to it: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The total expenses for the winding up of the visa sink, because it is not any more necessarily the appointment arrangement, the treatment of the visa application and the transport services with which the document is handed over to pay apart. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The NASA announces the finding of extraterrestrial life </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The North American space agency called up a press conference, around a finding tomorrow preblocks which will have effects on the search for living being in all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Tomorrow the national aerial authority and space agency (NASA) of the United States announces, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery which could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Tomorrow the finding is introduced at 13.00 o'clock in a press conference in the seat of the NASA in Washington by experts of the astrobiology. Besides, it concerns a science which examines the origin, the development, the distribution and the future of life in the universe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> By conscription of the press conference assured the NASA, she will introduce "a supervision-exciting finding for the search for extraterrestrial life" what released speculations with experts of other countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The discovery could prove the theory that it can exist in the hostile surroundings which one held up to now for unbwohnbar manlike creatures. The hypothesis was thrown up that these could change into intelligent living beings - as well as people - if her living conditions improved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Apparently it concerns a microbe which was found on the basis of the Mono brine in the Yosemite-national park, California. She lives there in surroundings which were held for too toxic for all conceivable life forms, because the lake is very arsenic-containing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Somehow the arsenic uses the Mikrobie as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability increase the chances that there could be similar life on other planet which do not dispose of our protecting atmosphere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> If these organisms the arsenic verstoffwechseln, is proved according to the astrobiologists that "there is actual another life form, the second life form which differs from to us of the known ones." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Tomorrow the space agency announces, on Thursday, in the press conference the actual reach of her finding. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the conference take part the geobiologist Pamela Conrad who examines the possibility of life on Mars, and which studies biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, the titanium (the biggest moon of Saturn) under the question whether his chemical composition resembles that of the earth. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Robert Dutil, minister of the public security, states, this idea does not come from yesterday: Quebec would already have consulted the last January the New York Department of Investigation with regard to this subject. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The metropolis disposes since 1870 of a standing unity against the corruption. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Still, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than only one. </seg>
<seg id="6"> One must say to the fact that this measure on the occasion of the meeting of the constant committee of the Quebecer police service was discussed on the 29th of October of the last year in spite of the presence Robert Dutils not in the slightest. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="13"> "To be able to form the only means, a committee of inquiry, is the resignation of Jean Charest," Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and politics systems explained on his part in the ENA (staatl. College to the education of high administrative officials). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> To come out of this dead end, he suggests to Quebec putting away a special mandate for the finance check control, so that this can make suitable inquiries about corruption and confidential arrangements. </seg>

<p>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The Quebecer broadcasting company presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered before the Canadian supervisory board for broadcasting company norms (CCNR) because of his controversial statements of social care and Haitian just as because of his abusive manner of speech on radio a partial setback. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The CCNR represents the opinion, M. Though Dupont and his 98,1-FM team CHOI would have the right on own expression of opinion, indeed, certain statements would have contained "inexact information about the social care and unjustified negative representations of the Haitians as well as also a so coarse manner of speech which is not measured for the broadcastings emitted during the day." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The supervisory board had also final-concluded that have committed a discussion about the suicide which contains the spreading of the names of two people the suicide, offends against the code of the broadcasting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The CCNR had received several discomfort concerning during in the period from 2008 and 2010 to emitted broadcastings to made comments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The first possession was inserted as a result of a complaint of "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec." </seg>
<seg id="7"> The activist's organisation had complained that the amounts called in the broadcasting are inexact. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The presenters should give rather solidly as delusive information. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Concerning the subject Suicide presenter Stéphane Dupont had represented the opinion, the suicide is an expression of cowardice. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="11"> "The majority of the supervisory board considers that the standing results of the broadcasting "Dupont le midi" would have broached a sensitive subject in suitable way appropriate for family." </seg>
<seg id="12"> Hence, he was booked with no reprimand towards his person. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The last contentious issue concerned the statements which had referred to the earthquake in Haiti. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a media-oriented quarrel conversation to themselves concerning this that an amount from reactions has caused. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The CHOI presenter had declared not to have made a donation in favour of the Haiti help, because one would know not with certainty whether the destitute also received really the cash donations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The supervisory board is of the opinion that these comments have not been of abusive character that, nevertheless, her cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "I have already atoned for my 3-day suspension punishment in this thing." </seg>

<seg id="1"> 450 millions in contracts without advertising </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hydro québec has granted in mutual agreement project planning companies 450 Millions dollars in contracts for the water power project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts stands a syndicate, consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe N.M. and Axor which has received the most important portion, namely those of the project management, to a sum from 295 million dollars without advertising. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This syndicate, called "Énergie gérance," was formed in 2004 as a concomitant of the decision by Hydro québec, the private sector her responsibilit, this important, hydroelektrische project by height of a sum of 5 milliard dollars to überantworten. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the beginning of 2005 the syndicate "Énergie gérance" got hold of the lucrative contract, without there would have been a public advertising. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For the Parti Québécois falling back on enterprise syndicates poses a serious ethical problem which brings on the risk of the Wettbewerbsverdrändung as well as a prize increase. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "This is a new way of a snare and weakens the competition." </seg>
<seg id="8"> "This means that one carries out instead of snares instead of in confidential way now in open form," yesterday explained Sylvain Simard, representative of the PQ, in the press conference. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the early morning Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems to him difficult to understand how the interest of the public can be served in this way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Resource minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon to it, while she denied vehemently that it would have concerned with this contract a snare. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "I remain loyal to my line," railed them, while it encouraged, the PQ has gone forward "dishonestly" and "she lacks hardness." </seg>
<seg id="12"> She said, it "is the least" that the PQ apologise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The model of the syndicate is worldwide a current practise. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It usually concerns a chronologically so limited alliance which allows to two or several enterprises to bundle up her expert's assessments concerning an order on an advertising for a complicated project. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The project "Eastmain" shows a high complexity level with regard to his working magnitude. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The construction method is going and should be put up till 2012. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Anyhow the contract was awarded, without a competition had been able to take place; there had already been negotiations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Besides, the model of the syndicate in Quebec even with relatively easy projects shows by no means more an exception. </seg>
<seg id="19"> How the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted the last week, applied model of the syndicate is in the area of the structural engineer and consultation being an object of government inquiries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Short flying of the Quebecer enterprise register allows to name more than 200 syndicates from which some of continual duration seem to be. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In this way, for example, the company Dessau works together in partnership with the majority of her nuclear competitors to whom CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult count. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Any linking, and of it returns it to several dozens, introduces on and the same legal entity, namely on Dessau. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> What concerns the syndicate "Énergie gérance," minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territory of the Baie James of a special manpower dynamism is subjected and that Hydro québec gives to this fact since the 70s in special way calculation." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Réal Laporte, the big employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a declaration which has the nose about the fact rümpfen leave that the contract about the project management was granted after arrangement. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "If you an advertising makes and gives it only few applicants, upwards your prices will shoot up." </seg>
<seg id="26"> "You have two possibilities: either you take the people who are on this Mart and says you: one will negotiate an adequate arrangement for a good price." </seg>
<seg id="27"> "Nevertheless, the thought is that not the price is vital, but the expertise of the people," sanctioned Laporte. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> This contract allowed to the syndicate "Énergie gérance" is a part of a long list of contracts about more than 50,000 dollars preserved by the Parti Québécois. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The contracts were approved either by Hydro québec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> After examination the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineer and adviser contracts, the companies or their branches, under it in particular resource labs, between 2002 and March, 2010 were granted. </seg>
<seg id="31"> SNC-Lavalin had heaped 22 contracts in itself, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without counting, on this occasion, their participation in "Énergie gérance." </seg>
<seg id="32"> All these contracts have been negotiated. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They amount in Whole to 449.783.344$, in it enclosed the contract with "Énergie gérance" more than 295.131.564$. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Sylvain Simard left that four companies who form the syndicate (BPR are Dessau, Groupe N.M. and Axor) of the "Parti libéral you québec well-known." </seg>
<seg id="35"> Minister Normandeau left, the PQ would be equally connected with the companies whom they "financed," before she specified that it concerns rather their executives. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Barometre to verantworungsbewußten consumptions - The "green" label does not inspire confidence </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Green, but point-blank doubtfully. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The Quebecer consumer has little confidence in the main actors of the lasting growth, however, just as little to the marked brands or the ecological markings which should steer his choice. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is a pity, although it has a bath in a media-oriented universe where it is swarming with information in favour of a more responsible consumption only so: the barometre to responsible consumptions has to deplore a lack of plausible information, an inadequacy which marks itself as a brake of his engagement, as the first reading pointed which was held yesterday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Although they have sped up the consumption of the so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the Quebecer still seem to those which try to sell this to give little loan. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Two thirds of the Quebecer population admits giving, indeed, to the environmental engagement of the companies to just as little faith like the green enterprise advertisement, ingenious measuring instrument betrays from the responsible consumer centre of the university of Sherbrooke. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Another findings: half of the consumers doubts the trustworthiness of the official, to the putatively fair products to added certificates, but also the credibility of the products and brands which declare themselves as environment-conscious, according to the barometre. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the same pattern the discourse of the politicians is taken seriously on this subject of only 14.6% of the Quebecer population. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Anyhow the information concerning responsible consumptions seems importantly to the stimulation of this consumption segment which is animated at the moment by roughly only one third of the Quebecer consumers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Indeed, emptiness and dubious character of the information damped the zeal of 46% of the consumers. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is after the higher price of the products the second brake identified on the part of the barometre. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, there faces one third of the Quebecer of the given efficiency of the green products and services which one tries hard to lay to them to the hand distrustfully. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to another communication had already changed about half of the consumers in 2010 her habits and mainly had changed the brand of one or several products to give expression to her conviction. </seg>
<seg id="14"> According to barometre they had also preferred to 61% of purchases with traders of her town quarter and had favoured the purchase of food tilled in her region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Green and more responsibly - the index of the environment-conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value from 100 this year - the homo consumus of Quebec loves to present himself as a king of the recycling who tries to reduce his tracks hinterlassenen in the environment, while he looks after the protection of animals. </seg>
<seg id="16"> However, the social and ecological consciousness still seems to stop at his car, according to the barometre: just 28% of the Quebecer have bragged, in 2010 have used public means of transportation or the agency for arranged lifts to have preferred to demonstrate her ecological interest. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The Zufußgehen as well as the bicycle driving were also recommended from 39.1% of the participants of this comprehensive behavioral survey which feeds the stereotype images. </seg>

<seg id="1"> State loan for the takeover from eXcentris </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Quebecer government which was asked by the Société to Angus as well as the enterprise of Parallèle to take part financially in the takeover of the film complex eXcentris agrees with a cooperation, however, only in the form of a competitive loan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The developer society Angus as well as the enterprise of Parallèle which had hoped for a donation at the rate of seven million dollars of the Ministry of Education and the Arts for the takeover of Daniel Langlois of belonging film complex eXcentris in the boulevard Saint-Laurent, around this again of his real cinematic function to überantworten, preserved apparently not what they have required. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Though the government has accepted to involve itself in this thing, indeed, to her own conditions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Instead of the expected donation the Quebecer government offers rather a loan in lower than the at first expected height which could bring to life a solution able to exist to advantageous conditions at least according to opinion of the springs entnehmbaren from the state rumour kitchen. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first action plan as well as an inquiry after 12.8 millions have been already rejected the last spring of Quebec, the petition was corrected since once more according to sum down. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Ein Vorschlag zusammen put einem Aktionsplan wurden bereits vom Präsidenten der "Society of development of the cultural firms" (SODEC), François Macerola, year Ministerin St-Pierre gesendet, die die Akte eXcentris leitet. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Several days ago he had her one last material report hand over. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The alternative suggestion of the cabinet was transmitted of the SODEC, nevertheless, on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Now Parallèle and Angus have time up to the 31st of December to answer this. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In any case, the premise of the state donation seems to have been pushed really aside. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> If we call ourselves in recollection that the Quebecer owner's community of the cinemas and film complexes had rebelled against a direct state investment to the support of the takeover from eXcentris, while she brought forward the argument, the minister of education and the arts has to provide no financial assistance to real estate projects there which he also to other film halls does not have hand over. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Nevertheless, several other market participants of the segment sued by contrast for substantial, economic help. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Film boss Daniel Langlois had presented after the own-financed construction of the cinema more than ten years under big difficulties the author's cinema in the rooms of his film complex what could justify the exceptional position on the part of the treasury. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The lack of the film halls which show independent films is in Montreal more than obviously, and eXcentris his clientele knew how to hold with the pole. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The Société Angus as well as the enterprise of Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the head, head for their part for a privately financed Campagne from which they hope for a sum 700,000$ to start the acquisition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Since the spring, 2009 only one single canvas continues showing films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The aim of the future acquirers is to open three film halls on the 27th of February of the next year with the presentation of the very successful film of Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux" anew. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, Christian Yaccarini has not recalled the newspaper "Le Devoir" and has ignored one what he and his group of the down corrected proposals hold which one has made to them. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Secret of complicated-shaken Canada ventilated </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new, American diplomat's pipelines which were spread by WikiLeaks ventilate the secret about what the United Nations judge under the inferiority complex of the Canadians towards the Americans; however, they disclose the sense of superiority last-named towards Canada with the same blow. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Consequently the American diplomats have surprised at the fact that the Canadian voter does not have the Canadian-American relations for the purposes of with the ballot, and they think that the visit of president Obama had helped the conservative government to put through her budget of 2009! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Four new communications between the American message in Ottawa and Washington which were spread yesterday publicly offer even more piquant details than the bare substantial contents at which one has to nibble. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A connection dating from the 22nd of September, 2008, i.e. in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage were located in the full way reports about that from which point the United Nations do not take part any more in the applications discussed by her political bosses. </seg>
<seg id="6"> To the big astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador used in Ottawa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Mr. Wilkin offers different explanation possibilities of this situation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "An inferiority complex nearly being inherent in the Canadians arranges partly possibly the Canadian, political executives a lot rather to speak of internal issues of the everyday life, than leave holding the baby the United States by this choice (how in 1988 with the campaign about the free trade) ," so he describes. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The United Nations, so he concludes, are therefore "proverbial Goliath of this choice: omnipräsent, but to speak potentially too menacingly, in order of him." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The ambassador understands this "ear-deafening silence" the less, because both countries look after intensive political and economic relations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Logically," so he values, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and still even more of a party chief for leading of such an essential respect which the voter has with the urn way as a key factor for the purposes of." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The other expression of this feeling of importance reads in on the 22nd of January, 2009 from Terry Breese, representative in Ottawa, sent communication which president Barack Obama should prepare for his first visit in Ottawa. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Your trip will help to guarantee the continued existence of the government with the vote of confidence about the federal budget at the beginning of February with which Canada will announce his first deficit after more than one decade which has originated on account of a stimulation programme by the height of from 30 to 40 milliard dollars," describes Breese. </seg>
<seg id="14"> He had nowhere mentioned that the government had had to adjourn the parliament meeting before Christmas to prevent that the parliament would be brought down by the coalition and would affect the so conditioned continued existence of the opposition parties the quality of the suggested stimulation programme. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Next from January, 2008 dating and on the part of the ambassador Wilkin written communication informs Washington of the picture becoming more and more negatively that the dramatic series emitted about CBC of the United States spread. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The ambassador is disturbed about broadcastings like Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O in which one can observe a little subtle allusions in Maher Arar, the "No Fly cunning" or also payments for the purpose from by musclemen of the CIA of carried out examinations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Again another communication reports in detail about how Hillary Clinten has asked with her French colleagues Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting for whether Europe is ready to take up certain prisoners from Guantanamo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Mr. Kouchner should have answered the question with, indeed, on the base of an individual "case to case" decision. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Àm end of the meeting, in such a way described, "he has handed over to the state secretary a paper as regards Omar Khadr, to a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin." </seg>
<seg id="20"> "The Assistant Secretary has accepted to look through the act once more." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> If we still mark, finally that the minds get hot concerning the web page WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very closely standing adviser, had explained about CBC that for this massive leakage people responsible should be "killed." </seg>
<seg id="23"> He had reported here on Mike Huckabee from the United States. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Worldwide plan to the renewal of the lighting </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yesterday UN has suggested in Cancun a plan to the renewal of the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in view of the achievement of a reduction of the greenhouse gas (CFC) which corresponds nearly to one third of the additional reduction which must be realised to stabilise the earth climate till 2020. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This ambitious plan takes his position in the step of the concrete large-scale projects which UN hopes to move in Cancun to compensate for the absence of compelling reduction obligations of the industrial countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> After the plan proposed yesterday the main problem would be avoided in the form of 1.8 milliard tonnes (Gt) on account of the lighting on the earth delivered FCKWs if the white-hot pears which show up to now one more monopoly of from 50 to 70% at the market were substituted with fluorescing or better still, by light-emitting diodes (LED). </seg>
<seg id="5"> The lighting is responsible for 8% of the worldwide issues. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This corresponds to a recompense of 70% of the exhaust gases of the worldwide vehicle park. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In Copenhagen the big exhaust gas emitters like the United States, China, Europe and other had themselves the last year under which also Canada counted, obliges to voluntary reduction plans which should screw off the global CFC issues of 53 Gt on 49 Gt. </seg>
<seg id="8"> One would have to depart from this balance, nevertheless, another 5 Gt to stabilise the climate increase about 2 degrees centigrade from today up to 2020 to prevent that this gets out of control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the white-hot pears 95% of the energy escape in the form of warmth, and remaining 5% produce the light. </seg>
<seg id="10"> With the compact illuminant pears the energy consumption decreases about 75%, with the new LED light bulbs one reduces this power demand again around the double. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The compact illuminant pears hold on an average between from 6000 to 10,000 hours. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The new LED light bulbs, as for example those which the manufacturer Philips has put on the market this week - this society has taken part, by the way, in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and use 80% less energy than a white-hot pear what provides an indication of the saving possibilities of the Auswechselungsplanes which should be applied in 100 countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Beside the fact that iese to absolutely new light bulbs deliver only very little warmth they can also function with a variable resistor. </seg>
<seg id="14"> And they contain no mercury. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Several specialists have indicated that compact illuminant pears show reserves, because they contain mercury and that one must decontaminate them so as a hazardous waste what is not always possible in the developing countries, except the producers make available a counter. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The main spring in mercury issues on the planet shows according to the report, nevertheless, not the compact illuminant pear, but rather the coal-fired power stations which expel substantially more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white-hot pears. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Only in the United States these coal-fired power stations expel 25,000 tonnes of mercury yearly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The report demonstrates in detail the profits which every country would gain thanks to this international programme. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Indonesia would save, so for example, one milliard dollars yearly by the buying of electricity and eight million tonnes CO2, this means a recompense of 3.5 coal-fired power stations whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 milliards. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée palace exaggerates his mediator's function for Syria </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Within more than six months, from July, 2009 to May, 2010, held the destiny of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was held on in Iran because of "spying," the diplomacy moved the French public in breath, on the alert and accented the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Teheran. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This everything under the attentive looks of the diplomats of the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> From WikiLeaks preserved and from the newspaper "Le Monde" Looked through American documents some backgrounds of this crisis reveal. </seg>
<seg id="5"> They describe how the Elysée had explained to the Americans his strategy who went so far of giving this advice to the contact with her own crisis of "taking of hostages" in Iran (a small group of travellers). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> They indicate as the French people responsible have tried to persuade Washington of the fact that the freeing of the young Frenchwoman does not have the release of Majid Kakavand, one in France held prisoner and from the American justice on the basis of trade with material in favour of the Iranian nuclear programme of Iranian in request to the Gegeleistung. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Finally, they put the way with which the French presidium has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose to make to these the idea plausible, the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad has played a central role by the freeing from Clotilde Reiss, in a garish light. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In truth he had done nothing in this regard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> A diplomat's telegramme edited 12th of August, 2009 in Paris carries the title "Iran: French comments to the way of the contact with taking of hostages." </seg>
<seg id="10"> François Richier, Elysée adviser in strategy questions, talked in company of Patrice Paoli, manager of the dock d'Orsay for North Africa and middle East to the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> They explained the French method to her. </seg>
<seg id="12"> They advised the Americans to risk everything, around her own citizens rückzuführen who would be held on by force in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Power of noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without respite" the words "Basic human rights," "Innocence," "immediate release" in the media. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime in embarrassment which pays attention very sensitively to his image. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> "If this pursues the more, particularly as to you the Iranians ask not to act." </seg>
<seg id="16"> Since "silence solves nothing," past the discussion attempts about on unobtrusive way, the Iranians are "masters in evasive actions." </seg>
<seg id="17"> Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "familiar, Iranian tactics": "Taking of hostages for the purpose of political extortion." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> He announces who flees release of Clotilde Reiss from the prison (who should come about 16th of August on the day, in which them in the French message) "the payment of a big sum of money asks to the Iranians" (230,000 euros of security). </seg>
<seg id="19"> And he allows to announce, the Elysée anticipates other taking of hostages, a phenomenon which will intensify "." </seg>
<seg id="20"> The Iranians could arrest "in close future another of about 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> 28. August 2009. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Clotilde Reiss has been dismissed twelve days ago from the prison, nevertheless, it is held on furthermore in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Information was brought in circulation: the Iranian Majid Kakavand whose delivery the combined states demand on account of unlawful trade with sensitive electronics material to Iran has been dismissed after decision of a judge in Paris from the custody. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The American message positions itself, like numerous other observers, questions about this disconcerting coincidence. </seg>
<seg id="25"> For Washington which pursues the unlawful Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear programme the release of Majid Khakavand shows a bad news. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Has France accepted cow's trade? </seg>
<seg id="27"> The freeing of the Iranian against that of the Frenchwoman? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> On the occasion of a renewed discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on the 4th of September François Richier assures that this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The Elysée, so he says, was completely surprised not only "from the decision of the judge," but has also tried to rebel against it. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "There has been an active exchange between the French presidium and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Mr. Richier would also like to point out to the fact that Majid Kakavand stands furthermore under "strict" supervision of the French Secret Service. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The Elysée adviser chooses a telephone number, hangs up again, informs then the American diplomat, at the moment the Iranian "would be in the buildings led by the Iranian message in Paris." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> During the safekeeping of Clotilde Reiss in Iran the Elysée does not spare his efforts, by means of announcements and from the media of organised "escape attempts" believe to make, the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "high-powered mediator's role." </seg>
<seg id="34"> The Americans observe this activity not without irony and state that the manipulation yields fruit, because several press articles reflect the official French version. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> One telegramme dating from the 25th of August, 2009 brings on "the media flash of the French authorities." </seg>
<seg id="36"> On which is based compared with so much "Dankesbezeugung" Mr. Assad, asks itself the Paris message. </seg>
<seg id="37"> "In spite of her explanations full praising the French authorities admit in petto that they have only one vague notion of what the Syrians have really done." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The document deals then with the reasons which have made the Elysée go to ruin this fiction. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The intensive communication efforts "is designed to confirm Sarkozys politics of the opening towards Syria," he analyses. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A politics launched in 2008 which was perceived at that time "by numerous critic voices in France as well as abroad as premature and undeserved." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> "The Syrian role blowing out" tries to make clear Paris "Syria which Belobigung one can achieve, while one plays a constructive role in the region." </seg>
<seg id="42"> Moreover, aim is to be sowed it, "discord between Syria and Iran." </seg>
<seg id="43"> The American message knows this from good spring. </seg>
<seg id="44"> 11th of August François Richier had entrusted her: "of course we do not know whether the Syrians whatever have made." </seg>
<seg id="45"> "But we have thanked in spite of all them." </seg>
<seg id="46"> "This should donate at least confusion with the Iranians." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Clotilde Reiss returns on the 16th of May, 2010 to France. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Nicolas Sarkozy receives them in the Elysée. </seg>
<seg id="49"> In a communiqué he owes the president of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for her "active role in favour of the release of our compatriot." </seg>

<seg id="1"> World championship in 2018-2022: the organizer's country appoints the FIFA </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In bright excitement on the basis of corruption suspicion the executive committee of the FIFA on Thursday appoints the organizer's countries of the world championships in 2018 and 2022, an extremely political choice by which tussling about influence as well as the lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria in the background. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Nevertheless, a thing is sure: the issue in 2018 of the king's discipline of the FIFA will take place in Europe, her traditional stronghold, (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain Portugal, Netherlands Belgium). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Then the issue in 2022 will be a little more exotic; the international football association hopes to be able to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) for itself after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to follow up his establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The list of the personalities, to the delegation accompanying (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political application of a world championship. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The machination behind the scenery threatens to stop up to the last minute. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> To put up difficultly otherwise, a hierarchy of the candidates. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the Evaluationsbericht of the FIFA, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts offer to bessseren arguments as those of her competitors. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But these considerations will not be so weighty for 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees at the moment of the choice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The Sunday Times which stood with the causation of the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the exposures could have ruined as well the chances for her own country, cradle of the football, which might deliver only just once the world championship, namely in 1966. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The BBC had given on Monday once more fertile soil, while it had emitted a documentary report which takes three high-powered members of the Kommitees, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under bombardment. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and to bring the English people responsible in embarrassment who had pursued an intensive lobbying, primarily, with David Cameron during these last weeks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The head of government hopes for a new edition of the manoeuvre successful by his predecessor Tony Blair which had achieved the organisation of the Olympic games 2012 in 2005 for London. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Would this intensive application be enough to revalue the image of England before the Kommitee again? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Nothing is sure less, because the duet Spain Portugal does not lack trumps with his already ready stadia, his expert's assessment (world championship 82 in Spain, Olympic games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and his football culture. </seg>
<seg id="16"> However, the economic and financial shadow sides of both countries could damp her ambitions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The possible repressive measures against the Englishmen as well as the doubts about Solvenz of Spain and Portugal raise the chances of Russia which has become in spite of his gaps in the dossier (stadia, hotels, transport) the weighty outsider. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Nevertheless, prime minister Vladimir Putin has decided, denounced the open indication of the imputation of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" on the part of the Kommiteemitglieder. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> "One pelts them with mud, one tries to compromise them," railed Putin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> For 2022 the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, the logical favorites seem to be. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The first economic world power, seat of the main sponsors FIFA, the country seems to show a long list of advantages towards Japan and South Korea which have put up separately a very nice project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> However, these new candidatures seem too early for two countries which had coorganized the competitions in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Another menace: the approval hotly desired by the FIFA of the world championship in 2026 for China which make the Asian chances of 2022 frail. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> With Australia and Qatar which had put out all the stops with the respects futuristic stadia her expansion pursues the FIFA in the direction of new areas, however, these both countries show a bigger risk, because certainty. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Australia would be able just as Japan and South Korea under the weakness akquittierten from the European countries of the television rights (on account of the time movement) have to suffer, to the sensitive nerve of the FIFA. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Euro: the EZB is made maintain her buyings of government stocks </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The last meeting of the central bank advice of the EZB last year should offer opportunity to indicate possibilities as one comes out of the crisis, or announce at least the arrangement of a big number in unconventional measures of the monetary policy which should come at the end of the year for her end. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The crisis of the European state indebtedness obliges, the central bank in Frankfurt cannot afford undoubtedly to forfeit also the today's, more than tense situation at the European loan markets not to cause their increase. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Besides, the political costs would be too high by far. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Yesterday the French Minister of Finance Christine Lagarde had welcomed the active role taken by the EZB in favour of the solution of the budget indebtedness of Europe on the occasion of a press conference. </seg>
<seg id="6"> She does not have to say risqué whether she is to the opinion the central bank can act even more, for example, by boost of her programme of the buyings of state loans. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners ." </seg>
<seg id="8"> The day before Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the EZB had appeared in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the economic committee and monetary committee of the European parliament not very voluble with regard to his plans, but had been content rather to point out to the fact that the programme of the purchases of government stocks at the secondary market "weiterbetrieben" would become and that we will see at the meeting on Thursday "how the decisions fall out." </seg>
<seg id="9"> The only certainty: The EZB will leave her leading interest consistently with 1%, the historically lowest level since May, 2009. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In practice the bond purchases of the treasury were doubled by the EZB the last week on about 1.35 milliard euros. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And yesterday according to indiscretions of some traders she should have effected new purchases in Irish and Portuguese government stocks. </seg>
<seg id="12"> All together the central banks of the eurosystem since May have carried out 2010 purchases at the rate of 67 milliard euros. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Among the traders the Antizipation of a Weiterverfolgens of the purchase course is on no account doubted (see page 29). </seg>
<seg id="14"> The economists already expect no more noteworthy course change. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> If the loan shops of more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the EZB, will potter about latter still in the unlimited finances reserves in freigiebige kind, namely for a period of one week up to three months. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The economists make themselves calm already today on it that this measure will still extend in some months. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "I cannot imagine that the EZB her programme in essential kind will change." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "Otherwise she would take the risk to provoke new tensions in the short period," Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank supposes. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "One for the course of the first quarter in 2011 intended, progressive climbing out seems to me more likely," Norbert Bräms, economist anticipates on his part with Sal. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Home Oppen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> In the area of her interventions at the market of the state indebtedness "such a purchase volume had to do the EZB in bonds aufrechthalten which animates the sluggish market," Norbert Bräms adds. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In consideration of the relevance of the exposed position of the European banks at the markets of the state indebtedness in the eurozone the central bank has no other choice to maintain as her presence at the market. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "She must step for every price to the Steller of the lacking investors at the market and act so to prevent the rash enthusiasm about the yields paid in the weakest states," yesterday testified an important bond owner. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Since if the interest rates begin to the high-altitude flight, the states would be stopped even more from reducing her indebtedness or from stabilising even. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This is the price for the protection of the euro. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The government Berlusconi goes in Italy to cover </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yesterday after a weekly beginning disturbing for Italy the situation has relaxed with the decline of the basic interest rates for 10 years a little. </seg>
<seg id="3"> A return to the delusive silence. </seg>
<seg id="4"> At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs the region chairpersons Giulio Tremonti had the situation as "indecipherable" qualify and heard to calculate him on an "unpredictable" week-end what the person concerned denied, nevertheless, immediately. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On Tuesday, in any case, the scissors with the German interest rates would have reached his record from 210 base points, and the prices of the contracts for the cover of the bankruptcy risk have risen on 263 points what had caused a certain rash in Rome. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his council of ministers to the fact that the discrepancy of Spain lies to the German interest rates with 400 base points. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Nevertheless, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed itself as "difficult anxiously" from the "market turbulence" and a possible infection danger from Ireland. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "The good news is that Italy, the third national economy of the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist in the Hudson institutes. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In plain English this is called, his problem is the absence of economic growth and the schwindsüchtigen tax entrances walking along with it which endanger the state not to be able to cover his financing need any more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In future an Italian growth of 1.1% is expected in 2011 and from 1.4% in 2012... although at the senate to the check present budgetary budget on 1.3% or 2% counts. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Under these conditions, so the EU commission calculates, the budget deficit next year will still put out 4.3% of the BIP (against 3.9% predicted by the governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Hence, also the turmoil around a new budgetary group which could be used after the holidays to a sum of 7 milliard euros. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "If necessary, new economy measures must be seized," believes chartered accountant Olli Rehn. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At the moment Italy receives the support of international institutions. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "The basic parties of economy of Italy are in order and his accounts are regulated, we repeat this already since long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the international monetary fund who is entrusted with the IWF with Italy. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "At the moment there are no problems, neither on short-term, nor on long-term view, there from Italy in spite of his high indebtedness (119.2% of the BIP in 2011, A. d. R.) lower Stabilisationsfortschritte are demanded than of other countries," observes pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD. </seg>
<seg id="19"> If the question remains after the political unsteadiness. </seg>
<seg id="20"> On the 14th of December Silvio Berlusconi will be up against a motion of no confidence of the representative's chamber as a result of which early elections could be already organised at the end of March. </seg>
<seg id="21"> A little favorable period approaches for an adoption of resolutions concerning a heavy crisis. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Europeans think about the removal of the anti-crisis measures </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Christine Lagarde had expressly emphasised it only yesterday within the scope of a press conference in Paris: "I believe, one has proved it still on Sunday afternoon as well as also in the evening: The Europeans hold together unambiguously, are ready and engaged to defend her currency as well as her currency area." </seg>
<seg id="3"> Although completely relatively - the deduction registered yesterday with the interest rates of the European state bonds was water on the mills of the governments as well as the EZB. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nevertheless, from a normalisation beginning the speech cannot be yet. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced, she can lower the debt note of Portugal, the probably most effective target of the speculators nowadays. </seg>
<seg id="6"> "As in May exists an honest lack of clarity and political perceptibility which presses particularly on the bank systems," according to the opinion of the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Above all, particularly as "the political time passes much more slowly than of the markets." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The European countries, which this gap as well as the danger which is hidden in it are probably aware, intensify the discussions to the strengthening of the already available anti-crisis measures. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The informal consultations between the straightest affected Ministers of Finance and in the broader sense with her opponents of the G20 well lead the way. </seg>
<seg id="10"> And this also in view of the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin in the beginning of the next week. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Today the EZB meets. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The lot of the unconventional measures stands on the plan to the backing of the countries of the eurozone in the crosshair of the markets (see below). </seg>
<seg id="13"> What concerns the EU-stability funds, their Executive Director Klaus Regling has already begun his Asia tour on Tuesday in Singapour to inform the investors in the Far East about the developments concerning the crisis in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="14"> If the aim of his visit is not explicit Fundraising though, he prepares for this in addition absolutely the terrain. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The first Werpapierausgaben on the part of the EU-stability fund are planned for the next month. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Yesterday an official American representative of the agency Reuters had entrusted, the United States supported a possible increase by the additional, direct engagement of the IWF mobilised funds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first row, are about for their part to take over structural reforms, in particular in the area of the job market organisation. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The reforms which come to the economy measures, however, effects in closer future should show. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Lisbon and Madrid on another way walk than this Greece and Ireland have acted. </seg>
<seg id="20"> One, as well as to the other lies for every price with it to avoid, to have to request international assistance, before they have put up her own budget correctives and have decided on unavoidable structural reforms which to them on a continuing basis the trust brings back. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The European sponsors talk again about the available options to accelerate the normalisation process of the markets of state loans. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Axel Weber who was on the 24th of November on the travelling in Paris had produced the idea as the first that if 750 would be through Europe and the international monetary fund to mobilised milliards euros not enough, the union would not hesitate to reach once more in own pocket. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The economists of Barclays Capital, concerning the market of the European state indebtedness quite being in the foreground actor, judge, a lengthening from about the 100 milliard euros would be sufficient, "mainly in the form of a direct liquidity syringe. </seg>
<seg id="24"> These means exist: the European mechanism of endowed finance stabilisation which amounts at the moment to 60 milliard euros. </seg>
<seg id="25"> An advisory board who has all chances to be examined carefully in the European capitals. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Above all if the market terms taper to a point. </seg>

<seg id="3"> At least in the discussions. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Today, finally, it has come to the first projections. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The supplementary budget of 2010, this morning looked through from the finance commission of the National Assembly, contains the intended measures to raise the first part of this money. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It concerns, on this occasion, two things measures: the creation of a special tax to the Erschließund and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Erstere, so one takes article 15 of the law draught, goes "in favour of the public law institution of Société you Grand Paris." </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is numbered: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Zweitere is a reorganisation of the already existing enterprise taxation: "to modernise this to increase which from her proving product and this rise of the Société you Grand Paris to überantworten." </seg>

<seg id="14"> A riddle. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This sum is not numbered in the text. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> From the 4 milliards one is far away. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "It is explained that the tax resources are included to the 4 milliard euros of the capital donation which are raised by the state and are performed the Société you Grand Paris bit by bit for the project," is to be taken from the explicatory statement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> One finds this system not at all indecent with the SGP. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "Since the moment at which one registers income (both taxes, d. R.), one can cover the project engineering more than three years and then scoop only from the 4 milliards," is explained. </seg>
<seg id="20"> "This is taken down in the budget and is drawn off bit by bit." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Revengeful hackers and industrious spies </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A double meaning has the Affaire WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On a side she has turned out evident scandal, a scandal which is only one scandal in the Sinner false holiness which governs the Beziehunge between the states, the citizens and the press. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other side she announces radical changes at international level, and gives a foretaste on the future dominated by regression. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> However, we go forward after the row. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every act provided by a Secret Service (x any nation) consists exclusively of press clippings. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary," American exposures about the sexual habits of Berlusconi throw down nothing else as what one got to read about months away anyhow in every x any journal (except those whose owner Berlusconi is), and the alarmingly karikaturierte profile Gaddafis offered material for her sketches to cabaret artists already since long time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule according to which the confidential dossiers may exist only of already known news is essential for the dynamism of the Secret Services, and not only this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go to a library which devotes itself to esotherischen publications, you will recognise that every work (about the Sangraal, the mystery of running Running Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosenkreuzler) repeats precisely this what was already written in previous works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This comes along not only that, hence, still the author of occult texts wants to publish no searches (that he not knew where news about the non-existed would be to be found), but because those which devote themselves to the occultism believe in nothing differently than this what they already know and confirms what they have already learnt. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the successful mechanism of Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Also of the confidential acts. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informant is decayed, and decayed (or limited mind) is also the boss of the Secret Service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example, the editor with Libération) who judges only as true what he recognises. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Top-Secret information about Berlusconi which the American message in Rome had sent to the state department were the same like those, the Newsweek already the week before had published. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Why was made of such a fuss around the exposures of these dossiers? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On a side these mean what every educated person already knows, namely that the messages - can call the heads of government to themselves at least since end of the second world war and since also mutually or can take an airplane to meet to the dinner - have lost her diplomatic function and have changed, with the exception of some small representation duties, into spy centres. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Every any spectator of inquiry films knows this very exactly, and it does not happen from false holiness that one does in such a way to ignore this. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Still: the fact to repeat publicly it, the job of the false holiness injures and serves to put the American diplomacy in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Secondly: The idea that x more arbitrarily hacker can tap the most confidential secrets of the mightiest country of the world rescues the considerable blow against the prestige of the state department. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Besides, the scandal makes less the sacrifices, than rather the "sharp judges" in distress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> However, we devote ourselves to the profound nature of that what has happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Formerly, at Orwell's times, one could bundle up all power like a Big Brother which controlled every gesture of his subjects. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwell's prophecy could have turned out since then as completely right where one can control every movement thanks to the phone, every effected transaction, the visited hotel, the elective highway et cetera; the citizen would become the complete victim of the eye of the power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> If, however, one makes clear himself what runs off today that even the confidential crypts of the power any more cannot escape from the control of a hacker, the controlling way stops being directed unilaterally and becomes circle-shaped. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - selectedly as an avenger of the citizen - can bring the secrets of the power in experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> How can a power keep, however which is not able any more to protect her own secrets? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is right, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can be never revealed); it is also true that every knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkels is basically a secret freely from Geheimis, because it reveals the public sphere; but to disclose in the style of WikiLeaks that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, indicates to rob them of any power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> WikiLeaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, against it, however, Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What will be the consequences of this insult which was added to such an immense power? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is evident that the states will put in future no reserved information to more on-line - this would amount to a notice stuck on on the street corner. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is as evident that it is in vain with the topical technologies to hope, to be able to keep secret confidential reports on phone. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of state has moved in an airplane and has contacted one of his colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could certain relations be maintained in future private and only for certain ears? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know very well that my prediction sounds at the moment after science fiction and novelistic, but I feel forced to fancy myself the government agents, to itself in confidential way busily on uncontrollable march routes motively, her communications nowhere differently than in the bare memory with weight-bearing, and, in addition, few written information which they have got, in the shoe heel hiding. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information would be stored in the only copy in close drawers: basically the spy attempt of Watergate had to register less success, than WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had to write the opportunity that the technology progresses nowadays like a cancer, namely backward. </seg>
<seg id="37"> One century after the wireless telegraph the communication had revolutionised, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The (analogous) video tapes had enabled to the film researchers to explore a film Tape for tape, while one could reel from the back forwards and ventilate all secrets of the assembly, while the (numerical) CDs allow nowadays nothing else, than to jump from chapter to chapter, so in macroservings. </seg>
<seg id="39"> By the high-speed trains one goes within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this requires by airplane including the Umsteigens 3,5 hours. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Hence, it is not unusual that politics and communication technology come back to car and horse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> The last observation. </seg>
<seg id="42"> In former times the press tried to understand what were forged for secrets between the messages. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Presently these are the messages who demand confidential information of the press. </seg>

<seg id="8"> The EU announces to have released in 2010 2.2 milliard euros what it brings on the right way to the Respektbezollung of her engagement of 7.2 milliards in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If one looks, however, in the detail, the things lie a little more complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should be according to the Copenhagen contract "anew and, in addition," to guarantee that an additional application was introduced, without to the disadvantage of the public development aid to gereichen. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what means "anew and, in addition,." </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the EU commission had suggested a harmonisation, certain member's states, under it France, the procedure have blocked. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today everybody chooses the appoximate value which he judges as best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The EU commission has itself, for example, as an appoximate value for that of 2009 chosen: the international financing will maintain, and adds within the scope of the financing "almost-start" more than three years 150 millions. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries have chosen similar appoximate values, either concerning year or with regard to conditions at level of the public development aid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As a countermove in addition was France of the opinion, the financing "of all new projects" of 2010 is new "and additional." </seg>
<seg id="17"> Differently expressed: There are no appoximate values on the issues of the preceding year or at global level of the public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Specifically said the total sum of the French support of the developing countries can remain stable (or also decrease) - France pretends to keep to his obligation concerning "new and additional" financing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another, determining element is the classification in donations and advances. </seg>
<seg id="20"> No rule still rules over it, and everybody chooses his arithmetic mode. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, as for example France, find 1 borrowed € as equivalent with 1 donated €. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Obviously this is only hardly defensible: the trouble is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of advance can be justified for certain profitable investments (often to the issue containment engaged projects which are based on the most actual technology), it is delusive to present the euro which one takes in as a recompense for a donated euro... Besides, only the costs of the advance should be credited against the sponsor country as an engagement (i.e. the recompense of an interest rate). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France has nothing differently for the purposes of than the following consideration: it "respects" his obligation of 420 million euros, while it takes up 91.5% of advance (389.8 million euros) and donates 8.5%) 36.1 million euros) - see the also EU document to convince itself of it. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is only land of the EU that advance starts in big measure. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany demands 46%, while Denmark which follow the Netherlands or Slovakia (among the rest,) to her obligations to 100% with donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In other words if the prevailing majority of the European Union spends 1€ to the fulfilment of her obligations, France gives just once 10 cents and understands by it a comparable application. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Nice abracadabra! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> All in all, France operates in his almost start financing with a double dizziness: to a part with a Weiterentwicklkung of the action for the time away and to the other part with the reality of the financial application. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France succeeds in letting think that it has spent 420 millions "more anew and, more in addition," millions according to his promises and, besides, saves 36.1 million euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (there fine seems that it was Bercy which has carried out the arbitrage) a twice negative effect could cause; once EU-internal (why do the other member's states continue with the donation, if to lend it, nevertheless, enough?) and then during the negotiations, because the developing countries do not allow to be completely deceptive... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter of the premature financing only one small question for relatively short time in comparison to the totality in discussions about the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> If we hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> How to him also is always, it is indispensable to learn his lesson from this first year of premature financing. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Primarily, France could announce a change in his posting kind for the years 2011 and 2012, namely in spirit of the respect for his obligations and the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Above all, however, France could bring the discussions about the quarrel object of the long-term financing forwards (another, determining and at the moment discussed subject): one does not escape from the question of the "Verrechenbarkeit" or the posting kind of his advances. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could change his position to be as advancedly concerning the issues as it is with other things. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Hope is based on the new secretary of the environment Kosciusko-Morizet who will arrive the next week at Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="40"> An astonishing announcement about the almost-start of France and his vision of the "Verrechenbarkeit" as well as the use of advance would raise from nature the international trust base which is inevitably for continuing discussions. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Alarm - from children taken pesticides </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A child of 10 years takes about the day 81 different chemical substances, thus one this Wednesday of the union Générations futures (former movement for the protection of the rights and the respect of the coming generations) published study. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The union which explains that her results "in view of the low number return no statistically significant value in analysed tests but illustration character of the treated problems explain," had between July and September usually within four, from an approximately ten-year-old child for the meals to consumed food plus an intermeal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris bought. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were examined just as Naschereien by laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, treacly metals and other pollutants. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The plate balance is shattering: 81 chemical substances, classed under it 42 as possibly or probably cancer-causing classified and five as sure karziogen, just as 37 substances with Endokrinin-sturgeon factor, according to studies of several institutions as for example to the international cancer research centre. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "Even if in the approximate totality of the cases the legal limits are not crossed for every chemical, individually taken substance, one infers from this elevation, nevertheless, very well that the reality in which the consumer is possibly put out to cancer-causing materials or substances with Endokrinin-sturgeon factor is alarming," notes the union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Already with the breakfast only the butter and the tea with milk already contain more than ten of the possibly cancer-causing remains and three certainly as carcinogenic proved, just as more than twenty remains which can affect the hormone system. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The apple imported from Brazil, intended as an intermeal for the study, shows tracks of six chemical substances, under it a fungicide forbidden in France. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The same one is valid for the French beans from Kenya, enclosed in the lunch with which the study has ascertained tracks of an insecticide strictly forbidden in the EU. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Further the minced meat steak, the tuna from the tin, even the French stick and the chewing gum were also larded by pesticides and other chemical materials. </seg>
<seg id="11"> With the tap water the analyses have brought to light the presence of nitrates and chloroform. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> With the dinner the salmon steak with 34 ascertained, chemical remains was the "most extensive," and even for warming up of the meal in the microwave used plastic plates was not unloaded. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The final-limited risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer "is probably undervalued," according to the study. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts" (EE-LV) has suggested for their part "in view of the urgency of the situation" introducing a moratorium about the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in civilisation illnesses." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> In July a study of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) had relation to the presence of remains 365 more different, in fruit and vegetables to the identified pesticides identified which are consumed in Europe under it 76 in Getreiden. </seg>
