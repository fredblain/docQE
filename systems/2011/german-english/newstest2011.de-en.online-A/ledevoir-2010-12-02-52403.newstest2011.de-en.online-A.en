Secret of complex-ridden Canada revealed 
The new American diplomatic cables, which were sent out by WikiLeaks, reveal the secret of what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of Canadians towards the Americans believe; they expose but latter the sense of superiority with the same blow to Canada. 
As a result the American diplomats in are surprised that the Canadian voters at the ballot has not the Canadian American relations in the sense, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the Conservative Government to enforce its budget of 2009! 
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were sent out yesterday publicly, offer even more spicy details as the mere substantial content, where one has to nibble. 
Connect dating from September 22, 2008, i.e. during the period in which the Federal package of election campaign in full swing was located, reported from what point the United Nations is no longer participate in the operations discussed by their political bosses. 
To the surprise of David Wilkins, in Ottawa, American Ambassador. 
Mr Wilkins offers various policy options to this situation. 
"An inferiority complex almost intrinsic the Canadians requires Canadian, political leaders, much more likely causes may, to speak, as the United States in this election lay the Black Peter (such as 1988 in the campaign of the free trade) inner issues of everyday life," as he describes. 
The United Nations, so he concludes is thus "the proverbial Goliath in this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of him." 
The Ambassador is the less this "deafening silence," since the two countries have intensive political and economic relations. 
"Logically," he rated "it so should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and even more a party leaders to drive a such essential relationship, which has the voters at the polls as a key factor in the sense." 
The other term in this sense of importance reads in the communication sent from Terry Breese, Charg√© d'affaires in Ottawa, on 22 January 2009, that President Barack Obama to prepare for his first visit to Ottawa. 
"Her trip will help to ensure the survival of the Government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget, where Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, originated due to a Belebungsprogrammes of 30 to 40 billion dollars in early February," describes Breese. 
Nowhere, he had mentioned that the Government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas, to prevent that the Parliament would overthrown by the coalition and the as conditional survival of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed recovery programme. 
Another, from January 2008 dating and communication on the part of Ambassador Wilkins wrote notified Washington of the growing increasingly negative image that the broadcast of CBC, dramatic series of the United States spread. 
The Ambassador is concerned about shows like border little Mosque on the Prairie, intelligence and H2O, where you can watch little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "No. fly list," or even contributions for the purpose of by Muskelprotze of the CIA of carried out interrogations. 
Again, another message extensively reported how Hillary Clinten have asked for their French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting, whether Europe is willing to include certain prisoners from Guantanamo. 
Mr Kouchner to the question with Yes answered have, but on the basis of an individual "case to case" - decision. 
At the end of the meeting, so described, "has he given the Secretary of State a paper in terms of Omar Khadr, a 15-year old Muslims of Canadian origin." 
"The Secretary of State has promised again to see the file." 
We finally add to heat up in the minds with regard to the website of WikiLeaks. 
Tom Flanagan, a consultant very closely related old and Stephen Harper, had stated on CBC, that those responsible for this massive leak "should be killed." 
Here, he had spoke to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
