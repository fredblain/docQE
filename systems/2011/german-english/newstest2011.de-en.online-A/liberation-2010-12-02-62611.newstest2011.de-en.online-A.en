The Association, which declared that their results "given the small number of analysed samples play a statistically significant value, but represent illustration nature of the treated problems," had that between July and September usually within four, by a roughly ten-year child meals consumed bought food plus a snack in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris. 
This typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and Obstteilen, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water a day, as well as sweets of laboratories looking for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants examined. 
The balance sheet of plate is devastating: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as possibly or probably carcinogenic classified and five karziogen certain classified, as well as 37 substances with Endokrinin disruptive factor, according to studies of several institutions such as, for example, the International Cancer Research Center. 
"Even if in the near totality of the cases the legal limits for each chemical, individually consumed substance not be exceeded, so you take this survey but very well, that the reality in which is suspended the consumer may be carcinogens or substances with Endokrinin disruptive factor"," Is worrying," the Association noted. 
Already at breakfast alone the butter and tea with milk contain more than ten may be carcinogenic residues and three safe as proven carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues which may affect the hormone system.
