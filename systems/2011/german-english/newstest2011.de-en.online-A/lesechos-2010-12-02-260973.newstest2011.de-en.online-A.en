Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain their buying of Government securities maturing 
The last meeting of the Central Bank Council of the ECB in the past year should to be opportunity identify ways as one out of the crisis comes out, or at least the arrangement of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures announce the end of the year on their graduation. 
Commits the European debt crisis, the Central Bank in Frankfurt can afford without a doubt, to forfeit the today, more than tense situation in the European bond markets cause not their aggravation. 
The political cost of this would be far too high. 
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde had welcomed the occupied by the ECB, active role in favour of the solution of Staatshaushalt debt of Europe yesterday at a press conference. 
She did not dared say if she was of the opinion, the Central Bank more could do, for example, by boosting its program of buying of government bonds. 
"I keep my reasons for my European trading partners (...) ." 
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB had been the day before in Brussels during his hearing by the economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament not very eloquently on his projects shown, but is rather content to point out that the program of purchases by Government securities in the secondary market "continue to would operate" and that we "will see to the Assembly on Thursday"," as the decisions to be." 
Only certainty: the ECB is its key interest rate left unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009. 
In practice, the bond purchases of the Treasury of the ECB were doubled last week to approximately â‚¬1.35 billion. 
And, according to news leaks of some dealers she should have made yesterday new purchases on Irish and Portuguese Government securities. 
Overall, the central banks of the Eurosystem have made purchases amounting to EUR 67 billion since May 2010. 
Among traders, the anticipation of a Weiterverfolgens of the purchase price is not disputed (see page 29). 
The economists expect has no remarkable shift. 
If the bond transactions over three months will have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter on the unrestricted cash reserves in freigiebige way will have to create, and over a period of a week up to three months. 
The economists make is prepared that this measure will expand to a few months already on it. 
"I can not imagine that the ECB will amend their program in a major way." 
"Otherwise she would take the risk, to provoke new tensions in the short term," Michael Schubert, an economist of Commerzbank has suggested. 
"A 2011 proposed for the first quarter, progressive withdrawal seems more likely to me" in turn anticipates Norbert Braems, an economist at Sal. 
Oppenheim. 
In the area of their interventions on the market of public debt "should the ECB maintain keeping such a purchase volume on bonds, that animates the sluggish market," adds Norbert Braems. 
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of the European banks in the markets of public debt in the eurozone, the Central Bank has no other choice, keep as their presence on the market. 
"You must enter at any price on the actuator of the lack of investors in the market and so act to prevent the premature enthusiasm about the returns paid to the most vulnerable States," a major bond owner testified yesterday. 
Because if fix the interest rates to new heights, the States even more would be prevented to reduce their debt, or just to stabilize. 
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
