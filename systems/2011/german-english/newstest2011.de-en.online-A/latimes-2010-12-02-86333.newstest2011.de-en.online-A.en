Arsenic resistant germ could enable new forms of life on earth or elsewhere 
The discovery of a foreign type of bacteria that can live among other things by arsenic, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere. 
Although scientists here discovered this unusual bacteria on Earth, it is in their opinion a sign that it is possible to have a life without the elements previously considered vital. 
"This organism has two options." 
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow." 
"That makes it something special, even though it's almost a kind of 'foreign' way of life," said c.w. Davies of the Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online issue of the journal Science Paul. 
So far, six main elements considered essential for life - are carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur. 
However, as the scientists found the bacteria in the Californian Mono continues Lake even, replacing phosphorus by arsenic. 
"Since you ask yourself, what else can," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar by the Arizona State University. 
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, since scientists need to see life and its forms so Anbar. 
The study deals with microbes that have been found on Earth. 
The announcement of a press conference in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet, that the report could be the discovery of extraterrestrial life. 
This is not the case. 
The discovery "shows, that in other planetary systems, organisms with the help of other elements can set biochemical processes and that the 'standard 'elements that are absolutely vital in our view, are not necessarily fixed," said Charles Cockell, Professor at the planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the UK. 
Cockel was not part of the research team. 
"This work is a first, as it shows that, in Basic biochemical processes and structures, an element can be replaced by another," added Cockell. 
This discovery was not accidental. 
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiologischen Institute of NASA, who led the study, chose the Mono Lake due to the high content of arsenic. 
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she joined that microbes exposed both may replace an element with the other. 
"The toxicity of arsenic is based above all on that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus." 
"As a result it is difficult the organisms, to distinguish an element from the other." 
"But the difference is so great that arsenic acts differently as phosphorus." "It reaches our biochemical system, where it smeared all more or less," explains Anbar. 
The researchers set out the bacteria GFAJ 1 of a rising concentration of arsenic. It adapted to and grew. 
The Microbe grows while in phosphorus better, but that she can survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based life form is of course possible, either on earth or on an other planet or moon, on the arsenic is prevalent. 
According to Jamie S. foster, lecturer in Microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, is not new. But so far there is still no functioning example. 
Arsenic occurred in the early years of the Earth, more often, she says, this is why science is assumed that early forms of life have used it. 
"This is reason to believe that life different may have developed as in the early eras," as Forster, who was not a Wolfe-Simons research team member. 
The research supported by NASA, the Department of energy and the national health authorities.
