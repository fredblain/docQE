Two light aircraft L-159 out of a total of five, which has replaced the Czech Ministry of defence against the transport aircraft CASA C-295M, who on Tuesday in the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - based EADS. 
It is the first time that aircraft are owned by a foreign army. 
Abroad they were so far only in maneuvers or air shows. 
This is the two-seater version airworthy L 159T1, which was operated by the Czech Army. 
The other three aircraft are single-seat L-159. 
They are still a konserviert in the Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the company Omnipol - took it last week. 
When she are physically expediert the aircraft from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek is the spokesman of the Ministry of defence according to not yet known. 
The single-seater fighter aircraft L-159 in turn were singled out in the long term stored aircraft and this without more deposits and investments on the part of the Department of the Ministry. 
"The double seat-L 159T1 were replaced in current state and appearance," Pejšek told the newspaper Pravo. 
He added the army will have to get without two-seat fighter aircraft, as the Ministry of Defence signed a 200-million contract for the conversion of four waste L-159 to the two-seated version in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody. 
A new aircraft took over the army in July, the second will take them until the end of this year. 
Pejšek according to EADS has committed itself to enforce the fighters in the equipment of one of the NATO countries. 
"The Treaty is clearly given, that the EADS Company is customer of the L-159 aircraft and that they intended for the training of pilots of the NATO countries." 
"It is a matter of customer, how he realized the thing," leader in Pejšek. 
The business newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish Government has no interest in the L-159. 
The barter of five L-159 against a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of further aircraft for CZK 3.5 billion was been approved last year by the Government of Mirek Topolánek. 
The Ministry of defence had announced no tendering procedures at the time to buy, but spoke directly to EADS. 
The then Office of the defence argued that this Exchange will support the future export of the L-159 in other countries. 
The Czech Army bought from Aero 72 machines, of which she used only 24, she wanted to sell the rest. 
The purchase of the aircraft CASA is expected to have by the way even a legal aftermath. 
Namely, the European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of defence at the European Court of justice. The reason? The aircraft due to a full European tendering procedure would need to select and not by response by a single producer. 
The army has taken delivery of three aircraft CASA, the last to land within fourteen days at the Kbely airport.
