Durchgesickertes US document portrayed as port of corruption Moscow 
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and it passes a part of the bribes and of protection money, which they collect to the Kremlin. So, the American Embassy in Russia in a memo reported in February. 
Both high protection money blackmail police as also the State security service, so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, as it is. 
Earn money not only from legitimate businesses, but also by organised criminal gangs. 
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has referred to as "Vertical of authority" - takes his share of the money that moves the head to above. 
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his site. 
The memo is based on sources, names that have been edited. 
It was written while still Moscow's Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, and it accused him of corruption. 
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly a proof that would be been scavenged in the meantime. 
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, which has a well-known construction company, have rejected over and over again allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won numerous libel against such accusations. 
In September he explained a Russian television station, when he was asked after a documentation suggests, he was corrupt: "it's crazy, it is dirty, it's dirty." 
An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. Surveys have shown that. 
But it is unusual that, as happened in the report of Ambassador, individual persons are called, and it is unheard, that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country. 
"The direct connection of the Government of Moscow with the crime has meant that some refer to them as"disturbed"and come to the conclusion that the Government is rather like a Kleptokrat as a Government," so the memo. 
"Criminals enjoy elements one"kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the mafia, which literally"roof"or protection), which extends from the police, State security (FSB), the service Authority (MVD) and the Office of public prosecutor as well as by the entire Moscow Government bureaucracy." 
Experts have discovered a three-layered structure within the criminal world of Moscow. 
"Luzhkov is at the top." 
"FSB, MVD, and the militia are in the second stage." 
"Last ordinary criminals and criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level." 
"This is an incompetent system where criminal a gap close groups in some areas because the city offers no help." 
The report continues, that the FSB received money from the biggest companies and the small businessmen arrested the police. 
Is a source, so is, "explained, that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best, the protection of the MVD and FSB to not get it (and not by organised crime), as just as the criminals have more weapons, resources and power"," but also because they are protected by the law." 
"For this reason the protection by criminal of gangs is not more as demand like earlier." 
The memo noted that, while the collection of funds is comprehensive, the protection of even very modest be no; Sometimes, even those who pay, be arrested. 
Those who do not pay, have very quickly closed their business - on the basis of one or other Vorwands. 
Medvedev has talked several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress. 
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men go with suitcases which were probably filled with money, in the Kremlin. 
"In his fight against corruption Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, Director of by, a Moscow Expert Commission, in a recent interview. 
"But it is part of this bureaucracy." 
"It is not a part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists." 
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, so he says, corruption is inevitable. 
Nationwide, as estimated by, the corruption of Russia costs more than $300 billion a year. 
The country ranks to place 154 of a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization transparence International (countries are of "least corrupt" to "most corrupt" list). 
The revelations of memos of the American Embassy, which happened after Moscow time late in the evening, will trigger disapproval within the Russian Government with security, although, since Luzhkov can be blamed for the errors of Moscow, you might also be a way for the Kremlin to claim, that you solve the problems. 
In an interview with Larry King of CNN claimed Putin could be a fake the WikiLeaks documents and reacted angrily to the revelation that American diplomats have called him Batman and Robin Medvedev. 
"The truth is that it goes to our interaction is an important factor in the domestic politics in this country," he said. 
"But to be honest, we had not expected that this would happen with a such arrogance with such pressure and in such unethical way, you know."
