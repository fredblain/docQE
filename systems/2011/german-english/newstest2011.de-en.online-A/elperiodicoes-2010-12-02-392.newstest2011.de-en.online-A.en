On the hunt for Wikileaks head 
Obama appoints a high charge for the anti-terrorist campaign to prevent new revelations. 
Interpol emits a red warning to the tracking and discovery of Assange. 
Everything that is related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complex labyrinth in which the issues can be difficult to clear up. 
Yesterday, a "red alert" for the "discovery and prosecution" of Assange was from Interpol. 
However it is not to a traditional arrangement on the arrest. 
In addition, it is not new, she came from 20 November. 
It has to do anything with the recent unveiling of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse, which the Australians must face in Sweden. 
It also assures the Attorney of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "The police knew where and how she can get in touch with Mr Assange." 
Already on 20, the international police agency based in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden was from the arrangement, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the power by the Swedish authorities. 
As things stand. The 188 Interpol countries depend to identify Assange and locate "to arrest him for the time being and to deliver." 
Although Interpol may not order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many Member States consider the red warning according to the Organization as a carte blanche for a Arrestierung - that - be required by the national police in particular, if they have a bilateral extradition treaty, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is probably resident. 
The action outraged Assanges lawyers, who published a letter gesture, in which they informed it that the 39 founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by videoconference. 
You also remind that Assange requested after departure from Sweden and received the permission of the Prosecutor, compared with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Chief of security of Stalin. 
"This is like a hunting, not as a legal prosecution," is charged in the letter. 
While the world is looking for him - and his mother of Australia from affirms the innocence of her son - Assange holds up in an unknown location, but not silently. 
On Monday, he gave a time via Skype from an undetermined location the head of the magazine interview. During the conversation, he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton. 
"If it can be shown that she was responsible for the arrangement North American diplomats spy on the United Nations and international agreements signed by the United States that has failed, she would have to resign," he said. 
His mind was sentenced yesterday by the White House, Robert Gibbs, Press Secretary, described the request for withdrawal as "ridiculous and absurd." 
"I am me why we should attach importance to the opinion of a type that has a Web site not sure," he told the channel CNN. 
Obama itself has a high charge for the anti-terrorist campaign, Russell Travers, charged with the prevention of new document disclosures. 
The attempt of the spokesman of the presidential Barack Obama, to pay less attention to Assange, is contrary to the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators announced these days. 
Congressman Peter King, who will lead the Chairman of the national Sicherheitskommitee of the House of representatives from January, has prompted the State Department to study the possibility, on the list of terrorist organisations to put Wikileaks "in order to seize the money and anyone who supports or contributes to pursue." 
Tom Flanagan, consultants of Canada President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to his statement, Assange had revoked "murdered." 
"Obama would have to turn it into a target and a not manned aircraft or so what use." 
If you are not excused was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Arkansas Governor and possible presidential candidate. 
He said "who always was which transpire information left in the Government, he is guilty of treason and everything is no execution is eiine to mild punishment," the Fox station.
