No objection to the Spanish Government against flights 
The Spanish Government had no objections to the flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners on Spanish territory to Guantanamo, as stated in a telegram of the Ambassador of the United States in Madrid. 
The enhüllten of Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (wired) documents reflect that. It adds that the former Deputy Head of Government Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega urged the Spanish Government should be informed, "to prove that foreign aircraft overflying Spain, be adequately monitored." 
In June 2006, after the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, where the aid to human rights-free practices in a dozen was accused countries, including Spain, were discussing the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre, Fernández de la Vega. 
The Deputy Head of the Government admitted to the Council's report "have met on the sidelines Zapatero" and confirmed that Spain have to hide anything in this matter. 
"De la Vega stressed Spain had no objections regarding the intelligence flights over Spanish territory." 
"You want to be informed just," to not "unprepared to be surprised," Aguirre reported by cable. 
Also the former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the Ambassador pointed out that the Spanish Government "would pay no attention this matter, although the Government had little influence since they would be in the hands of the judges." 
The public prosecutor Vicente González gave to understand that he would block the judicial initiative to apply for the declassification of documents of the Spanish Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Minister of defence of the CIA flights in January 2007 the Embassy. 
"These reports contain no onerous or sensitive information," the Ambassador said after talking with the public prosecutor. 
However, the United States of the "apparent coordination between the Spanish public prosecutor and the German prosecutors" were concerned about the of classified information of the CNI and the Ministry of defence. 
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to the discrete handling between Governments," Aguirre complained. 
Latter, at a lunch in March 2007, in which the Ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba took part, commented that "though the Spanish judge insanely strong are considered, their independence and would do what they deem appropriate," he his statements gave, "to avoid inflated rhetorical comments, to let the tension abates." 
The Ambassador expressed his concern about how the PP in this matter. 
"Despite their generally pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will doubt not from a note that the Government of Zapatero will make capital acts of United States, which have potential human rights violations could be construed as tolerated or deliberately ignored"," even if these revelations could affect the Government of the United States," he points out.
