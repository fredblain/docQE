Nothing like away here 
This evening, it runs finally times again properly round for the Irish. 
No trace of sadness. 
For the home team dominated its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States too much. 
The fans hoot for joy when cracking loud music, they stomp their feet. 
The Bailey pub in Cork, Southern Ireland trembles because the players throw ping-pong balls over a three metre distance in a beer mug - and meet. 
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win it is 500 euros prize plus airline tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong World Championships in January. 
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; This garish drinking game and the restrained it specialists that fit together not really. 
And but tries the 26 here to amuse, to distract from the nagging question of what the future will bring. 
His plan is not fun in Las Vegas, it will result in job interviews in New Zealand in January. 
"I have to process a queasy feeling," he says. 
"It is so far away from home and still I have no work there." 
After all: His girlfriend waits in Auckland on him "she is ruck, tidied her dream job as event Manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiles. 
Because of poor prospects at home two of Tanner's three children are looking for already their luck abroad. 
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, Colin is in Sydney, his brother has a job as a consultant in London now. 
The boys go: how at the Tanner's it looks on the island in many families. 
100,000 Irish probably will leave the country in the near future, predict experts of the economic and Social Research Institute ESRI in Dublin. 
By 2015, they expect even with 200,000 emigrants. 
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a heavy loss. 
True the forecasts, it comes to a wave of emigration comparable with those under the Ireland suffered in the 1980s. 
After a decade of expansion, which brought great wealth with it for the Irish, Tristesse is spreading now again. 
The economic crisis causing uncertainty in particular the young, well-trained Irish for which it was previously only uphill. 
Job loss and social descent seemed absurd in the boom years. 
Each was used, money is there in abundance. 
But now three out of ten women and men under thirty unemployed are. 
In the Irish Times abound letters of young immigrants who complain: "Anything goes in Ireland the drain." 
"It should give an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and our country to lose an entire generation." 
"The last light makes out then." 
Law student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, see mount a bleak future because the Government run only window-dressing and more offer no prospects for the future of young people. 
"Reduce the minimum wage, but they have no strategy, how to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old. 
You observed how their fellow students hangeln by an unpaid internship to the next. 
Their main concern, saying it is to emigrate in four years. 
"This idea is sad and depressing." 
Here, men such as Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the theme. 
McLarnon organized the "WorkingAbroadExpo," an exhibition that offers a service to the topic of working abroad. 
"For their first job, the work abroad is but a great chance to make the first steps up the corporate ladder," says the Manager. 
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada. 
The message is clear: work abroad is no galley service, but brings also freedom and fun. 
How it feels, to build something somewhere else, Sean was know Donovan for half a year. 
Because there was nothing more to do for the 24 engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on a building in Germany. 
In Gelsenkirchen, they pull up just a fashion house. 
In January, it goes further to Hanover or Berlin to the next project. 
His home is now only rarely O'Donovan, because he makes extra layers at home to pay off the credit for his house. 
"The situation is a little crazy," he says as he enters after a long time for the first time over the threshold of his house. 
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am as good as no more." 
He laughs little set and goes through ausgekühlte rooms. 
The little house stands in a fine residential area with landscaped gardens, the gateways, large, expensive car park. 
Together with a sister has O'Donovan credit financed the House purchased for 380,000 euros four years ago - for 100 percent. 
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says. 
Is he afraid that it could go wrong with the credit? 
O'Donovan thought awhile, pours for hot tea and says: "I have no children, I must durchfüttern and I am young;" "even if everything goes wrong, I can begin again." 
The civil engineer don't like the weeping that he currently often hear. 
He says "nobody must starve - our situation is by far not as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island,." 
"Working a while in a foreign country, this is not the worst thing that can happen - perhaps we feel this only as Irish." 
He laughs and then tells of his father, who has gone to England in the last major economic crisis. 
"After seven years he was there again, and life went on in Ireland, easily." 
Cian Tanner like this idea. 
The future-omit and just look how it runs with life somewhere else. 
A few years working in London he has already behind it and why it should run not well in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend? 
One thing is there but that worried him part these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin. 
He fears that it could degenerate into a farewell party. 
"Just not too many emotions," he says, drinking a big gulp from his beer. 
"Farewell, this sounds but scary." 
"We call it rather a the Weggehen party, very loose with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
