Obama is committed to the law in favour of undocumented students in Twitter 
"If you are for the adoption of the dream Act - the law, then call on your Senators and urge the adoption of this law," twitterte the President of the United States in the popular social network. 
Today, the President Barack Obama supported the nationwide mobilization to support the dream Act - the law on the legalization of undocumented students with a message on his personal blog in the social network Twitter. 
"If you are for the adoption of the dream Act - the law, then call on your Senators and urge the adoption of this law," twitterte Obama. 
His text message contains a CyberLink to a larger document, asking the public to contact, as the vote of the law imminent unterz√ºglich their senators in contact. 
"The time with your voice that we wait, has come to listen to you," he stressed. 
The news was spread after exposing the 42 Republican Senators to block all voice for every law, except the extension of the tax reductions from the days of Bush and the financing of the Government would be extended. 
Such blockage, which was announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of dream Act - law and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
Asked about the blockade of Republican of dream Act law and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he confident that, if the tax issue was once resolved, a timetable for the remaining projects could be set up. 
"I think we have much more time..." 
"All we are agreed, that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year" 
"I believe that we at any time can reach an agreement on and then we can plan the flow of the rest," he said. 
The Chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would vote to end of the debate" request so that the dream Act - law, with which the initiative for legalising undocumented students from next Thursday in the Senate could be adjusted, although the next week would be more likely. 
The version of dream Act - law or the law of the American dream would approximately 800 000 young people who immigrated to the United States, as they still none were sixteen years old, while the last five years in this country have lived and enrolled at a higher educational institution or in the army, legalize. 
But the supporters of the law need 60 votes, which is why it a handful of Republicans are dependent on the votes for the adoption of the initiative. At the time, the organizations of the advocates of this project organize an intensive influence on the adoption of the law. 
The Democrats, of which the majority support the dream Act, have 58 seats. 
However, one said of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, he would vote against it and only a Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced its support of the law. 
Therefore, the defender of the dream Act need to get more Republicans on their side if other Democrats should choose abandon the back the initiative. 
The most touted Republicans include those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martinez. 
Other Republicans who support the dream act in the past, are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they are told to not support it on another occasion. 
An another Republican, which John McCain, had pronounced itself for the law did not set date yet his attitude. 
Although the House of representatives has a different version, agree the analysts is that the dream act in the Senate faces the biggest obstacles.
