Obama stops new drilling 
Off the coast of the U.S. State of Florida in the, there will be no new drilling in the coming years. 
A corresponding prohibition has adopted in the Government in Washington - and thus their earlier plans finally revoked. 
Also off the coast, new holes are for the time being prohibited. 
This was announced by Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar on Wednesday. 
The strict prohibition, which shall be at least for the next five years, was the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April. 
Before the accident that cost the lives of eleven workers and resulted in the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama to pressure the opposition and the industry had signaled his willingness, allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico. 
The proponents want to reduce the dependence of the United States of oil supplies from abroad.

In the Centre of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is facing demands for billions. 
A Commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama's to present their results in the course of December. 
In October, Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the drilling ban imposed after the explosion. 
Following several oil companies had immediately made requests for new drilling projects. 
With tougher controls and stricter safety regulations, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster. 
Currently, the competent control authority, which was fallen into disrepute after numerous allegations of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed. 
At the same time, Obama has announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies. 
The industry now publicly warns that flow in the Gulf by a stricter regulation would significantly lower than in the past. 
"The Government's plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of oil and gas industry," is the result of a current industry survey by the consulting firm BDO - before the drilling ban on Wednesday. 
The American Energy Alliance also complained about the uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows what exactly will change with the regulation." 
Investments in new projects would be delayed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
