A tenant of Bakala: He heats while in the oven - still pay higher rent 
An older mid-tower man leaves just the client Centre of company RPG Byty of "Coal Baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest Privatbesitzers of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic. 
Under his arm a portfolio with three new leases to three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and his son who served just a sentence. 
Just the rent has been increased in the framework of the so-called "deregulation" all three. 
Instead of 3500 kroons shell furnished rentals the son to out 4100 crowns in the next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category. 
"And there is not even fluent hot water in the apartment and heat you need in a simple SZD," he presses annoyed with the finger on the new lease agreement of the son, he has a power of attorney to his signature. 
He said half out of tune and half to "But what - have signed I." 
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new terms and conditions as "incorrect and immoral," advises the tenants simply not to sign new contracts and to wait where she release a guide intends to, how you are against those contracts going on until 7 December. 
But the man waves only. 
"A says this, the other the," he makes a sinister face. 
The Ostrava region becomes the major "deregulation laboratory." 
After the new year this deregulation is imminent the most apartments for rent in the Czech Republic whose Mieter has no market rent to pay. 
Aktuálně. cz therefore decided to visit this "Lab" personally. 
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is full to one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning breaking this Tuesday. 
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and its a calling device. 
"Rent 2011," so is a special button box on the touch screen. 
Briefly touched and already the device spits out a list of numbers. 
Hardly we have deciphered the number "157" and already, it beeps on the big screen on the ceiling of Warteraums. 
Half a second later it is your turn. 
Later, an older couple enters the waiting room, to ask for the price, but the rush in the waiting room is apparently not the new rent. 
Most people are here repair requests, insurance issues and the like, to solve the common problems-. 
As of mid-November, the envelopes with the new lease flutter most tenants of a total of 44,000 dwellings of portfolios of the RPG in the mailboxes in the region of Ostrava. 
The RPG Byty proposes you an assign of approx. 15 to 38 percent in the letter. 
The special switch for the new hiring in the client Centre is open since November 18. 
"The action is running something over a week, that is to say, this is just the beginning," the ladies behind the counter reply hesitation after a moment, as it turns out to be the "client" as a journalist. 
The deregulation and Bakalas former mining houses are an explosive issue. 
Taken before the elections the from Ostrava, Vice-President of the parliamentary Lubomír Zaorálek of the čssd regional had this topic up quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of. 
"Twenty years I want a new floor of them." 
"Non times ne besch." "They could substitute for WC-Brille," is the earlier mentioned man air. 
So far, especially pensioners on the switch are on the employees according to to ensure whether they receive really the promised guests moderation, which promises them RPG if they sign the special offer in a timely manner. 
Enjoy a half reduced February rental also the other tenants are, that sign the new lease agreement until 15 December. 
So far, "deregulation" switch in Havířov is anything but, under pressure of demands. 
"Yesterday's 360 clients only approximately 40 to 50 were rent in 2011 because here," the switch workers estimate. 
RPG offers individual rental agreements, where it is necessary both to their Web pages, and wall panels. 
If the Mietparteien but not on the new hire to agree, it will be set by an independent court. 
"That is to be no threat, but is to be understood as information on the only possible and perfectly legitimate legal approach," explains RPG's Web pages. 
"Here no one goes to court," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client Centre gives her at least partially right. 
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pension, of which 5,000 for the food leaves me, where should I use the money for a court dispute," he says. 
Then, the employees is yet uncertain. 
"Let's see." 
"Mr Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign, and so the people wait still," she are to keep in mind. 
The regulated rent ends the majority in the Czech Republic on new year's day 2011 and RPG Byty according to the assign is an economic necessity. 
"The existing amount of the rent sufficient not even to the maintenance of the Housing Fund," argues Pavel KLIMEŠ, the Director of the housing portfolio of company RPG Byty and - just the neglect criticized by the angry tenants of Housing Fund is the main reason for the assign according to the homeowner. 
While RPG could invest four billion in the apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the collected rents, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it will be 5.2 billion. 
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling to the armchairs in the waiting room of Havířov, a few red glowing information appear in in between time and again. 
"The rent increases in the years 2011 to 15%, and less concern 31 200 apartments, that is more than 90% of RPG." 
"Always, this means more than 7.50 CZK per square meter per month," is to read on the LCD monitor. 
Only on 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG is increased the rent by 38 percent. 
"In these cases, it comes to increasing extremely low rates of 19,66 CZK per square meter," argues RPG. 
2600 Apartments, the rent remains in the next year at the same height. 
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation drives rents not leaps and bounds in the height, but gradually takes place within four to eight years. 
What's more - the company imposed on itself a further obligation: the company wants to put again all revenue from the assign (see diagram) in the apartments, especially in heat savings - new window and thermal insulation. 
But - primarily it will benefit those people who sign the agreements on the assign.
