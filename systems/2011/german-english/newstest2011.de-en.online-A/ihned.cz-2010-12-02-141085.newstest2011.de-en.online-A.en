I wish my successors a quieter year, when we had it in Farmet 
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis. 
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst behind it. 
The price for the first rank of competition Vodafone company of the year in the past year took Karel Žďárský, to the owner of Farmet. 
The jury paid tribute to the efforts that he stomped a company from the ground from the small tool making in Česká Skalice that makes hundreds of millions of sales at that time. 
"I can say that this assessment encourages not only myself, but also all of my employees and has strengthened our confidence in the fight with the competition," says the winner of the previous year. 
At the beginning of the history of Farmet was the effort to do something useful. 
And then the State Žďárský offered a small workshop to the lease his father Karel as compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists, he hesitated for a long, his career in the company where he worked until then, whiz, and founded his own company for the production of plastic tubs with a few comrades of his father. 
A short time later they started to focus on vegetable oil presses. 
They are within 18 years to become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in all of Central Europe. 
But only by the success in the mentioned competition and the medialization she occurred also in the awareness of the non-professional public. 
"Not only that customers perceive the brand Farmet now much more intensively, began our foreign partners the fact to be able to work in their country with a company's greatest success has won, paying greater attention to the," says Karel Žďárský. 
The past year was not only characterised by the euphoria of victory at Farmet. 
The assessment came from the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009. 
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products. 
The crisis that shook at that time still less the citizens, but above all companies, reached its peak just - many companies were forced to adjust their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new equipment and technologies. 
"We could not avoid of course also this situation." 
"Sales declined by 40 per cent, we had to restrict the production and access even to redundancies," Karel explains Žďárský 
A viable company must sometimes also such unpopular measures. 
However, it managed to get the situation under control and to keep the company in the black numbers with lower profits than before the crisis. 
In one, the company was not willing to make concessions - in investment in research and development. 
"Of the grant, we built a research and training center, we encouraged our presentation at international fairs and earned top prizes in domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský. 
All bears witness to the fact that we have overcome the crisis. 
Sales grow back and with them the number of new employees. 
"I wish much joy in the victory - the new winner but in quieter atmosphere," Karel can Žďárský align.
