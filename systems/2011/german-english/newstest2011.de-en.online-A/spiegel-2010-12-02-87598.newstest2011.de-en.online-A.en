Hell, warriors! 
Fits splatter to art cinema? 
The Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores with his fighters epic "Valhalla rising" new from old genre boundaries. 
To which audience may the Danish Director have thought Nicolas Winding Refn, as he "Valhalla rising" has shot? 
A trapped Viking Warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is freed from his persecutors and sets everything to with almost superhuman powers his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers looking for bloody action, and his enemies just because our hero of like rough methods of killing uses ever the intestines from the living body snaps, if he is in a bad mood. 
On the other hand, one eye says as he is actually called, the whole movie about nothing, and also the other characters can be carried away at most times to one or two sentences or a few agonizing Todesschreien. 
Otherwise remained silent and revels in the creepy beautiful hills of Scotland, which provides the backdrop to the Viking world of thousand years ago. 
Ideal for adult cinema with interest in Existentialism and quiet camera movement. 
A beautiful, if a film has multiple target groups, pity if they mutually exclusive choices. 
Director Winding Refn since its wild and styled drug dealers trilogy "Pusher" is considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refused to make his works with more humor the arthouse available mainstream or something less brutality. 
The most art cinema friends are likely to be afraid of the around spouting brain mass and the colon. 
The action-fans at the latest dying of boredom when one eye freely interpretable reasons with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem breaks down and stuck forever in the doldrums and fog before the team apparently arrives in America and further remains silent. 
It is no wonder that "Valhalla rising" in Germany no cinema distribution has found and is released only on DVD. 
This is a real shame for the magnificent images, and also, because the prätentiösen to bluttriefenden facade a sometimes exciting piece hidden behind cinema, that deserves some attention. 
This film is not about dialogue or a stringent action, it's all atmosphere, a film company fevered dream. 
And from which there is no escape for the audience. 
Refn take him hardly a moment of relaxation and puts together with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack very slowly the throat to him, especially with the incredible hatred that showed him from the heart of the figures. 
Only a little blond boy who faithfully is one eye to the page, kept something like innocence, all others are driven by anger. 
Most of all the one-eyed hero, whose Motive are never told which but for enemies and temporarily at some point becomes allies the warriors from hell, probably to the Ambassador of the devil. 
It means destruction maybe but just for the corruption anyway. 
"Valhalla rising" is a mysterious film you can hate and admire, to tease, exciting, and be amazed. 
An experience.
