Second mandate: the emphasis 
De Gaulle had really cut back. 
Mitterrand had to believe that he stutze. 
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation. 
And Nicolas Sarkozy or less than this. 
A term in the Elysee causes the next. 
Ergo, the current head of State will be candidate in 2012. 
But the emphasis is the site of the mystery that attached to the presidential function, not to shame. 
So, you must do so as if from now on would be the doubt. 
In one, such as in the other sense. 
2006, the followers of Jacques Chirac gave for a third term is not precluded, without even believe. 
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy in serious tone assured to make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011." 
He expressed the perspective of "two mandates" would be on Tuesday evening at the Elysée before the UMP members of Parliament, therefore a little feverishness had spread. 
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy? 
Far from. 
The President had only remind you that the constitutional amendment of 2008 will limit the number of the five-year terms to only two. 
He made a statement, no announcement. 
It is not the first time that he mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone. 
"You have at worst another seven and a half years with me, or at best," he explained to them in July 2009. 
On a new in May 2010: "Do not believe, that I think not about the stage afterwards." 
His words of yesteryear make it no longer the candidate as the day before; but also no less. 
Should they raise comments, then for a twofold reason. 
The acceleration of Wettlaufes for the candidacy with the PS on a page. 
It is not the inclusion of competition with Ségolène but Royal, which is Nicolas Sarkozy to to reveal. 
On the contrary, it is his apparent candidacy in 2012, which remind many members of the PS earlier as adopted to the Declaration of war. 
The bad polls on the other hand. 
For the first time the voters of the right a candidature of François Fillon would that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to survey of the BVA-L'Express) prefer. 
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP," the environment of the Prime Minister reacted immediately and carefully. 
"If it is a defeat as possible would be, he would be not candidate," shares with Jean-Pierre Raffarin. 
"He will believe always, to be able to win," corrected Alain Juppé, who himself has accepted with the emphasis.
