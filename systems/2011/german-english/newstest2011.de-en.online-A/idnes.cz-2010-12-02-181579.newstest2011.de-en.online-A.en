The right mattress and the right bed grate? Women have different needs than men 
So mattress and rust make up not the nicest bed frame, but the quality of the bed - good bed. 
They must however harmoniously complement is to meet the needs of specific user. 
Many things play a role - the weight, the size, health, and not least, the sex of guile in the selection. 
Also the Interior in the mattress and rust subordinate have to is just as important. 
Typical example? 
In a weekend House, in which not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not suitable because they longer need much "to be warm." 
In addition, they are much heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses. 
And - they should be changed regularly. 
If they have indeed not enough ventilation tubules in the core and still to lie on a fixed disk, moisture which impounds to: it is therefore not excluded that formed under their mold. 
When choosing plays also a role in what you are used. 
Who was quite a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with soft layer are common, is can adapt hard to a low mattress with hard surfaces. 
"Probably all ice hockey players who returned from the NHL, have complained to me, that they can sleep here properly." 
"For their abgeschundenen shoulders, heels, and hips they need a soft layer of Visco foam (memory foam - a shape memory polymer) simply." 
"I recommend it including diabetic people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the"information"from the skin and the joints badly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, focusing on upholstered furniture. 
That is why I have many ice hockey players, years ago this mattress with Visco foam (memory foam) concerned but also other customers. 
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer among other things the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer of Tropico." 
And one must not necessarily be a famous hockey player to learn the benefits of Visco foam. 
This "miracle" works actually quite simple. 
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, he clings downright warm body. 
Nowhere it expresses, in the night to roll around to not like after a heavy battle. 
You sleep much better. 
The viscoelastic foam provides also protection from pressure ulcers (gangrene). 
When choosing the size of the mattress you should still have the length of the soles of the feet add to the body, about 21 to 34 cm. 
Man as woman, are 180 cm in length on the need to a 210 to 220 cm long bed. 
Each sleeper at least 90 cm bed width available should be together so 180 cm. 
In singles, such as singles, are 120-140 cm. 
Of comfort, and also for any visitor. 
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb is the ideal bed width: "If you lying on her back, still enough space for the slightly bent arms should be," advises ing. Helena Prokopova, the Zunftmeisterin of the upholsterer and interior decorator, which is for years devoted to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and submits this issue also at schools. 
With a double bed everyone needs an own rust and his own mattress, but beware when shopping, so that the mattresses are also high. 
Otherwise, nothing else is necessary to mount as the grates in different height and possible long at each bed frame. 
Foam mattresses should be Mattresses Spring House at least 14 cm in height 15 cm, of which at least three inches should is on the shape layer and the fine upholstery. 
"With the hand or while sitting down you may feel the springs in no way," Helena Prokopova warns. 
Each mattress requires a special type of rust. 
Full-cushioned beds with mattresses and document such as integrated Siamese twins have no place in the bedroom. 
These mattresses can be not to air and it can not wash the reference, which is today Yes already commonplace. 
And because you lose in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat, it is clear that the mattress (and clogged strainer) is slow after five to seven years to a huge. 
Also, experts reject advertising slogans or even lifetime warranty promising a lifespan of up to 25 years, with mattresses. 
Every thing has its IFS and buts. 
And therefore a practical advice from the merchants: in mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width should you not afraid of the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, however, it is advisable to use a mattress covers, you easily remove the and wash can. 
Even though today usually mattress covers round to zip are made, so that you to open get (extremely important for the washing process and the size of the washing machine!) half the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially alone run appears to often as the unequal fight between David and Goliath. 
They have a solid record in bed instead of a rust? 
Out this! 
Or for a maximum of a bed for unwanted guests and for a single night. 
So, you should the plate rather with ventilation holes provide (if already not in it are) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket springs and fine upholstery use. 
Polyurethane mattresses are not on such a surface. 
LaTeX or sandwich mattresses are suitable for not adjustable slatted frames with 14 to 18 spring strips (lamella) (also combinations of latex and coconut), always grates with a larger number of staff, i.e. 28 and more spring bars pay off here, with lumbar support in the lumbar region and the possibility, to adjust the hardness of pale. 
On adjustable slat panels, no Mattresses Spring House are because they respond not to the ergonomic adjustment. 
Special flexible shoulder modules are provided next to the setting of the stiffness of the spring bars. 
This is a special fixing of the spring bars, which makes it possible to lower the spring bars or even to reverse angles to enable selective sinking of the shoulder of's Guile. 
Especially for men with wide shoulders an important thing. 
There are even mattress manufacturers have started to use "Men mattresses" soft zones for the shoulders. 
On the women's is - you take them this soft zones in the hips. 
For most demanding clients, point-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or grids with point elastic contact pads are designed with so-called multimedia torsion spring suspension. 
The pressure is distributed on several points, reducing the tension. 
But - if you used a bad pillow (too big and fülliges) to the right mattress and correct rust, the most benefits are lost again. 
Again a rule of thumb: the pillow to support the head, his tips should submit only up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax. 
Therefore a 50 x 60 cm pillow is ideal, as for example the Scandinavians like it. 
On its side, the pillow (along with the shoulder relief zone in the grill or the soft area in the mattress) should make up for the shoulder height. 
Have something our modern mattresses have but in common with the former mattresses (filled with hay). 
Modern manufacturers use more and more natural materials or at least their impurity. 
Also in mattresses, the new magic word of "Organic" means. 
Instead of oil raw materials using more and more natural oils - such as Castor and soya-bean oil for the production of polyurethane foams. 
Soy is probably used by all well-known manufacturers. 
Petr Vašíček explains "Bio is mattresses, their core consisting of purely natural origin materials," by the company Tropico plus. 
Natural materials are used but also in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was about Aloe Vera. 
You can also micro-capsules treat, spread the forest fresh at the sleeping or lavender scent. 
Again, it makes a difference between men and women. 
While the men a "cooling" herbal extract of birch leaves is used so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, have the references for effect "wärmende women." 
Extracts from red peppers stimulate the blood circulation that is so toasty warm sleep the weaker sex. 
And the today's Favorites? 
Mattress made of cold foam (he has larger pores with damaged cell structure and is therefore breathable than standard polyurethane and also much more flexible). 
More zones mattresses, who know exactly where the head, hips and heels are caused by the combination of different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and Visco foam. 
For a high-quality mattress, you have to shell out 7000 kroons, and more. 
Health mattresses are with lower VAT, but usually because they are considered medical. 
As the first Czech company, this advantage had Gumotex. 
You can see on the mattress and to save the rust is not so easy. 
Every now and then there are special offers from manufacturers and retailers who offer two mattresses for the price of one. 
So, the brand of Magniflex offers the Duofreeze mattress with Visco foam verstepptem regarding memory for 11.990 CZK. 
Free, you get to the second. 
It was the material of Tempur, which initiated the era of the viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace. 
No wonder they have been developed for NASA, for the astronauts are exposed to enormous overload at the start. 
Tempur is soft at heat, in cool environment it solidifies again. 
So it fit perfectly on the human body and distributed the body pressure in an optimum way. 
It is therefore not only ideal for the prevention of pressure fire, but generally increases the comfort as you sleep. 
Viscoelastic foams are not only mattresses, but also other health products, as used e.g. in special Fußpolstern, that should give relief the legs and the vessels. 
Local manufacturers use for example the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
