Vengeful hacker and bustling spies 
The WikiLeaks affair has a double meaning. 
On one side has a scandal that only a scandal in the sinner is hypocrisy that governs the Beziehunge between the States, the citizens and the press emerges it as obvious scandal. 
On the other hand, announces major changes at the international level, and a foretaste of the future dominated by regression. 
But we go in order. 
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each created by a secret service file (of any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper clippings. 
The "extraordinary," American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi's throw from nothing more than that which it across anyway to read got months in every x any journal (except those owned by Berlusconi), and the terrifying karikaturierte profile of Gaddafi's offered substance cabaret artists already for a long time for their skits. 
The rule according to which the secret dossiers may consist only of already known news, is not only essential to the dynamics of the intelligence services, and that in this century. 
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le Ch√¢teau, the Knights Templar or the Rosenkreuzler) exactly repeated that what was already written in previous works. 
This is not only the fact, that the author of occult texts will publish any research (yet because he does not know where would be the non-Existierende news to find), but because those devoted to the occult, believe in nothing other than the, what they already know and confirmed what they have already learned. 
This is also the mechanism of success by Dan Brown. 
Just as the secret files. 
The informant is lazy and lazy (or limited mind) also the head of intelligence is (otherwise he could what ever, for example, editor of Liberation), which considered only as true what he recognises. 
The secret details of Berlusconi, who the State Department had sent the American Embassy in Rome, were the same as those that already the week before had published in Newsweek. 
So why was made such a fuss to the revelations of this dossier? 
On a page say that what already know every educated person, and that the messages - at least since end of World War II and since the Government each other can call himself or an airplane can take to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and to , with the exception of some small representation tasks, in espionage Centers transforms have. 
Any any spectator of discovery films knows this very well, and it is not from hypocrisy, that to do so, to ignore this. 
Still, the fact to repeat it publicly violated the task of the hypocrisy and serves to put the American diplomacy in a bad light. 
Secondly: The idea that a x any hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world, is the significant blow to the prestige of the State Department. 
Also the scandal of less brings the victims, as rather the "executioner" in distress. 
But, we devote ourselves to the profound nature of what happened. 
Formerly, Orwell's time, you could combine all power like a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects. 
Orwell's prophecy could have since then quite rightly point out that, where you can control each movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, visited hotel, the selected motorway and so on; the citizens would become the total victims of the eye of power. 
If you are but do in mind, what's going on today, that even the secret Crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, so the tour ceases to be on one side and is circle-shaped. 
The power controlled every citizen, but everyone, or at least the hacker - chosen as the Avenger of the citizen-, can bring the secrets of the power in experience. 
How can a power adhere but, that is no longer able to maintain their own secrets? 
It is true, Georg Simmel said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty mystery may never be revealed); It is also true that any knowledge of the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's basically free is a mystery of mysteries, because it reveals the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks disclose that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means any power to rob them. 
WikiLeaks Merkel or Sarkozy did wrong, however, but Clinton and Obama. 
The consequences of this insult be what, which was added a so huge power? 
It is obvious that the States in the future will provide more online no reserved information - this would amount to a poster glued on the street corner. 
But it is also apparent that it is in vain with the current technologies to hope, to be able to keep secret confidential reports via telephone. 
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of State is moving in a plane and has contacted one of his colleagues. 
How could private and only for certain ears relations are maintained in the future? 
I am well aware that my prediction for science fiction and romanhaft sounds at the moment, but I feel this compelled to introduce the Government agents to me moving actively to uncontrollable routes in a secret way, carrying their messages anywhere else than in the mere memory to, and also hiding the little written information which they have received, in the Schuhabsatz. 
The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically, the espionage trial of Watergate had to had less success than WikiLeaks. 
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is progressing today like a cancer, namely backwards. 
A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionized the communication, reconstructed a Telegraph (telephone) wire to the Internet. 
The (analog) video cassettes had allows the film researchers, spotting a movie band for band by from behind forward fast and reveal all secrets of the Assembly could, while the (numeric) CDs enable today nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter, so in macro portions. 
With the high-speed trains, you drive three hours from Rome to Milan, whereas this requires three and a half hours by air including the transfers. 
It is therefore not unusual that policy and communications return on car and horse. 
A final observation. 
In the past she tried to understand press, which were forged for secrets between the messages. 
Currently, there are the messages that ask for sensitive information by the press.
