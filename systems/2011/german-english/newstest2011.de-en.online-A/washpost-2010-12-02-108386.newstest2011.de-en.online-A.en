Can courtesy connect what divides us? 
After a campaign of words and negativity, this week in Washington is broken out little courtesy. 
Is it the omen of a genuine two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the battle of the parties in the capital? 
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and tips of the Congress was no breakthrough in the big issues, which during the so-called "lame session duck," the meeting at the end of a period of Government, where no decisions are met, had to deal with. 
After all what you hear, it was not a polite discussion between two different pages or a compliance with their shared responsibility to govern, but rather a episode of a partisan point collecting empty. 
The public meeting of the deficit Commission of President on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that still exist between the members. 
It seems to be that close interaction over a period of months a mutual respect gives rise, which obscures the ideological gap that still separates the members, clear. 
That is hardly enough, come to claim it is a new era of cooperation. 
Both sides are now in a period of testing - in which has claimed one of the other characters of the cooperation and willingness to compromise, while even trying, after a renewed party warfare weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters. 
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants on a minimum of claims or allegations were limited. 
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep, as that one might expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years. 
No matter whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or rights that both sides are miles apart. 
Last but not least the November election has mild voted Washington at least for a short time. 
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, who now works for the "ethics and public policy Center." 
"That is inevitable after elections." 
Elections are partisan passions, which die off again. 
"And that is a good thing." 
"In some issues, especially those on the agenda of the"lame duck session"are, Republicans and Democrats have little choice to find a solution." 
Bush's tax cuts end end of the year, and no one in favour of that. 
Both sides want to find a way, a few or even to get all, it is now temporarily or permanently. 
As a compromise with regard to the increased unemployment benefit is expected, even if only, because the Republicans can afford, that it is believed that favored tax cuts for the rich, while they refuse to support unemployed workers. 
After the meeting at the White House on Tuesday, the optimism has increased, that one on these issues while some "lame duck session" and contract can ratify the new START at the same time. 
"But William Glaston of Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session" not necessarily a permanent cooperation of the parties cause must, if the new 112. is convened Congress in January. 
Instead, he says, a phase of non Ã¼bereinstimmens is more likely, perhaps even essential. 
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said. 
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - leads courtesy to true cooperation. 
"I see much of what happens between now and 2012 as a preliminary, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said. 
The reasons for this have to do much with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters that were beneficial to their education. 
As concerned the Republican leaders also may be that they play poker too high, they know that they must try, its promises to reduce government spending and to override the health care reform, to comply with. 
This party are already evident in the first reactions to the recommendations of the deficit Commission, which include a tax reform and raising some taxes and raising the retirement age and reducing government spending. 
The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have adopted one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, in accordance with their own assessment, so much crowded, the deficit issue on the public agenda, that they can no longer be ignored. 
But they need within the Commission of 14 of the 18 votes to make the official recommendation their plan and they fight very to come only in the vicinity of this number. 
The largest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the Panel, as in financial issues, at least today little scope, or is little sympathy for compromises. 
Galston predicts two stages in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress. 
The first fight will be held next year in the form of party clashes if the Republican challenge in terms of the State budget and the control of the health system, later followed by a phase of greater two parteilicher cooperation Obama. 
Leading to this change? 
The public opinion. 
It is proved that, despite the bias of the current election, the majority of Americans still wishes that the two parties work together. 
If confrontation in a dead end as it has happened in 1995, both parties need to carefully look for the public reaction. 
Who is sentenced to the loss, is to change the course and find the compromise. 
This may in fact be an optimistic view. 
Partisanship and polarization are today greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans. 
At the same time the activists of both parties see 2010 as pure prelude to one of consequence far greater choice 2012. 
Seen in this way, the courtesy that this week is carried to the show, like will be welcomed by many Americans. 
But it will require much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions that still separate the two.
