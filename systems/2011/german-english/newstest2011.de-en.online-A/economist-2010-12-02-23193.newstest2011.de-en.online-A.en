An electoral setback 
No one had expected that the elections would be perfect on 28 November in Haiti. 
But the facts by far exceeded the fears of election monitors who rushed the torn country to help. 
Crowded ballot boxes, multiple total votes, ballots in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problem. 
Polling stations opened hours late. 
Many Haitians, of which many earthquake had become homeless in January, roamed around looking for a choice. 
Some gave up eventually. 
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged leaders, demanded the abolition of the election results because of alleged fraud. 
Throughout the country, it came to sometimes violent protests. 
Nevertheless, called Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN Mission in Haiti, the choice "as well in many respects." 
According to a careful statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "to not necessarily invalidate the process these irregularities, so serious they may be,." 
In other words, the show goes on. 
The election administration, which allegedly is committed to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidates, Celestin, Jew, will announce the provisional results on 7 December. 
The expected runoff election is scheduled for January. 
There is still hope in the election. 
The two leading opposition candidate, the rapper Michel Martelly and the former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity proceedings. 
If Jew declared Célestin, who finds little or even no support among the voters, by the Wahlberhörde to the winner of the runoff, this could lead to problems. 
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of earthquake victims are still in tents, it was feared a low turnout. 
Many Haitians prevented by lack of organisation on the vote on election day. 
Shortly before the election, about 250,000 cards needed to vote, were still not dealt. 
There is much at stake. 
The donor countries consider a Government legitimate, recognised as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti. 
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
