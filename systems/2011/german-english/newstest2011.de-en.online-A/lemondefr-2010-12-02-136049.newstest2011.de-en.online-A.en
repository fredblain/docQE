Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée exaggerates his mediating function for Syria 
More than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, held the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher, was recorded in the Iran for "Espionage," the French public in breath, the diplomacy put on alert and accentuates the deterioration of in relations between Paris and Tehran. 
All this is under the attentive gaze of diplomats of the United States. 
Received from WikiLeaks and the newspaper "Le Monde" durchgesehenen American documents reveal some background to this crisis. 
You describe how the Elysee had declared its strategy the Americans, who went so far as to give them advice on dealing with their own crisis of "Hostage-taking" in the Iran (a small group of hikers). 
Point to how the French authorities tried to persuade the liberation of the young French woman to have a prisoner held in France and sought by the American Justice on the basis of trade in material for the benefit of Iranian Nuklearprogrammes Iranian to the Gegeleistung not the release of Majid Kakavand, Washington. 
Finally they put way the the French Presidency to manipulate the media for the purpose, tried to make credible the idea that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad have played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a harsh light. 
In fact, he had done nothing in this respect. 
A diplomatic telegram redigiertes on 12 August 2009 in Paris entitled "Iran: French comments on the nature and way of dealing with hostage-taking." 
François Richier, Elysee consultant in matters of strategy, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone. 
You told her the French method. 
Which advised the Americans to do its utmost, to their own nationals recycled would violently detained in the Iran. 
"Making noise," they said "the words"Basic menschenrechte,""Innocence,""immediate release"in the media articulated loudly and clearly and without ceasing." 
This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime in the fix, is very sensitive to its image. 
"Operates this even more, especially since the Iranians ask you not to do that." 
Because "silence solves nothing," past the discussion attempts of understated way, the Iranians are "Masters in evasive action." 
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners was a "common, Iranian tactics": "Hostage-taking for the purposes of political blackmail." 
He announces that Clotilde Reiss's release from prison (which on 16 August come should, on the day on which it escapes in the French Embassy) "Requires the payment of a large sum of money on the Iranians" (230,000 euro deposit). 
And he can announce, the Elysee antizipiere more hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "that will exacerbate." 
The Iranians could "in the near future one other of about 1,800 French citizens arrest, who live in the Iran," he said. 
August 28, 2009. 
Clotilde Reiss is been released from prison in twelve days ago, is still held in the Iran. 
Information has been brought into circulation: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States due to illegal trade with sensitive electronics at the Iran request, was dismissed by decision of a judge in Paris from prison. 
The American Embassy is, like many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence. 
For Washington, which provided for material pursued the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news. 
France took a horse trading in purchase? 
The liberation of Iranian against one of the French? 
On the occasion of a further meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assured that this was not the case. 
The Elysée he says was not only "completely surprised by the decision of the judge," but also tried to rebel against it. 
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "The French Government can not change the Court," he explains. 
Mr. Richier would like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under "strict" supervision of the French secret service. 
The Elysée consultant dials a phone number, to initiate again, then informed the American diplomat, the Iranians "were currently in the buildings of the Iranian Embassy in Paris." 
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in the Iran the Elysée not protects his efforts, by means of announcements and the media organized "escapes" into the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad should play an "important" and "influential mediation" thinking. 
Americans observe this activity without irony and ascertain that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version. 
A telegram dating of the 25 August, 2009 evokes "the media Flash of the French authorities." 
What is based as much "testimony of thank you" to Mr Assad, asks the Paris Embassy. 
"Despite their statements full of praise for the French authorities give to secretly, that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians are actually did." 
Then, the document deals with the reasons which have led the Elysee to this fiction. 
The intensive communication efforts "aims to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyses. 
A 2008 launched policy which at the time "was by numerous critics votes in France, as well as in other countries as premature and undeserved perceived." 
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" try Paris "Syria to lead what commendation you can achieve by to play a constructive role in the region." 
Also, aim is "to sow discord between Syria and the Iran." 
The American Embassy knows this from good source. 
On 11 August François Richier had entrusted to her: "of course we do not know whether the Syrians have ever made." 
"But we have to thanks us despite everything with them." 
"This should cause at least confusion when the Iranians." 
Clotilde Reiss returned on May 16, 2010 to France. 
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes you at the Elysée. 
In a press release, he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for its "active role in favour of the release of our compatriot."
