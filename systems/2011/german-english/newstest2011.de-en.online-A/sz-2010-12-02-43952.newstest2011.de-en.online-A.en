Love in time of war 
After Angelina Jolie started working on their yet unnamed directorial debut in the summer, there is trouble. 
The script has it even written a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serb man. 
You don't know much more about but already this is enough for concern. 
Stubbornly holds the woman, a Muslim is the rumor, fall during the Yugoslavia war in their Serbian rapists. 
Bosnian women immediately protested and some shooting days in Sarajevo planned deployed at short notice to Hungary. 
In the meantime is shot the film in Hungary and in post production, but it is still protested in Bosnia. 
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of female war victims wrote of the UN refugee Commission UNHCR on Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is even Ambassador of the UN's refugee fund. 
It is not diplomatic - it has offered have a meeting in Hungary the women weeks ago, what you but rejected. 
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, so Hasecic. 
There have been no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude tell her enough about the screenplay to the victims. 
Their organization has recommended the UN refugee relief according to dismiss Jolie, as Ambassador, reported the guardian. 
What exactly but wrote Jolie for scenes? 
The Bosnian Ministry of culture, which got to read their screenplay, has approved a rotation for Sarajevo after some back and forth - it is not clear why Jolie then still not arrived. 
The young author himself asserts she follow no political intentions with her movie, have incorporated with much difficulty in the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties involved. 
The content, it will remain however vague. 
So still a second synopsis to the film in the network, which then but quite unlike sounds courses: the lover knew it even before the outbreak of the war and meet again as she, a Bosnian Muslim, is kidnapped in a Serbian camp where he works as a guard. 
What sounds Yes but significantly different than the variant "Rape verknallt in torturer." 
That Jolie's begins film actually even before the war - so much is certain. 
The pressure on them, so Jolie, was "unfair and based on misinformation." 
Now you can get only the hackers of Hollywood peace: by providing the script, like so many before, illegally in the network.
