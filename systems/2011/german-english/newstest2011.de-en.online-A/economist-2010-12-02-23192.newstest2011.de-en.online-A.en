The demo katrische routine 
The democracy movement in Latin America is more like the support of private companies. 
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment. 
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is larger than that of the United States. 
The Latinobarómetro poll was carried out in 18 countries and exclusively published in the Economist came to these results. 
This survey is carried out regularly since 1995 and shows the change of opinion in this region. 
Two facts are in the this year's survey of September and October in's eye. 
First the good mood in Latin America 
and secondly the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions. 
In many countries of the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has greatly increased (see table 1). 
In Peru for example, where the economy every year since 2002 is growing by around 6%, the number of the democracy advocates from 40% increased in 2005 to 61% this year. 
Also in Mexico, where the economy recovered again since the strong decline in the last year, is such a trend to recognize. 
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region are convinced Democrats, which reduces the regional average (see chart 2). 
Approximately 44% of respondents said that they be satisfied with the democratic practice in their country. As many as in the last year are 25%, but more than in 2001 (chart 3). 
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their Government. Both values are the same as last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively). 
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined the efforts for more democracy. 
That this lasted also during the great depression, may reason that the countries of Latin America experienced only a short recession and recovered quickly. 
In addition, the poor were offset by a stronger social network. 
(According to the reports of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week the poverty rate in Latin America rose 2009 only slightly and has again fallen by 32% this year.) 
But from country to country, there are strong differences in mood (see chart 4). 
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a common progress thinking. 
In Mexico and Central America, where more noticeable was the recession and violent crime have increased, this less is the case. 
Only for the second time since the start of the survey many respondents see a bigger problem than in the unemployment in Latin America in the crime in their country (see Chart 5). 
About 31% morethan that either yourself or a family member have been victims of crime in the last year. However, compared to 38% in the last year have dropped the values and thus achieve the lowest level since 1995. 
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the increased support of the private and the market economy: about 71% of respondents also indicated that the private sector for the development is essential, in the year 2007, there were 56% (see chart 6). 
About 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% in the last year. 
Interestingly 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although its leftist President, Hugo Chavez, many private companies nationalised. 
Brazil has the greatest weight in the region, according to 19% of the respondents (18% in the last year) followed by the United States (9%), unchanged since last year and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year). 
The respondents in Mexico and the most countries of Central America, however, see where to seize this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela in the United States of the most influential country.
