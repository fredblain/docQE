Belarus agrees accumulate not weapons-grade uranium 
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide has the Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will collect not more longer highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. 
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of Security Summit. 
The Government had for years tried to convince Belarus to collect not more highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring. 
However, official of the US Government told the Washington Post that two secret with Belarus have been taken in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian Research Institute. 
That was the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds. 
The agreement seems to be "Nuclear security summit of the 47 Nations" of April had excluded Belarus one of the most important results of Obama's. 
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next Summit in 2012. 
"I was really excited by the fact that they want a seat in the nuclear security Summit (by 2012)." 
"That shows me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the global security partnership, a group for the promotion of nuclear safety. 
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant and important step" of Belarus. 
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years. 
Since then, the Government has helped six countries to get rid of their highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus will be the seventh. 
A dozen countries have done it under the administration of George W. Bush. 
At the time of Obama's nuclear security Summit, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that the nation will never give up its uranium. 
"How keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos which is fundamentally waffenfähig and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time. 
"This is our raw material..." "We will make no dirty bombs from it and we will sell it to anyone." 
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all." 
Belarus closer to be still the United States a few months ago, it announced interest in the meeting of an agreement. 
The first attempt to remove uranium of Belarus in October was particularly complicated, because the material was easily contaminated, official say. 
It was loaded in a special train, the more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for official say. 
The second attempt was adopted on Monday and was carried out according to the officials by plane. 
For this effort, the U.S. Government pays $14 million, with flows much of the money in the Belarusian research with low enriched uranium, which can be used for nuclear weapons. 
"This was very carefully co-ordinated and adapted, to build confidence," which led to the agreement which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of energy, which works to reduce global danger. 
The James Martin Center for non-wide location end studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of waffenfähhigen uranium this year as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. 
Belarus wants to resolve his camp by 2012 according to the common agreement. 
The relations between Belarus and the United States were strained for years, mainly because Lukashenkos harsh violation of human rights. 
But the statement Wednesday suggests a possible approach. 
"The progress of this global security issues, heißend welcome to the United States of America and Belarus announce that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in the bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
