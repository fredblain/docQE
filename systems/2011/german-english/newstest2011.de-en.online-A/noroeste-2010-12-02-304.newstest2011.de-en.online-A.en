The United States changes the rules for obtaining a visa 
The people need to think of before their conversation at the Consulate at the service centers to the visa application; Cost will be so reduced waiting times. 
From 10 January 2011 change the procedures for applying for a visa in the United States Embassy and the consulates. 
The new procedure, most applicants must present before their conversation in the Consulate at the service centers to the visa application (ASC, the initials in English). 
The staff of the ASC takes up the biometric data of the applicant, be checked by the Consulate before talking. 
The new procedure has certain advantages for the post-graduate students, include: 
Reducing the total cost for the processing of visa, because it is no longer required the appointment, to pay the processing of visa application and the transport services, with which the document is issued separately. 
The applicant makes only a single payment covering the three services. 
The current price remains unchanged: the Gegenwerit to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa application (including visa for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for trader and investor. 
Those who only want to extend your Visa, must result in no conversation in the Consulate, they need to think only in the nearest ASC, where they submit their documents and their fingerprints are taken. 
Because the biometric data in the ASC are obtained, the applicant need a second date for the interview in the Consulate, remain there less time than in the past. 
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Ju√°rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo, must no longer pay the service fee of $26.
