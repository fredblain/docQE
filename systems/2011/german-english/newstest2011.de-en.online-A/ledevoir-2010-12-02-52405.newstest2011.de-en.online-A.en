Global plan for the renewal of the lighting 
The UN has proposed yesterday a plan for the renewal of the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in terms of achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (CFC) in Cancun, which is almost one-third of the additional reduction must be implemented, to stabilize the Earth's climate by 2020. 
This ambitious plan takes up his position in the steps of the concrete projects which implement the United Nations in Cancun hopes to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments of developed countries. 
According to the plan yesterday expressed the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (GT) of CFCs votes due to the lighting on the Earth would be avoided if the incandescent bulbs, which has a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, by fluorescent or better yet, would be replaced by light-emitting diodes (LED). 
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. 
This corresponds to the equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the worldwide fleet. 
In Copenhagen the large exhaust issuers such as the United States, China, Europe, and others, which was also Canada, had committed last year to voluntary reduction plans, which should reduce the global CFC emissions of 53 gt on 49 gt. 
From this balance sheet, you would have to deduct still 5 GT today by the year 2020 to stabilize the climate increase to 2 degrees Celsius, to make sure that this gets out of control. 
95% Of the energy in the form of heat escapes in the incandescent bulbs, and the remaining 5% produce the light. 
Reduce the energy consumption by 75% with the compact fluorescent bulbs, with the new LED light bulbs, you reduce this energy again to twice. 
The compact fluorescent bulbs keep on average between 6000 to 10,000 hours. 
The new LED light bulbs, as for example those which the manufacturer of Philips has brought this week on the market - this company has by the way in the UN study competition - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives a hint of the savings of the Auswechselung plan, which should be applied in 100 countries. 
In addition to the fact that hese completely new light bulbs make only very little heat, they can work with a variable resistors. 
And they contain no mercury. 
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury, and that you therefore must dispose it as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except the producers provide a reception. 
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet is the report, but as not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather to the coal plants that emit much more mercury, the electricity wasted by the incandescent bulbs produce. 
Alone in the United States, these coal plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year. 
The report sets out in detail the profits, which would generate each country thanks to this international program. 
Indonesia would cut such as a billion dollars a year to buy electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which corresponds to an equivalent of 3.5 coal, whose building 2.5 billion would cost Indonesia.
