NASA Announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life 
The North American space agency convened a press conference, tomorrow a Fund of output, the impact on the search for life in space have is. 
The national air and Space Agency (NASA) of the United States Announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiologische discovery, which could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life. 
The Fund will be presented tomorrow at 1 P.m. at a press conference in the seat of the NASA in Washington of experts of astrobiology. It is a science that investigates the origin, development, distribution and the future of life in the universe. 
In convening the press conference, NASA assured she will present "an attendant pathogenic find for the search for extraterrestrial life," causing speculation among experts of other countries. 
The discovery could prove the theory that human-like creatures can exist in hostile environments, which was previously thought to unbwohnbar. It was raised the hypothesis that this could turn into intelligent beings - like people, if that improved their living conditions. 
Apparently is a Microbe that Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, was found at the bottom of the Mono. She lives there in an environment, which is considered too toxic for all conceivable forms of life, because the Lake is heavily arsenhaltig. 
In any way, the Mikrobie used the arsenic as of life resource. Taking into account this ability increase the chances that there might be similar life on other planets, who do not have our protective atmosphere. 
If these organisms metabolize arsenic, has been established in accordance with the astrobiologists "a different way of life, a second life lack actual, which differs from the US known." 
The space agency announces the actual range of their funds tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference. 
In the Conference take part the GEO biologist Pamela Conrad, which is studying the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, under one of the scientists, the Titan (Saturn's largest moon) the question whether its chemical composition resembles that of the Earth, studied.
