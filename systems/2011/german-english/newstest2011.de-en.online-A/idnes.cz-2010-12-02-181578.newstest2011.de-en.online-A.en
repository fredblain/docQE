A charnel house fascinated even after 100 years. Take a look at the Interior of Gaudi 
The roof appears to like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs as the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are open Fischmäuler. 
This is the Casa Batlló of by Catalan Architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. 
By the local inhabitants, the House with its organic forms was nicknamed "Bone." 
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile pieces and mosaic, the facades reminiscent of scales and ubiquitous soft lines, all of these are typical features of the art nouveau style by Antonio Gaudí. 
The façade of the House plays with beautiful lines, delicate colors and textures that remind of nature and living beings. 
Only on closer inspection we noticed that everything from geometry, rhythm and sophisticated order dominated. 
In the night, the whole facade of still plastic, dramatic works and the special ilumination reinforced the splendour of colours. 
The same energetic lines and meandering forms dominate the Interior of the House. 
Wave shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, and even loopholes and bars. 
The House Batlló in the district Eixample to lively shopping street Passeig formed by the conversion of a house built in 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese said de Gracia No. 43. 
The reconstruction took two years to complete and was completed in 1906. 
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed to the idea of Gaudí on an unusual and even cheaper tag. 
The tenement house Casa Batlló designed not only to Antoni Gaudí. 
This, he has collaborated with the architect Josep Maria Jujol. 
On the drawing board developed the decorations for the prestigious apartment of the owner of the reality and the use of mosaics on the façade was his idea. 
On the facade, but also many other designers and artists worked with. 
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudi. 
So, Jujol participated also in the construction of Gaudí's House Casa Mila in the Park Güell, in which there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí. 
Shortly after its completion was the home of the local inhabitants of his organic forms due to the nickname "Bone." 
Others called it the special window mechanism due to the "yawning House." 
It is also said at the top on the building the sword of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia is shown. 
But also other sculptural elements symbolize hidden religious motives. 
Gaudí designed a unique for that time central heating system with vents and typical chimneys for the House. 
Somewhat bizarrely, their 45 degrees appears to already. 
In his work, ignored Gaudi consistently all the building and was not swayed by them. 
Pre-construction he caught up while the corresponding construction permit from the city, but the details of the planned reconstruction made by him were so vague that the city fathers two years later so shocked by the result were at the completion, that they demanded redress. 
The Councillors came also from that of construction with its pillars intervened even in the public sidewalk. 
To changes it no longer was on the contrary - just fifteen days after the relevant call of the neighborhood Josep Batlló made an application for approval of letting the two highest floors of the House - and it was promptly granted. 
The owner of the House was a in the lower floors. 
The Gallery on the 2nd floor was a room of the society, there were the bedrooms and rooms of the apartment on the third floor. 
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry shop. 
The entire six-storey building through a staircase up to the roof terrace. 
By the fundamental elements of the conversion, were all right angles and straight lines removed, and replaced by bent and curved walls. 
Gaudi worked also with a modern approach to the interconnection of spaces. 
The social part can join totally by the opening of the Salon doors and so a larger company could chat easily, without having to give up to a certain intimacy in vertraulicheren talks. 
The House received tag except a new facade by Gaudí's also a quite unusual roof and two more floors. 
Impressively Gaudí also is playing with the light and the blue and white glazed tiles, with which the courtyard is covered and the borderlands. 
The game of these two colors brings a high light all floors of the House. 
This, he made the principle advantage that white better reflects light as dark colors which absorb the sunlight on the contrary is simply. 
Anyone can visit the House of Casa Batlló, recorded in the UNESCO's World Heritage list in 2005, today. 
The most spacious and most beautiful apartment of the public is made on the first floor. 
The homeowners decided only in the years to this step and this on the occasion of 150.Geburtstags of the famous creator. 
When you realized that this is a very profitable business, we continued to use the visits, yes you expanded it to more common and the Attic rooms, including the roof terrace. 
The price to visit the monument is however not chicken-feed, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups, and owner of tourist passes are given a 20 percent discount. 
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaudi buildings in the city. 
If you would like to know the real atmosphere of the House with his dragon turret, should try to close friendship with one of the inhabitants of the House and visit him at home.
