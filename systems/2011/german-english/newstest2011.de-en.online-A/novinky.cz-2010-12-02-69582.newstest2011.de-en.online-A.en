Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum is beer out - it is simply too slow 
Fernet, rum and vodka, exceptionally also times a good whisky, which it has stolen the father from the hotel bar. 
These are the drinks, after benefiting drunken Czech teenager under fifteen most emergency must treatment. 
Children have to sleep her cat repeatedly in the hospital are no exception. 
This is from the experience of doctors out, who are confronted with similar cases in the recording of the Kinderabteilungen of clinics. 
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion, because it takes just too long to get drunk." 
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol," said pravo Luděk Pelican, the chief physician of the children's Department in the Central-Bohemian clinic Hořovice. 
"Whiskey, if it is possible to take a bottle from the bar to the father, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka." 
"Vodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then he smells not as strong," said the head doctor. 
The speaker of the Faculty hospital Motol Eva such innovator gives him quite. 
"Most it is Fernet or rum." 
"This is the today's trend of alcohol, especially at primary school level." 
"Occasionally it was also about Slivovice, which takes you away from home," a leader in woman used innovator. 
Pelican according to chief physician are dreizehn-or ballet drinkers in the hospital has long been no exception. 
Before the clinic in Hořovice, where he has worked for this year, he worked for ten years in the Pediatrics Department of hospital Motol, where the ambulance near and far offloaded angetrunkene students from. 
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times." 
"Started her career at the age of 12, when she first was admitted to alcohol in the blood and in combination with"Ecstasy"with 3.5 per thousand," the doctor described a particularly serious case. 
"She was in the exhibition grounds in Holešovice to any dance party." 
"The interesting thing here was that it her mother not at all strange seemed, that their daughter 48 hours not homeward was to," the Director wonders. 
Just the missing interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance in the clink glasses with the own offspring is regarded as one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism of children. 
A real dependency in the true sense of the word is according to experts, when children do not. 
"Alcoholism is to a long-term chronic dependency of the phenomenon related to alcohol and all that and that is not the case with these children." 
"Among those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative familial and social background is characterized by mostly," explains head Pelican. 
The spokeswoman of the Hospital of Motol, woman used innovator, were until mid-November about 40 drunken children in the local Department of children and adolescent medicine trained. 
However, only the cases with severe alcohol intoxication, which necessitated a hospital stay, enter into the statistics. 
Drunken children, marketed by the parents or, where appropriate, by the police, home to outpatient treatment, are not registered. 
Except in the cases where children drink only times as a bottle of liquor in the back to school, there are three seasonal amplitude, that is one hundred percent reliable according to Mr Pelikan: Walpurgis night, new year's Eve and the end of the school year. 
"The latter for two reasons - either in grief because of the bad certificate or from joy at the holidays." 
"In the Walpurgis night I have experienced at one time even seven drunken children in establishing" stressed doctor Pelikan. 
A drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision, is paradoxically better off as a child who has to fight the next day only with an unpleasant hangover. 
You can distribute the headache the morning after, stemming from the dehydration and the lack of glucose, namely in the hospital with a liquid-giving infusion with glucose and nutrients are missing the organism that. 
"You are clearly better off, because after the"magnificent"in the evening, they awaken to good spirits without that somewhere, something hurts." 
"You are just confused about where they are," doctor Pelican admits, but he spoils the good mood the patients sometimes at least by he enumerates the cost them that the treatment will cost them. 
For the transport by ambulance and the night in an acute bed come easily to a few tens thousand crowns. 
"Every now and then I have used this as a means, if I have directly vorgerechnet the children during the visit, which took their drunkenness and that it is quite possible that they have to work the whole holiday about times to make the money for a single such Fête," added doctor Pelikan. 
In his view the health insurance funds are however not accordance with recourse procedures necessary for the treatment of drunken children costs from the parents claim.
