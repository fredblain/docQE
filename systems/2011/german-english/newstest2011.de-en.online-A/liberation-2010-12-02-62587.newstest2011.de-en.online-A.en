Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches 
Since the debate about the modernisation of the transport industry on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it's raining billions. 
At least in the discussions. 
One Paris call in particular the 23 billion for the Metro Grand is in memory, the of the Société du Grand Paris to be built. 
To direct the construction of the SSP in the way, the State has declared a capital endowment of EUR 4 billion. 
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum which would then allow the SGP to give a part of the financial value to her twice on the markets. 
Today, it has finally come to first projections. 
The supplementary budget by 2010, this morning revised by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly, contains the measures, to raise the first part of this money. 
It concerns two different operations: the creation of a special tax to the Erschließund and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France. 
The former, so it takes article 15 of the draft of the law, is "in favour of the public institution of Société du Grand Paris." 
It is estimated: "The product of this tax amounted to 117 million euros per year." 
Cities is a restructuring of existing business taxation: "to modernise it, the resulting from her product to increase and this increase of the Société du Grand Paris to deliver." 
How much would this bring? 
A mystery. 
This sum is not in the text. 
It is far from the 4 billion. 
"It is running, that the fiscal resources to the EUR 4 billion of the capital amount available is added, which are applied by the State and the Société du Grand Paris and be done for the project," is available in the explanatory statement. 
At of the SSP, you will find this system not offensive. 
"From the moment in which it recorded revenue (the two taxes, d. R.), you can cover the designing for over three years and then draw from the 4 billion," as explains. 
"This is recorded in the budget and deducted gradually." 
The SGP estimated that 2013 will be started 2014 to record the 4 billion for the budget. 
This measure, the 4 promised billions to is long can seek runs risk of provoking a very moving, parliamentary discussion. 
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
