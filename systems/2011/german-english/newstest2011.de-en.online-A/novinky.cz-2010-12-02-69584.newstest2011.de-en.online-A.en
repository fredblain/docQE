A long index finger as a ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer 
Men, whose Zeigefinger is long, as the ring finger, a lower-risk are obviously face of prostate cancer. 
This is the surprising results of a study, Journal of cancer was published on Wednesday by the British. 
This should indeed be testosterone with the mirror of the male hormone. 
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can be used as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer and this especially for men and sixty," declared the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, Professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick. 
The fingers could help to determine which men necessarily should be a prostate cancer test, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors exist such as for example familial health burdens, so Mrs Eeles added. 
In the period from 1994-2009, she pursued over 1500 patients with prostate cancer, and 3000 healthy men with their counterparts in Britain. 
More than half of the participants of the study of the index finger of his right hand was shorter than the ring finger. 
For these men was the same probability of prostate cancer, such as for 19 percent of men, the ring and index finger were the same. 
In men, whose Zeigefinger was longer than the ring finger, this risk but fell by 33 per cent, for men and sixty by 87 percent. 
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned finger, formed at the prenatal age, reflecting clearly the different levels of sex hormones, which was exposed to the child in the womb. 
Less testosterone is equivalent to an extended index finger. 
Previous research showed that just the testosterone accelerated the growth of prostate cancer. 
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticist and former Chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said CTK, it was this study briefly known, nevertheless he consider the ratio between the length of the finger and the risk of cancer so far for "fully established."
