PP calls for a postponement of the tax agreement of MAS 
The Chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez Camacho, yesterday seized the opportunity to present their conditions to support his entry into Office as Prime Minister of the Generalitat Artur Mas personally. These differ from the one made during the election campaign and can be summarised with the priority of economic recovery and the omission of regionalist independence adventures, such as a finance agreement, the regional leaders at the height of his mandate to propose. 
The Chairman of the Catalan people's Party turned with security on Artur MAS, which awarded 18 members, which they had - won on the last Sunday of a paragraph, which is more than enough to feel indispensable. As the candidate of the civic regionalist CiU party is to rely on that at least one of the opposition parties contains the vote when he became of the voice. 
The future alliances, which want to take the regionalists in the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Congress, hanging from a possible allied with the PP off. However, the talks leading MAS at the time with the other party leaders, revolve around Catalonia. 
With regard to the leader of the PPC, it calls that to support the entry into Office of the leader of CiU wants to submit "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia," as well as an agreement on the purpose of financial equalization between the State and the autonomous region - much like in the Basque country - and that even a referendum, be hired back. 
Is two political leaders have in common is that they want to make the exaggerated political apparatus of the regional government leaner and get rid of the inheritance and gift tax.
