Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris 
To participate in the Quebec Government, which by the Société Angus and parallel was prompted the company to financially in the takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond. 
The developer company of Angus as well as parallel, that a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of culture for the transfer of Daniel Langlois, cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard St. Laurent had hoped for the company, to deliver it again his actual cinematic function, apparently did not get what they have requested. 
Although, the Government has accepted to involve themselves, but on their own terms on this matter. 
Instead of the expected donation, Government provides the Quebecers rather a bond in lower than initially expected height, which could call a viable solution to favourable conditions in life, at least according to the sources removable from the public rumor mill. 
A first action plan, as well as a question about 12.8 million were rejected last spring by the Quebec, the Bittgesuch was revised again in terms of sum since the downwards. 
A proposal together with an action plan were already by the President of the "Société de développement of des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, sent to Minister St-Pierre, who heads the file eXcentris. 
Several days ago, he had send her to a last case report. 
The counter-proposal of the Cabinet sent the SODEC however on Wednesday. 
Parallel and Angus have time to respond to this now to 31 December. 
In any case the premise of State donation really seems to be marginalized to the page. 
We recall in memory that Québec community of owners of movie theaters and cinema complexes which had revolted against a direct State investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris, by she made the argument of the Minister of culture have no financial help for real estate projects to make , that he not also other cinemas have send. 
Several other market participants of the segment filed a lawsuit, however, a substantial economic assistance on the other hand. 
Cinema Chief Daniel Langlois presented for over ten years the Auteur cinema in the premises of his cinema complex on a self-financed design of cinema with great difficulty, which could justify the special position on the part of the Treasury. 
The lack of cinemas showing independent films, is more than evident in Montreal, and eXcentris knew his clientele in the rod to keep. 
The Société Angus, as well as the company parallel with Christian Yaccarini at the top, control in turn a privately funded Campagne to from it a sum of 700 $000 hope to stimulate the acquisition. 
Since the spring of 2009, only a single screen so that will continue to show, namely Le movies in eXcentris parallel. 
The future acquirer aims to reopen the three cinemas February of next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "des hommes et des dieux" on the 27. 
Christian Yaccarini but has not dismissed the newspaper "Le Devoir" and ignoring keep what he and his group the proposals downwards you made them.
