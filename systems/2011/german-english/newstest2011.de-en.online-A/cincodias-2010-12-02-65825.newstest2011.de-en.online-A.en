Red bull back on top in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens 
The cars are improved with a software in real time. 
Since Red Bull 2004 penetrated into the world of F1, is their history in this exquisite universe of the speed of surprises and successes. 
Initially, no one gave the novice attention and despite his steeply ascending career during the last seasons, all on the victory of Ferrari's Fernando Alonso put in the final sprint last November. 
Without wanting to reduce the capabilities of German pilots and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the engine by Renault, the "secret weapon," is the multi Siemens Red Bull to put hands, and so created a winning team, become the legend. 
In reality is a powerful software for the simulation of processes that brought the German company for purposes that have to do with race, 2007 on the market. 
This computer programme called PLM was used for the development of Assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments. 
Is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is before it is actually built to avoid such mistake and unnecessary costs. 
PLM has facilitated the development of the Canon cameras, the aircraft from Sukhoi and the most famous commercial vehicles from Nissan. 
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Industry Department of Siemens, explains that with the use of this software in the formula 1 - factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements that are found on the race and test, can design and execute. 
Russwurm executes that in 1992 in the teams on average ten technicians worked, which could introduce improvements at most three or four in one season. 
In Red Bulls team today 180 highly qualified young people are employed. With powerful computer equipment they carry out analyses and all possible changes to the car. 
The Siemens Manager stated that the PLM software was all components of the cars in the location, by Red Bull to analyse and improve, with the exception of the engine for the only Renault declared responsible. 
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the security elements are changed. 
Changes can be propagated thanks to advanced production facilities and tech autoclave less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of the Simulator to reality. 
The $40 million that should output a formula 1 - team for his race in a season are the only limit that is set to this crazy technical perfectionism. 
Red bull has built up 50 kilometres from London his high-tech factory for the development and production of his car in a remote location. 
It is two buildings where visits - especially of journalists - are strongly limited. 
Everything that happens, there is top secret. 
The staff includes 580 persons, including the two pilots, the world champions of Vettel and Mark Webber. 
But Red Bulls real formula 1 - hero is without a doubt the most recent world champion Sebastian Vetell. 
Hides the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer in the services is participating on the race tracks, is the other protagonists, which support is invaluable and their popularity equal to zero. 
The Technologichef of the work, Steve Nevey, stressed that one could still say five years ago, that the progress in the field of R & D for racing cars with 50 percent contributed to the victory and the pilot for the rest were responsible. 
Today, the unit values have changed. The technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent. 
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by it, because they "are not predictable Gladiators."
