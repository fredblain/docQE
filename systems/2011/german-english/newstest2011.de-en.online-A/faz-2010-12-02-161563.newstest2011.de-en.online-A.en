The ice cream University 
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, Eiskonditoren be prepared for better seasons. 
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from around the world. 
Where is the whole ice actually? 
The Gelatiere and the Gelataio. 
The Gelatiere, on German something Capitalis Eiskonditor, produces the cream according to all rules of the Italian ice making art. 
The Gelataio brings the ice cream from the cooling counter with a spatula, remove them in the waffle and then sells them. 
To know that we must not go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna. 
But if you would like to know more about ice passes not at the Italian company cream "Gelato University." 
The ice cream University established the manufacturer of ice cream makers in 2003 for the ice cream from his machines to anywhere the high Italian ideals meet. 
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world. 
There are also several-day special courses around the chocolate ice cream and internships in the hotel's own ice cream parlor. 
Some dreams in the midlife crisis of a new career, others just venture on the smooth ice of their vague aspirations. 
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil on Hungary to Saudi Arabia. 
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and will in future offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial ice-cream. 
Anke from Berlin is business consultant and wants something own eintüten after years in a racking job. 
Two young Egyptians dream to open an ice cream parlor in Cairo. 
A man from Malta and one from Brazil to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes, because their children love Italian ice cream. 
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari the participants explain the ideal properties of perfect ice cream. 
Not only good taste, but also the silky smoothness and good consistency is crucial. 
Luciano forgets his training but also not the icing of the national and at all Mediterranean superstructure: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then many romance is in the process." 
The first step to establishing seems easy. 
Luciano flips the ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large food that heated to 85 degrees, all with an electronic program and cools down immediately to four degrees. 
Then it rotates on a cock on the machine and out comes a pasteurised white base cream, basis for all kinds of Milcheis. 
Immediately to overwhelm the lecturer with questions: you can make ice cream with natural substances without stabiliser? 
How can you let loose the own experimentation? 
Luciano warns to guide the spirit of the times misleading. 
If you talk about ice cream "only from natural ingredients," stabilizers used probably still - usually a natural product, such as guar gum from the guar. 
Course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, only it must be sold within one day, otherwise it sags together in, and the customer bites on sheer ice grains. 
Some variations on the basic dimensions are allowed. 
It is more exciting with the flavors. 
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients to buy in the fruit Division or the sweets of the supermarket. 
In addition, are there powders and pastes. 
"The supplier will try all you foist dozens flavored additives." 
"But you should just experiment." 
Either in the fruit sherbets with fresh fruit and sugar. 
Or just by the ice cream from the white footprint, which becomes the yellow cream with eggs and cocoa powder to the basis for all possible chocolate temptations. 
Now, may the students at the ice cream makers. 
Luciano can they produce four types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the basic dimensions, with more or less vanilla flavouring or other natural additives. 
The types of Fruchteis are subject to the same experiment. 
Taste that is not necessarily better more flavouring substances, more fruit puree. 
Hazelnut ice cream tastes not necessarily nutty if it contains more hazelnuts. 
The most popular Kiwi ice provides her the group that used more fruit, less water and less stabilizer. 
Only a balance between properly highlight the taste of gelato, says Luciano. 
Ice production is a math question: peach purée is used with much sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe should be reduced. 
Lemon ice cream requires an extra dose of sugar. 
Luciano takes out a device with which it determines the sugar content of fruit varieties (winemakers to measure the Oechsle in the grape must). 
Fortunately, tables facilitate the Rechnerei. 
To make ice requires not so much physical use as before. 
Not only the device for the automatic production of the footprint helps. 
There is also a device where the finished ice cream mixture is beaten at the same time creamy and cooled to minus temperatures. 
Small glitches remain insufficient all automation despite. 
The Brazilian Gustavo covered himself and his course mates from top to bottom with fruit puree, as it turns the oversized hand blender out of control. 
"In each course," says Maestro Luciano, "is it happening only a matter of time before something."
