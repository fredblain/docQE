Zapatero and the red line of Germany 
Berlin has for the maintenance of the euro decided, but at the same time set up conditions for the entire European Union. 
The tensions in the markets have caused a duplicate response of the Government. 
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adaptation, from tax reductions for small and micro-enterprise, the regulation of temporary work agencies or the abolition of the 426 euro support for unemployed people, assume no unemployment benefits, and up to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of the airport of Barajas and El Prat and 30 percent of the State Lottery. 
On the other hand, the Deputy Head of the Government supported, Elena Salgado, have with the help of former President Felipe Gonzalez criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible that the current crisis out beschwört. 
How are these processes to understand? 
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is no fault of their public relations. 
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the new definition of the euro. 
This Germany occupies a fundamentally new perspective to the design of our future, which is in conflict with the maintenance of the old traditions of the majority of its partners. 
In view of the resistance in Europe to start three possible ways out of the crisis in Germany to spekuliern. 
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South would have to leave the euro area. 
The second: The reintroduction of the German mark - although that currently more to science fiction sounds-, supported by a majority of public opinion, about 50% of the population. 
The third: A transformation of the euro in accordance with the German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict financial management; Punishment of countries that violate the requirements; möglichereweise the suspension of payments in some countries, as well as the extension of the costs of potential adaptation measures on the private sector. 
The German position is unique and stands out for some time. Therefore, there are now no excuses. 
First 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission incentives made for deficits and the German Government is moved a constitutional reform from the sleeves to prevent this from 2016. 
This was the first sign of the divergence between what was Germany necessary (strict control plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. 
The second character was the Central European country as Merkel painful went the decision to save Greece. 
At the time that was strongly criticized. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the public opinion absolutely against a rescue of Greece were. 
Finally, Merkel comes out in the last days of October with a distinct location. You calls for a reform of the European Union agreements to allow the rescue of a country and to commit the private lenders at the same time, to take a share of the cost. 
This position has been designed as anti-European because she drove the Ireland crisis and all following. 
But their proposal if something sweetened, was adopted. In the next few months, we will take part in the reform of the European Union aimed at these measures as from 2013. 
Germany has drawn a red line, which intends not to exceed it. 
It says all that - although now infamous - measures are no longer is there the old workings of the euro after this date. 
2013 will be the year of birth of a new area, where the offending countries be punished hard, may be forced to do so, to declare insolvent and in this case, the private sector must assume part of the costs. 
Germany shows US that we must, take a hard course of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improving the productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances. 
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it was mentioned by Spain in boom times, will simply not be tolerated. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would do bad to understand it. 
It is not just a question, up to three percent by 2013 down up the budget deficit. 
The demands are much harder. 
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, is to deceive ourselves. 
I hope that the current turmoil in more peace move. 
And that we will use the opportunities offered to us by spring 2013. 
It seems that Zapatero has also understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies on Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, Establishing order in the House, their way is has. 
But the red line drawn by Germany is here, and it looks not like that because something would change. 
Among the possibilities under consideration, which is that we would have to leave the euro area crowded with little serious countries, cannot be ruled out. 
In this case Germany could tell US still, it had warned us.
