Apparently, the A380 has a major security problem. 
Investigators have discovered a potential building error when investigating an emergency hand machine, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure." 
The airline of Qantas will now sue the engine manufacturer. 
The passengers of emergency that Qantas Airbus early November had apparently much better luck so far known as: the Australian air safety authority has found a major security problem with the engines of some A380 machines in their investigations - and now warns of a potential building error. 
The potential failure would have serious consequences: when an oil hose connection, it could produce fatigue cracks and leaks, according to an opinion of the authority of ATSB published this Thursday. 
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure." 
Produced engines in 20 of the A380 series aircraft were affected by Rolls-Royce. 
Including the Qantas Airbus, which make an emergency had to landing on 4 November in Singapore is located. 
The Australian airline has launched now legal action against the British turbine manufacturers. 
She filed a claim in an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which enable him to further legal action against the company. 
Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said his airline will demand compensation for the incident in early November. 
During the fire of the engine had to solve parts and damaged the wing. 
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as the cause of the damage. 
After the incident, now worldwide up to 40 engines need to be replaced. 
The Australian investigators announced to carry out further security tests on the Superjumbos, equipped with the affected engines. 
The Security Advisory is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan. 
The vulnerability had been kept sufficiently important, to inform all interested parties. 
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine the airline had held for weeks their A380 fleet on the ground. 
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of his eleven A380 on the ground. 
The Lufthansa moved off the engine at an A380 as a precaution. 
The double-deck aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
