Enigmatic earthworks 
The Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria. 
It defends itself but to comment - still, it allows for controls. 
Around midnight of the fifth on the 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I zetar a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria aircraft. 
It stands on the Bank of the Euphrates; the nearest large town, 30 km away, is Deir as-Saur. 
Her name occurs in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor, Syria has reportedly built with help from North Korea in the box tucked into a Valley, which starting from the current. 
According to a briefing of US foreign secret service CIA by end of April 2008 he would have been common reactor well suited under the name of the nearby village el ilgen, to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons build left. 
For other purposes, however, is hardly the technology from the 1950s. 
The CIA presented a video presentation with fuzzy satellite images. 
Per computer animation, she dazzled in where which components of the reactor from destruction should have been, which is a scaled-down copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear Center. 
Also she presented photos that show the building from nearby or even the Interior. 
The reactor was said just before the entry into service, it was said have been fitted, but still not with fuel. 
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more known than it was then, Yes, the puzzles were rather larger with time. 
The former US President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA prior to the attack quite sure was, that Syria in el ilgen built a reactor, but saw little evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" the country. 
Some intelligence people in Europe are still rather more cautious and speak only of a "alleged reactor," even if they keep the CIA presentation for "plausible." 
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. 
Asked, how secure he was to have a reactor before him, a high-ranking UN diplomat replied in the summer only briefly, the IAEA had "enough material, to ask questions." 
The debris of the alleged "unused military building" made the Syrians while hastily aside and planierten the area thoroughly. 
Yet found in June 2008 an IAEA team under the previous Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el ilgen traces of uranium, which was made by people. 
In addition, the IAEA of a Member State received satellite of commercial provider from the period directly after the attack, which might be more meaningful when they presented by the CIA. 
However, these recordings on the market are not to get, because the unknown buyer - perhaps Israel - they exclusively bought. 
The IAEA can not independently verify therefore their authenticity. 
Syria has always asserted to have never operated a secret nuclear program or a reactor built. 
The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, Damascus said. 
But it rejected the IAEA for analysis of particles as unlikely. 
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss - as well as on the satellite images. 
In addition, it denied the inspectors a second inspection in el ilgen and the access to the ruins of the bombed-out building. 
But also Israel silent iron. 
"We are commenting that never," recently confirmed the incumbent at the time of the attack Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, the official position. 
As the investigation of the case dragging down without result since June 2008 and "is increasingly becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority," as a high-ranking Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna allows - finally is a serious violation of the NPT in the region, watching over the the IAEA. 
As the key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA is apparently three other facilities, which are - with the alleged reactor and other than this still exist "in functional connection." 
While the inspectors have so far revealed, what equipment it is, nor what they have or what they appear suspicious can be. 
According to information of the Sueddeutsche Zeitung, they are derived internally called Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, though during the IAEA of nearby cities. 
The independent Institute for science and international security in Washington (ISIS) has identified these places and on satellite imagery a building complex in Masyaf find made, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects. 
It is located in or immediately next to a military base - exactly on these grounds, Syria of the IAEA denied access to the three places. 
In Vienna, it is called the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be sent by the United States to obtain military equipment. 
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware through a tip of the US intelligence services on the facilities. 
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the box on the Euphrates material back and waste was. 
A high-ranking Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants may be "in connection with the production of fuel." 
There are "no indications on sensitive activities" but, therefore uranium enrichment or reprocessing; Processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons. 
The reactor type is operated while with uranium, which is not enriched. 
However, where the uranium would have to come from and where it later, the plutonium for the bomb should be split off, to have any plausible speculated these central issues. 
It is also unclear whether debris that could hold valuable traces, were stored in the three places. 
As the hundreds of truckloads of the ground would be gone, no one wants to have information about where the rubble remains. 
The salt mine of al-Tibni, 1998 Syria has examined for their suitability as a camp for radioactive waste, only a few kilometres from el ilgen on the other side of the Euphrates, is regarded as unlikely the IAEA. 
The former IAEA Inspector Robert Kelley had transferred recently Jane's intelligence review with the reactor in connection in an analysis of satellite imagery for the renowned magazine. 
Pictures from orbit show that Syria made earthworks in the three suspicious places and removed large container, after the IAEA had requested access. 
This may be coincidence, but hardly has helped dispel the suspicion. 
Also, is it in diplomatic circles, the IAEA have used quite a few months later, to develop a plan that would allow Syria, to maintain any military secrets-alone the effort shows how great is the interest of the inspectors for inspections there. 
However, Damascus ironed out also this proposal. 
Western diplomats in Vienna appeased had a year ago, the reactor was indeed destroyed, therefore the thing have no high urgency, brings about U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies since a few months known as special inspections in the game, one of the harshest means, which has the Vienna nuclear agency, to enforce controls. 
IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections has already talking "an option for which I am open to the future," but even he hesitates. 
It is a high risk in this way: on the one hand it needs for a majority in the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and quite a few of there represented 35 countries are far from being set on an escalation. 
On the other, as a diplomat to bear in mind is: "What is if they find nothing at the end?"
