Puigcercós is looking for loved ones peace in the ERC with a wink to the Carod 
The Republican leader allows a secret ballot of the Party of his continuation in Office. 
Huguet proposes a pluralistic Government and the end of the principle of the General Assembly. 
Joan Puigcercós seems a recipe to have found in order to go for the umpteenth time of an internal revolt in the ranks after the loss of 11 members and half of the vote of richtungslosen ERC out of the way. 
The party is aware that his resignation not enough the allies of the former party of Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is now so weakened as her mentor itself and not same headaches will give him like other former trends. 
That is why the leader of Esquerra trying with a wink to win the new critics, which would secure his position until the next local elections. 
For starters it announced yesterday on that the over 200 regional members of the Council of the ERC is secretly could talk about his stay in Office. 
With ballot papers, not with raised hand. 
If the Carodisten a ticket wanted to miss the Präsidenen, they could do so without fear of reprisals. 
Actually the boss would like to avoid the impression of Division as well as the submission under his person. 
In several interviews he confirmed he would feel not confirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added without specifying percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would also not good. 
The Carod demand allies of the President, to make his Office as only the party. An insufficient gesture since Puigcercós controlled the supreme body of the congresses. 
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to the promotion of resignations, they will schedule a process plan from now with the Executive Board until May. 
For them, expect to working on a document of strategic reorientation that the line on 18 will present to the Council to vote to be able to participate. 
Their intention is to guarantee Puigcercós. On the other hand this to promise, bring forward the Congress in the fall of 2011, which already holds the party leadership for a fact. 
The Party Chairman who is ERC believes that "Polyphony" too bad the stability and he is one for all time, the organization in a position to bring to wash their dirty laundry behind closed doors. 
In this sense, the article-in-Office Conseller Josep Huguet signed on his blog, is symptomatic. 
In view of this, which is an ideologist Puigcercos, the owner of Innovació held it for a fact that the leader "in exchange for various objectives" was backed up. 
He was on five, of which two are in the foreground are. 
First, the "restructuring" of the Board, so that this represents at least 90 percent of party members, that is the inclusion of new faces from car store environment. 
The second could be the big news. 
Huguet proposes ERC should finally give up the Assembly principle as functioning. 
Thus, he advocates a reform of the statutes that it will enable the congresses with elected delegates hold. 
By the end of the Assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós ' team, which fought on the last two congresses for this, is how obsessed. 
Actually, the party leadership was commissioned on the trembling Assembly of 2008 with the review of the principle of the Assembly on a Congress which should address the reform of the statutes. 
This date is still out as infogle which trouble the last few years internal addressing this matter was not advisable. 
Now, without the critical sectors in wait are, the time could be come to again take up this matter and complete forever.
