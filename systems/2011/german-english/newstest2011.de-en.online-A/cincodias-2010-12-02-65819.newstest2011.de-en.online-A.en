Stopping the European Central Bank (ECB) 
The investors yesterday sharply responded to the threat of ECB President Trichet, who warned "The markets should not underestimate our capacity to react." 
Dramatically increased the risk premiums of EUR Peripheriländer and the share of European banks to more than 5%. 
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can fool and the euro hardly points has increased what causes for concern. 
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, which recovered to the extent where he collapses, however as a result of the closure of a short and highly speculative positions. 
The institutional investor will still lose his fear not long. 
Today a month ago the European Central Bank called on us to undo our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen, according to which the ECB must make back down tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably quite a few times in the future. 
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to buy government debt, because they are ineffective, as well as the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only a one-week unlimited access should be maintained. 
After the Ireland crisis, we expect that extended the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and the quarterly tender with unlimited access to the end of the period to ensure the liquidity will be maintained until at least June. 
Also, we expect that the programme for the purchase of bonds continue and a hearty signal is output. 
If the created expectations are not met, the excellent response of the markets of the past are thrown back again and if halstarrig is insisting, that we take back our liquidity measures, may God help us! 
As well as at the ECB meeting in may, which confirmed the Bank to consider the purchase of State debt securities not take into account and the markets crashed as a result, this story could repeat tomorrow. 
The ECB must be credible and persistent. 
In may she showed the teeth and on Wednesday she is said to have bought much which she provoked a new collapse of the market. 
Yesterday, the auction of one-year government bonds in Portugal was pretty weak. 
The State asset management output only 500 million to 5,28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction. 
Nevertheless fell Portugal interest rates by 30 basis points in the entire curve and thus reflected a change in the perception of the markets according to Trichet's. 
The figures of debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published in Ireland. 
The sum is estimated to be approximately 10 000 million in the short term and possible further 15 000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks be nationalized. 
Although Ireland has completely lost his credibility after it had not recognized the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures in the part of the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce the uncertainty. 
However, the Government must get the parliamentary approval of his new budget next Tuesday. Because she always does not have the sufficient support, Ireland is also still a source of uncertainty. 
Angela Merkel made moderate their discourse relating to the Summit of the heads of State and Government on 14 December. There, political unit is required to show that we share same score play. 
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the Ninth Symphony of Beethoven's. 
The President of the Spanish Government yesterday presented the action plan, to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday. 
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions, such as in the financial institutions, reducing the State deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job-making measures. Measures that four seasons sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldi's. 
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why has increased the Spanish Stock Exchange 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges. 
Compared to February, the response of the Government and the Spanish Central Bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect. 
Today, there is a major auction of three-year government bond, which will benefit from the effect of Trichet. Therefore, we rely on a strong demand, which will remove all doubts about our ability to debt restructuring. 
For Spain, applying for an assistance plan would be a sacrifice. 
We would get liquidity, we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are very expensive and the access to the markets would close without notice. 
Nevertheless our strategy should be the motto Caesar's wife: "Now is not only being, but also the appearance." 
Only courage, we do that!
