China maintains its goals to reduce greenhouse gases 
The representative of China on the COP16 said his country had made enormous efforts to reduce of the carbon tracks and it would maintain its offer, reduce to 2020 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases. 
China keeps its offer to cut emissions of greenhouse gases per cent up to 40 to 45 by 2020, assured Su Wei, the representative of that country on the COP16. 
In his first public appearance at the 16 world climate summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei assured, his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon tracks and for the conversion of its industry. 
He carried out that in the last four years his country had invested $245 million, to minimize emissions of greenhouse gases. 
However, he said that China would not change its targets, but would work together with the international community on this matter. 
He said that the Chinese strategy develop themselves in terms of climate change in four aspects: dialogue, building capacity, building institutions and support of pilot programmes. 
It had made progress in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law in the last year, which includes the objectives with regard to the reduction in the emission of gases, he said. 
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China the authorities of the States had collaborated with which the Central Government and the municipalities, to achieve the objectives for energy savings, more effective use of energy and the reduction of emissions. 
In addition, he carried out, some multi-annual plans in attack have been taken or completed, both those who were funded by the Chinese Government, and such, the funds from other countries were given. 
For example, was he had received on the programme for the effective use of energy, that was introduced in the last five years and investments of the United Nations (UN), the Government and from private hands. 
It is also a project at the provincial level on climate change, another to exchange of the traditional incandescent bulbs and another for the mitigation and adaptation, he said. 
Martin Krol, scientific advisors in terms of climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts were much greater than would generally be accepted. 
He pointed out that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases is six tonnes per person in China, while there were 100 tons in the United States. China is responsible for overall contribution according to the pollution. 
Also, it makes unprecedented progress in the use of energy. The energy efficiency has been increased in the last five years to twenty percent, and by the year 2020, another to do, he said.
