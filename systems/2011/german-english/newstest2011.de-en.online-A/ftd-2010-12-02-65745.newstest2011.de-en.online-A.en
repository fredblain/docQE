The Technical University of Braunschweig and the carmaker Volkswagen have invited the engineering and design students to a workshop. 
They should talk shop - and by the way, meet Volkswagen in a kind of ideas along with VW developers on the car of the future. 
In the competition for the brightest minds go now many companies in the melee and set, such as VW, in cooperation with the universities. 
Their mission: the most talented graduates as early as possible in the lecture halls to recruit before they come on the labour market and are courted by others.

Such cooperation, so Selle, are not uncommon. 
It is new so aggressively will gebuhlt to the students. 
Otherwise the focus "was more on the technical project," says Selle. 
The battle for the fresh graduate will probably even harder.

But they need to be promoting and booming especially to highly skilled workers. 
In particular graduates from the engineering disciplines are doing in an excellent negotiating position.

"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors." 
If you treat its people well and they identify with the company, then they would advertise from alone with friends and acquaintances for their employers. 
"This is like a game with gang," says Kriegler.
