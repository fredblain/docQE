The elderly nursing home confirms that the deaths to "lack of measures" are the result 
The owner of the nursing home in Olot do not rule out that her nurses killed eleven elderly 
The leaders of elderly nursing la Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference in which they pointed out what harm the criminal acts of Joan Vila of Dilmés - the nurse who had - killed at least eleven old people, for which he was responsible, during his work of the institution had added yesterday. 
The head of elderly nursing, Joan Sala, appeared in in the company of his lawyer, front court Joan Canada and announced "La Caritat wants to prosecute those responsible (for the deaths) ," but "the right and our liability are forcing us to the process and the civil liability" to accept. 
The institution must accept not only a social reputation because she had not found the criminal acts of the keeper, but pay now also a high amount of compensation is calculated by the attorneys for the families of the victims. 
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime goes back to August 2009 and that he had since then further murdered. 
The judge ordered to the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of elderly nursing - because he suspected that no doctor examined the deceased personally, but the formalities on the basis of their age and diseases were handled by phone. 
The head of la Caritat flatly denied this point and said that "lack measures the cause of the incidents could have been keinerzeit." 
The lawyer of la Caritat added that there "is no evidence for the negligent actions of a person other than the accused in the lawsuit." 
The baptized persons already as "Angel of death" confessed the day before yesterday eleven murders and declared to have the first crimes committed on 29 August 2009, and one and a half months later the second old lady murdered. 
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first crime in which he had given a mixture of different tranquilizers. 
The head of la Caritat stated that the access of staff to the medicines was difficult to control. 
The orderly set up the insulin injections and the relaxant cocktail at six crimes of nine to relieve the patients with the death of their suffering. 
But the results of laboratory analysis will highlight whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victim or whether he ausbrannte them from the inside by he administered them stage as he had done according to the confession in three women, that he murdered between 12 and 17 October. 
In la Caritat, it gives the statements of the keeper no faith, not even as regards the number of the related murders, which could well be more. This setting is therefore justified that Vila had made very different statements before the Court and that it makes no sense to change his approach after eight successful murder suddenly. 
They say they provided it is for this reason and the enlightenment of the reach of these incidents of the justice.
