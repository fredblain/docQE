With the results of the November 28 could be PP play a crucial role in the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona and Barcelona 
After the major voice and increase in members in the last regional election, which is PP view already on the parliamentary elections - preferred or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes obtained in these elections, this party is usually twice as high as that in the elections in Catalonia. 
So, the Catalan people's Party received 610.473 votes in the general election of 2008 while this section in the regional elections was 316.222 in the year 2006 only. 
On the last Sunday, the PPC scored 384.091 votes. 
If this rising trend - result of the diversion of Stimmenanteils of the PSC and the binding of the electorate of PP - should stop the analysts forecast the PP, that in the general election the PPC from 8 to 12 congressmen could drop while four (she now has 10) gain also CiU and the PSC would lose at least 9 members (of 25). 
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE. 
According to the analysis of the people's Party the ERC would lose a member of Parliament - currently has them three, while ICV could keep their members or a gain. 
The electoral calendar but should be maintained, is the next appointment with the local elections in the may of 2011. Also can the people's Party (PP) the tongue the scales one of the municipalities with the biggest budget be put an end to the Socialist hegemony in four provincial capitals and their majority in the City Council of Barcelona,: 661 million euros for 2011. 
Both the nationalists and the people's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Barcelona and Gerona, in which the Socialists achieve a majority nor resort to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV) can. 
It is not absurd that this party will lose their representation in the Municipal Council of Barcelona, where she would have to achieve 5% of the vote, after the Republican debacle. 
The PP, however, recorded an increase of Stimmenanteils in the four provincial capitals and could be the decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona. 
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the lead role in Tarragona's turnaround. There they had Josep Felix Ballesteros before the current mayor, together with the PP ruled. 
EN Barcelona is that PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The Mayor, Ã€ngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last electoral campaign met several times. 
Also in other important places, such as, for example, in Badalona, Castelldefels or reus, the people's Party has seen a significant increase. 
Currently the PP represented in 34 municipalities of Catalonia and strives for the creation of lists in so many places as possible.
