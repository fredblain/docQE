60. Parliament was officially opened yesterday. It is composed of seven political groups, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of the PRD, one of PT, one of convergence and still one of EMPA together. This makes a total of 40 representatives of the people. 
The new members of the Congress of the State, it is expected that they do a clean job, feel obliged to the society and the different social groups, which depend on a responsible parliamentary work, and that repeat themselves not same pattern of bias and paternalism. 
Eduardo Davalos, Chairman of business Coordination Council CCE, suggested that the new members should take great responsibility, a role model for a better Sinaloa that is facing many challenges, to make. 
"We hope that the members really exercise their right to be, free from agreements between the parties because it is common that they reach agreements with which they are representing their own interests, which they develop into Carnival extras of the leaders and the leader of the parliamentary groups." 
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to build of the necessary bridges to support the current Government. 
"We care, that they perform a trusted work and for the society and their groups committed above all, for it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa, which voted them their confidence in the last elections." 
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, Chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association says that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives of the people is the drive and the joint work for the economic growth of the State, because today, the economic situation is ultimate complicated. 
"The most important thing is that they drive the economic growth, investment and infrastructure projects to create what will promote job creation in any way." 
In terms of the tourism industry, he demanded of the new members, they should allocate the necessary value in the State budget the Ministry of tourism to promote. 
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second least means." "This is incompatible with an important economic activity, which brings foreign exchange and investment in the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry." 
Funds must be allocated to the tourist projects, the State security must be supported are and the alcohol Act, which was not recast in previous terms must be brought up to date.
