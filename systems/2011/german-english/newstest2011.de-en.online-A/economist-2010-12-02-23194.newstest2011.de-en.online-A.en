Secretly in the Middle 
In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband was Argentina's President, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, which drove their popularity rate by 20 points to more than 50% to the top. This is the highest value since her election in 2007. 
Whether this but helps in the next year to a re-election, depends on whether the visibly mourning Cristina Fernández is kompromissbereiter as her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Nestor Kirchner. 
The signs are not unique. 
Nestor Kirchner, who steered economic policy after the election of his wife, often set budgets, which does not fully take into account the tax revenues, economic growth and inflation. 
This allowed the President of the pair, spend the extra income to its sole discretion. 
On paper, the Fernandez administration lost its majority in Congress last year. 
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further Zerwürfnissen. 
Some dissidents from the ranks of the ruling Peronists were behind Cristina Fernández. 
But after chaotic meetings (where a parliamentarian hit another in the face and others accused the Government of bribery) Congress, failed to adopt the budget for 2011. 
"I will not discuss," so the President. 
The 2010 budget now also applies to the next year, which the President has more opportunity to spend money to its sole discretion. 
The economy is hot: probably it will grow by up to 9% this year. 
The official inflation rate currently at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of trade unions - drive the value to almost 30%. 
Kirchner, who took over the Office 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, said growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not the reduction in inflation. 
He refused the cooperation with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and cleaned the National Institute of statistics and census INDEC, which then schönte the official inflation statistics. 
Can Fernández go a way we now? 
She encouraged the private sector and the trade union leaders to talks. 
And official statements that wage increases should be limited in the next year to 18%. 
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products gave a strong boost to the economy. 
But inflation undermined the growth by a large devaluation in 2002. 
May, Cristina Fernández therefore would like to finance again connect Argentina to the rest of the world. 
Earlier this year, the Government met an agreement with the holders of securities, which had rejected earlier rescheduling of the country in 2001. 
Now Fernandez seems on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club to which it owes about $6.7 billion. 
The Kirchner had rejected a review by the IMF as usual elsewhere, always. 
But in the last month, the Economics Minister Amado Boudou announced that the funds in the creation of a new national index of consumer prices will provide "technical assistance." It looks as if this were the first step towards the cleansing of INDEC. 
It is not known whether Fernandez will be politically active after their term of Office without the support by her husband. 
If so, she needed the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of the Kirchnerism. 
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of the Sympatie, which was placed on it, will be diminished. 
If you would like to win another choice, she must decide whether she quietly lifted many political decisions of her husband.
