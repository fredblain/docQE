Winning placement in the competition "Small businessman of the year" Lukáš Pytloun have assisted in the sale of the franchise of its hotels. 
Winner of recent vintage "Small businessman of the year" competition was Lukáš Pytloun in Liberec. 
The story of his success appears to like a film scenario. 
Lukáš Pytloun traveled to. 
Only from abroad was aware that it is missing in Liberec on good accommodation at reasonable prices. 
From the savings of his Ferienarbeiten from abroad and by using a bank loan, he purchased a dilapidated House with five apartments. 
Considering that he was University student in the sixth semester, this certainly was a courageous undertaking. 
"The price-quality ratio then annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukas Pytloun. 
He leased the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers. 
He invested the entire profit again in the House, which he then gradually rebuilt to the boarding house with 54 beds. 
Since then, it managed to open up four boarding houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec. 
The most convenient of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun design hotel." 
Another first class hotel was added this year. 
"Just we have signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we have sold our franchise concept and more interested in the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already reported," the entrepreneur says number one last year. 
"Just the victory in the competition"Entrepreneur of the year," played a large role in this license sales to the operation of hotels Mr Pytloun adds appreciation." 
The victory brought him greater popularity, yes popularity in Liberec and surroundings. 
"People recognized me on the street, they often even later congratulated me and I have to say that did really well," he recalls. 
I really recommend those who want to create something, to take part in this competition. 
You need also not to win, each Visual is good. 
He says that he takes advantage to this day from the contacts and friendships which otherwise ever not would have. 
"With some people I've met thanks to the competition, I talk to now regular business relationships." 
The fame associated with the success reflected his opinion a bit on each of its employees. 
And since he has of the seventy. 
"I see greater loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something, is the general recognition." 
"I look at this also really not only as a personal success, no, this is the result of good work by us all." 
"My name is brought to the fore just," Lukáš Pytloun says modestly.
