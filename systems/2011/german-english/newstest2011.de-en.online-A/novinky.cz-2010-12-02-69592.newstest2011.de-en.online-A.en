American soldiers have a new "smart gun." 
For the first time American troops have used a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, which is known only by their code name XM-25. 
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon influenced the local conflict with the Taliban and shifts the balance of power in their favor. 
The new weapon is something like a super accurate gun. 
Their projectiles which attract laser with a marksmanship from only a few meters to the finish. 
The special bullets of caliber 25 mm, this gun were developed, which includes high explosive dynamite, work like small shells. 
The missiles can be programmed so that they can explode not only on the impact on the target, but at any point of its ballistic trajectory. 
This means that you can use them against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trenches. 
From above it is namely not usually protected, the murderous rain of steel chip from above can set so easily it out of action. 
Richard Audett, who in the development of the XM-25 participated, the new battle rifle is the first infantry weapon, which makes "smart" technologies to use. 
"The soldier is taken so taking in fact: he aims at the target and emits a laser beam which determines the distance, as he wins an exact sight point, after which he corrected the Erhöhungswinkel, they need only shoot." 
"Let's say, one has measured 543 m." 
"If you abdrückt the weapon loads up and the floor on the distance shoots off 543 metres plus minus one, two or three meters."
