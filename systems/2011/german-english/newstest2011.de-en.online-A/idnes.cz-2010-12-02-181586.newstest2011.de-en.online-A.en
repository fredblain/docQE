More and more parents want people tracking devices to keep the kids under control 
The fear of their children is growing and so more and more parents consider GPS to monitor them. 
The system was originally invented for cars with Interpol can namely as well people locate, what would be helpful in such cases, as recently at the no disappearance of nine-year Anička Janatková. 
The device is currently about as large as a cigarette packet, but soon it should be no larger than a wrist watch. 
The case of the missing Anička has put many people in fear and terror, and so they look better to protect, their children for ways and means. 
Also for the price of a compromising of their privacy. 
"We seek us all to say that it comes here not to Herumspionieren, but an effective way to reduce the chance that it comes to the tragedy," Petr spearheading Pilín society macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market. 
"I give up, that it may be in individual cases the abuse of such devices, for example, if you put it someone in the Pocket, without that he knows of, but we had there been no such case." 
"Most customers buy it really reasons," adds Pilín. 
He believed the child should know but always the "box" serves what purpose and how to use them in an emergency. 
The more Dana Bočková pointed out however that a child, if it may not bear such a thing, it is his simply discards. 
"Very small children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately lose certain things if they want to not be controlled." 
"Already the phones initially aroused great expectations with the parents, but they can just as easily disable, as this new monitoring devices," says Mrs Bočková. 
Their opinion is also disputed whether such a body in the case of an attack actually helps. 
"Planned kidnapping Father Hood confirming practically always if your child has any electronics to, with which it could be detected." 
"Today it is the mobile phone." 
"If such monitoring equipment found wider use, they would seek also these, as their sales would certainly accompanied by massive advertising." 
"In these cases the criminals are always one step ahead of police," says the psychologist. 
You however admits that similar devices in a sudden attack by a pedophile can be quite helpful. 
Roberta Čech by the company RC monitoring according to the location services for automobiles, as well as for persons offering, can help the existence of such a device even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack. 
"It can be so adjusted that it reports the position at certain intervals." 
"Even if it immediately would be destroyed, is at least the last position of the affected person available." 
"On more expensive devices even a Clinometer is integrated, that is, if it falls and breaks in motionless, it immediately sends a warning stating the position," said Mr Čech. 
In his view similar services could do also intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you need to record only a special software. 
The problem of the current locators is that this either involves devices in matchbox size, which are similar to followers or to smaller mobile phones. 
There is always the risk, that you lose it. 
Mr Pilín macro Weil according to testing in the presence devices that look like normal Digital clocks. 
"This has the advantage that any attacker ever not has to realize that it is a monitoring or tracking device." 
"Or he will notice this time giving a time lead the police only," he adds. 
No matter in which direction the development is - to bracelets or pendants, always the same technology is used, such as when the vehicle tracking. 
So to the combination of positioning function using the GPS system (as well as in the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
