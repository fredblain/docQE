Prosecutor will not prosecute Senator Ensign 
The Department of Justice prosecutors have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the accusations which have been applied after his affair with a former Wahlhelferin and his attempt to make a lobbying her husband against him, announced on Wednesday the lawyers of the Senator. 
This decision ends the most serious legal charge against Senator Ensign, Republican of Nevada. Up to the scandal, which caused nationwide headlines and put a setback of his career, he was considered as a possible presidential candidate of the Republican for 2012. 
As Senator ensigns announced Office, he was "delighted" by the ruling after the one-year investigation. 
The Ethics Committee of the Senate could impose a Disziplarstrafe yet. 
According to ensigns lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice in that the investigations against Senator Ensign were dropped and that there are no more charges in this matter. 
The Ministry of Justice did not comment on the case. 
The ruling came as a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of justice. In their opinion there was sufficient evidence that Ensign has violated the prohibition of lobbying. 
Interviews, emails and other documents, which were disclosed for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times, gave rise to the presumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of its election workers, helped to lucrative jobs to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia. 
Cynthia Hampton worked during an election campaign of ensigns as Treasurer. 
Ensign resumed contact with some political friends to give work to Hampton. According to the documents and interrogations he took Hampton's lobbying for them according to the setting. 
Hampton was recently still in ensigns election team, it was he was allowed to take over for a year no lobbying work for his former employer or the entire Senate. 
According to the statement of Ethics experts was the unusual agreement between ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the case against the so-called prohibition of revolving door Lobbykratie. 
In accordance with the published evidence "is everything pointing to an agreement and to the violation of the statutes of the revolving door," so Stanley brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defence of clients, which are the target of the Government. 
While the Department of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the case of the Ensign, said Mr. brand and other ethics lawyers, the Ministry seem very careful to contain political charges after a variety of disasters that were followed with great interest by the media, including the decision last year to drop the case against the former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct on the part of the public prosecutor. 
Prosecutors "are obviously frightened," said Melanie Sloan, the Chairman of the Association "Citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington" (an organization, the aim of which is the fight against corruption in parliamentary and Government circles of the United States), a group of lawyers that has brought several charges against Mr. Ensign in court. 
"This basically means that high government officials can be now assumed that the laws do not apply for them," she added. 
Paul Coggins, the main defender of Mr. said Ensign, in an interview, he had received a phone call of a public prosecutor on Monday and another the next day, in which it was informed that the Ministry would have no complaint against his clients. 
Mr.. ensigns Defender had working with the prosecutors, to convince them that the Senator, "had acted again repeated, such as his Office in a statement on Wednesday in accordance with the law." 
Mr.. Coggins it refused to explain the legal arguments he had put forward to the prosecutors, more accurate. 
"Is me not comfortable, to go into the details of talks between the Ministry of Justice and me." "Only so much by saying: we believe that you have made the right decision," he said. 
Last month the Federal Election Commission has decided to terminate the investigation for a separate lawsuit by the Group on ethics, according to which a payment of $96,000 of Mr. ensigns had infringed parents at the Hampton's the Federal Wahlgesetz. 
The Electoral Commission said there had been insufficient evidence that the money had been anything other than a gift. 
NV energy, a large company in Nevada, which long supported the Senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton was thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyists work. 
An E-mail from the December 2008 shows that, after the company Mr. has made Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings Hampton had Chief of staff, John Lopez, an appointment with Mr.., where he told him that he "anklopfe at the Ministry of the Interior because of a thing." 
Mr. ensign was agreed for lunch also with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Transport Minister to arrange a meeting in the name of the airline after this Mr.. Hampton for the purpose of lobbying. 
As last year for the first time entered the details of this affair to the public, apologize to Mr.. Ensign with its voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been in the ranking of the Republicans in fourth place. 
After he many months no longer was noticed, Ensign before two weeks reporters, that he go for a third term in the Senate told Mr.. 
In the announcement that Mr.. Ensign no longer police investigations aim, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the Senator hope, that the Ethics Committee quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and set his investigation.
