World Cup 2018-2022: the FIFA appoints the host country 
In bright excitement due to suspicion of corruption by the FIFA Executive Committee appoints the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 world cups on Thursday, a highly political choice of the Rangeln influence, as well as the lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria in the background. 
One thing is certain: the output of the discipline of the FIFA 2018 will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold, (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain Portugal, Netherlands Belgium). 
The 2022 Edition will be then something exotic; the International Football Federation hopes to be able to win the premiere on the African continent in 2010 New Territories (Qatar, Australia) for up to, or to pursue his establishment in the United States or in the far East (Japan, South Korea). 
The list of personalities that belong (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, Jose Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Prime, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) is the measure of the economic and political use of a World Championship to the delegation. 
The machinations behind the scenes threaten so stop until the last minute. 
Difficult otherwise, establish a hierarchy of the candidates. 
According to the evaluation report of the FIFA, file offer the English, Spanish Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) help arguments as those of their competitors. 
But these considerations will be not so weighty for the 22 members of Exekutifkommitees at the time of the election. 
The Sunday Times, which was bringing about the suspension of two members of Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, would have can ruin as well the opportunities for their own country, cradle of football, which only once allowed to play the World Cup, namely 1966. 
The BBC had given again breeding ground on Monday, by she had broadcast a documentary, which takes three influential members of the Committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolás Léoz and Issa Hayatou under fire. 
Reason to annoy enough, the FIFA, and to bring the English authorities in fix, which had operated an intensive lobbying in the first place with David Cameron in these last few weeks. 
The head of Government is hoping for a new edition of Schachzuges successful by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had made the Organization of the Olympic Games in 2005 for London in 2012. 
This intensive use, meet would enhance the image of England before the Committee again? 
Nothing is less secure, because it is missing the duo Spain Portugal in trumps with its already finished stages, his expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games in Barcelona, 92 European Championship 2004 in Portugal) and his football culture. 
However, the economic and financial dark side of the two countries could dampen their ambitions. 
The possible reprisals against the English, as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal pushed the chances of Russia, which has become the important outsider despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport). 
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has however decided to denounce the candidly hint on the accusations of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" on the part of the Kommiteemitglieder. 
"You bewirft it with dirt, attempting to compromise it," Putin ranted. 
For 2022, the United States seem to be strengthened by the experience of 1994, the logical favourites. 
First economic world power, seat of the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems advantages compared to Japan and South Korea have a long list that have separately set up a very nice project. 
But these new candidacies seem premature for two countries that had co-organised events in 2002. 
Another threat: the approval awaited by FIFA the World Cup in 2026 for China, which the Asian opportunities for 2022 are obsolete. 
Australia and Qatar, which had pulled all the stops with waiting for futuristic stadiums, the FIFA pursues its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries represent a greater risk than certainty. 
Australia might have to suffer from the akquittierten of the European countries weakness of television rights (due to time zone) as well as Japan and South Korea, the sensitive nerve of the FIFA.
