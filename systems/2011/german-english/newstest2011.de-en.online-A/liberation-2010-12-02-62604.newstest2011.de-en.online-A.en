Climate: its promise of financial schönredet such as France 
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time, compliance with the promise of funding quickly dissolved (also called "Fast Start" or anticipated funding) to investigate, which have been realized by the developing countries. 
And already the rough French blandishments are revealed. 
With the Copenhagen Treaty developing countries are committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012. 
The EU has pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France 1.26 billion euro (i.e. 420 million per year). 
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16 the EU has pulled all the stops to convince its partners of the fact of their commitment with regard to the fast-start financing: detailed procedure report by its Member States, press conference, large side events, brochure distribution. 
The operation of transparency is appreciated for its actual value remarkably and grade: the developing countries and civil society would it like if all developed countries did the same on the same level of precision. 
The EU announced to have released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, which takes them on the right track to the respect be Zollung of their commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012. 
If you look in detail but, things are a little more complicated. 
This money should be "new and additional" according to the Copenhagen Treaty, to ensure that bet was introduced, without detriment to the detriment of public development aid. 
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what "new and additional" means. 
While the Commission proposed harmonising, certain Member States, including France, blocked the process. 
Today, everyone chooses the indicative amount, which he considered to be the best. 
The Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those of the year 2009 chosen: the international finance are retained, and are included in connection with the financing of "Fast Start" for over three years 150 million. 
Other countries have chosen similar values, either with regard to year or conditions at the level of official development assistance. 
On the other hand France of think was that the financing "all new projects" of 2010 are "new and additional." 
In other words: there are no values on the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of official development assistance. 
Specifically said can the total of the French support of the developing countries remain stable (or also lose weight) - France pretends to comply with its commitment to the "new and additional" financing. 
An another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. 
Furthermore, there is no rule, and each selects his calculation mode. 
Some, such as, for example, France, are borrowed £ 1 as € donated equivalent with 1. 
Obviously, it is difficult do so: the trouble is not the same. 
If the use can be justified by loans for certain profitable investments (projects often bound to the control of emissions, based on effective technology), it is deceptive to introduce the euro, which is recognised as equivalent for a donated euro... Also, only the cost of the loan for the country as a commitment should be counted (that is the equivalent of a rate of interest).

France is the only EU country that uses loan to a great extent. 
Germany calls 46% while engaged in Denmark, the Netherlands, or the Slovakia (among others) their obligations to 100% by donations. 
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends 1€ to fulfil their obligations, is France just 10 cents and is including a comparable use. 
Beautiful mumbo jumbo! 
All in all operating France in its fast-start financing with a double fraud: a part with a Weiterentwicklkung of the action of time and partly with the reality of the use of financial. 
France succeed to be that it has spent millions in accordance with his promise of 420 million "new and additional" believe and this saves 36.1 million euros. 
The manipulation of the Treasury (since it seems probably that it was Bercy conducted the arbitrage) could result in a double negative effect; Once EU-internal (why the other Member States with the donations, if go there but enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries be... so not completely fooled 
The chapter of the early financing just a small question on relatively short time compared to the overall discussions on the climate. 
But it could be the drop too much in the huge machine of the UNFCCC. 
Let us hope that this will be not the case. 
Whatever is the, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year of early financing. 
In the first place France could announce 2011 and 2012 a change in its update type for the year, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and the retributive justice with the other countries of the European Union. 
But above all France could bring the discussions on the subject of the dispute of the long-term financing to the front (an another, crucial and currently-debated topic): not one escapes the question of the "reverse accountability" or the update type of its loans. 
France could change its position, to be as progressive with regard to the dispute, as is that with other things. 
The hope is so based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive next week in Cancun. 
Naturally, a surprising announcement about the fast start of France and his vision of the "reverse accountability," as well as the use of loans would raise the international trust which is necessary for further discussions.
