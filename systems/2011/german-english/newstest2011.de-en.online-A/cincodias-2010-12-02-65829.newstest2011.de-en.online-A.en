Sabadell wants his rivals in three years a million customers 'steal' 
The Managing Director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 a tough year for the banks will be, first but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war of debt. 
Nevertheless, he is forecasting a collapse of the spreads the banks compensate for trying with increases in the fees and the prices for loans. 
Sabadell expected to capture one million private customers in three years - a partition to existing. 
Sabadell has found the way to take advantage of the next three years, and to survive in a very difficult economic environment. 
The Bank will introduce a new Dreijahresleitplan 2011. 
The goal is not only to survive, without taking the public aid from the FROB in order, but also the market share to one million private customers - 700 000, if you withdraw the customers that the Bank will lose - to increase. This is the great challenge facing this Bank, because until now she paid their business more attention than their private customers. 
This year it has get 250 000 individuals and 50 000 companies. 
Their market share in retail is 3.5 percent, while the business account for more than 10 percent. 
Another principle of business plan for 2011-2013 is to increase the productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. She will present the challenges facing the Bank so that together with the annual accounts. 
Only a few banks dare in these difficult times, set goals and to publish, since the financial crisis all plans of the banks have got messed up. 
Sabadell Optima will complete their master plan laid down four years ago this year. It was designed initially for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended to a fiscal year. 
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main objective of the Bank. 
Guardiola said at a breakfast organized by the APIE, 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with long range." 
The Manager assumes Spain would be "slow" out of the crisis. 
Also, it is "very difficult" in two or three years ' work to create"- fundamental for the survival of banks. 
Although he believes that the war to liabilities - which punished the interest margins - will abate, the risk premiums, the banks and savings banks for their emissions to the receiving of liquidity will have to pay, to compensate for dwindling margins already to the price for credits passed. 
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural type and they will put pressure on the loans." 
"We have not finished the tap, but the interest rate differential are very high," Guardiola admitted to. 
Banesto on Thursday already the arrangement at its branch network output, restrict the granting of long-term loans and to increase the interest rate differential (see Cinco Dias of the 22 and November 27). 
The Manager also conceded the banks currently pursued the strategy, "the fees to increase," however "within a competitive framework." 
Sabadells master plan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate transactions. 
Not for nothing, he assured that in Spain "larger companies are necessary." 
"In the coming year everything will change," he assures. 
He stressed that the need for capital currently "greatly increase" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions in red numbers will drop. 
He believes the FROB could replace the money market at Kaptitalaufstockungen. 
After he affirms that Sabadell could survive a temporary closure of the markets, he ruled out the argument of some bankers who already predict a new liquidity crisis. 
He stressed it could bring nothing in circulation, but in contrast to the events in June, you can achieve short-term funding through repo transactions and thus catch the crisis.
