The army has so many fuses, that you could wrap you Czech Republic keep but only two years 
The Czech Army has 445 km purchased fuses, with explosives are detonated. 
In the previous year, the Ministry of defence had provided already 224 km fuse at the army camp. 
It's been reassuring to know that the armed forces for 225 years have ausgesorgt. 
The problem is only the durability of the fuses - two but no more than four years. 
The army bought the fuses of the joint-stock company STV group, a. s. for paltry 40 million Czech Crowns. 
In his explanatory statement for the purchase of this huge quantity of detonating cord, the General staff replied MF DNES, the soldiers would spend each year to the 60 kilometres of detonating cord. 
The research of army pyrotechnikern according to the MF DNES to addressed, is clear from this claim that the army every year would have to - training extremely intensive pyrotechnic of all generals and officers of the army command, to the Secretaries and cleaners. 
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded. 
Just as considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres could be reasonably justify ignition cords. 
This length is by the way 25,000 detonations. 
But so would submit this army stocks for more than ten years. 
If still the old rule of experts applies that to the training of each new career soldiers two meters fuse completely sufficient, then through this new shopping - also in the light of the increased needs of engineering and special forces - has created a soothing stock for the already mentioned 225 years. 
In soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade complained recently in the Defense Minister Vondra, they had almost no cartridges for small arms more, so that the missing target practice are severely limited resources due to. 
Not to mention the lack of underwear. 
"Me not enters also, why they buy such fuses tons of us." 
"But that is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need to." 
"For us, the army is a good customer, we want to largely satisfy the merchants," says the Manager of the STV group Jan Děcký. 
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman for the Defense Ministry justified the purchase of hundreds km of detonating cord, the army had covered so at least for ten years with this "ammunition." 
Jan Děcký of the STV group speaks only of a four-year service life of the fuses and police and army Pyrotechniker only by two years. 
"When perfect are possible also the four mentioned years," gives a one of them, which wants to remain but uncredited, as a soldier not the criticism of the army accused to be. 
After the service life of any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and threatens not the life of the soldiers. 
These tests are but not free, but cost more money. 
Another argument of the Defense Ministry is the quantity discount for the fuse 445 km. 
"They cost us sixty-five percent of less than last year's supply of 244 kilometres," spokesman Pejšek shares with us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of defence. 
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of ignition cords of Pyrotechnikern of the police, that liquidate ammunition from the second world war or the Soviet army of brothers, exceeds several years barely 1,500 metres. 
And the police only such quantities of this ammunition which can consume before the end of service life. 
Already security were the support act for, also keeping the to open the possibility for flexible purchases of more advanced and therefore more reliable fuses. 
The Ministry of defence has tens of thousands tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty already huge problems on the liquidation, as the two hundred times Czechoslovak people's army was preparing on their campaign to the Rhine. 
The Pyrotechnikern, which addressed MF DNES, expected in a few years the same problem with the liquidation of hundreds km old fuses, which today as "cheap" has bought the Czech armed forces.
