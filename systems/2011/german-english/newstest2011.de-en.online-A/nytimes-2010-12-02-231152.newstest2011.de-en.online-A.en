Police operations in China are soft 
As a training officer step Tang Shenbin over an urban place, checked his nervous subordinates and issued commands in with military authority and subdued voice. 
He wanted that its female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guardians of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their penchant for violence - impress the audience. 
"Just are!" 
"Look straight!" 
He whispered to "Shows them" them, "as pretty girls are so!" 
Four girls, teenage hardly outgrown, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants were straight. 
Four pair of black pumps were in straight set. 
Four ordinary hats were perfect on the hair held with blue and white striped loops. 
"For me it looks average," noted Mr Tang dismissively. 
"Models are pretty." 
Several Governments have already tried to burnish the image of China's city inspectors. 
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree. 
The Guangdong Province, China introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green. 
Force replaced Wuhan in central China by low-locked: 2009 orbited an incorrectly established snack car reportedly 50 civil servants and stared at the operator until this documented after half an hour and left the place. 
Xindu district, a district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, would like to transform the image. 
Since 2003, 13 women strengthen the urban police patrols. You have been chosen special due to their appearance, their good character and their youth. 
You should give a softer, feminine aspect of insensitive police. 
But unfortunately it would hardly succeed also Scarlett Johansson to improve the bad image that the Chinese of this city commands have. 
Right, so the critics. 
Otherwise as the police, these officials may enforce the municipal laws only by fines or administrative penalties. 
But the Chinese media routinely show a different image. 
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei, she filmed a viewers to death, when he with his cell phone while beat as they defeated a protest campaign against a garbage dump. 
In the last year, a training manual for the Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how offenders without bloodshed can be beaten. 
This year, a Shanghai watermelon trader suffered after a scuffle with five officials of brain injury. 
A strotzendes from violence video game that can be downloaded from the Internet, shows trained officials in an attack on street vendors in China. 
The national newspaper China daily lamented "Chengguan makes fear the Government," in the last year, after further controversy regarding the tactics. 
The newspaper called for a "really thorough cleansing." 
Skeptics are insufficient, the current approach to clear. 
When the Distrik was looking for eight female recruits in October by display, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked the question whether the women had real tasks or should serve only as a Visual distraction. 
Probably both. 
Women in the age of 18 to 22, with good character and "harmonious features" were sought according to the job ad. 
You should be above-average large - about 1, 5 m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches. 
The employment relationship ends on reaching the age of 26. 
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is physically too tiring. 
"The most important is their image," an unnamed District Officer of announced quasi governmental Web page Rednet.com. 
"Whether the candidates will get the job, depends first on their outer appearance, like size, weight, features, etc." 
Then come the temperament and "inner qualities." 
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but in addition they have other duties." 
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the municipality of the district, would not agree with this description, 
but admitted to that in China size requirements in job advertisements are not unusual for either sex. 
The same is true for uniform features. 
Whether that equate with good appearance is controversial in China. 
But, people with disabilities or physical distortions need not to apply. 
"We need here unfortunately no lame or hunchback," so Mr Zheng. 
"Their image would be not good." 
Liu Yi, who patroliert on the Baoguang square near a monastery, is 22, Apple cheeks and a well shaped mouth. 
You empfindetes not as sexist, that so much emphasis is placed on their appearance. 
"Find you, I looked sexy in this uniform?" asks her with ironic view. 
Her colleague with the dimple that 21 year-old Xu Yang, commented "We have the task to represent the image of the city." 
According to their it not regret the short setting, because they had more ambitious career plans as scare just traders through the streets, to prevent them to making business. 
Every morning the patrol deals with approximately twelve street hawkers trying, on foot or by bike to sell as many buns and tofu dishes, before they are fortgejagt. 
"Mr Wang, disappear here please." 
"We have said so often that you!" said a dealer who had fled on foot and it temporarily in the lurch had left his noodle kitchen mounted on a bicycle cart Miss Xu. 
According to the officials, the activity is rather monotonous as strenuous. 
"It is the same almost every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studied in the leisure sales. 
"All routine." 
One reason for this is that the female officials may not, confiscate the goods of the dealer as their male colleagues. 
They can threaten offenders only to report it to their male superiors. 
This is to protect them from public hostility, officials in China are often exposed. 
September this year hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming Prefecture, Yunnan province, after the rumor circulated, Chengguan officials have killed a dealer. 
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the night-time incident, 14 Government vehicles were overturned or thrown into fire. 
Xindu so far spared from such violent trouble. 
But disturbances cannot be ruled out. 
Only two blocks away gathered over 50 people on a street corner from quiet Baonguang square, where the female officials patroulierten this morning. 
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle which was repaired in contrary to the rules on the sidewalk, rather than in a workshop. 
The owner cried Zeter and cry. 
After 15-minute hesitation, opened the way to their vehicles themselves the officials with a grim face and went on with the bike and its owner. 
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male patrol remained. This, he turned to his white badge to remain anonymous. 
Like her colleagues, the coordinators - play men over 40 - a purely supporting role. 
But they were not trained to present a clean image. 
"Sometimes we proceed verbally." 
"Sometimes but also physically," Mr Li said sober. 
The people "are beginning to most of the time with the dispute."
