Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past 
In a dimly lit, concrete-lined classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the Director of the Veng of Anlong County high school reminds the man who has built it on the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok. 
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok." 
"He was a good leader and he has looked after his people," said Sreng KOR Ma, 42 years. 
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher," the Commander in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold remains popular in northwestern of Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live. 
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the Government, longtime followers in Anlong County Veng are challenged. 
In April a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the public confrontation the victims with the people who once supported the regime. 
In June the Government distributed a textbook, which for the first time children of former soldiers tells the story of the Khmer Rouge. 
And in July a Community Court of the United Nations and Cambodia condemned a former member of the Khmer first Rouge, as it torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known, convicted the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng as Duch to 35 years in prison. 
With each of these developments grew the fear under the Khmer Rouge veterans of Alnlong Vengs, impeded their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration in the society of Cambodia. 
"There is still a rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation center of Cambodia, an independent organization that explores the regime. 
"For them the life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." 
"It divides itself families." 
During the Khmer Rouge reign in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or they died from diseases, revision or hunger. 
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-IED toppled Government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military on the border of Cambodia fled to Thailand. 
Here they spread until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered, unrest. 
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the West of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved up to the next generation in Anlong County Veng. 
But mid-1990s, when a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations, 1993 to the first democratic elections in the country's large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, began defect to the Government, leading to the capitulations 1998 led by Ieng Sary in 1996 and NUAN Chea and Khieu Samphan. 
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and 1999, Ta Mok, who had not given, was arrested by Government forces in the Dângrêk mountains. 
He died in 2006 in the prison in Phnom Penh, where he waited for his process. 
As their patrons no longer protected her, the most former Khmer fled Rouge fighters in the grueling poverty of rural Cambodia and many retained the movement in nostalgic memories. 
Even if some Rouge their local government posts retained a few elite official Khmer, because they laid down their weapons, were simple soldiers poor, uneducated farmers. 
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said of the Center for Justice and reconciliation, which holds in all over Cambodia, also in Anlong County Veng, public forums Sok Leang 
"They are anchored in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime." 
"You grew up without any professional knowledge." 
Sor Lim, fought in the jungle to 55 years to 1974 had Rouge joined as a teenager in the Rhmer, Anlang Veng, before he settled in 1998, to lead a life as a poor rice farmer. 
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said. 
"Ta Mok has given to eat something each." 
"But now, life is hard, because we must take care to our own." 
Called awake the current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has again concerns universal. 
Early next year, the Court will try to make Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife Ieng Thirith, an other former Khmer Rouge Minister in court. 
The order of the Court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further actions on these four cases. 
That contributed little to mitigate the fears in Anlong County Veng. 
Current media speculation have to 64 years in the Chaem, concentrated, which was during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's District Manager in Manteay Meanchey province. 
2007 it had representative of the documentation center about Cambodia, she have led the construction of Trapeang Thma of dam, a project in which thousands of forced labourers died probably. 
On a hot night Veng came back in the Chaem from working on the fields to their wooden house on a dirty road outside of Anlong County. 
As the Sun threw long shadows on the withered grass it turned down in the Chaem to discuss Rouge about their past in Khmer. 
They should summon the Court, she would refuse to go, she said. 
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said. 
"There would be no more persecutions would war here." 
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has fled in 1878 by the Khmer Rouge, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, would accuse the Court more suspects although experts and historians discuss it. 
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said. 
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia must do to to go forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation centre. 
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means gathering the broken pieces," he said. 
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together, so that how all can understand." 
The center created the first textbook approved by the Government of the Khmer Rouge, the 75seitige "history of democratic Cambodia." 
It distributed the book as an annex to the history book for the high school of the Ministry of education, that less than four contains pages about the Khmer Rouge in Anlong County Veng in June. 
How many times in Cambodia only little about the Khmer Rouge despite the connections of the town to the regime know the young people in Anlong County Veng. 
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Veng Anlong County high school, said that the new textbook helps students to understand an important part of their history. 
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home, to read it. 
"My family is from many parts of the book and the Court," he said. 
"You are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people are convicted by the Court." 
Such a resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang. 
"But the public forums, the textbook and the Court to gain influence," he said. 
Still, the Khmer Rouge here has a powerful attraction. 
Up in the Dângrêk mountains, leads to a rectangle of black soot a palms of shrubs and verdreckter with plastic waste way, covered with a rusty tin roof. 
Pol Pot body was been burned here in 1998 after his death on a heap of tyre. 
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile phone vendor at the roadside, said she knows not much about the man who was been burned here. 
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here are going to him to pray," she said. 
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later in the day she wanted to go last resting place to Pol Pot, where it is - a Bush of ripe bananas in the hope that he will bring her luck.
