The trail of the stones 
ULI Gsell also which got itself, a total of about 400 pounds. 
On Monday evening, he faced the Stuttgart railway station, the tuba on the back. 
It was a demo. 
It snowed. 
The story is known: in September were stalled the excavators and had begun to cancel a large chunk of the North Wing. 
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billions deep lapping of the station. 
When it came to the construction, was a large part of the wing in ruins. 
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces. 
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, between 1914 and 1920 installed. 
Gsell is sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old. 
He has secured a few of the brocken. 
"These stones are relics." 
"You must not disappear." 
He raves: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and erdenhaft." 
As he to sägte one, he had smelled after leftists. 
He doesn't know what he will do with the brocken, still. 
Stones have time. 
ULI Gsell also. 
The track of the Stuttgart stones leads to a former depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone Kingdom in a forest near Tübingen. 
The 44-year old is with old stones. 
He bought all that incurred during the demolition in Stuttgart. 
"It's a shame, they would to gravel ground or disappear in the landfill," he says in his Office, a wooden Büdchen, which once was a guardhouse. 
Insulted and threatened to have him, he tells, when in September in the newspapers was that he bought the remains of the North Wing of the demolition contractor. 
But he has talked with the S-21 opponents, for days on end. 
And he declared them he could do nothing for the demolition but now. 
And if it happens once, then it is but the most sensible, if the stones were used. 
About 200 S-21 opponents took then with one of the on average 80 kilos heavy box, unit price 6.50-14 euro. 
Some as a souvenir, but also in the hope to be able to return him in a reconstruction. 
500 Tonnes had bought Rongen 25 large heavy goods vehicles. 
Half the stores in the forest, the rest is long since sold. 
Garden owners, landscape gardener, Builder of the House. 
From anywhere, they came and would have dragged what could carry luggage and trailer. 
The Stuttgart stones of contention have been transformed into "Mäuerle" or in bounds by Herb beds. 
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen. 
"Would be not the political component." 
He rises in his all-terrain vehicle, gives a tour through his 20-hectare Kingdom. 
Jura has studied and canceled later biology, then he has interest for computers and has finally become stone dealer. 
And rock lovers. 
He is 40000 tons of stones. 
He carts his treasures together from all over Germany. 
He says he is the largest ancient stone retailer in the Republic. 
He slows down. 
There are artistically graven sandstones in the snow. 
"You were once among the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says. 
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, he enthuses. 
"My favorite stone." 
It follows the path up through the forest. 
He points to a bunch: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station. 
And on. 
"Beautiful travertine." 
Once the blocks belonged to the Gallery of Stuttgart Neckar Stadium. 
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart police, red granite from the Cathedral of St. Blasien, Tuff of the Heilbronn-based hospital. 
What, what troubles, what sweat. 
If Rongen remember how the stones previously by hand carved and moves with simple pulleys and ox-cart, he is quite awesome. 
"It would be a scandal, but, if you would something shred." 
He has not become rich, steinreich even less. 
But the stone dealer employs 14 people today, also stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower, and a horticulturalist have settled up in the forest. 
"We are working hard, but it is satisfactory," says the remaining holders. 
Soon he must to Cologne. 
Also there is to save the stones.
