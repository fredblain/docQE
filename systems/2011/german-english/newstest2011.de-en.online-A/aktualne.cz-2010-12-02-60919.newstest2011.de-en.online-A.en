The Government wants to stop the torture of "Witches" and published a brochure 
Women who are stamped in Burkina Faso to witches, have to typically some common social features. 
Rather, they belong to the older generation, they have found no work - for example for health reasons, they are single and have no children. 
If one of these women "is to the witch," she will be strictly isolated so that she can be dangerous to the rest of the village. 
"Men are rarely affected by this fate." 
"This is spared, even young and healthy women because they contribute to the work and give birth to children," describes the situation, which deals in the capital of the west African State of Burkina Faso in a special home to more than one hundred women a nun, which were launched from their communities. 
Now, the local government decided to take action against this abnormal "social action." 
And a brochure edited because of this, which should stop the "witch hunt." 
But, the thing has a hook. 
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can not read," the newspaper "derStandard" pointed out the dilemma of the written information. 
To be accused of witchcraft is but also in other African countries commonplace. 
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, was the 27 year-old Ammy Hemmahov√° tortured by three women and two men to death - they doused it with petroleum and they set fire to simply. 
Also the server BBC reported on the incident. 
The perpetrators claimed, however, the thing would have been only a combination of unfortunate circumstances. 
According to their version, was inflamed oil that was used for ritual anointings. 
Namely, after the group tried to "cast out"an evil spirit"from the woman." 
The people here support the isolation of "Witches" without regard to their education. 
"The standard," cited a remembers entrepreneurs from Burkina Faso: "Fresserinnen human souls are early as today a danger," he said. 
While the Government of Burkina Faso dedicated at least, to defuse the witch hunt, a "the President himself properly" the gambianische President has during last year. 
"President Yahya Jammeh kindled a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his aunt, since they allegedly had share of their death and now would try kill the President himself through black magic." 
"This he called Shaman from the nearby Guinea to help that accompanied by police officers, soldiers and bodyguards of President kidnapped indiscriminately arrested women and men by force from gambianischen villages and brought to the farm of President in Kanilai," spearheaded the organization Amnesty International in its report. 
On the farm, the imprisoned people were forced to drink a white plant with hallucinogenic effects which also intestinal and kidney problems. 
Two of the drift of people did not survive to stay on the farm. 
Only due to international pressure, the nearly thousand prisoners were released.
