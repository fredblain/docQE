Inspectors in the twilight 
The European food safety authority EFSA had been infiltrated by industry experimenting with genetic plant. 
The expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent Institute for the assessment of biotechnology now formulated this criticism. 
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have well documented it," Testbiotech Chief Christoph then said on Wednesday in Munich. 
The Director of the EFSA expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and a further EFSA expert were for years even with the lobbyist Association Ilsi under contract. 
It is by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer paid. 
Kuiper have significantly contributed to the EFSA testing for genetic crops and is thus a clear conflict of interest, then criticized. 
The EFSA rules are absatzweise identical with position papers of the Ilsi and so do the handwriting of the industry, which should actually be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma. 
It was the second time that Testbiotech bemängle an interest conflict of interest. 
So, recently was a senior manager of EFSA without conditions or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural company Syngenta - and thus changed the pages. 
Also the Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) had revealed from recent personal connections between controlling EU authority and industrial lobby, what hellhörig did the EPA as well as MEPs. 
However no conflict of interest can be seen by the EFSA. 
You refer back to all serious data, also to those of the industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, it is said in a statement. 
From the experts who work for EFSA to not demand that they have no links with industry. 
You would have to disclose but. 
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States. 
This refers to himself as a neutral forum for experts from academia, industry and policy - among others to the risk assessment of biotechnology without lobbying job. 
In the matter, independent experts and then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently allowed without each feeding test in animals and the reaction will not tested by gene plants on environmental influences. 
"We want to know what makes for example genetically modified maize on the field," says then. 
Current practice is there, only isolated proteins, but to test not the whole gene plant, which provides no reliable results. 
"If it does not seek the risks, how should you find it then?," then asks accusingly. 
This looks so also Angelika Hilbeck. 
The scientist is doing research in genetic engineering since 1994 and is now at the University of Zurich. 
The industry try to influence always more, critical scholars in this field as in the United States now also in Europe, or to discredit. 
It is therefore hardly researchers which are intertwined with corporations. 
For company critical studies would not generally published. 
'The industry controlled security research', Hilbeck claims.
