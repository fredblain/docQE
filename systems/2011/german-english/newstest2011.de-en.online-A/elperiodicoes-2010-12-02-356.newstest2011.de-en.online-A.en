Sports and rule bypass 
Tricks such as those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to circumvent a sanction. 
The exclusion anti-Strasbourg allegedly by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game by 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League meant that much ink, it was shed, whether a unsportliche Act or not was and whether any both players should be sanctioned by UEFA. 
As is well known, lost two players time a few minutes before the end of the game (your team had already clearly won), and played several fouls, so that the referee showed them the second yellow card. 
In this way, and since Real Madrid lead his group would, be the two players meet the prescribed penalty for the next League match against the Auxerre and go into the next stage without cards. 
Finally, the Disziplinarkommitee of the UEFA punished the coach of the Club, Jos√© Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money. 
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football. 
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but followed in this sport rules. 
Part of the arisen debate to the case goes to back, that a team of football club Real Madrid (who in his hymn claims of nobility and honor and had punished his players for similar incidents elsewhere) it played the leading role, and on the dramatization by Mourinho, more to its long history as a theatrical and provocative technician has added an episode. 
In any case the debate is about, whether this behavior prohibited expressly authorized by the articles of Association contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a rule bypass. Actually, adheres to the rules of sport this approach, but seem the meaning to get around. 
On this occasion he should undergo damage the sporting spirit. 
The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that has not been jeopardised by these acts because there was no aggressive play. 
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the offending player to take unjustified advantage from the opposing team. This did not happen. 
The paradox of the plot of the players of Real Madrid is that it is not what we usually see cheating or understand rule bypass for the circumvention of the rule was not secretly carried out to avoid a penalty, but it should be so striking as possible, so that she will be punished by the referee. 
The players waited and happy accepted the sanction. 
Another question is what kind of advantage moved the offender from the intentional fouls. 
Here should be that the rival is not brought in a less favourable position or such benefits for the played game highlights were, for the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to play with less players. 
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because then, the Club does not have these players. 
The advantage is obviously that the players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game. 
But it is a long term, up to a certain degree of uncertain benefit, because the team could leave eventually. Also, the players use this procedure to receive a sanction and go over in the second cycle of the card, in which they leave due to accumulation of card with a card less than in the first cycle. 
Thus, it is not so clear whether it is really an advantage. 
Ultimately, such practices are directed not against the sporting spirit, to which strategic decisions belong, to draw a maximum benefit from the provisions. 
In this case the player wanted to avoid any sanction (that would be a clear case of rule bypass actually), they wanted to choose more when they are this subject. 
You made a strategic decision without avoid a punishment or to escape from it. 
Although the line between creativity and control environment is, I believe that it is on this occasion a clear case of ingenuity. 
I have the impression that the polemic arose as a result of two factors: because it went to two self exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked rule transmission. 
The damage caused by these actions the principles of sport is less ethical than rather aesthetic art.
