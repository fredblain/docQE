The new unit is not unanimity 
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, related unit to fight against corruption and collusion on the part of Jean Charest, many observers continue to demand the formation of a public inquiry on this subject. 
Robert Dutil, Minister who public security, claiming that this idea came not from yesterday: Quebec would have consulted last January, the New York City Department of investigation with regard to this topic. 
The city has since 1870 a standing unit against corruption. 
However, Wednesday's announcement surprised more than only one. 
You have to say that this measure on the occasion of the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec of police force has been discussed on 29 October last year despite the presence of Robert Dutils not in the least. 
It was also not that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, this announcement in terms of public safety as a "Rabbit gezaubertes out of the hat" and "a table rightly made solution" qualified. 
Minister Dutil had in turn turned to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the question, future unit. 
"You will see the result when we will announce it," he was content to confirm. 
"It is aware of this problem." 
According to Réjean parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public survey. 
He said "the more M. Charest insists to prevent the formation of this Committee of inquiry, the more are people like you and I think that he has something to hide." 
"The resignation of Jean Charest is the only way to be able to form a Committee of inquiry," as Yves Boisvert, Professor of ethics and policy systems at the ENA told (Government) in turn (High school for the training of high civil servant). 
To get out of this impasse, he proposes the Quebec give a special mandate for controlling financial audit, so that they can do appropriate research on corruption and collusion. 
"You should be able to extend the mandate of the audit check," so he decided. 
He believes also that that would give Quebec of the same powers as Commissioners test control, which also would allow her to commit people to make the statement. 
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government. 
The Quebec will also require from Ottawa, to amend the Penal Code, better on this type of crimes to be set. 
This demand comes from the Senior Prosecutor of the operation of Marteau, which the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier also informed that the case law of this kind of law enforcement is not unique. 
Vic Toews, Minister of State for public security in turn confirmed his colleague from the justice, Rob Nicholson, am currently dealing with amendments, relating to this matter. 
During the operation of Printemps 2001, concerning the groups of the motorcycle policeman, 131 people were arrested, although the Penal Code was not been amended. 
Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism as a result.
