Weak applause for China 
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the Mainland. 
What does Taiwan from its big brother beyond the Strait? 
On 27 November more than 7.5 million voters, made up 70% of all eligible voters, to choose mayors and Councillors in the five boroughs. This is considered Ma Ying-jeou a broad review of the President. 
By creating breakthrough business relationships, including a partial free trade agreement, MA is itself a symbol for the relations with the Mainland. His policy effectively changed the relationship with the Chinese mainland for the first time since 1949. 
The test has passed ma, but only just. 
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) provides three of the five Mayor, she received no majority of votes. 
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates a greater independence of Taiwan was, almost 50% of the vote, the KMT won 45%. 
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma. 
The share of the vote of his party by about 8% has fallen since his election two years ago. 
Even with the KMT, the DPP was a the Councillors for the first time. 
During the election, there was the usual in Taiwan events such as truck convoys with rioters, flags schwenkende mass parades and only scantily clad dancers. 
There was even the compulsory, mysterious attempted murder. 
Sean lien, who was son of Lien Chan and Honorary Chairman of the KMT on the eve of the election a speech to a KMT candidate,. 
When he shot a man from the crowd in the face. Lien was wounded and killed a umstehender viewers. 
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the gunman wanted to kill lien or settle a dispute with the candidate. 
Regardless of the attack according to Tsai has Ing-wen, the leader which has affected the DPP, the choice and put the DPP in a bad light, which gives more votes of the KMT. 
May, China was the biggest winner of the campaign. 
Remarkably, the relations with the Mainland was not addressed. 
Instead debated the candidates have plans to social housing and job creation. 
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat. 
For this reason, the KMT is their relations to the Government in Beijing don't like in the foreground. 
But this time the DPP also avoided to stir up anti-Chinese feelings too much. 
Thus, she responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy without China cannot survive. 
Ma in turn would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese favour its China policy. 
The Government in Beijing will continue to monitor his strategy, Taiwan with economic incentives in the community back to lock. 
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a Summit on investment protection and medical cooperation. 
Certainly, it wants also a political integration. But the most important thing first. 
It is thus rather until after the presidential election 2012. 
The DPP now newly invented himself. 
Two years ago, she was greatly weakened: the former leader of Chen Shui-bian was arrested for corruption in the prison. 
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008 he strongly advocated the absolute independence. 
But under TAIS reign developed into a new generation of moderate political leaders and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the professionals and youth. 
Tsai found broad approval, such as Su Tseng-chang, Chen as presidential candidate of the DPP. 
Their party is doing everything to show that she able is to build close relations with Beijing now. 
Tsai is a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China. This requires however unprejudiced discussion. 
Tsai publicly that her party will offer a "trusted alternative" to MAS of over-rapid approach to China. 
Chen seems very angry about this change. 
From his cell, he said the DPP candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence. 
He even urged the pragmatist Su to give up the presidential nomination. 
Chen's intervention without the DPP having a hard time, to choose their possible candidates. 
The KMT will have to undergo an own self-analysis. 
MAS values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead its election campaign without him. 
The main reasons seem to be unemployment and the more gap between rich and poor for his unpopularity. 
According to a KMT spokesman, he will remodel his Cabinet, as well as the local institutions. 
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan limited in favour of a rapprochement. 
At the same time, the most Taiwanese see as inevitable economic cooperation with China. 
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no way back already."
