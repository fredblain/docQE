Euro: the EZB is compelling to maintain their purchases of government stocks
The last meeting of the central bank council of the EZB last year should offer possibilities to opportunity point out, how one comes out from the crisis, or at least the arrangement of a large number at unorthodox measures of the monetary policy to announce, the end of the yearly to its conclusion to come be supposed.
The crisis of the European national indebtedness obligated, the central bank in Frankfurt can not afford without a doubt, also the today's it to incurr the loss more than strained situation on the European bond markets in order not to cause their aggravation.
The political costs thereby would be by far too high.
The French financial minister Christine Lagarde had yesterday welcomed taken, active role on the occasion of a press conference of the EZB in favor of the solution of the national budget indebtedness of Europe.
She did not dare to say, whether she the opinion is, the central bank can still more do, for example by setting in motion of her program of the purchases in motion of government loans.
" I keep my considerations for my European trade partners before (...) ."
Jean-Claude Trichet, Präsident of the EZB had not pointed himself the day before to Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the economic and monetary committee of the European parliament very talk-turned concerning his projects, but rather it is content to point out that the program of the purchases of government stocks on the secondary market " weiterbetrieben" and that we at the meeting on Thursday " will see, like the decisions ausfallen."
Only certainty: The EZB will leave its key interest unchanged with 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice the obligation purchases of the vault were doubled of the EZB last week on approximately 1.35 billion euros.
And according to indiscretions of some dealers it is to have transacted new purchases at Irish and Portuguese government stocks yesterday.
Altogether the central banks of the euro system made for May 2010 purchases at a value of 67 billion euros.
Among the dealers the anticipation of further pursuing the buying rate is not under any circumstances doubted (see page 29).
The political economists expect already no more remarkable change of course.
If the loan business of over three months will have disappeared already from the arsenal of the EZB, the latter will create itself still at the unrestricted fund reserves in freigiebige kind will make, during one period of one week up to three months.
The political economists make themselves already today calm on the fact that this measure will expand still by some months.
" I cannot imagine that the EZB amends its program to substantial kind wird."
" Otherwise it was in the short term too provozieren" the risk to be received, new tensions; , then Michael Schubert assumes, Volkswirt of the Commerzbank.
" , A progressive exit intended for the process of the first quarter 2011 seems to me wahrscheinlicher" , for his part Norbert Bräms, political economist antizipiert with Sal.
Oppenheim.
Within the range of its interventions on the market of the national indebtedness " the EZB should upright-hold such a purchase volume by obligations, which belebt" the slow-acting market; , Norbert Bräms adds.
Considering the relevance of the exposed position of the European banks on the markets of the national indebtedness in the Eurozone the central bank does not have other choice to maintain than their presence on the market.
" It must step at each price to the Steller of the investors lacking on the market and in such a manner act, around shoots forward enthusiasm for the net yields paid to the weakest states too verhindern" , yesterday an important debenture holder testified.
Because if the interest rates set to the high-altitude flight, the states were prevented still more to reduce or also only stabilize their indebtedness.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
