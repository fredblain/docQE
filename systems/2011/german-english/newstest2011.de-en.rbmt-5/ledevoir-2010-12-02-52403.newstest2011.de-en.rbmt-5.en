Secret complex-vibrated Canada ventilated
The new, American diplomat lines, which were spread by WikiLeaks, air the secret over what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of the Canadians judge opposite the Americans; they reveal however with the same impact the superiority feeling latter opposite Canada.
Therefore the American diplomats are surprised at the fact that the Canadian voter does not have the Canadian-American relations in the sense with the ballot, and they believe that the visit of president would have Obama the conservative government helped to implement their budget of 2009!
The four new reports between the American message in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly spread yesterday, offer still more spicy details than bare substantial contents, at which one has to nibble.
From 22 September 2008 dating a connection, i.e. in the period, in which the federal choice coming PAGE was present in the full course, reports on it, starting from which point the United Nations do not take part no more in the employments discussed by their political bosses.
To the large astonishment of David Wilkins, the American Ambassador used in Ottawa.
Mr. Wilkins offers different explanation possibilities of this situation.
" The Canadians an almost inherent inferiority complex conditionally compelled possibly the Canadian to push over political high-level personnel much rather to speak about internal points of issue of the everyday life as the United States Peter black with this choice (like 1988 with the campaign over the free trade) " , then he describes.
The United Nations, then he concludes, is thus " the proverbial Goliath of this choice: omnipräsent, but sprechen" potentially too threateningly, over from it to;.
The Ambassador understands these " deafening Stille" the less, since the two countries preserve intensive political and economic relations.
" Logischerweise" , then he evaluates, " it should be the ability of a candidate, a party still much and more a party chief for leading such a essential relationship, which the voter hat." with the going to the polls as key factor in the sense;
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads itself in on 22 January 2009 report sent by Terry Breese, representative in Ottawa, the president Barack Obama for its first visit in Ottawa to prepare is.
" Their journey to help to ensure a continuing of the government with the confidence vote over the Federal Budget at the beginning of of February at which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than one decade, due to a stimulation program at a value of 30 to 40 billion dollar developed ist" , Breese describes.
Anywhere he had not mentioned that the government had had to postpone the sitting of parliament before Christmas, in order to prevent that the parliament was fallen by the coalition and in such a way caused continuing of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the suggested stimulation program.
And on the part of Ambassador Wilkins written report Washington informs, from January 2008 dating further from the ever more negatively becoming picture that, the dramatic series of the United States, radiated over CBC, spread.
The Ambassador is concerned about transmissions such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one little subtle allusions at Maher Arar, which " NO-Fly-List" or also to removals for the purpose of through muscle-show off the CIA of accomplished hearings to observe can.
Again another report reports in detail how Hillary Clinten asked with its French colleagues Berne pool of broadcasting corporations Kouchner with their first bilateral meeting for it, whether Europe is ready, certain prisoners from Guantanamo to take up.
Mr. Kouchner is to have answered the question with, however on the basis of an individual " Case to Fall" - Decision.
Àm end of the meeting, then descriptive, " he handed a paper to the state secretary out in puncto Omar Khadr, a 15-jährigen Muslims Canadian Ursprungs."
" The Secretary of State assured, the document again durchzusehen."
We finally still mark that the mind heats up regarding the web page WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, an older and Stephen Harper very closely standing advisor, had explained over CBC that for this solid leakage the responsible persons " umgebracht" will should.
It had reported here on Mike Huckabee from the United States.
