Holy king is looked for
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toy wish themselves the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela longingly.
For parents it on the next three-king day will be difficult to meet these desires because the household does not consist no longer and less than of twelve persons and a goat support.
Nevertheless Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give hope up that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar them the toy and the articles of clothing give, which desire them in such a way.
The family inhabits a modest house in the settlement Salvador all end. They live from hand to mouth, because the father does not have a firm work.
" Sometimes hard times are announced, because my man does not have a job. But we sell Mandarinen and potatoes... Already on afternoon I go with would ferment to selling on the Straße" , Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade said, the mother of the small ones.
The four years old Adelaida would have gladly a doll or a bicycle, while her three years old sister Isabel a Barbie doll wishes itself.
The ten-year José Alfredo would like already for some time a ' Monsterwagen' have and for its eight months old Brüderchen Jesús suggests Cayetana clothes in the size for one year's ones.
" (José Alfredo), ' said to me; I would have so gladly this Monster' , but I answered him, ' let us be waiting, Junge' , because it was very much teuer" , Cayetana remembered sadly.
For the older children, who at school were, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year old María Guadalupe has size 12; the ten-year Isaías size 10, while the eight-year old Miguel has size 8.
Tennisschuhe are missing to the 14-jährigen José Juan. One pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
