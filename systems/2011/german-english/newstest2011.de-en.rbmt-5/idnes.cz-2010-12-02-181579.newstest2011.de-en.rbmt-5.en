The correct mattress and the correct bed rust? Women have other desires than men
The maddest bed framework, do not separate the quality of the couch surface - thus mattress and rust constitute the good bed.
These must complement each other however harmoniously, in order to become fair the desires of the concrete user.
With the selection many things play a role - the weight, the size of, the state of health and not least also the sex of the Schläfers.
Just as importantly is also the Interieur, in which mattress and rust have to subordinate themselves.
Typical example?
In a weekend house, in which not regularly one heats, Latexmatratzen are not well suitably, since they need much longer, over " warmly too werden."
Beyond that they are clearly heavier than usual PU mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have still enough exhaust small channels in the core and in addition on a firm plate to lie, humidity dams itself up: It is thus impossible that under its mould forms.
With the choice naturally also a role plays, at which one is accustomed.
Who longer time was abroad, where very high mattresses with soft layer are usual will be able itself to accustom, heavily to a low mattress with hard surface.
" Probably all ice hockey players, who returned from the NHL, weighted with me that they do not sleep correctly here any longer können."
" For their abgeschundenen shoulders, heels and hips they need simply a soft layer from Visco foam (MEMORY Foam - a form memory polymer). "
" These recommend I among other things also sugar-ill humans, who suffer from a disturbance of the nervous system, so that them " Informationen" from the joints and the skin badly received können" , explains Sylva Hadamcziková, which specializes in pad furniture.
Therefore I have already years ago many ice hockey players, in addition, other customer these mattresses with Visco foam (MEMORY Foam) procures.
" Today is this no more problem, because such mattresses offer among other things the manufacturer Tempur, which Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico an."
And one does not have to be necessarily a famous ice hockey player, in order to learn to estimate the advantages of the Visco foam.
This " Wunder" functioned actually completely simply.
The foam optimalisiert its hardness and form according to the absorbed warmth, differently said, it schmiegt itself proper at the warm body on.
Anywhere it does not press, in the night rolls one not around as after a heavy fight.
One sleeps simply much better.
The viscoelastic foam offers beyond that also protection from Dekubitus (Wundbrand).
With the choice of the mattress size one should include the length of the soles to the body size still, thus approx. 21 to 34 cm.
Man such as woman, which are large to the 180 cm, need such 210 to 220 cm long a bed.
Everyone should at least 90 cm couch width for the order, together thus 180 cm.
With single beds, for example with Singles, is attached 120 to 140 cm.
For the sake of the comfort and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise the following rule of thumb is valid for the ideal bed width: " If one lies on the back, still enough place for the easily bended arms should sein" , engineer Helena Prokopová, the Zunftmeisterin of the Polsterer and Raumausstatter, guesses who dedicate themselves already for many years to the problem of the healthy Schlafes and the ergonomics of furniture and speak this topic also on technical schools.
With a double bed everyone needs its own rust and its own mattress, but watches out with the purchase, so that the mattresses are also equivalent high.
Otherwise nothing else remains to install as rust in different height and that is long not with each bed framework possible.
Foam mattresses should be high at least 14 cm, mattresses with feather/spring skeleton 15 cm, of it should at least three centimeters to the form layer and the fine pad be allotted.
" With the hand or when putting one may do the feathers/springs in no case spüren" , Helena Prokopová warns.
Each mattress makes a special type of rust necessary.
Completepadded beds with mattress and document like grown together Siamzwillinge do not have to look for anything in the bedroom.
These mattresses do not leave themselves and the purchase to air can one wash, which today is already common.
And there one at only one night between 0,2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, is clear the fact that the mattress becomes slow after five to seven years an enormous (and clogged filter).
Also therefore specialists advertising slogans reject, which promise one life span of up to 25 years, even lifelong warranty with mattresses.
Each thing has it if and however.
And therefore a practical advice of the dealers: With mattresses of 120 or 140 cm broad one should not shrink from the hygiene of the washable, removable purchases, yet it is advisable to use a Matratzenschoner which one can take off and wash easily.
Even if today mattress purchases with round outlining catch are usually manufactured, so that one gets two halves after opening (immensely importantly for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, above all alone implemented, seems often like the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a firm plate in bed instead of a rust?
Raus thereby!
Or at the most for a bed for unloved guests and for only one night.
Also so they should rather use the plate provided with ventilation holes (if already none in it are) and mattresses with feather/spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called bag feather/spring core and fine pad.
PU mattresses do not belong on such a document.
For not adjustable slat rust with 14 to 18 multipole sockets (lamellas) Latex or sand yielding mattresses suitably (if necessary also combinations of Latex and Kokos) are, always pay off thereby rust with a larger number of slats, thus of 28 and more multipole sockets to adjust with Lordosenstütze in the Lendenwirbelbereich and the possibility, the slat hardness.
On adjustable no mattresses with feather/spring skeleton belong to lamella rust, since they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
Apart from the attitude the rigid one of the multipole sockets also special flexible shoulder modules are ordered.
Here it concerns a special attachment of the multipole sockets, which it makes possible to imprint or bend the multipole sockets in such a way that they make punctual sinking for the shoulder possible of the Schläfers.
In particular for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers, that began, with " Herrenmatratzen" To use soft zones for the shoulder range.
Also to the ladies is meant - one grants these soft zones to them in the Hüftgegend.
For most fastidious customers scoring reading tables are wing feather/spring systems (Lattoflex) or rust with scoring reading tables contact Pads with so-called multi-torsion suspension determines.
The pressure is distributed on several points, whereby the tension is reduced.
But - if one to the correct mattress and correct rust a bad (too large and fülliges) pillow used, is lost most advantages again.
Also here a rule of thumb: the pillow is to support the head, its points should only up to the shoulders reach, so that the Schultermuskeln can relax.
From there 50 x 60 cm a large cushion appears ideal, how for example the Skandinavier likes it.
In the side situation the pillow (together with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should adjust the Schulterhöhe.
Our modern mattresses have something in common to have with the former (with hay filled) straw bags nevertheless.
Modern manufacturers use ever more frequently natural materials or at least their admixtures.
Also with mattresses the new magic word is called " Bio."
Instead of oil raw materials uses one for the production of PU foams ever more frequently natureal oils - for example rizinus and Sojaöl.
Soy is probably used by all well-known manufacturers.
" Bio is called with mattresses, which besteht" their core from materials of purely natural origin; , Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico plus explains.
In addition, natural substances are used with the production of mattress purchases - one first was thereby aloe Vera.
One can grant oneself in addition, micro caps, which blow forest or Lavendelduft when sleeping spread.
One makes a difference between man and woman also here.
While with the men " kühlender" Plant extract from Birkenblättern is used, so that the mattress purchase the warmth absorb and can the body cooling, the purchases for women " wärmende" Effect.
Excerpts from red Paprikaschoten suggest the blood circulation, the weaker sex become thus wohlig warm when sleeping.
And the today's favorites?
Mattresses from cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is from there more breathe-actively than commercial PU and also many more flexible).
From the combination the different rigid one (hardness) of cold foams and Visco foams result multi-zone mattresses, which know exactly, where head, hip and heels are.
For a high-quality mattress one has to shell out however 7000 crowns and more.
Health mattresses are however usually burdening with smaller value added tax, since they are considered as medical aids.
As the first Czech enterprise Gumotex became this advantage assigns.
One does not see, at the mattress and at the rust to save is so easily.
Now and then there are special offers of manufacturers and dealers, that offer two mattresses for the price of one.
Thus the mark Magniflex offers the mattress Duofreeze also in the purchase to verstepptem Visco foam MEMORY for 11.990 CZK.
One gets second free of charge in addition.
It was the material Tempur, which introduced the era of the viscoelastic foam materials with open cell structure and high density in almost cosmic speed.
A miracle, they were not developed nevertheless for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads with the starts.
Tempur with warmth softly, in cool environment solidifies itself it again.
Thus it adapts to the human body perfectly and distributes themselves on optimal way the body printing.
It is general from there not only ideally for the prevention of printing fire, but increased the sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foam materials do not however only become with mattresses, but also with other health products, how uses e.g. with special foot padding, which are to provide relief for the legs and the containers.
Native manufacturers use for example the foam materials Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
