Put the finger into the wound with literature
The second round of ' The desire to the Sprache' was a walk, with which the participants made themselves strong for the narration
" With the Sex in the language I understand, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected by me? " , the authoress Luisa Valenzuela asked, those the second round of ' Loosely placeres de la lengua' to open, a cycle, that should the spanischsprachige literature celebrated and on this occasion the sub-title of its question used (on another meeting table the Sex was dedicated to the round in the language, explained it).
The finger in the wound... " brings us in Schwierigkeiten" , the Argentine spat Schriftstellein sweetly against the public, which consisted mainly of young people, who met on the international book fair in Guadalajara (FIL), in order to attend this by Marisol Shultz moderated rounds table, at whom Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read out a text, which she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and which Shultz marked thereafter as a great narration. Luisa told in first person and is the Protagonistin, on the search is to be experienced, what " one; Wunde" is, and from physician to physician goes, from which it receives no answer, but notes for the manual of its narration.
It leaves the Infektologen convinced: " Patience is not my strength, perhaps is that my Wunde."
In the end, after a frustrating approach to the Traumatologen, which robbed it in the middle on the course the breath, and which it however explained that wound a scientific term is not, enthült the Psychoanalytiker the secret: " the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the Narbe."
The main figure of the narration sighs relieved and closes, it " from the wound only it experienced that this was really open and does not existiere." But it is convinced that the desire at the language and their traps mix themselves.
Valenzuela, the authoress, played with both.
The Nicaraguaner Sergio Ramírez presented also a entzückende narration, which it ' Praise of the Erfindung' called, and in that the finger in the wound is not mentioned but is not discovered.
With allusions to magic realism it tells of a famous Zauberin, which returned the clouds affected, far traveled men or re-established the virtue lost by a girl. The narration made an about-face and reported of America, for the large novel, to which it was not missing from the outset at its own chroniclers, and it quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the abundance of stories told by the Eroberen.
" Cervantes, which invited us all (the writers), scoffed the pretended witnesses, who emerged in as truely explained stories, but on other way history America would have been never told - with imagination, which even the shame kam." lost;
However he emphasizes, " there is the crazy people and liars, who vorstellen" themselves the things best; , and reality and lie approach there each other on, where one does not know no more, to which side the narration belonged, where the fictitious literature reaches the summit.
It actually calls that the ' Tradition Cervantes'.
" Of him we inherited, to be which, which wird." told;
When Mayra Montero at the row was, and praised the authoress commentated the variety of the interpretations, to those the invitation of the FIl for rounding table ' The finger in the Wunde' had contributed.
The Kubanerin and Puertorikanerin dedicated its contribution to the large wound of the social force, those their country strikes - like completely Latin America - as result of the fights for the drug trade.
" I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs a tacit, deliberately not planned commitment enthalten" , it explained, after it had emphasized that literature is communication and commitment, which " themselves between the author and the readers as with one; chemical Reaktion" construct.
The Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution likewise ," decided the evening; this finger of the engaged writer in the wound of the Schriftstellers" hevorhob.
He noticed that in a schnelllebigen world also the intellectual habits and control of consciousness run out on Dogmatismen, and forgotten, is " that behind each confirmation a small no stands and behind each denial a small Ja."
" In order to be in the possession our thought and the reality, we must nuancieren: And Nuancieren means frequently to put the finger into the wound and trouble those, which feel much better, if they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances for troubling and also the powerful ones which prefer it, the world in black and it noticed dividing white and loaded in addition the sense of the letter to rediscover.
