Partido Popular won 4 seats in the congress to it and PSC lost 9
With the results from 28 November the PP in the cities Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona could play a crucial role
After the important mood and delegate increase with the last regional elections the PP directs its view already toward the parliamentary elections - preferred or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes, which obtains this party with these elections, is normally twice as high as with the elections in Catalonia.
Thus the Catalan people's party received 610,473 voices with the parliamentary elections from 2008, while this number amounted to with the regional elections in the year 2006 only 316,222.
On last Sunday the PPC obtained 384,091 voices.
If this ascending tendency - result of the bypass of the voice portion of the PSC and the connection of the constituency of the PP - should continue, the analysts of the PP that with the parliamentary elections the PPC of 8 to 12 congressional representatives could ascend, prognosticate four (it now 10) have to it-win and the PSC at least 9 delegates (of 25) during also CiU would lose.
These computations occupy the fundamental meaning of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
In accordance with the analysis of the people's party the ERC would lose a delegate - at present it has three -, while ICV or to it-win one could hold its delegate.
If the choice calendar should be maintained however, the next date with the Gemeindewahlen falls into May 2011. Also then the people's party (PP) can be the tongue at the balance, in order to prepare for the socialist supremacy an end, in four province capitals and with its majority in the town councillor Barcelonas, one of the city administrations with the largest household: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalist and people's party agrees will lose therein that the PSC the cities Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the socialists obtain neither a majority nor to its traditional allied ones (ERC and ICV) fall back can.
After republican debacle is it not wrong that this party their agency in the local council of Barcelona, in which it would have to obtain 5% of the voices will lose.
The PP registered however an increase of its voice portion in the four province capitals and could the crucial Kraft in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona become.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the leading role in Tarragonas reversal. There they had Josep Félix Ballesteros before the present mayor, together with which PP governs.
EN Lérida is appropriate the PP for only 500 voices behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, as for example in Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus the people's party could register an important increase.
At present the PP is represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and aims at the formation of lists in as many places as possible.
