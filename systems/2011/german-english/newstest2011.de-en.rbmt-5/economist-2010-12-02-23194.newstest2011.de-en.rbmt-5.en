Secretly into the center
In the weeks after the sudden death of your man of Argentina experienced president, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, which drove its popularity rate upward around 20 points on over 50%. That is the highest value since its choice in the year 2007.
Whether you help this however in the next year to a re-election, depends on it, whether the obviously mourning Cristina Fernández is more ready to compromise than her deceased husband, its predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The indications of it are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, which directed the economic policy also after the choice of its wife, set up frequently budgets, those the tax revenues, which economic growth and the inflation did not consider fully.
This permitted it the pair of presidents to spend the extra incomes after own discretion.
On the paper the Fernández government lost the majority in the congress in the last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchners death after a cardiac infarct on 27 October led to further discords.
Some dissidents from the numbers of the governing Peronisten placed themselves behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (with those a parliamentarian another in the face struck and others the government of the bribery accused) it did not succeed to the congress to discharge the household for 2011.
" I am not diskutieren" over it; , so the president.
The household 2010 is valid now also for the next year, whereby the president has still more opportunity to spend money after own discretion.
The economy runs hot: probably it will grow in this year over up to 9%.
The official inflation rate is at present with 11,1%, but numerous private estimations - and wage demands of the trade unions - drive the value on nearly 30%.
Kirchner, which took over 2003 the office, when Argentina von Wirtschaftskrisen was vibrated, explained growth and fight against poverty as its principal purposes, and not the inflation lowering.
It refused co-operation with the IMF, chicaned the private sector and cleaned national Institut for statistics and census INDEC, which thereupon the official inflation statistics schönte.
Can Fernández hit a more moderate way now?
It called the private sector and the trade union leader6s to discussions.
And according to official statements wage increases are to be limited in the next year on 18%.
The high world market prices for of Argentina agricultural products gave a strong lift to the economy.
But the inflation undermined the growth spurt by a large Devaluation in the year 2002.
Possibly Cristina Fernández for this reason Argentina would like to attach financialeconomically the remainder of the world.
Beginning of this yearly met the government an agreement with security owners, who had rejected the earlier conversion of debts of the country in the year 2001.
Now Fernández seems on an agreement with the backers from of Paris the club to urge, which she owes approx. $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had usually, always rejected an examination by the IMF, as in another place.
But in the last month the minister of economics Amado Boudou announced that the funds with the production new national consumer price index " technical Unterstützung" will carry out. It looks in such a way, as if this would be the first step for the cleaning of the INDEC.
It is not well-known whether Fernández will be politically active after completion of their term of office also without the support by their husband.
If, it needs for it the support of the middle class, those to a large extent enough has from the Kirchnerismus.
If the Argentinier returns in March from its summer vacation, the wave of the Sympatie, which you were brought, will have died down.
If it liked to win a further choice, it must decide whether it waives many political decisions of its man quietly and quietly.
