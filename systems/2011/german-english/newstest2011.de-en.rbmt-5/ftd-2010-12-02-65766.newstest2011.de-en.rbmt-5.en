Obama stops new drillings for oil
Before the coast of the US Federal State it will give no new drillings for oil to Florida in the gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
An appropriate prohibition issued the government in Washington - and thus its earlier plans finally recall.
Also before the Atlantic coast new drillings remain for the time being forbidden.
This communicated Ministers of the Interior Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
Cause for the strict prohibition, which is to be valid at least for the coming five years, is " the explosion of the drilling platform; Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the misfortune, which cost and to the largest environment disaster of the USA led eleven workers the life, president Barack Obama had signaled his readiness on pressure of the opposition and the industry to permit new drillings in the eastern part of the gulf of Mexico.
The proponents want to reduce thereby the dependence of the USA von Ã–llieferungen from the foreign country.
Who carries the responsibility for the devastating oil pollution in the gulf, is not clarified until today finally.
In the center of the criticism is located the British energy group BP, which is confronted with demands for billion.
A commission of inquiry on behalf Obamas is to submit in the course of December their results.
In October Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar had waived the drilling stop imposed after the explosion.
In the connection different oil companies had placed immediately requests for new drilling projects.
With sharper controls and stricter safety regulations Obama and Salazar want to exclude a recent disaster.
At present the responsible board of control, which was guessed/advised after numerous corruption reproaches in disrepute, is reformed fundamentally.
Parallel Obama announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas companies.
The industry warns now publicly of the fact that the delivery in the gulf would fail by a stricter adjustment clearly smaller than so far.
" The plans of the government are the largest brake for the growth of the oil and Gasindustrie" , the result of a current branch inquiry reads by the advisor company BDO - still before the drilling prohibition of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance deplores besides the uncertainty in the industry: " Nobody knows, what exactly with the adjustment change wird."
Investments into new promotion projects were postponed until further notice - debited to growth.
