The geriatric home affirms that the deaths not on " missing Maßnahmen" to lead back are
The owners of the home for the elderly in Olot do not exclude that their male nurse over eleven killed older humans
The responsible persons of the geriatric home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave yesterday a press conference, in which they put out, which damage the criminal actions Joan Vila Dilmés - which male nurse, who had killed during its work at least eleven old humans, for whom it was responsible, - had caused to the mechanism.
The director/conductor of the geriatric home, Joan Sala, arose in company of its attorney, Joan Cañada, before court and announced, " La Caritat would like the responsible person (for the deaths) anklagen" , but " the right and our adhesion obligation force us to it the process and the civil Haftung" to assume.
The mechanism must accept not only a social reputation loss, because it had not in time determined the criminal actions of the male nurse, but also a high amount of damages to pay now, which is computed by the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime decreases/goes back on August 2009 and that it gemordet since then.
The judge arranged the Exhumierung of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric home -, since he assumed that no physician had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities were completed by telephone due to their age and diseases.
The leader of La Caritat answered this point in the negative round away and explained that " being missing measures no time the reason for the incidents been its könnten."
The attorney von La Caritat added that it " in the law case no indications for negligent actions of another person than the accused one of gäbe."
That already as " Todesengel" Baptized one confessed the day before yesterday eleven murders and explained, the first crime on 29 August 2009 to have committed and one and a half months later the second old lady to have murdered.
In this case it killed insulin, in contrast to the first crime, with an overdose with which it had given a mixture from different tranquilizers.
The leader of La Caritat explained, the entrance of the personnel to the medicines was only difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and tranquilizer cocktail used the male nurse with six of nine committed crimes, in order to free the patients with death from their suffering to.
But the results of the laboratory tests will put out whether Vila lies and actually selected for its first victims a less cruel death or whether it burned these out from the inside, by giving bleaching caustic solution to them, as he had done it according to confession with three women, it between that the 12. and 17 October murdered.
In La Caritat one does not give faith to the statements of the male nurse, not even which concerns the number of stood murders, which could quite be more. This attitude is justified with the fact that Vila had made very different statements before court and that it does not make a sense to suddenly change its approach after eight successful murders.
They say, them placed themselves them for this reason and to the clearing-up of the range of these incidents of the law to the order.
