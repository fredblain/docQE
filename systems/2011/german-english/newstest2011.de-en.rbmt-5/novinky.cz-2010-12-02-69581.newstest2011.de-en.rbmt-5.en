The apartment costs of the households rise around some hundreds monthly
The households must count the rents starting from January not only on higher costs of all kinds of energy, but also on higher water and waste water fees and of long-distance heating and at some places grow also.
Families will have in such a way to pull starting from January several hundred crowns monthly to more from the purse than so far.
River will have to pay gas up to around 4,6 per cent more expensively, around 2 per cent and more, in some cities one up to a tenth more for water supplies and at some places will raise the price of also the long-distance heating supplies.
However the current price increase costs the housing budget annually some hundred crowns more.
The heavy current prices were lowered thereby by all main suppliers, debt are thus the clear promotion of the generation of current from renewable sources, in particular from Fotovoltaikanlagen.
Gas becomes only moderately more expensively, this however exactly if the people at most must to heat and have highest consumption.
Also here is to be counted thus on some hundred crowns more per year.
While river and gas in completely Czech Republic become expensive, the prices for long-distance heating from city are different to city.
Above all larger places plan price increases.
Thus for example the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové must pay starting from January for long-distance heating monthly up to 50 crowns more, more to than 1000 crowns more per year pay families in Liberec.
Again threaten the inhabitants of Prague 9 per cent higher water and waste water fees and this if the city the infrastructure rent increased.
If the rent does not change, there is only 6.8 per cent.
The price in Prague belongs compared with completely Czech Republic however also further to the lowest.
In the Nordböhmen, where the prices belong already to the highest, water and waste water fees are to rise around 7,4 per cent.
Enormous rent increases are to be expected for example in 140.000 flat lets for rent, with which starting from January the so-called renting adjustment is omitted.
Thus for example the housing enterprise plans CPI Byty, which possesses Labem 2500 dwellings in Ústí nad, to increase the rents starting from January equal around one hundred per cent.
Who with this rent increase does not agree, which the enterprise wants to sue judicially.
The adjusted rents, which one pays today still in approximately 300,000 dwellings, might rise next year around more than 10 per cent.
