Red Bull triumphs in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull penetrated 2004 into the world of the formula 1, its history is coined/shaped in this erlesenen universe of the speed of surprises and successes.
At first nobody gave attention to the beginner and despite its steeply ascending course during the last seasons set with the final spurt in last November all on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to lower the abilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the achievement strength of the engine of Renault, is " Geheimwaffe" , which the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into the hands, and thus created a winner team, nascently the legend.
In reality a high performance acts software to simulation of processes around, which the German brought enterprise to 2007 to purposes, which do not have to do with motorraces, on the market.
This as PLM designated computer science program for the development of assembly chains in factories on the whole world, energy works and highly precise instruments was used.
A faithful reproduction and/or simulation of a product or a process is aimed at, before this is actually built, in order to avoid errors and redundant costs in such a way.
PLM has the development of the cameras of Canon, which facilitates airplanes of Sukhoi and the most famous commercial motor vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried soot worm, director/conductor of the industrial department of Siemens, explains that with the employment of this software in the formula 1 - factory Red Bull " in few hours, nearly in Echtzeit" the changes and improvements, which are determined on running and with the tests, sketch and would drive out can.
Soot worm implements that 1992 in the running stables on the average ten technicians worked, who would bring at the most three or four improvements in one season could.
In of Red Bull team today 180 highly-qualified young people are busy. With high performance EDP systems they would drive through analyses and all possible changes at the racing cars.
The Siemens manager explained, the PLM software was able to analyze and improve all components of the racing cars from Red Bull to, with exception of the engine, for which excluding Renault responsible explains itself.
The materials, the fuel, which become aerodynamics and the safety members changed.
The changes can be transferred owing to progressive production plants and Hightech autoclaves within less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of the simulator into the reality.
The only border, which is set to this moved technical perfectionism, are the 40 million dollar, which formula a 1 - team on its races in one season to spend may.
Red Bull developed its Hightech factory for the development and the production of its racing cars in 50 kilometers a place removed from London.
This concerns two buildings, in which visits - particularly of journalists - are strongly limited.
Everything that happens there, is Top Secret.
The staff covers 580 persons, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark of Webber.
But of Red Bull of true formula 1 - hero is doubtless the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind enormous technological resources, which the Energy drink manufacturer places into the services of his participation on the racing courses, hide themselves further protagonists, whose support is inestimably and their fame equal to zero.
The Technologichef of the work, Steve Nevey, stresses that one could still say before five years that the progress within the range F& E for racing cars with 50 per cent to the victory contributed and the pilots were responsible for the remainder.
Today the portion values changed. The technology constitutes 85 per cent of success, while the contribution of the pilots on 15 per cent becomes estimated.
Nevey recognizes on that Vettel and Webber can be never replaced by EDP, because them " is not predictable Gladiatoren."
