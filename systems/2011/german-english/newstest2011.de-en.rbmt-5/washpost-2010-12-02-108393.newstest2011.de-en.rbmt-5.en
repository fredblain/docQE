Khmer Rouge veterans in a forced manner to the confrontation with the past
In a weakly lit up, concreted classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds of the man, who built him, at the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
" Everyone loves Ta Mok." here;
" He was a good leader and he around his people gekümmert" himself; , Sreng Kor mA said, 42 years.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule admits as " the Schlachter" , the commander remains popular in these remote former Khmer Rouge center in the northwest Kambodschas, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers to still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge in relation to the government, supporters of many years in Anlong Veng are provoked.
In April local truth and reconciliation forum permitted the public confrontation with humans, who supported once the regime to the victims.
In June the government distributed a school book, which tells for the first time the history of the Khmer Rouge to children of former soldiers.
And in July a community tribunal of the UN and Kambodschas condemned a former member of the Khmer Rouge, when it admits the former boss of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better than Duch, to 35 years prison for the first time condemned.
With each of these developments the fear grew under the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, made its efforts more difficult around reconciliation and Reintegration into the society Kambodschas.
" There is still refusal and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they tun" no power, something too; , Chhang Youk, director/conductor of the documentation centre said an independent organization, which investigates the regime of Kambodschas.
" For it the life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime is geworden." to a symbol of the bad one;
" It splits even Familien."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Kambodscha, between 1975 and 1979, were executed roughly 1.7 million humans or it died at diseases, revision or before hunger.
When the Vietnameses broke in and fell 1979 the pole Pot Ied government, the leftovers of the regime and its military fled to the border Kambodschas to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary the Guerillakrieg of their basis in the west of the mountains and jungles of Kambodscha led, consulted Ta Mok the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But years, when 1993 to the first democratic elections of the country led a peace agreement promoted by the UN, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began in the middle of the 1990er to overflow for government which led to the surrenders of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu SAM fan 1998.
Pol Pot died 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, which had not given way, was arrested 1999 by government forces with the Dangrek Mountains.
It died 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where it waited for its process.
When its sponsors did not protect it any longer longer, most former Khmer Rouge fighter fled into the zermürbende poverty of the rural Kambodschas and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even if some few elitist official ones the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts, because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
" These humans profitiert" only very few from the surrender; , Sok Leang said of the center for justice and reconciliation, which holds public forums in completely Kambodscha, also in Anlong Veng,
" They are embodied into the utopian agrarian ideology of the Regimes."
" They grew without any occupation knowledge auf."
Sor Lim, 55 years, which had followed 1974 as teenager of the Rhmer Rouge, Veng fought, before it to 1998 established itself in the jungle over concerns, in order a life as a poor rice farmer to lead.
" The life under the Khmer Rouge was gut" , it said.
" Ta Mok gegeben." each something to eat;
" But the life is heavy now, because we worry about us müssen."
The current Khmer Rouge tribunal evoked concerns also here.
Beginning of next yearly will try court, Nuon Chea, Khieu SAM-chamfers, Ieng Sary and its wife as well as Ieng the Thirith, another earlier Khmer Rouge Minister to place before court.
The order of the court is it to condemn the old leaders and those, that are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
That contributed a little to moderate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current medium speculations concentrated on in the Chaem, 64 years, which had been during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's district boss in the province Manteay Meanchey.
2007 had it assigned the documentation centre told by Kambodscha, she had led the building of the Trapeang Thma of dam, a project, with which thousands of forced laborers probably died.
In a hot evening returned in the Chaem of the work on the fields to its timber building at a dirty road outside from Anlong Veng.
As the sun rejected in the Chaem it threw long shade on the grass dried up to discuss over their past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court should cite it, then it would go refusing, said themselves it.
" Kambodscha lives in peace and in Stabilität" , it said.
" There would be no more pursuits, would be here Krieg."
Prime minister Hun Sen, who fled 1878 of the Khmer Rouge, in addition has repetitive before it warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court more suspect would accuse, although experts and historians discuss this.
" Kambodscha must dig a hole and the past begraben" , it said.
But the confrontation with the past is what must do Kambodscha, in order to be able to go forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation centre.
" Reconciliation with the Khmer times means a gathering of the broken Stücke" , it said.
" It is our obligation to set these broken parts together so that like everything understand können."
The center created first of the government approved school book over the Khmer Rouge, which " 75seitige; History of the democratic Kambodscha."
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as appendix to the stories book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four sides over the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Kambodscha the young people in Anlong Veng know only little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years, a student to the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps the student to understand an important part of their history.
But its parents reacted sceptically, when it brought the book with home, in order to read it.
" My family leans many parts of the book and the court ab" , it said.
" They are distrustful, because they are not safe, as werden." many humans condemned by the court;
Such a resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicates, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court attain gradually Einfluss" , it said.
Still the Khmer Rouge possesses a powerful attraction here.
Above in the Dangrek mountains by bushes more überwucherter and with plastic garbage verdreckter way to a rectangle leads by black soot, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body after his death 1998 on a heap of tire one had burned here.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a Handyverkäuferin at the roadside, said, she did not know much about the man, who had been burned here.
" But it beten" here a strong spirit and many humans to go to it over too; , it said.
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday later and on the day wanted it to Pol Pot's last Ruhestätte to go, where it becomes shrubs of ripe bananas placing - in hope that it brings its luck.
