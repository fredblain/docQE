Climate: as France its financial promises beautiful-talks
One year after the Kopenhagener contract is it time, the adherence to the fast solved financing promises (also " Nearly Start" or came prematurely financings mentioned) to examine, which were realized by the developing countries.
And the rough French Schönredereien is uncovered already.
With the Kopenhagener the developing countries committed themselves to contract to make available 30 billion dollar between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16 the European Union drew all registers, in order to convince their partners of the fact of their commitment concerning the nearly starting financings: detailfaithful procedure report of its member states, press conference, large Nebenevents, brochure distribution.
The operation transparency is remarkable and degrees for their actual value estimated: the developing countries and the civil society would see it gladly, if all developed countries made the same on the same precision level.
Announced the European Union in the year 2010 2.2 billion euros to have set free which brings it on the correct way to the Respektbezollung of its commitment of 7.2 billion in the year 2012.
If one looks however in the detail, the things lie a little more complicated.
This money should according to the Kopenhagener contract " again and zusätzlich" its to do in order to ensure that an additional employment was brought in, without for the disadvantage of public development assistance.
Unfortunately there is no consent over it, which " again and zusätzlich" meant.
While the European Commission had suggested a harmonization, certain member states, under it France, have which blocks procedures.
Today everyone selects the appoximate value, which it judges as best.
The European Commission has itself for example as appoximate value for that of the yearly 2009 chosen: the international financings are maintained, and give in the context of the financing " Nearly Start" over three years long 150 million in addition.
Other countries selected similar appoximate values, either regarding year or concerning conditions on level of public development assistance.
In response to it was France of the opinion, which " financings; all new Projekte" the yearly 2010 are " again and zusätzlich."
Differently expressed: There are no appoximate values with the expenditures of the preceeding yearly or on global level of public development assistance.
Concretely said the sum total of the French support of the developing countries can remain stable (or to also decrease) - France gives, its obligation regarding " new and zusätzlichen" To keep financings.
Another, crucial element is the classification in donations and loans.
Over it still no rule prevails, and everyone selects its computing mode.
Some, as for example France, find 1 borrowed € as equivalent with 1 donated €.
Obviously this is only with difficulty justifiable: the trouble is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often to the emission containment bound projects, which are based on most effective technology) to be justified can, it is deceitful to present the euros one as equivalent for a donated euro taken in... Besides only the costs of the loan of the financial source country should be taken into account as commitment (i.e. the equivalent of a interest rate).
But France does not have anything differently in the sense than the following consideration: it " respektiert" its obligation of 420 million euro, by taking up 91.5% loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donates) 36.1 million euros) - see also the European Union document, in order to convince itself of it.
France is the only country of the European Union that loan begins in large measure.
Germany demands 46%, during Denmark, which follow to the Netherlands or the Slovakia (among other things) their obligations to 100% with donations.
Differently said, if the predominant majority of the European union spends 1€ for the fulfillment of its obligations, France gives straight once 10 to cent and understands by it a comparable employment.
Beautiful Hokuspokus!
All in all France operates in its nearly starting financing with a double swindle: to a part with a Weiterentwicklkung of the action over the time and on the other hand part with the reality of the financial employment.
France succeeds it, believes to leave that it " 420 million; more again and zusätzlicher" Millions in agreement with his promises spent and saves thereby 36.1 million euro.
The manipulation of the Treasury (it probably seems there that it was Bercy, which accomplished the arbitrage) could pull one doubly negative effect; once European Union-internally (why the other member states continue with donating, if it is sufficient nevertheless to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries do not let be deceptive completely...
The chapter of the financings only a small question on relatively short time compared with the whole of discussions over the climate, come prematurely.
But it could be too much the drop in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
We hope that this will not be the case.
As also always is, it is indispensable to learn its lesson from this first year of premature financings.
Primarily France could announce a change in its kind of posting for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of the respect for its obligations and the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European union.
Above all however France could bring the discussions forward over the contention of the long-term financings (another, crucial and momentarily discussed topic): one escapes from the question " Verrechenbarkeit" or the kind of posting of its loans not.
France could change its position, in order to be just as progressive regarding the points of issue, as it is with other things.
Hope is based thus on the new Secretary of the Environment Kosciusko Morizet, which will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement over the nearly start of France and its vision " Verrechenbarkeit" as well as the use of loans by nature the international confidence basis would raise, which is necessary for resuming discussions.
