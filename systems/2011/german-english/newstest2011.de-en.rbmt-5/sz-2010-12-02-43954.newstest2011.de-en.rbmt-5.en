Nothing like away here
In this evening it runs finally times again correctly approximately for the Irish.
No trace of Betrübnis.
But the home team dominates its guests made of Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans johlen before joy with crashing loud music, it stamp with the feet.
The Bailey pub in the southIrish Cork trembles, because the players Tischtennisbälle throw and meet over a three-meter distance in Bierbecher -.
" Bierpong" bizarre pageant calls itself, to win gives it 500 euros victory premium plus plane tickets after read Vegas for the Bierpong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this shrill drinking play and the reserved computer scientist, really do not fit.
And the 26-Jährige tries nevertheless to amuse to divert itself from the boring question, which will bring the future.
On its plan fun does not stand in read Vegas, it in January application discussions in New Zealand will lead.
" I dabei" a mulmiges feeling; , it says.
" It is not so far away from at home and still I a work dort."
Nevertheless: Its friend waits in Auckland already for him - " it had jerk, twitches its desire job as Eventmanagerin, perhaps a good Zeichen" , the young man says and smiles.
Because of bad perspectives at home already two from Tanners three brothers and sisters abroad looked for their luck.
Its sister Yvonne, a social female worker, is in Sydney, its brother Colin has now a place as an IT-advisor in London.
The boys go: As is the case for the Tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish will probably leave, forecast the country in next time experts of the economic and social research institute ESRI in Dublin.
To 2015 they count even on 200.000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a violent loss.
If the prognoses prove to be true, it comes to an emigration wave comparably with that one, from which Ireland suffered in the eighties.
After a decade of the upswing, which brought large prosperity for the Irish with itself, now again Tristesse makes itself broad.
The economic crisis disconcerts thereby above all the young, well trained Irish, for whom it went so far only uphill.
Job loss and social descent seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was used, to money gave it in the abundance.
In the meantime however are three of ten women and men under thirty without work.
In that Irish Times gives it zuhauf reader letters of young emigrants, who complain: " Everything goes into Ireland the brook runter."
" There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - however who can, leaves and our country loses thereby a whole Generation."
" The latter makes then please the light aus."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, sees a dark future drawing up, because the government operates only Augenwischerei and to the young people no more future prospects offers.
" They reduce the minimum wages, but they do not have a strategy, as new jobs are created sollen" , the 20-year old says.
She observes herself, like their fellow students from an unpaid practical course to the next hangeln.
Their largest concern, says it, is it, to have to emigrate in four years themselves.
" This thought is sad and deprimierend."
Men try to positively occupy such as Stephen McLarnon the topic.
McLarnon organizes " WorkingAbroadExpo" , a fair, which offers a Rundumservice about work abroad.
" For occupation beginners the work is abroad nevertheless a great chance, the first steps on the career leaders too machen" , the manager says.
On its web page photos surfers in Australia and Snowboarder point to Canada.
The message is clear: Abroad is no Galeerendienst works, but brings also freedom and fun.
How it feels to develop elsewhere something Seán O' knows; Donovan since a half year.
Because there was nothing more to do for the 29-jährigen engineer in Ireland, he works now with 15 Irish colleagues on the building in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they pull up a straight mode house.
In January it continues to go to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
Its homeland sees O' Donovan in the meantime only rarely, because it makes extra layers, in order to be able to at home pay the credit off for its house.
" The situation is already a little verrückt" , it says, when it steps after long time for the first time over the threshold of its house.
" I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I so well never more bin."
He laughs something moves and goes through cooled down areas.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with maintained front gardens, in the entries parks large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister O' has; Donovan the house for before four years for 380,000 euros bought - 100 per cent credit-finances.
" Were crazy times, it gave simple money without many Fragen" , it says.
Does it have fear that it could go wrong with the credit?
O' Donovan considers one while, pours hot tea after and says: " I do not have children, whom I must through-feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can again anfangen."
The civil engineer does not like a lamenting, which he often hears at present.
" Nobody must be hungry - our situation is nevertheless by far not as dramatic as here in earlier times on the Insel" , it says.
" One while abroad works, that is not the worst, which can happen - perhaps we feel thereby only as Iren."
He laughs and tells then of his father, who went in the last large economic crisis to England.
" After seven years it was and the life again there continued in Ireland, completely einfach."
Cian Tanner pleases this thought.
The future leave open and simply times look, like it runs with the life elsewhere.
A few years it has work in London already behind itself and why shouldn't it run in New Zealand also well for it and its friend?
A thing is there however still, those it in these days concerned belonging to: the celebration to its 27. Birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He is afraid that it could degenerate into a life well-being party.
" Only not too many Emotionen" , it says and drinks a large sip of its beer.
" Life well-being, which sounds nevertheless beängstigend."
" We call it rather a leaving party, completely loosely, also a few friends, a few drink, a few Spielen."
