Love in times of the war
Since Angelina Jolie began in the summer with the work on her still nameless direction debut, there is annoyance.
The film script wrote it, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more white one over it non is however already enough for unrest.
Persistent keeps itself the rumor, the woman, Muslim, falls in love during the Yugoslavia war with their Serbian rapist.
Bosnian woman federations protested immediately, whereupon some turning days planned in Sarajevo were moved at short notice to Hungary.
In the meantime the film is turned off in Hungary and in post office production, but it still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote over the UN refugee organization UNHCR Jolie and required a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper now reported - Jolie is even ambassador of the UN refugee organization.
It is diplomatic non it to the women weeks ago already times a meeting in Hungary offered, which rejected however.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic.
Love stories in Vergewaltigungscamps it did not give, and to Jolies attitude the victims in relation to betrayal it enough over the film script.
Their organization recommended according to the UN refugee organization to dismiss Jolie as an ambassador reports the Guardian.
What exactly however wrote Jolie for scenes?
The Bosnian cultural Ministry, which got to read their film script, gave a turning permission for Sarajevo after some back and forth - it is not completely clear, why Jolie did not come then nevertheless.
The young authoress protested, her does not pursue political intentions with her film, with much trouble into the Yugoslavia conflict trained themselves, wants the terrible consequences of the war to show and to all sides involved a voice give.
With contents it remains however vague.
Thus still another second Synopsis circulates to the film in the net, which sounds then nevertheless rather differently: The loving already knew each other therein before outbreak of war and meet again, when them, Bosnian Muslim, are kidnapped in a Serbian Camp, in which it as a guard work.
Which nevertheless substantially differently sounds " than the variant; Rape victim slams himself in Folterknecht."
That Jolies film actually already before the war begins - as much is safe.
The pressure on it, so Jolie, is " unfairly and is based on Fehlinformationen."
Now you can provide probably only the hackers of Hollywood peace: By it the film script, as already so many place before, illegaly in the net.
