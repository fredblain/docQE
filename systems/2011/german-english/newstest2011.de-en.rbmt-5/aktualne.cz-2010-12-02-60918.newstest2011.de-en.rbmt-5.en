What is to do it, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither VOL the place, nor the "confectionery."
The new councilmen of the capital from the numbers of the ČSSD will have to overcome obviously certain language barriers, in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prager advice and in the city agency at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz "knocked off" members of the new advice from the ČSSD times a little, how they control the notorious Slang, which nationalized itself in the last years, in which the today's coalition partners in Prague at the rudder were.
The coded vocabulary, which was introduced in the verflossenen era by mayor Pavel Bém by the Prager political elite, is unites the most well-known participants, situations and Causae taken.
Surprisingly it showed up that the new advice grope regarding these new terms somewhat in the dark.
They maintain that at least.
"Who is VOL the place?"
"No notion."
"I am rather a beginner in the Prager politics," reacted Lukáš Kaucký, the new councilman for culture, on the test of the "godfather vocabulary."
In addition, the councilman Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example on the term "gulf hole."
"That is the only expression of those, which submit here you to me, which I use now and then."
"Otherwise do not hold I much of Slang."
From the vocabulary, which the day sheet Aktuálně.cz had published in June of this year before the congress of choice of the ODS, pickte the editorship of six terms, out above all such, which are notoriously with the Prager municipal authorities connected.
The Social Democrats should the terms "VOL the place," "largest Prager gulf hole," "into the confectionery go," "bull necks," "betrayal of the capital" and "sheet metals" defining.
Three Prager councilmen agreed the test, fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future boss of the Prager of public education - promised first its participation in the discussion, did not remove then however not times the listener.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the beginning.
"These things are me all the same and like the civil democrats among themselves maintained, about it judge themselves I not."
"For me is important, like we within the framework of our programs understand themselves," countered it.
As already suggested, Lukáš Kaucký in the headline mentioned above would allegedly not have recognized that of the influential entrepreneur and friend of the ex mayor Bém, novel Janoušek is the speech.
The term "VOL the place" does not say nothing at all to Kaucky and the only term, which it guessed with the test correctly, was purely "the largest Prager gulf hole."
"That is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, however still added for security: "However I know rather from the newspaper."
And jokeful: "I will probably have to occupy a language course."
The "gulf hole" is then deciphered correctly not only of Matador Karel Březina, but also of the advice gentleman for environmental questions Lukáš Plachý as tunnel Blanka.
Both in addition, Social Democrats know, for whom the term VOL the place stands and suspects Lukáš Plachý even, where this figure is to be found and thus also, what it is called, "into the confectionery to go."
"I believe, i.e., into any Prager catering trade enterprise to go," is Plachý quite close on to the mystery solution, if one knows that it concerns here the seat of Janoušeks companies.
Agreeing with Březina it protests however these knowledge rather from the newspaper to have drawn that this vocabulary would be own to it.
By the test participants to judge, it seems to actually give no similarly nationalized Slang among the Social Democrats.
"I asked also my colleagues, but obviously it does not give such a thing with us really."
"We calls ourselves with the name, now and then use we also contractions or nicknames," say the chairman of the Prager ČSSD Petr Hulínský - of its party comrades casually "Hulda" mentioned.
"At school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I do not know whether also my colleagues in such a way call, betray me" us Karel Březina its nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz tried out and sees the name there - it functions.
Councilman Weinert is friendly for the party comrades friendly the "Grandpa" or less the "old person," who representative Miroslav pounds, which made attentive before the elections by machinations with party sponsoring on itself, from some colleagues "Igráček" (well-known Czech Lego figure) called.
Nicknames are so the only one, which the Social Democrats in the within the party linguistic usage permit.
Hulínský does not like it allegedly, if one calls him "Hulda," but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered still another another nickname of the Prager chairman.
His nickname "doctor of the rubber club rights" it has to do allegedly with the fact that Petr Hulínský acquired its title Doctor juris at the Bratislaver police academy.
