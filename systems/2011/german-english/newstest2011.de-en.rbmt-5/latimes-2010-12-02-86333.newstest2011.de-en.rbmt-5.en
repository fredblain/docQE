Arsenic-resistant microbe could elsewhere make new ways of life possible on earth or
The discovery of a strange type of bacteria, which can live among other things on arsenic, opens new possibilities for new ways of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, it is in their opinion an indication for the fact that a life is possible as vitally necessary judged elements also without those so far.
" This organism has two MÃ¶glichkeiten."
" It needs phosphorus or Arsen." for growing either;
" That makes it somewhat completely special one, although it nearly a kind ' fremde' Way of life ist" , Paul C.W explained. Davies of the Arizona State University and CO author of the report, which appears to the magazine on Thursday in the online edition Science.
So far six main elements were vitally necessary regarded as - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But like the scientists, continue to grow Lake found the bacterium out in the California mono also still if it replaces phosphorus by arsenic.
" There one asks oneself nevertheless, what ist" otherwise still possible; , the CO author of the report Ariel D said. Anbar of the Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step with the search for extraterrestial life, since scientists must recognize lives and its forms, like that Anbar.
The study is concerned with microbes, which were found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were announced to the discovery, gave too wide-spread speculations to cause in the Internet that the report could act of the discovery of extraterrestial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery " it shows that in other planet systems organisms can set biochemical processes with the help of other elements on and that the ' Standardelemente' , which are absolutely vitally necessary according to our opinion, not necessarily firmly given sind" , explained Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and space Sciences Research of institutes of the open university the kingdom united by Milton Keynes in.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
" This work is a new fact, because it shows that in fundamental biochemical processes and structures an element by another are replaced kann" , Cockell added.
This discovery was not coincidental.
Felisa wolf Simon of astro+biological Institut of NASA, which led the study, selected the mono Lake due to the high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus resemble themselves chemically, it assumed that microbes, which are exposed to both can replace possibly an element by the other one.
" The toxicity of the arsenic is based above all on the fact that it behaves chemically similarly as Phosphor."
" Thus it falls the organisms heavily, an element from the other one to unterscheiden."
" But the difference is so large that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It arrives into our biochemical system, where it verschmiert" quasi everything; , Anbar explains.
The researchers exposed the bacterium to GFAJ-1 of a rising arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
The microbe grows in phosphorus better, but that it can survive also in arsenic, it points that a arsenic-based way of life can naturally occur, either on earth or to another planet or moon, on the arsenic more frequently occurs.
According to Jamie S. Foster, Dozentin for microbiology at the University OF Florida, is not new the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic. But so far there was still no functioning example.
Arsenic occurred in the early earth years more frequently, says it, therefore the science assumed early ways of life used it.
" That gives reason to the acceptance that life can have developed also differently than in the early Erdzeitalter" , so Forster, which was not member in wolf Simons research team.
The research work became from NASA, which energy Ministry and the national health authorities support.
