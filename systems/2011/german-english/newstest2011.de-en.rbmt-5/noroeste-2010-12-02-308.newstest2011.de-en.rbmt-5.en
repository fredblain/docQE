NASA announces the find of extraterrestial life
The North American space agency called up a press conference, in order to tomorrow before-set a find, which will have effects on the search for organisms in the universe.
Tomorrow, Thursday, a astro+biological discovery announces the national air and space agency (NASA) of the United States, which could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestial life.
The find is introduced tomorrow at 13.00 o'clock at a press conference in the seat of NASA in Washington von Experten of astrobiology. It concerns a science, those the origin, the development, which examines distribution and the future of lives in the universe.
During summoning to the press conference insured NASA, it is " an supervision-exciting find for the search for extraterrestial Leben" presents, what with experts of other countries released speculations.
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments, which unbwohnbar one considered so far manlike creatures can exist. The hypothesis was raised that these could transform into intelligent organisms - as humans -, if their living conditions improved.
Apparently it acts around a microbe, which was found on the reason of the mono Lake in the Yosemite national park, California. It lives there in an environment, which was considered too poisonous for all conceivable ways of life, since the lake is strongly arsenic.
In some way the Mikrobie uses the arsenic as survival resources. With consideration of this ability the chances increase that there could be similar life on other planets, which do not have our protecting atmosphere.
If these organisms amplifier-off-change the arsenic, it is proven in accordance with the astrobiologists that " it actual another way of life, a second way of life gives, which admitted themselves from us unterscheidet."
The space agency gives tomorrow, on Thursday, on which press conference the actual range of its find well-known.
To conference participate Geobiologin Pamela Conrad, which possibility of lives on Mars examines, and which biologist Steven Benner, one the scientist, whom titanium (the largest moon Saturns) under the question, whether its chemical composition resembles that the earth, it studies.
