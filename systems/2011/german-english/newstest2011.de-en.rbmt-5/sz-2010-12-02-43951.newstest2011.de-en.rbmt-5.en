Puzzling earthwork
The atomic energy authority IAEA has new referring to a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country resists however to take in addition position - still it permits controls.
Against midnight of 5th on 6 September 2007 attacks at least four Israeli F-15 I of combat aircraft a mysterious, würfelförmiges building in Syria.
It stands on the bank Euphrates; the next larger city, 30 kilometers far away, is Dair as-Saur.
Their name emerges in documents of the international atomic energy authority (IAEA), if it concerns the reactor, which Syria built allegedly with the help of from North Korea in the right parallelepiped, hidden in a valley, which goes off the river.
According to a Briefing of the US foreign secret service CIA von Ende April 2008 also the reactor common under the name of the close locality el-Kibar would have been well suitable to produce plutonium - from nuclear weapons to build let themselves.
For other purposes against it the technology from the 50s is hardly suited.
The CIA led a video presentation forwards with indistinct satellite photographs.
By computer animation it faded in, where which components of the reactor before the destruction are to have been, which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the atomic center Yongbyon.
Besides it submitted, those to photos the building from the proximity to show or the interior.
The reactor is confessed shortly before start-up, it was said, but equips not yet with fuel rods been.
Today, more as three years after the bombardment, is hardly more well-known than at that time, the mysteries became rather larger with the time.
The former US president George W. Bush revealed recently in his memoirs the fact that the CIA before the attack was quite safe that Syria in el-Kibar built a reactor but hardly saw reference points for it that it " in the country; an active Nuklearwaffenprogramm" gave.
Some secret service agents in Europe are there rather still more careful and speak only of one " alleged Reaktor" , even if it " the CIA presentation for; plausibel" hold.
Hard proofs are missing to them, just like the IAEA.
In demand, as safe he was to have a reactor before itself a high UN-diplomat answered in the summer only lapidary, those IAEA " enough material, around questions too stellen."
The debris of the alleged " unused Militärgebäudes" the Syrians created hasty aside and planed the area thoroughly.
A IAEA team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium in June 2008, which had been manufactured by humans, found nevertheless.
Besides the IAEA kept satellite photographs of commercial offerers from the time after the attack, who might be more meaningful than of the CIA presented direct over a member state.
However these photographs on the market are not to be gotten, because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot verify from there their authenticity independently.
Syria has always to have protested, a secret nuclear programme to have never operated or a reactor build.
The uranium comes from the Israeli weapons, explained Damascus.
But the IAEA rejected after analysis of the particles as improbable.
Damascus refuses since then discussing - exactly the same as the satellite photographs.
Besides it refuses a second inspection in el-Kibar and the entrance to the rubble of the zerbombten building to the testers.
In addition, Israel is silent iron.
" We are never kommentieren" that; , recently that affirmed at present the attack acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert the official position.
Thus the investigation of the case drags itself since June 2008 without result and " develops increasingly to a serious reliability problem for the Behörde" , how a high western diplomat at the seat of the IAEA in Vienna grants - finally a heavy offence against the Nuclear NONPROLIFERATION Treaty is located in the area, over which the IAEA is awake.
As key to progress with the clearing-up the IAEA sees obviously three further mechanisms, which " in functional Verbindung" with the presumed reactor to stand are to still exist - and differently than these.
The inspectors revealed so far neither, which plants it concerns, still which function it to have or which lets it appear suspicious.
After information of the South German newspaper they are internally called Masyaf and Iskandariayah with the IAEA Marj as-Sultan, derived again from close convenient cities.
Independent institutes for the Science and internationally to Security in Washington (Isis) these places identified and on satellite photographs a building complex with Masyaf made, with which it acts in all probability over one of the suspicious objects.
It is possibly in or directly beside a military base - exactly with this reason Syria of the IAEA refuses the entrance to the three places.
In Vienna is called it, the Syrians was afraid one fishing expedition - that the IAEA is before-sent from the USA, in order to spy military plants.
Because the nuclear detectives had become attentive by an hint of the U.S. secret services on the mechanisms.
The IAEA has references, under the fact satellite photos that between the three places and the right parallelepiped at the Euphrates material and was transported.
A high western diplomat in Vienna said, at least one of the plants could " in connection with the Brennstoffproduktion" stand.
It gives however " no referring to sensitive Aktivitäten" , thus uranium enrichment or reprocessing; Processes, which are necessary for the building of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come and where from it the plutonium for the bomb should be separated later, to these central questions there are if necessary plausible assumptions.
Unclear it is also whether rubble, which could save valuable traces, to which three places were stored.
As if the hundreds of truck loads of the ground would have disappeared, want to have nobody information about where the debris remained.
Only the few kilometers of el-Kibar on the other side Euphrates convenient salt mine Al-Tibni, which examined Syria 1998 for its suitability than camps for radioactive waste, the IAEA than improbable is valid.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had it recently in an analysis of satellite photographs for the renowned magazine Jane' s Intelligence Review brought with the reactor in connection.
Photographs from the orbit show however that Syria at the three suspicious places made earthwork and removed large containers, after the IAEA entrance had required.
That can be coincidence, however hardly contributed to eliminate the suspicion.
Besides it is called some months in diplomat circles, the IAEA after used to develop a plan for inspections there which should permit it to Syria, any military secrets to true - alone the expenditure shows, how large the interest of the inspectors is.
Meanwhile, Damascus ironed also this proposal off.
Still one year ago had appeased western diplomat in Vienna, who was reactor destroyed, therefore the thing does not have high urgency, for instance US Ambassador Glyn Davies brings so-called special inspections since a few months in the play, one of the sharpest means, which have the Viennese atomic energy authority, in order to implement controls.
IAEA boss Yukiya Amano, which would have to suggest these inspections, " of course of; an option, for which I in the future openly bin" spoken, still however he hesitates.
It lies a high risk in this way: On the one hand it needs for it a majority in the board of governors of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented there are everything but erpicht on an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat gives to consider: " What is, if they do not find nothing at all at the end? "
