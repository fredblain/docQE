The army has so many igniter cords that one could tape completely Czech Republic you to hold however only two years
The Czech army has 445 kilometers of igniter cords to be bought, with explosive devices ignited.
In the year before the Ministry of Defense had produced already 224 kilometers of igniter cord to the army camps.
It is already reassuring to know that the armed forces out-ensured for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the igniter cords - two, at the most however four years.
The army bought the igniter cords of the corporation STV Group, A.S. for läppische 40 million crowns.
In its reason for the purchase the general staff MF DNES, which would use soldiers annually to the 60 kilometers of igniter cord, answered this enormous quantity of igniter cord.
The searches of Armeepyrotechnikern according to, which addressed MF DNES on it, it comes out from this indication that the whole army would have to complete annually extremely intensive pyrotechnic training - from all generals and officers of the army command, up to the secretaries and charwomen.
Secretary of Defense Alexandr Vondra and army general Vlastimil Picek not exceptionally.
The considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers igniter cords would only thus let itself justify halfway.
This length by the way corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
In addition, these army existence became in such a way for more than ten years are enough.
If however still the old rule of experts is valid that for the training of each new career soldier two meters of igniter cord are sufficient completely, then the army created itself a reassuring supply by these new purchases - also under the criterion of the increased need of the pioneer and special-purpose forces - for the 225 years already mentioned.
Soldiers of the sentence brigade weighted recently with the Secretary of Defense Vondra, it would have nearly no cartridges for hand-held weapons more, so that firing exercises of the missing means are because of strongly reduced.
To be silent from the lack of pant completely.
" Me it is not received why she kaufen." from us such enormous amounts of igniter cords;
But that is its decision, it already will finally know, to which she brauchen." her;
" For us the army is a good customer, who we come as dealers as far as possible against möchten" , the sales manager of the STV Group says January Děcký.
January Pejšek, which justifies speakers of the Ministry of Defense the purchase hundred of kilometers of igniter cord thereby, which would have itself army so at least for ten years with this " Munition" covered up.
January Děcký of the STV Group speaks however only of a four years old life of the igniter cords and police and Armeepyrotechniker only of two years.
" With perfect storage are probably the four mentioned years möglich" , one of them does not grant, which wants to remain however anonymous, in order as a soldier to the criticism at the army to be accused.
At expiration of the life any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and the life of the soldiers does not endanger.
These tests are however not in vain, but cost further money.
A further argument of the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers of igniter cord.
" They cost us sixty per cent less, than the last year supply of 244 Kilometern" , speaker Pejšek communicates the point of view of the buyers of the Ministry of Defense to us.
Only to the comparison: The annual consumption of igniter cords of Pyrotechnikern of the police, already some years liquidate, exceed the ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet brother army long hardly 1,500 meters.
And the police orders in each case such quantities of this ammunition, which can use it still before expiration of the life.
Already the security of the Pyrotechniker because of, in addition one keeps oneself so the possibility open for flexible purchases of more modern and thus also reliable igniter cords.
The Ministry of Defense has anyway enormous problems with the liquidation Zehntausender tons of ammunition from times Warsaw Treaty, when the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovakian People's Army prepared for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the Pyrotechnikern, whom MF DNES addressed, in a few years the same problem expects the Czech armed forces with the liquidation hundred of kilometers of old igniter cords, which it " in such a way today; günstig" bought.
