A longer index finger than Ringfinger means a lower risk to get sick with cancer
Men, whose index finger is longer, as the Ringfinger, are obviously exposed to a smaller risk to get sick with Prostatakrebs.
That is the surprising result of a study, which was published on Wednesday by British the journal OF CAN cerium.
That is to be connected with the mirror of the male hormone Testosteron.
" Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as simple test for the risk of Prostatakrebs and this sechzig" in particular with men to; , the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, explained Professorin at Krebsforschungsinstitut at the university in Warwick.
The finger could thus determine help, which men should absolutely undergo to a Prostatakrebs test, above all, if genetic risks or other factors of risk are present, like for example family health loads, Mrs. Eeles added.
In the period of 1994-2009 she pursued than 1500 patients with Prostatakrebs with her colleagues in Britain more, at the same time in addition, 3000 healthy men.
With more as half of the participants of the study the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the Ringfinger.
For these men the same probability of Prostatakrebs, as for 19 per cent of those men, was valid whose ring and index finger were equivalent long.
With men, whose index finger was longer than the Ringfinger, this risk sank however by 33 per cent, with men to sixty by 87 per cent.
The relationship of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which already form at the pränatalen age, reflects obviously the different mirrors of sex hormones, the child was exposed to which in the Gebärmutter.
Less Testosteron corresponds to a longer index finger.
Earlier research resulted in that the straight Testosteron accelerates the growth of Prostatakrebs.
Václav Pačes, prominent Czech Genetiker and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK, him this study was volatilely well-known, yet do not consider it the relationship between the finger length and the cancer risk so far " completely erwiesen."
