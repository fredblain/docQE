Rachsüchtige hacker and emsige spies
The affair WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On a side it emerged as obvious scandal, a scandal, which is only a scandal in the Sinner hypocrisy, those the Beziehunge between the states, which citizen and the press govern.
On the other side she announces profound changes on international level, and gives a foretaste on the future dominated by involution.
But we proceed in sequence.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that everyone of a secret service consists provided document (an x-arbitrary nation) exclusively of newspaper cuttings.
" außerordentlichen" , American exposures over the sexual habits Berlusconis throw nothing else off as what one got to anyway read over months in each x-arbitrary journal (except those, whose owner is Berlusconi), and that frightening karikaturierte profile Gaddafis offered Kabarettkünstlern already since long time material for their Sketche.
The rule, according to which the secret dossiers may consist only of already well-known pieces of news, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go into a library, which dedicates itself to esotherischen publications, you will recognize that each work (over the Gral, which Mysterium of Rennes le Chateau, those Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) accurately repeats, what in previous works were already written.
That comes along not alone that the author of okkulter texts does not want to publish searches (still from there that he would not know, where pieces of news would be over the non--existing thing to be found), but because those, which dedicate themselves to the Okkultismus, believe in nothing differently than, what they already know and confirm, what they already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Likewise the secret documents.
The informant is lazy, and putridly (or limited spirit) also the boss of the secret service (otherwise it could whatever be, for example editor with Libération) is, which judges only as true, which he recognizes.
The Top Secret information about Berlusconi, which had sent the American message in Rome to the state department, was the same as those, which Newsweek had already published the week before.
Was such why thus made waiving around the exposures of these dossiers?
On a side these that already knows each educated person, mean that the messages - at least since end of the Second World War and since then also the heads of government mutually to call to be able themselves or an airplane to take be able, in order to meet with dinner - their diplomatic function to have lost and, with exception of some small tasks of representation, in espionage centers to have transformed.
Any spectator of investigation films knows this very exactly, and it does not happen from hypocrisy that one does in such a way, this to ignore.
Nevertheless: the fact to repeat it publicly injures the task of the hypocrisy and serves to set the American diplomacy into a bad light.
In second place: The idea that an x-arbitrary hacker can tap the secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world, saves the substantial impact against the prestige of the state department.
Besides the scandal brings the victims less, than rather " Scharfrichter" in distress.
But we dedicate ourselves its that happened to deep nature.
Formerly, to Orwells times, one could bundle all power bread ago like a Big, for each gesture of its subjects controlled.
Orwells prophecy could itself have put since then as perfectly correctly, where one can control each movement owing to the telephone, each transacted transaction, the visited hotel out, the selected motorway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
If one leads oneself however before eyes, which runs off today that even the secret crypts of power cannot escape from no more control of a hacker, then the Kontrollgang stops being on one side arranged and becomes zirkelförmig.
Power controls each citizen, but each citizen, or at least the hacker - chooses as Rächer of the citizen -, can get to know the secrets to power.
How however can a power hold itself, which is not any more able, their own secrets to protect?
It is correct, George Simmel said already that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can be never revealed); it is likewise true that jedwede knowledge of the character Berlusconis or Merkels is free in the reason a secret from Geheimis, since it surrenders the public sphere; but in styles of WikiLeaks to reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means, to rob she of any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel injustice, however on the other hand to Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this offense be, which was caused to a so enormous power?
It is obvious that the states will place in the future no reserved information more on-line ones - that would equal a notice glued to at the street corner.
But it is just as obvious that it is with the current technologies in vain to hope to be able to keep confidential reports secret over telephone.
Nothing is being found out more simply than whether and when a head of state in an airplane moved and contacted one of its colleagues.
How in the future could private and only relations intended for certain ears be maintained?
I very probably know that my forecast sounds novelful for the moment after Science Fiction and, but I do not see myself forced to present to me the government agents in secret way emsig on uncontrollable routes of march moving, their reports anywhere differently than beyond that in the bare memory with carrying, and the few written information, which got her, in the shoe paragraph hiding.
The information would be stored in only copy in locked drawers: in the reason the espionage attempt of Watergate less success had to register, than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology progresses nowadays like a cancer, i.e. backwards.
One century after the wireless Telegraf communication had revolutionized, reconstructs the Internet a Telegrafen with (telephone) wire.
(Similar) the video cassettes for the film researchers had made possible to explore a film volume for volume by reeling from the rear forward and all secrets of the assembly air knew, while (numeric) the CD make nowadays nothing else possible to jump as from chapter to chapter thus in macro portions.
With the high-speed courses one drives within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this requires three and a half hours by airplane including transferring.
It is not unusual from there that politics and communications technology return to car and horse.
A last observation.
In earlier times the press tried to understand, what for secrets between the messages were forged.
There is present the messages, which demand confidential information of the press.
