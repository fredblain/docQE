The ice university
To " Gelato University" with Bologna Eiskonditoren are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day-long basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest inlet and visitor from the whole world.
From where does the whole ice actually come?
Of the Gelatiere and of the Gelataio.
The Gelatiere, on German somewhat anciently the Eiskonditor, manufactures the cream according to all rules of the Italian Eismacherkunst.
The Gelataio gets the ice cream from the cooling counter with a putty, paints it into the Waffel and sells it then.
In order to know, one does not have after Anzola dell' Emilia in the province Bologna drive.
But who would like to know still more about ice, that does not come to " Gelato University" the Italian company Carpigiani past.
The ice university furnished the manufacturer of ice machines in the year 2003, so that the ice cream becomes fair from its machines everywhere the high Italian ideals.
The three-day-long basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest inlet and visitor from all over the world.
In addition, there are special courses of several days approximately around the chocolate ice and practical courses in the internal ice-cream parlor.
Some dreams others in the Midlife Crisis about a new career, dares itself simply times on the smooth ice of its vague longings.
This mark are there 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil over Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow Food movement and wants in the country of the industrial Ice Cream in the future a European quality product to offer.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and wants after years in a nerve-racking job something own in bags.
Two young Egyptian inside dream to open in Cairo an ice-cream parlor.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bar - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes, because its children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains first the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream to the participants.
Are crucial not only good taste, but also the seidige suppleness and the good consistency.
Luciano does not forget the Sahnehäubchen of the national and at all südländischen building of over with its training in addition: " Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then still each quantity of romance is dabei."
The first step for production seems completely simple.
Luciano tilts to basicadd the milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which heats up and then on four degrees cools everything down immediately with an electronic program on 85 degrees.
Then it untwists a cock at the machine, and a pasteurisierte white basis cream, basis for all milk ice sorts comes out.
The lecturer with questions is stormed immediately: Can one manufacture ice cream only with natural materials without stabilizer?
How can one leave free run to the own experimentation desire?
Luciano warns of it, from the spirit of the time in errs lead to let.
Who of ice cream " only from natural Zutaten" talks, possibly nevertheless stabilizers used - usually a natural product, about Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne.
Naturally one can manufacture ice also without stabilizer, only it must be sold then within a daily, otherwise it sags in itself together, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Certain variations at the basic dimension are permitted.
It becomes more exciting with the flavours.
For the taste in the ice Maestro Luciano differentiates between added, which one buys in the Obst-Abteilung or with the sweets of the supermarket.
Besides gives it gives powders and pastes.
" The suppliers are anzudrehen." all to try, you dozens of aromatized additives;
" But you should simply times experimentieren."
Either with the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and blow fruits.
Or with the ice cream from the white basic dimension, those with eggs to the yellow cream becomes even and with cocoa powder the basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the class participants may to the ice machines.
Luciano leaves it in each case four to different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, Mokka and Haselnuss ice manufactures - with or without eggs in the basic dimension, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural additives.
Also the fruit ice sorts are submitted to the same experiment.
More flavour material, more fruit Püree - geschmacklich that is not necessarily better.
Haselnuss ice does not taste more nussiger necessarily, if it contains more Haselnüsse.
The most popular Kiwi ice manufactures the working group, which uses more fruits, fewer waters and somewhat less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture emphasizes the taste of a Gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Ice production is an arithmetic problem: If peach Püree with much sugar is used, the sugar portion in the basic prescription must be reduced.
For lemon ice an extra portion of sugar is necessary.
Luciano pulls equipment out, with which he the sugar content of the fruit sorts certainly (winegrowers measure thereby the Oechsle in the Traubenmost).
Fortunately tables facilitate the Rechnerei.
Ice to make requires no longer as much physical employment as in former times.
Not only the equipment for the automatic production of the basic dimensions helps.
There is also equipment, in which the finished ice mixture is cremig struck at the same time and cooled on temperatures below freezing.
All automation to the defiance small breakdowns are not missing.
The Brazilian Gustavo bekleckert itself and its course colleagues from top to bottom with Fruchtpüree, when the oversize staff mixer gets to him out of control.
" In each Kurs" , Maestro Luciano means " it is only one question of the time, until passiert." such a thing;
