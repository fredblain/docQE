The Argentinier magnified the importance of itself with the medal to second champions, it a step behind the winners stayed and surprisingly it with the same team following each other final games delivered.
The santistische strategist reached the first final game as a coach with the ' Torneo Apertura 2002' , when del Morelia had the reins in the hand, with which he experienced a large defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, with the ' Clausura 2003' reached it the crucial duel, which it lost also with 3-1 against Rayados.

To know that this series could be decided by penalty shootout, it does not worry it, because it trusts its players: " One wants to never arrive with the penalty shootout, one would like in the regular play time to lock, sometimes but there is no alternative and one must for it be preparatory, in previous tour was preparatory we, but to us the fate unfortunately prepared to sometimes regard a bad play, due to nervousness or the violent tendency, the title in the hands, left us somewhat as this final game, and we to hope that this mark to it do not come wird."
