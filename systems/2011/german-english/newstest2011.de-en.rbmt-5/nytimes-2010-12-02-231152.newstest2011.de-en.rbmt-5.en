Police employments in China become gentler
Like a training officer seaweed Shenbin walked across an urban place, examined his nervous subordinates and gave thereby with military Authorität and absorbed voice of instructions.
It wanted that its female members of the Chengguan - of China robust guards of the urban order, feared and despised for its arbitrary raids and its tendency to the force - which spectators impress.
" Straight ones stand! "
" View straightforward! "
" Shows ihnen" , it whispered to them too, " how pretty girls like that are! "
Four girls, hardly the tea rodent age entwachsen, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and trousers stood stramm.
Four pair black pumps were located in straight lines row.
Four tidy hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white touched loops.
" For me they see on the average aus" , Mr. Tang notices geringschätzig.
" Models are hübsch."
Several governments already tried to up-polish the image of of China city inspectors.
In a city all new applicants must have a university conclusion.
The province Guangdong introduced instead of the grey-green bright blue uniform.
Wuhan in central China replaced force by Niederstarren: 2009 circled according to reports 50 officials a duly not set up lunch car and stared the operator on, until this packed up after a half hour and left the place.
Xindu, an urban district in Chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants, would like to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003 13 women strengthen the urban police patrols. They were selected special due to their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They are to lend a softer, feminine aspect to the grobschlächtigen police.
But also Scarlett Johansson would unfortunately succeed hardly, the bad picture, which the Chinese of these city commands have to improve.
With good reason, so the critics.
Differently than the police these officials may implement the urban laws only assistance of penalties or other administrative punishments.
But the Chinese media show by routine another picture.
In January 2008 officials in the province Hubei flogged a spectator to death, when this filmed her with its mobile phone thereby how they struck down a protest action against a dumping ground.
In the last year a training course manual of the Pekinger officials was stolen and published in the Internet. One describes how offenders without bloodshed can be lambasted.
In this year a Shanghaier suffered water melon dealers after a hand mixture with five an official brain injuries.
A video game strotzendes before force that from the Internet can be downloaded, shows trained officials in China with an attack on street traders.
" Chengguan makes Angst" for the government; , the national newspaper China Daily lamentierte in the last year, after further controversies concerning tactics.
The newspaper required one " really thorough Säuberung."
Sceptics find the current beginning for clearly insufficient.
When the Distrik looked for eight female recruits in October by announcement, a Editorial asked the question into Beijing Evening news whether the Mrs. genuine tasks had been supposed to serve or only as optical diverson.
Probably both.
According to job advertisement women at the age were " from 18 to 22 with good figure and; harmonious Gesichtszügen" searched.
They should be above average large - over 1,5m or 5 foot, 2 1/2 tariff.
Conditions of employment end with the reaching 26. Year of life.
According to the officials is the activity for women over 25 physically too exerting.
" The most important is their Image" , a unnamed district official indicated Rednet.com to government web page for that quasi.
" Whether the candidates get the job, depends first on their outside feature, like size of, weight, features, usw."
Then come temper and " internal Qualitäten."
" Female Chengguan is like Blumenvasen" , it said and added, " but beyond that they have still different Pflichten."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director/conductor of the city administration of the district, would like this description not obligations,
it admitted however that in China size defaults are not uncommon in job advertisements for both kinds of sex.
The same is valid for even features.
Whether with good appearance is to be equated, is disputed in China.
But humans with handicaps or physical distortions do not need to apply.
" We know here unfortunately no lame ones or Buckligen gebrauchen" , so Mr. Zheng.
" Their image would not be gut."
Liu Yi, which patroliert at the Baoguang place close of a monastery, is 22, has Apfelbäckchen and a probably formed mouth.
It empfindetes not as sexistisch that so large value on their appearance one puts.
" Do you, I find look in this uniform sexy? " she asks with ironical view.
Their colleague with the Grübchen, which 21-jährige Xu Yang commentates, " We repräsentieren." the task, the image of the city too;
According to their data they do not regret the short attitude, since they would have more ambitious career plans, as simply only dealers by the lanes to scheuchen, in order to prevent it from the business making.
Each morning is concerned the patrol with approx. twelve street traders, who try, to sell to foot or on the bicycle as much as possible rolls and Tofugerichte before they are away-hunted.
" Mr. Wang, you disappear here bitte."
" We already so often said that to you! " explains Ms Xu to a dealer, who had fled to foot and its fastened on a bicycle cart noodle kitchen in the pass had left temporary.
According to the woman officials is rather monotonous the activity as arduous.
" It is dasselbe" nearly each day; , Huang Jing, explains 20, in the spare time the sales natures studied.
" All Routine."
A reason for it is that the female officials the goods of the dealers may not konfiszieren, like their male colleagues.
They can threaten offenders only to announce it to their male superiors.
That is to protect it against public meeting with hostility, officials are frequently exposed to which in China.
In this year hundreds inhabitant of Kunming, the capital of the province Yunnan, after the rumor circulated, randalierte Chengguan officials a dealer would have killed.
More than one dozen of policemen and Chenguan officials were injured with the night incident, 14 government vehicles were upset or been into fire.
Xindu remained so far spared by such force excesses.
But unrests are not to be excluded.
Only two of block far away from the calm Baonguang place, at which the female officials patroulierten on this morning, met over 50 persons at a street corner.
Officials had konfisziert a motorcycle, which was repaired against the regulations on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner cried Zeter and Mordio.
After 15-minütigem the officials with grimmigem face the way to their vehicles cleared and continued a hesitating with the motorcycle and its owner.
Left Xuedong, 40, a co-ordinator of the male patrol, stayed. It turned its white name plate, in order to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues the co-ordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supporting role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
" Sometimes we go verbal vor."
" Sometimes in addition, körperlich" , Mr. Li explains soberly.
" The people with the controversy catch most time an."
