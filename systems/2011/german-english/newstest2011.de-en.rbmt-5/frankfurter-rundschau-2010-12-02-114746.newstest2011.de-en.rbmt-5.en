It was demo.
It snowed.
History is well-known: In September the excavators were moved forward and had begun to break a large piece off of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no more the same: Zigtausende demonstrated billions-worth setting of the station lower against S21.
When it came to the building stop, a majority of the wing lay in rubble.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.

Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
It has itself few that breaking into secured.
" These stones are Reliquien."
" They may not verschwinden."
It swarms: " A cheap and poor stone, simply and erdenhaft."
When it sawed one, after cigarette smoke had smelled.
Which it will make with breaking into, it does not know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell also.
The trace of the Stuttgart stones leads into a forest with T5ubingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen its loaded established.
The 44-Jährige acts with old stones.
He bought all, which resulted with the outline in Stuttgart.
" It would be a dishonor, it to crushed stone husbands or in the dump was verschwinden" , it says to a Holzbüdchen, which was once an awake little house in its office.
Insulted and if one threatened it, he tells, when in September in the newspapers it stood that he had bought the remainders of the north wing of the abort entrepreneur.
But it talked with the S-21-Gegnern, for days.
And it explained to them that it cannot do nevertheless now nothing at all for the outline.
And if it happens now, then it is the most reasonable nevertheless, if the stones were re-used.
About 200 S-21-Gegner took themselves thereupon one on average 80 Kilos heavy right parallelepiped also, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As memories, some in addition, in hope to be able to return it in a reconstruction.
500 tons Rongen had bought, to 25 large truck loads.
About half still stores in the forest, which is remainder long sold.

From everywhere they came and away-dragged, which trunk and supporters could carry.
Stuttgart stones of the impact long in " themselves; Mäuerle" transformed or into delimitations of herb patches.
" Actually this stone is not anything Besonderes" , Rongen says.
" Would not be the political Komponente."
It rises in its jeeps, makes a route by its 20 hectare large realm.
It studied and broke law off, late biology, then it interested in computers and finally stone dealers became.
And stone lovers.
It stores 40000 tons of stones.
From all of Germany it karrt its treasures together.
He says, he is a largest old stone dealer of the republic.
It brakes.
In the snow ornate behauene sandstones lie.
" They belonged once to Dresdens the Marienbrücke" , it tells.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warmly, it swarms.
" My Lieblingsstein."
It goes the way highly through the forest.
It points to a heap: red sandstone, early part Karlsruhe of the station.
And further.
" Beautiful Travertin."
Once the right parallelepipeds belonged to the grandstand of the Stuttgart Neckarstadions.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the cathedral sank Blasien, tuff of the Heilbronner hospital.
Which work, which troubles, which sweat.
If Rongen remembers, how the stones were gehauen in former times by hand and moved with simple pulley-blocks and ox trucks, it becomes completely ehrfürchtig.
" It would be nevertheless a scandal, if one würde." such a thing schreddern;
It is not become, loaded already not at all rich.
But the stone dealer employs 14 people today, in addition stone-cutters, have themselves a sculptor, forge above, a Glasbläser and a garden farmer established in the forest.
" We work hard, but it is befriedigend" , says the remainder-worth.
Shortly it must to Cologne.
There are stones also there to save.
