This had allegedly tried to manipulate a straight taking place public competition in such a way for the completion of requirements for restitution that properties offered in the competition were assigned to a concrete prospective customer.
This is to have paid Luboš G. for it one half million.

Luboš G. were obviously to information at the disposal, which had registered on the request and since he entitled person was, since it had bought a set of requirements for restitution, offered he interests of property that he withdraws himself from the competition.
Obviously against a fat compensation.
That would be also a sufficient explanation for why he had a large money with its arrest such with itself.
Luboš G. had already in the past all too good contacts to the Pilsner ground fund.
Thus it played a role, which criminally one pursued, because it gave change in spare restitutions properties also in the Causa of the former boss of the ground fund Václav Sankota, to which already location decisions to building projects pleases were.
At that time Luboš G. acquired of ground fund for example also properties, which were intended for the building of public roads, more exactly said, in the place, where the building of the Zufahrtsmagistrale polarized Borské to the trade area was planned.
Later it exchanged these very favorably with municipal authorities against a house directly in the historical center of the city, which exceeded the value of properties far.
The city hall had at that time with a heavy heart small adding, in order not to endanger the building project by the blocking of properties.
