To hell, warrior!
Does Splatter fit the art cinema?
The producer Nicolas Winding Refn plumbs with its fighter Epos " Walhalla Rising" old category borders again out.
Of which public the Danish producer Nicolas Winding Refn may have thought, when it " Walhalla Rising" turned?
A caught Wikinger warrior with only one eye (WAD Mikkelsen) frees itself from his torturers and surrounds with almost superhuman forces by the dozen its opponents - ideally bloody Action, straight because our hero sounds gladly rabiater killing methods served and its enemies already times the Gedärme from the alive body tears oneself for young male spectators in the search for, if he has bad mood.
On the other hand a eye says, as it is actually called, the whole film about no word, and also the other figures admit themselves at the most times to or two sentences or a few painful death cries to hinreißen.
Otherwise is silent and one geschwelgt in the gruselig beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, which the Wikingerwelt of before approximately thousand years the backdrop offers.
Ideally rather for adult Cineasten with interest in Existentialismus and very calm camera trips.
, If a film has several target groups, harm beautifully only, if they are mutually exclusive.
Producer Winding Refn is valid since its wild and gestylten Drogendealer trilogy " Pusher" as a kind Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, refuses however stoisch making accessible its works with somewhat more humor the mainstream or somewhat less brutality for the Arthouse.
Most art cinema friends might let themselves be deterred from the brain mass squirting around and the Gedärmen.
The act ion fans die at the latest before boredom if a eye for freely interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian mission acres breaks open via ship after Jerusalem and an eternity in calm air and fog feststeckt, before the crew arrives obvious at America and continues to be silent there.
No miracle thus that " Walhalla Rising" in Germany no cinema rental business found and now only on DVD appeared.
That is particularly because of the magnificent pictures a misery, in addition, because behind the prätentiösen to bluttriefenden front a sometimes exciting piece cinema hides itself, which earned something attention.
In this film it does not concern dialogues or a stringer duck action, it is all atmosphere, a film-nascent having a temperature area.
And from there is no escaping for the spectator.
Refn hardly grants one moment of the relaxation to it and ties it with its icy pictures and the dark Trance well-behaved soundtrack completely slowly the throat too, above all however with the incomprehensible hate, which against-strikes him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a small blond boy, a eye faithfully to the side stands, retains themselves as as innocence, all different by anger is floated.
Very most the einäugige hero, whose motives are never explained, who becomes sometime however for enemies and temporarily allied one the warrior from hell, possibly as the Ambassador of the devil.
It means a spoiling, perhaps in addition, only for anyway the spoiling.
" Walhalla Rising" a puzzling film, which one can hate and admire, is for annoying, exciting and being astonished.
An experience.
