Second mandate: the obviousness
De Gaulle had really gestutzt.
Center in the middle of had let believe that it stutze.
Valéry Giscard d' Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show smallest hesitating.
And Nicolas Sarkozy still less than these.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in the year 2012.
But the obviousness stands for the side of the Mysteriums, which adheres to the presidency function, not well to face.
Thus one must do in such a way, as if the doubt would exist from now on.
In the one, as also in the other sense.
2006 gave the supporters of Jacques Chirac, a third mandate is impossible, without believing even in it.
On 15 November insured Nicolas Sarkozy in serious clay/tone, its decision " sometime in the autumn of the yearly 2011" to meet.
That it on Tuesday evening in the Elysée before UMP parliamentarians the perspective of " two Mandaten" be reminiscent would let, little Fieberhaftigkeit had therefore spread.
Was that the official announcement of its candidacy?
Far been missing.
The president let remind only of the fact that the constitutional amendment limits the number of five-year office periods of 2008 to only two.
It did not make an statement, an announcement.
It is not the first time that it mentions the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous clay/tone.
" You at worst still seven one half year with me, or bestenfalls" , it explained to them in July 2009.
On a new in May 2010: " It does not believe that I over the phase thereafter does not nachdenke."
Its words from the day before yesterday do not make it for no more the candidate than the day before; in addition, not less.
If they should cause comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidacy with HP on a side.
The admission of the competition with Ségolène Royal, whom Nicolas Sarkozy drives to it, is however not to be revealed.
On the contrary, it is its obvious candidacy in the year 2012, which admonishes many members of HP more promptly than accepted to the challenge.
The bad inquiries on the other side.
The first time the voters became that rights a candidacy of François Fillon by Nicolas of the Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to inquiry of the BVA-L' Express) prefer.
" We have a candidate, and it gives with the UMP no discussions darüber" , directly and carefully the surrounding field of the prime minister reacted.
" If it would find a defeat as possible, it would not be Kandidat" , Jean-Pierre Raffarin communicates.
" It in it to always believe, triumph too können" , corrects Alain Juppé, which resigned itself to the obviousness.
