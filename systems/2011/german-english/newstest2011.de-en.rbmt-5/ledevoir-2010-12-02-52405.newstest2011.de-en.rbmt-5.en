World-wide plan for the renewal of the lighting
The UN yesterday suggested trade and industry in 100 countries in Cancun a plan for the renewal of the lighting of households, regarding the achievement of a decrease of the greenhouse gas (FCKW), to which almost to a third to the additional reduction corresponds, which must be realized, in order to stabilize the earth climate until 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the step of the concrete large-scale projects, which the UN in Cancun hopes to convert, in order to compensate the absence of compelling reduction obligations of the industrialized countries.
After the plan brought forward yesterday that would be avoided main problem in form of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of the FCKWs delivered due to the lighting on earth, if the white-hot pears, which represent so far still another monopoly from 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better still, by light emitting diodes (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world-wide emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the world-wide vehicle park.
In Copenhagen last year the large exhaust memo ducks like the United States, China, and others, under what also Canada counted, had committed themselves Europe to voluntary reduction plans, which should down-screw the global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
From this balance one would have to take however still 5 Gt off, in order to stabilize today up to the year 2020 the climatic rise around 2 degrees Celsius, in order to prevent that this gets out of control.
In the white-hot pears 95% of the energy escape in the form of warmth, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact phosphor pears the energy consumption reduces by 75%, with the new LED bulbs reduces one this power requirement again by the double.
The compact phosphor pears hold on average between 6000 to 10.000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, as for example those, which the manufacturer Philips brought this week on the market - this society by the way participated in the UN study - to have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and use 80% less energy than a white-hot pear, which obtain a suggestion of the saving possibilities of the replacing plan, which is to be used in 100 countries.
Apart from the fact that iese completely new bulbs deliver only very little warmth, it can function it also with an adjustable resistor.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists pointed out that compact phosphor pears exhibit reserves, since them mercury to contain and that one must dispose of it therefore as special refuse, which is not always possible in the developing countries except the producers makes available an assumption place.
The main source at mercury emissions on the planet does not represent the compact phosphor pear according to the report however, but rather the coal-fired power stations, which discharge substantially more mercury, in order to produce the electricity wasted by the white-hot pears.
However in the United States these coal-fired power stations discharge 25.000 tons mercury annually.
The report states details the profits, which would gain each country owing to this international program.
Indonesia would save so for example a billion dollar annually with the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that means an equivalent of 3,5 coal-fired power stations, whose building Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
