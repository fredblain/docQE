Threatening gestures of the European central bank (EZB) 
The investors reacted yesterday sharply to the threat of the EZB president Trichet, which warned, " the markets should not our reactivity unterschätzen."
The risk impacts of the euro Peripheriländer rose dramatically and the shares of the European banks around more than 5%.
Nevertheless we should the possibility that the EZB can be mistaken and the euro hardly did not add at points, which arranges to the concern to underestimate.
Events of yesterday are typical for illiquiden market, which in the measure, in which it breaks down itself again recovered, however due to the locking of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will still for a long time not lose his fear.
Today one month ago the European central bank requested us to cancel our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen according to which the EZB must tomorrow make some marks in the future, a backdown for the fourth time in two years, and probably still.
The Federal Bank demanded the termination of the plan to the purchase of national debt, since these were ineffective, as well as the abolition of all unusual limited liquidity measures. Only an one-week unlimited access is to be maintained.
After the Ireland crisis we expect that the present liquidity measures " at least to März" to be extended and the quarterly advertisements with unlimited access at the quarter end for the guarantee of the liquidity to at least June be maintained.
We expect likewise that the program for the purchase of obligations will spend continued and a strengthening signal.
If creative expectations are not fulfilled, the excellent reaction of the markets from yesterday again are thrown back and if halstarrig in one persists to take back which we our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Not to consider just as with the EZB meeting in May, with which the bank affirmed, the purchase of state debt papers and the markets thereupon broke down, could themselves this history tomorrow repeat.
The EZB must be reliable and persistent.
In May it showed the teeth and on Wednesday said it already much to have bought with which it provoked a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of one year's state titles was rather weak in Portugal.
The national administration of an estate spent only 500 million to 5.28%, opposite 750 million to 4.81% in the preceding auction.
Nevertheless the interest rates fell in Portugal around 30 base points in the entire curve and reflected thereby a perception change of the markets after the words Trichets.
In Ireland the numbers of the debt hole of Allied and bank OF Irish country were published.
The sum becomes on approximately 10,000 million at short notice and possible further 15,000 estimated. There is time until February, around private capital to constituted or these banks is nationalisation.
Although Ireland lost its reliability completely, after it had not recognized the problem with the stress tests in July, the numbers are acceptable in the context of the rescue plan and to help to reduce the uncertainty.
However the government must receive the parliamentary agreement on coming Tuesday to its new budget. Since it does not have yet the sufficient support, Ireland is also further source of the uncertainty.
Angela Merkel arranged her discourse more moderate regarding the summit of the heads of state and the government on 14 December. There political unit is in demand, in order to show that we play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries the ninth symphony Beethovens.
The Spanish head of the provincial government presented yesterday the measure plan, which was to be adopted on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions as with the financial establishments, dismantling of the state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and work-providing measures. Measures, which sound in the ears of the investors such as Vivaldis four seasons.
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains, why the Spanish stock exchange added by 4,5 per cent, twice as much like the remainder of the European stock exchanges.
In the comparison to February the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincingly, and we profit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a relevant auction of a three-year government loan, which will draw use from the Trichet effect. Therefore we set on a strong demand, which will eliminate all doubts about our conversion of debts ability.
For Spain requesting an auxiliary plan would be a self sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity, which we do not need. The Treasury has available 40 billion euros, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and the entrance to the markets were without notice closed.
Nevertheless our strategy should correspond to the slogan Cäsars woman: " Now counts not only its, but also the Schein."
Only we create courage, that!
