450 million in contracts without advertisement
Hydraulic Québec granted in mutual agreement project planning companies 450 million dollar at contracts for the water power project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the middle in this avalanche of more than 100 contracts a consortium, consisting of the companies BPR, stands Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most important portion, i.e. that to the direction of the project, to a sum of 295 million dollar without advertisement.
This consortium, mentioned " Énergie gérance" , 2004 as accompaniment of the decision of hydraulic Québec, the private sector its responsibility, this important, to surrender hydraulicelectrical project at height of a sum from 5 billion dollar to formed.
At the beginning of of 2005 ergatterte the consortium " Énergie gérance" the lucrative contract, without it would have given a public advertisement.
For the Parti Québécois represents a falling back to enterprise consortia a serious ethical problem, which causes the risk of the Wettbewerbsverdrändung as well as a price increase.
" This is a new way of a preconcerted play and weakens the Konkurrenz."
" That means that one durchführt" instead of preconcerted plays instead of in secret way now in open form; , yesterday Sylvain Simard, delegate of the PQ explained, on the press conference.
In the early morning Simard had raised the question before the national assembly, because it seems to him with difficulty understandably, how the interest can be served of the public in this way.
Resources minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon after, by placing vehemently in agreement that it would have concerned with the present Treaty a preconcerted play.
" I remain treu" for my line; , it ranted, by encouraging, which was PQ " unredlich" proceeded and it " be missing to it at Härte."
She said, it " is the Mindeste" that the PQ apologizes.
The model of the consortium is world-wide usual practice.
It concerns usually temporally such a limited alliance, which permits it to two or several enterprises to bundle their expert's assessments regarding a requirement on an advertisement for a complex project.
The project " Eastmain" a high complexity level exhibits concerning its work extent.
The building procedure is under way and should until 2012 be set up.
Nevertheless the contract was assigned, without a competition had been able to take place; it had already given negotiations.
Besides the model of the consortium in the Quebec does not represent an exception with relatively simple projects by any means more.
As the newspaper " Le Devoir" last week noted, is the model of the consortium article of government investigations, used within the range of the civil engineer and consulting nature.
Short flying over of the Quebecer of enterprise register makes it possible to designate more than 200 consortia from which some from steady duration to seem to be.
In this way for example the company Dessau in partnership with the majority of their nuclear competitors, among whom CIMA+, Génivar, SNC Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult rank, co-operates.
Any linkage, and of it gives it several dozen, attributes to the same legal entity, i.e. to Dessau.
Which the consortium " Énergie gérance" it concerns then minister Normandeau stressed that " the territory of the Baie James of special worker dynamics is subjected and that hydraulic Québec this fact zollt" for the 70's in special way calculation;.
Réal Laporte, the large employer of the Société d' énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), made a declaration, which let the nose turn up the fact that the contract was granted over the direction of the project according to agreement.
" If you an advertisement makes and it only few applicants gives, your prices are schnellen." up;
" You have thus two possibilities: either you take the people, on this Mart are and say yourself: one is aushandeln." a satisfying agreement at a good price;
" The thought is however that not the price is crucial, but the expert knowledge of the Personen" , Laporte affirmed.
This the consortium " Énergie gérance" granted contract is part of a long list dollar received from contracts over more than 50.000 of the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved either of the hydraulic Québec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After examination the newspaper counted " Le Devoir" more than 100 engineer and consultant contracts, who were granted companies or their branches, under it in particular to resources laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC Lavalin had gerafft 22 contracts, to Génivar 16 had actually received, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without here their participation had " on; Énergie gérance" to take into account.
All the present Treaties were negotiated.
They amount included in the entire to 449,783,344 $, in it the contract with " Énergie gérance" over 295,131,564 $.
Sylvain Simard to mention that the four companies, which form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) had " Parti libéral you Québec probably bekannt" are.
Minister Normandeau had let the PQ be reminiscent, is equally connected with the companies, which she " finanzierten" , before it specified that it concerns rather their high-level personnel.
