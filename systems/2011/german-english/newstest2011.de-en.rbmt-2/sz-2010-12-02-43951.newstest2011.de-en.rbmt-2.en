Mysterious earth works 
The atom energy authority IAEA has new references to a secret nuclear program in Syria. 
The country defends to take itself however, in addition position - yet lets it inspections to. 
Against midnight of that 5th on the 6th of September 2007 at least four Israeli F attack-15 I military aircraft a mysterious, cubic building in Syria. 
It stands at the bank of the Euphrates; the next larger city, 30 kilometer away, is Dair ace Saur. 
Your name emerges in documents of the international atom energy authority (IAEA) if it concerns the reactor, that Syria nominally with aid from North Korea in the rectangular solid constructed has, hidden in a valley, that walks of the current. 
According to a Briefing of the US foreign secret service CIA of the end of April 2008 the reactor familiar also under the name the near village el Kibar would have been well suitable, to produce plutonium - out of that construct let itself nuclear weapons. 
For other purposes on the other hand the technology is useful out of the fifties hardly. 
A video presentation led the CIAS before with fuzzy satellite pictures. 
Per computer animation, it faded in where which components of the reactor are supposed to have been before the destruction, that a reduced copy of the North Korean model would be out of the atom center Yongbyon. 
Moreover it produced photos, that show the building out of the vicinity, or quite the inner rooms. 
The reactor would be stood shortly before the starting, was named it, but not yet with fuel rods equips been. 
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, is became hardly more well known as at that time, yes the riddles gradually rather larger. 
The earlier US President George W. Bush revealed most young in its memoirs that the CIAS quite certainly was themselves before the attack to be sure, that Syria in el Kibar constructed a reactor, but saw hardly criteria that there was in the country "an active nuclear weapon program." 
Many secret-service agents in Europe are there rather yet more carefully and speak only about one "alleged reactor," also if they consider the CIA presentation to be "plausible." 
Hard proofs are missing you, just as as the IAEA. 
Asked how certain it would be, to have a reactor before itself, answered a high UN diplomat in the summer only succinctly, the IAEA would have "enough material in order to ask" questions. 
The Syrians created the debris of the alleged "unused military building" to be sure hurriedly aside and flattened the terrain thoroughly. 
Nevertheless an IAEA team found in June 2008 under the earlier chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el Kibar traces of uranium, that had been produced of people. 
Moreover the IAEA received be might over a member state of satellite pictures of supplier commercial out of the time directly after the attack, that statement strong as that of the CIA of presented. 
To be sure these receptions not to are got on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - exclusively bought it. 
The IAEA cannot verify therefore its authenticity independently. 
Syria always assured, operated never a secret atom program or to have constructed a reactor. 
The uranium comes of the Israeli weapons, explained Damascus. 
Yet that rejected the IAEA after analysis of the particle as unlikely. 
Since then Damascus refuses to discuss about that - just as over the satellite pictures. 
Moreover it forbids the inspectors a second inspection in el Kibar and the access to the ruins of the bombed building. 
But also Israel is quiet iron. 
"We become that never comment on," strengthened most young the premier officiating at present the attack Ehud Olmert the official position. 
So the investigation drags the if since June 2008 futilely there and, like a high western diplomat at the seat of the IAEA in Vienna have accrued to "develops increasingly to a serious credibility problem for the authority" - in the end stands a heavy offence against the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in the room, over that the IAEA is awake itself. 
As a key to progress in the clarification, the IAEA sees stand should evidently three further arrangements, that "in functional connection" with the presumed reactor - and unlike these yet exist. 
At the same time the inspectors neither disclosed until now, still have around which plants it acts itself, which function it or what lets appear it suspicious. 
After information of the southern German newspaper, they are designated in the IAEA internal as a Marj ace sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, diverted again by nearly lain cities. 
The independent institute for Science and internationally Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and foundly made a building complex on satellite pictures in Masyaf, suspect concerns in that it most likely one of that objects. 
It is possibly in or directly next to a military base - exactly with this establishment forbids Syria of the IAEA the access to the three places. 
In Vienna, it is named feared, that Syrians a fishing sending - that the IAEA of the USA before adept would become, around military plants auszusp√§hen. 
For the nuclear detectives had become through a tip of the US secret services on the arrangements attentive. 
The IAEA has references, under that satellite photos that between the three places and the rectangular solid at the Euphrates material was transported here there and. 
A high western diplomat in Vienna said, could stand at least one of the plants "in context with the fuel production." 
There is however "no references to sensitive activities," therefore uranium enrichment or again reconditioning; processes that are necessary to the building of nuclear weapons. 
The reactor type is operated to be sure with uranium, that is not enriched. 
Yet where the uranium should have come and detached become should where from that later the plutonium for the bomb, gives to these central questions it in any case plausible suppositions. 
Unclearly is also whether ruins that could rescue valuable traces, at which three places stored became. 
As the hundreds of lorry-loads of the ground would have disappeared, wants to have no one information about that where the debris remained. 
That only a salt mine lain few kilometer by el Kibar on the other side the Euphrates al Tibni, that examined Syria 1998 on its fitness as a warehouse for radioactive rubbish, the IAEA counts as unlikely. 
The earlier IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had connected it most young an analysis of satellite pictures for the renowned magazine Jane's it Intelligence Review with the reactor in. 
Receptions out of the orbit show suspect undertook however, that Syria at the three places earth works and removed large containers after the IAEA accesses had demanded. 
That can be chance, contributed however hardly in addition to clear the suspicion. 
Moreover it is named in diplomat circle, had used the IAEA some months on that to develop a plan for inspections there, that it should permit Syria to preserve contingent military secrets - alone the expense shows how large the interest of the inspectors is. 
Meanwhile, Damascus ironed also this suggestion off. 
If western diplomats in Vienna had soothed yet a year ago, would be destroyed the reactor yes, would have therefore the thing no high urgency, brings about US ambassador special inspections so-called Glyn Davies since a couple months into the game, one of the sharpest means that the Viennese has atom authority in order to put through inspections. 
IAEA boss Yukiya Amano that these inspections would have to propose has openly am" spoken to be sure already about "an option, for that I in the future, hesitates yet however he. 
A high risk in this way lies: To the one, it needs for that a majority in the governor advice of the IAEA, and some of the countries represented 35 there are anything but eager on an escalation. 
To the other like a diplomat to consider gives: "What is if they find" at the end nothing at all?
