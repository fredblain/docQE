Partido Popular won 4 seats in the congress in addition and PSC lost 9 
With the results of the 28th of November, the PP in the cities Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona could play a decisive role 
After the important agreeing increase and delegate increase in the last regional choices, the PP arranges its view already on the parliament choices - preferred or not. Your expectations are more than positive, for the number of votes, that this party obtains in these choices, that is normally doubly as high as in the choices in Katalonien. 
So the catalan People's Party received 610,473 voices in the parliament choices of 2008 while this figure amounted to only 316,222 in the regional choices in 2006. 
At the last Sunday, the PPC obtained 384,091 voices. 
If this climbing tendency - result of the detour of the percentage of votes the PSC and the tie of the constituency of the PP - should stop, the analysts of the PP predict that in the parliament choices the PPC of 8 could climb on 12 congresswomen, during also CiU four (it has now 10) win in addition and lose would become the PSC at least 9 delegates (of 25). 
These calculations cover the fundamental meaning Kataloniens for PP and PSOE. 
In accordance with the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a delegate - presently has it three -while ICV hold its delegate or could win in addition one. 
If the choice calendar should be retained however, the next appointment with the community choices falls into the May 2011: Also then the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue at the scales in order to prepare the socialistic predominance an end, and to be sure in four province capitals and with its majority in the city advice Barcelonas, one of the city administrations with the largest household: 661 million Euro for 2011. 
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree therein that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the socialists can obtain fall back neither a majority yet on its traditional allies (ERC and ICV). 
After the republican debacle, it is not misleading that this party will lose its representation in the local council Barcelonas, in which it would have to obtain 5% of the voices. 
The PP indicated on the other hand an increase of its percentage of votes in the four province capitals and could become the decisive power in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona. 
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the leading role in Tarragonas reversal. There they had reigned before the present mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP. 
E Lérida lies the PP only 500 voices behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations to Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign met it repeatedly. 
Also in other important places, like for example in Badalona, Castelldefels or regrets the People's Party was able to indicate an important increase. 
Presently the PP in 34 city administrations Kataloniens is represented and strives the development of lists in so many places such as possible on.
