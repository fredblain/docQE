Drohgebärden of the European central bank (EZB) 
The investors of reacted yesterday sharply on the threat of the EZB Präsidenten Trichet, that warned, "the markets should our reaction fortune do not underestimate." 
The risk impacts of the Euro Peripheriländer dramatically climbed and the shares of the European banks around more than 5%. 
Nevertheless we should not the possibility that the EZB can be mistaken and the Euro gained hardly at points, what causes to the worry, underestimate. 
The events of yesterday are collapses recovered typically for an illiquiden market, that in the mass, in that it again, to be sure as a result of the closing shorter and highly speculative positions. 
The institutional investor will not lose yet long its anxiety. 
Today a month ago the European central bank requested us to make our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen annulled according to what the EZB must make tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably yet some times in the future, a backing down. 
The German Federal Bank demanded the Beendung of the plan to the purchase of country guilt because these would be ineffectual, as well as the lifting of all extraordinary temporary liquidity measures. Only an one-week unlimited access should be retained it. 
After the Ireland crisis, we expect that the present liquidity measures are extended "at least until March" and the quarterly announcements with unlimited access are retained at the end-of-quarter to the guarantee of the liquidity until at least June. 
We expect also that the program is continued to the purchase of bond and a strengthening signal will issue. 
If the created expectations are not fulfilled, are thrown back the excellent reaction of the markets of yesterday again and if halstarrig is persisted on that to turn back that we our liquidity measures, can help us only God! 
Just as as in the EZB session in May, with which the bank strengthened to not to take the purchase of country guilt paper into consideration and the markets thereupon collapsed, could repeat itself this story tomorrow. 
The EZB must be trustworthy and persistent. 
In May it showed the teeth and on Wednesday it said to have bought already much wherewith it provoked a new breakdown of the market. 
Yesterday the auction of one-year country title in Portugal was rather weak. 
The national fortune administration issued only 500 million to 5.28%, vis-à-vis 750 million to 4.81% in the preceding auction. 
Nevertheless the interests rates in Portugal fell around 30 basis points in the entire curve and reflected therewith a perception variation of the markets after the words Trichets against. 
In Ireland, the numbers of the guilt hole were published of Allied and bank of Ireland. 
The sum becomes on approximately 10 000 million short-termed and possible further 15,000 appreciated. There is time until February in order to procure private capital or these banks be nationalized. 
Although Ireland lost its credibility totally, after it had not recognized the problem with the stress tests in July, the numbers in the frame of the rescue plan are acceptable and help to diminish the uncertainty. 
To be sure the government must receive the parliamentary approval to its new budget at the coming Tuesday. Because it does not control yet always the sufficient support, Ireland is also further a source of the uncertainty. 
Angela Merkel more moderately formed its discourse with regard to the summit of the heads of state and the government on the 14th of December. There political unit is asked in order to show that we play jointly that the same score. 
The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries the ninth symphony Beethovens. 
The Spanish district president introduced yesterday the measure plan, that is supposed to be dismissed on Friday by the cabinet council. 
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as in the financial institutions, dismantling of the country deficit, liberalization, denationalization and work procurement measures. Measures that sound in the ears of the investors such as Vivaldis four seasons. 
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange gained around 4.5 percent, twice as much like the remainder of the European stock exchanges. 
In comparison with the February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincing, and we profit from the surprise effect. 
Today there is an authoritative auction of a three-year government bond that will pull utility out of the Trichet effect. Therefore we set on a strong demand, that will remove all doubts about our debt funding capacity. 
For Spain, the application of an auxiliary plan would be an even sacrifice. 
We would receive liquidity, that we do not need. The treasury has 40 billions of Euro to the decree, three times so much like in March. The interests rates are extremely expensive and the access to the markets would become without notice closed. 
Nevertheless our strategy should correspond Cäsars woman to the motto: "Now not only that counts be, but rather also the certificate." 
We create only courage, that!
