The new unit finds no unanimity 
In spite of the announcement of the possible foundation of a new, standing unit to the battle against corruption and collusion on the part of Jean Charest, numerous observers demand further the development of a public board of enquiry to this subject. 
Robert Dutil, minister of the public security, maintains, this idea would not come of yesterday: Quebec would have consulted already last January the New York department of Investigation regarding this subject. 
The metropolis has controlled since 1870 a standing unit against the corruption. 
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday surprised more than only one. 
One must say in addition that this measure was not discussed on the occasion of the meeting of the permanent committee of the Quebecer police service on the 29th of October last year in spite of the presence Robert Dutils in the slightest. 
It did not be missing also that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, this announcement qualified done handicrafts solution" with regard to public security as rabbit" done magic "out of the hat as well as "at a table end right. 
Minister Dutil had turned for its part again to those, that fear, that the political power too much influence would have on the in question standing, future unit. 
"You become the result see, if we it announce become," was content to strengthen itself it. 
"One is himself this problem aware." 
In accordance with Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, can replace nothing the execution of a public survey. 
"The more M. Charest on that persists to want to prevent the development of this board of enquiry, the more become the people such as you and I think to conceal that he something has," explained he. 
"The single means, an investigation sow shot form to can, is the resignation of Jean Charest," declared for its part Yves Boisvert, instructor to be ethics and politics systems at the ENA (staatl. University to the education of high administration officials). 
In order to come out out of this dead end, it proposes engage can the Quebec to clear the finance test inspection a special mandate, therewith this investigations corresponding over corruption and secret arrangements. 
"One capably should be, the mandate of the test inspection to expand," decided it. 
It represents just as the opinion that the Quebec of the test inspection could clear the same power authority such as commissioners, what would permit its also on to obligate the people to the statements. 
The development of a standing unit is not the single project in the drawers of the government Charest. 
The Quebec will demand of Ottawa just as to alter the criminal law indicating, in order to be adjusted better to this type of crime. 
This demand comes of the senior state prosecutor of the operation Marteau, that the attorney general Jean Marc Fournier informed about that, that the jurisdiction in this type of the punishment pursuit is not unambiguous. 
Vic Toews, state minister for public security confirmed for its part, its colleague of the justice, Rob Nicholson, would sit down currently with determined, this dossier amendments relevant apart. 
During the operation Printemps 2001, that the groups of the motorcycle policemen concerned, 131 people had been arrested although the criminal law had not been amended. 
Ottawa put through as a result of its the law against Gangstertum.
