Dear in times of the war 
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer with the work began at its yet nameless administration debut, there is annoyance. 
The script wrote it itself, a love story between a woman out of Bosnia and a Serbian man. 
One does not know much more about that - however already that passes for unrest. 
Stubbornly the rumor, the woman, a Moslem holds itself, would fall in love during the Yugoslavia war in its Serbian rapist. 
Bosnian woman associations protested immediately whereupon some days of shooting planned in Sarajevo were transferred short-termed to Hungary. 
In the meantime the film in Hungary is turned off and in the postal service production, but it still is protested in Bosnia. 
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of feminine war victims wrote over the UN fugitive relief agency UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, reported a Bosnian newspaper now - Jolie is even ambassador of the UN fugitive relief agency. 
Diplomatically it is not - it offered weeks ago already once a meeting in Hungary, what that rejected however to the women. 
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic. 
There had not been would betray love stories in rape camps, and Jolies bearing vis-Ã -vis the victims its enough over the script. 
Your organization recommended according to the UN fugitive relief agency to released Jolie as an ambassador, reports the Guardian. 
What did exactly however Jolie write for scenes? 
The Bosnian culture ministry that got to read its script gave after some back and forth a trick permission for Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come then nevertheless. 
The boy author herself assures, she pursues no political intentions with its film, had gotten used to the work with much effort into the Yugoslavia conflict, wanted show the terrible consequences of the war and give all involved sides a voice. 
In the contents, it remains to be sure vague. 
So another second Synopsis to the film in the network that sounds then yet rather differently circulates: The loving knew themselves therein already before outbreak of war and meet again when it, a Bosnian Moslem is displaced, into a Serbian camp, in which it works as a watch. 
What yet considerably differently "rape victim verknallt sounds itself as the variant in torture servant." 
That Jolies film begins actually already before the war - so much is certain. 
Let the pressure on it, so Jolie, be "unfair and is based on misinformation." 
Now can provide its probably only the hackers of Hollywood peace: In that they place the script, how already so many before, illegally into the network.
