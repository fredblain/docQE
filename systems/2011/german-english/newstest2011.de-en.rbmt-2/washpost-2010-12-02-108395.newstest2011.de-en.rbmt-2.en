White Russia is therewith agreed, not further weapon capable uranium to collect 
In a surprising victory for president Obamas campaign to the worldwide security of nuclear material, the government of White Russia announced on Wednesday that one will gather no longer more long highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. 
The deal was announced in a joint Statement after a meeting of the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the white Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the security summit. 
The US government had tried for years to convince White Russia, to gather no longer highly enriched uranium and seemed reached last spring a hurdle to have. 
Yet official of the US government of told the washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreement with White Russia encountered became in order to remove from 187 pounds uranium weapon capable a white Russian research institute. 
The prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the remainder of the material - according to an official colleague, who remains based on the sensitivity of the subject anonymous, approximately 500 pounds. 
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obamas, that had excluded White Russia to "nuclear security summit of the 47 nations" of the April. 
And it was obvious good enough in order to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit 2012. 
"I really was enthused of the fact that they want" a seat in the nuclear security summit (of 2012). 
"That proves me, that it functions," said Ken Luongo, president of the partnership of global security, a group to the support of the nuclear security. 
Clinton named the agreement "a very important, important step" of White Russia. 
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years. 
Since then the US government helped six countries to become its highly enriched uranium loose. 
White Russia will be the seventh. 
A dozen of countries did it under the government of George W. Bush. 
Präsident Alexander Lukashenko explained the white Russian to security summit nuclear at present by Obamas that the nation never will abandon its uranium. 
"How retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, what basic weapon capable is, and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko at that time. 
"That is our raw material... We will make from that no dirty bombs and will sell we it no one." 
"We use is it exclusively for research purposes, that all." 
White Russia approached nevertheless a few months ago the USA on when it indicated interest in the meeting of an agreement. 
The first start to remove the uranium of White Russia in October, especially was complicated because the material easily had contaminated, say official. 
It became loading, the more into a special train than 1,300 miles a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say official. 
The second start was concluded on Monday and was carried out loudly the official per airplane. 
The US government pays for these striving $ 14 million whereby a large part of the money flows into the white Russian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons. 
"This was extremely carefully coordinates and voted, around confidence to construct" that led to the agreement, which became signs of Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the energy ministry who works at the global danger reduction. 
The James Martin center for Nichtweiterzugebende studies appreciates that White Russia had this year at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen of uranium as well as hundreds of pound at highly enriched uranium. 
White Russia wants to be dissolve according to the joint agreement warehouse until 2012. 
The relations between White Russia and the USA were for years tense, primarily because of Lukashenkos harsh disregards of the human rights. 
But the Statement of the Wednesday suggests a possible approach. 
"The progress of these global matters of security welcome being named, announce the United States of America and White Russia, that an increased respect before the democracy and the human rights in White Russia a central subject in the improvement of the bilateral relations remains and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," explains it.
