At least in the discussions. 
Call himself herewith especially the 23 billions for the Metro Grand Paris in memory, that by the Société you are supposed to be constructed Grand Paris. 
In order to lead the building start of the SGP into the ways, the country a Kapitaldotation of 4 billion exclaimed Euro. 
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would enable the SGP then to lend on the markets a part of the finance sum to its dual. 
Today it came in the end to first projections. 
The supplement household of 2010, this morning looked through of the finance commission of the national assembly to raise contains the planned measures, around the first part of these moneys. 
It concerns herewith two kinds measures: the creation of a special tax to the Erschließund and a higher taxation of the offices on that Ile de France. 
First, one takes articles 15 of the bill, goes "for the benefit of the publicly legal institute Société you Grand Paris." 
This is numbered: "The product of this tax amounts to itself on 117 million Euro per year." 
Zweitere is a reorganization of the already existing business taxation: In order around to modernize this, in order to increase that out of its product yielding and to entrust" this increase of the Société you Grand Paris. 
How much would bring in that? 
A riddle. 
This sum is not numbered in the text. 
Of the 4 billions, one far is removed. 
"It is carried out, that the fiscal resources to the 4 billion Euro of the Kapitaldotation added become, that through the country raised become and the Société you Grand Paris gradually for the project performed become," is to be taken the explaining statement. 
In the SGP, one finds this system not at all objectionable.
