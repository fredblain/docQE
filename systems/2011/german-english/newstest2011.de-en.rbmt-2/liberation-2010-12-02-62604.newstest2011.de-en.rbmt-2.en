Climate: like France its finance promises beautiful speaks 
It is a year after the resident of Copenhagen contract time to examine the compliance of the quickly solved financing promises (also "almost start" or premature financings named), realizes became that by the developing countries. 
And already the coarse French Schönredereien are uncovered. 
With the resident of Copenhagen contract, the developing countries promised in addition to allocate 30 billions of dollar between 2010 and 2012. 
The EU promised 7.2 billions of Euro over three years away, France 1.26 billions of Euro (i.e. 420 million per year). 
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16, the EU pulled all indices to convince around its partners of the fact of its engagement regarding the almost-starts-financings: detail loyal action report of its members states, press conference, large Nebenevents, pamphlet distribution. 
The operation transparency is remarkably and just for its actual value appreciated: the self-developing countries and the civil company would see developed made it gladly, if everyone countries that on the same precision level. 
The EU announces to have released in 2010,2.2 billions Euro, what brings it on the correct way to the Respektbezollung of its engagement of 7.2 billions per years 2012. 
If one looks however into the detail, the things lie a little complicated. 
This money should be according to the resident of Copenhagen contract "new and additional" in order to guarantee that an additional use was brought in, without to the disadvantage of the public economic aid to passed. 
Unfortunately there is no consent about that, what means "newly and in addition." 
While the EU commission had proposed a harmonization, have certain member countries, under that France that blocks procedure. 
Today every selects the guideline that it considers as best. 
The EU commission chose itself for example as a guideline for that of the year 2009: the international financings are retained, and "almost start" gives in the frame of the financing over for three years 150 million in addition. 
Other countries selected similar guidelines, either with respect to year or regarding conditions on plain of the public economic aid. 
In return in addition France of the opinion, the financings of "all new projects" of the year 2010 was would be "new and additional." 
Differently expressed: There are no guidelines in the editions of the preceded year or on more globally plain of the public economic aid. 
Concretely said can the entire sum the French support the developing countries stably remain (or also decrease) - France gives before to keep its obligation with respect to the "new and additional" financings. 
Another, decisive element is the breakdown in contributions and loan. 
About that yet no rule rules, and everyone selects its rake mode. 
Some, like for example France, find 1 lent€as equivalent with 1 contributed€. 
This is obvious only heavily justifiable: the effort is not comparable. 
If the use of loan can be justified for certain profitable investments (often at the emission checking bound projects, that on most effective technology be based), to present is it deceitfully, the Euro, that one as equivalent for a contributed Euro collects... Moreover only the costs of the loan should be credited for the investor country as an engagement (i.e. that equivalent an interest rate). 
But France has nothing differently in the sense as the following consideration: it "respects" its obligation of 420 million Euro in that it receives 91.5% loan (389.8 millions Euro) and 8.5% contributes) 36.1 million Euro) - see also the EU document in order to convince itself. 
France is the single country of the EU that loan uses in large mass. 
Germany demands 46% while Denmark that investigate Netherlands or the Slovakia (among other things) its obligations to 100% with contributions. 
Differently said if the predominant majority of the European Union 1 issues€to the fulfillment of its obligations, gives France just once 10 cents and understands under that a comparable use. 
Beautiful Hokuspokus! 
All in everything operates France in its almost-start-financing with a double vertigo: to a part with a Weiterentwicklkung of the action over the time away and to the other part with reality of the financial use. 
France succeeds issued has and saves it let believe, that it 420 million "more newly and in addition" millions in agreement with its promises at the same time 36.1 million Euro. 
Does the manipulation of the treasury (there it probably seem, that it Bercy was, that the arbitrage carried out has) could stretch a doubly negative effect after; once EU internally (why go the other member countries with the contributing away, if it yet sufficed to lend)? and then in the negotiations, there the self-developing countries not completely deceive let... 
The chapter of the premature financings only a small question on relatively short time in comparison with the entirety at discussions over the climate. 
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC. 
Let's hope that this will not be the case. 
How that also always would be, to learn it is inevitable, its lesson from this first year of premature financings. 
Primarily France could announce a change in its booking type for the years 2011 and 2012, and to be sure in the spirit of the respect for its obligations and the balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union. 
Above all however France could bring the discussions over the dispute object of the long-term financings forwards (another, decisive and momentarily discussed subject): one does not escape the question of the "Verrechenbarkeit" or the booking type of its loans. 
France could change its position in order to be just as progressive with respect to the issue how it is that in other things. 
The hope is based therefore upon the new environment minister Kosciusko Morizet, who will arrive next week in Cancun. 
A surprising announcement over the almost of start France and its vision of the "Verrechenbarkeit" as well as the utilization of loan would raise inherently the international confidence basis, that is necessary for continuing discussions.
