The NASA gives notice the finding of extraterrestial life on 
The North American space flight agency called would deliver before a press conference on, around tomorrow a finding, that will have effects on the search for living thing in that all. 
The national air authority and space flight authority (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiologische discovery, life extraterrestial the theory by the existence confirm could. 
The finding is introduced tomorrow around 13.00 clock on a press conference in the seat of the NASA in Washington of experts of the Astrobiologie. At the same time it concerns a science, that the origin, that development, that examines distribution and the future of life in the universe. 
In summoning of the press conference assured the NASA, it would introduce "an aufsichtserregenden finding for the search for extraterrestial life," what released speculations with experts of other countries. 
The discovery could cover the theory that it can exist in hostile environments, that one considered previously to be unbwohnbar, person-like creatures. It was raised the hypothesis that these could change itself into intelligent living things - so like people -, if its conditions of life improved themselves. 
Apparently it concerns a microbe, that was found on the reason of the Mono sheet in the Yosemite national park, California. It lives there in an environment, that was considered to be too poisonous for all imaginable life forms, because the lake is strong arsenhaltig. 
On any type, the Mikrobie uses the Arsen as a survival resource. Under consideration of this capacity, the chances increase that there could be on other planet, that do not control our protecting atmosphere, similar life. 
If these organisms the Arsen verstoffwechseln proved is, in accordance with the Astrobiologen, that "it actual another life form differs" confessed, a second life form gives, that of that us. 
The space flight agency will announce tomorrow, on Thursday, on the press conference the actual range of its finding. 
At the conference, the Geobiologin Pamela Conrad parts, that the possibility of life examines on the Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists take, that titanium (the largest moon of Saturn) under the question whether its chemical composition of that of the earth resembles, studies.
