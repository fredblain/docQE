Worldwide plan to the renewal of the illumination 
The UN proposed yesterday a plan in Cancun to the renewal of the illumination of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with regard to the realization of a reduction of the greenhouse gas (CFC), corresponds that to almost one-third of the additional reduction, that must be realized in order to stabilize the earth climate until 2020. 
This ambitious plan takes in hopes its position in the step of the concrete large projects to transfer that the UN in Cancun in order to compensate the absence of compelling reduction obligations of the industrialized countries. 
After the plan proposed yesterday, the main problem in form would be avoided the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of the CFC delivered based on the illumination on the earth if the incandescent pears, that represent previously another monopoly by 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced, by fluorescing or better yet, by light-emitting diodes (LED). 
The illumination is responsible for 8% of the worldwide emissions. 
This corresponds one equivalently of 70% of the exhaust fumes of the worldwide Fuhrparks. 
In Copenhagen, the large Abgasemittenten such as the United States, China, Europe and other had last year whereby also Canada counted, to voluntary reduction plans promised, that should screw down the global CFCS emissions of 53 Gt on 49 Gt. 
Of this balance, one would have to draw-off however yet 5 Gt in order to stabilize of today to the year 2020 the climate climb around 2 degrees centigrade, in order to prevent that this runs except inspection. 
In the incandescent pears, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of warmth, and the remaining 5% produce the light. 
With the compact lamp material pears, the energy consumption decreases reduces around 75%, with the new LED light bulbs one this energy demand once again around the dual. 
The compact lamp material pears hold on average between 6000 to 10,000 hours. 
The new LED light bulbs, like for example that, that the manufacturers Philips this week on the market brought has - this company has by the way at the UN study participated - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent pear, what mediates a hint of the save possibilities of the substitution plan, that is supposed to be used in 100 countries. 
Next to the fact that iese deliver totally novel light bulbs only very little warmth, can function it also with a rule resistance. 
And they contain no mercury at all. 
Several specialists showed that compact lamp material pears reserves show, because it must contain mercury and that one must dispose of it therefore as a special rubbish, what is not always possible in the developing countries, except the makers make available an acceptance place. 
The main source at mercury emissions on the planet does not represent the compact lamp material pear according to the report however, but rather rather the coal power plants that eject substantially more mercury in order to produce the electricity wasted by the incandescent pears. 
Alone in the United States, these coal power plants 25,000 eject tons of mercury annually. 
The report represents detailed the profits, that each country would gain thanks to this international program. 
Indonesia would save so for example a billion of dollar annually in the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that means an equivalently of 3.5 coal power plants, whose building would cost Indonesias 2.5 billions.
