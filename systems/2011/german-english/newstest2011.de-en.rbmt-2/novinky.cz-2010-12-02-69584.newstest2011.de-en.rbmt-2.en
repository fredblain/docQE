A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk to become ill with cancer 
Men whose index finger is longer, than the ring finger, are stopped obviously a slighter risk to become ill with prostate cancer. 
That is the surprising result of a study that was published on Wednesday by the British journal of Cancer. 
That should hold together namely with the mirror of the masculine hormone testosterone. 
"Our results show, that the relative length of the fingers as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer serve can and this nominally with men until sixty," explained the with author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the cancer research institute at the university in Warwick. 
The finger could help subject should, above all, themselves so to determine, which men unconditionally if genetic risks or other risk factors are available, like for example informal health loads to a prostate cancer test, joined woman Eeles thereto. 
In the period of 1994-2009, it pursued more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, simultaneously however also 3000 healthy men with its colleagues in Britain. 
With more than the half of the participants of the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger. 
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer counted how for 19 percent of that men, whose ring and index fingers were equally long. 
With men, whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk sank however around 33 percent, with men until sixty quite around 87 percent. 
The ratio of the length both mentioned finger, that form already in the prenatal age, reflects obviously the different mirrors of sex hormone which the child in the uterus was stopped. 
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger. 
Earlier researches yielded that just the testosterone of the growth accelerates of prostate cancer. 
VÃ¡clav of leading Czech genetics and former chairperson of the academy the sciences, said would be it this study fleetingly well known, nevertheless it would consider proved" the ratio between the finger length and the cancer risk not yet to be "totally.
