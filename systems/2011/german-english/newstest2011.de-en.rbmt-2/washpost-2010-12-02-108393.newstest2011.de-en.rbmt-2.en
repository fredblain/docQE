Khmer rouge veterans to the confrontation with the past forced 
In a weakly illuminated, betonierten classroom with dirty and peeling off walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds one of the man, who built it, at the later Khmer rouge leader Ta Mok. 
"Every here loves Ta Mok." 
"He was a good leader and he has herself around its people worried," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years. 
Because of its brutality during the Khmer rouge domination well known as "the butcher," remains the commander in this remote former Khmer rouge stronghold in the northwest Kambodschas popularly where he constructed hospitals and bridges, that infrastructure developed and yet always live where thousands of former soldiers. 
Yet this year, 12 years after the capitulation of the Khmer rouges vis-Ã -vis the government, long-time followers in Anlong Veng are demanded. 
In April a local truth forum and reconciliation forum permitted the victims the public confrontation with the people that supported once the regime. 
In June the government distributed a school book that for the first time children former soldiers tells the story of the Khmer rouges. 
And in July a partnership tribunal of the UN and Kambodschas convicted for the first time a former member of the Khmer rouges when it convicted the former boss of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better well known as a Duch, to 35 years prison. 
With every of these developments, the anxiety grew under the Khmer rouge veteran Alnlong Vengs, impeded its efforts toward reconciliation and Reintegration into the company Kambodschas. 
"It gives yet always rejection and anxiety in the former Khmer rouges, but it have no power, anything to do," said Chhang Youk, leader of the documentation center of Kambodschas, an independent organization that investigates the regime. 
"For it, life was glorious under the Khmer rouges, but the regime became" a symbol of the squall. 
"It splits even families." 
During the Khmer rouge domination in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, 1.7 million people were executed approximately or died it at illnesses, revision or before hunger. 
When the Vietnamese occurred and 1979 fell the poles Pot Ied government, the remnants of the regime implored and be military at the boundary Kambodschas to Thailand. 
Here they spread until December 1998 when the last movement capitulated, unrest. 
As a pole Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary the guerilla war of its basis in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia led, pulled Ta Mok the next generation in Anlong Veng up to. 
But middle of the '1990's when a peace agreement 1993 promoted by the UN led to the first democratic choices of the country to overflow began large groups of Khmer rouge fighters, to the government, what led to the capitulations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998. 
Pole Pot died was arrested 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok that had not given way, 1999 of government powers in the Dangrek Mountains. 
It died 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh where it waited for its process. 
When its patrons more long protected it no longer, most former Khmer rouges fighters fled retained the movement in nostalgic memory into the wearing down poverty of the rural Kambodschas and many. 
Also if some retained few elitist officials of the Khmer rouges its local government posts, because they laid down its weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers. 
"These people have only very few of the capitulation profits," said Sok Leang of the center for justice and reconciliation, that holds throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng, public forums 
"You are anchored into the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime." 
"You grew without each occupation white to." 
So Lim, 55 years, that 1974 had joined as a teenager of the Rhmer rouges, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he established himself 1998 in order to lead a life as a poor rice farmer. 
"Life under the Khmer rouges was good," said it. 
"Ta Mok gave" everyone something to eat. 
"But now life is heavy because we must" attend to us even. 
The running Khmer rouge tribunal roused also here worries. 
Beginning next year will try the court, Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife as well as Ieng Thirith, another earlier Khmer rouge minister to place before court. 
The order of the court is not is said it that to convict old leader and that, that are responsible main for the horror deeds,, but it whether it will pursue over these four cases out further deeds. 
That contributed few in addition to soften the anxieties in Anlong Veng. 
Current medium speculations have on in the Chaem, 64 years, concentrated was, were was that during the Khmer rouge domination in the late '1970's district boss in the province Manteay Meanchey. 
It had told 2007 delegate of the documentation center of Cambodia, it had led the building of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project with which cable would send of slave laborers probably died. 
At a hot evening returned in the Chaem of the work on the fields to its wood house at a dirty street outside of of Anlong Veng. 
Shadow long as the sun on the withered grass threw off leaned it in the Chaem to discuss its past in the Khmer rouges. 
If the court should summon it, she would refuse to go, said it. 
"Cambodia lives in peace and in stability," said it. 
There "were no more pursuits, war" would be here. 
Prime minister Hun Sen, that 1878 of the Khmer rouges is implored, warned moreover repeatedly before that that the situation would become unsteady, would accuse the court more suspect although experts and historian discuss this. 
"Cambodia must a hole dig and the past bury," said it. 
But the confrontation with the past is that what must do Cambodia in order to be able to go forwards, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center. 
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means gathering of the broken pieces," said it. 
"It is our duty to set these broken parts together so that how everything can" understand. 
The center created the first school book approved by the government over the Khmer rouges, the 75seitige "story of the democratic Cambodia." 
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as a supplement to the history book for the High School of the development ministry, that contains less than four sides over the Khmer rouges. 
How often in Cambodia the young people in Anlong Veng know only few over the Khmer rouges, in spite of the connections of the city to the regime. 
Touch Valeak, 19 years, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps the student to understand an important part of its story. 
But his parents reacted sceptically when it brought the book home in order to read it. 
"My family leans many parts of the beech and the court from," said it. 
"You are distrustful because they are not certain, like many people of the court convicted become." 
Such a resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicates, said Sok Leang. 
But the public forums, the school book and the court attain gradually influence," said it. 
Yet always a powerful attraction possesses the Khmer rouges here. 
Above in the Dangrek mountains leads an of bushes more overgrow and with plastic rubbish filthy way to a rectangle of black soot, covers with a rusty sheet metal roof. 
Pole Pots body had been burned here after its death 1998 on a tire pile. 
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a mobile phone salesman at the roadside, said would know, it not much over the man, who had been burned here. 
"But it has a strong spirit and many people here concern to it to pray," said it. 
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later at the day wanted it to pole Pots of last quiet site go where it will discard a shrub of ripe bananas - in the hope that it brings its good fortune.
