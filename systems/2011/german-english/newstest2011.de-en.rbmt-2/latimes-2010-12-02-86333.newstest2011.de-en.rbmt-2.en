Arsen resistant microbe could new life forms on the earth or elsewhere enable 
The discovery of a strange bacterium type that can live among other things of Arsen opens new possibilities for new life forms on the earth and elsewhere. 
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on the earth, it is in its opinion a sign, that a life also without that previously as absolutely essential considered elements possible is. 
"This organism has two possibilities." 
"It requires for growth either phosphorus or Arsen." 
"That makes it to somewhat entirely special, although it almost a type 'strange' life form is," explained Paul C. W. Davies of the Arizonas State University and co-author of the report who will appear on Thursday in the online edition of the periodical to Science. 
Previously six head elements became as absolutely essential observed - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur. 
Yet like the scientists found out, are awake the bacterium in the Californian Mono sheet also then yet further if it replaces phosphorus by Arsen. 
"There asks one itself yet, what otherwise is yet possible," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar of the Arizonas State University. 
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestial life because scientists must recognize life and its forms, so Anbar. 
The study concerns itself with microbe, that were found on the earth. 
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were announced to the discovery, gave occasion to far common speculations on the Internet that the report could act life of extraterrestial by the discoveries. 
This is not the case. 
The discovery "shows, that in other planet systems organisms by means of other elements biochemical processes in gear set can and that the 'standard elements', that according to our opinion absolutely absolutely essential are, not unconditionally firmly purported are," explained Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research institute of the open university of Milton Keynes in the united kingdom. 
Cockel was not part of the research team. 
"This work is a novelty, for it shows, that in basic biochemical processes and structures an element through another replaced will can," joined Cockell thereto. 
This discovery was not accidental. 
Felisa wolfs Simon of the Astrobiologischen institute of the NASA that led the study selected the Mono sheets based on the high Arsengehalts. 
Because Arsen and phosphorus chemically are similar themselves, it supposed that microbes that are stopped both can replace, possibly an element by the other. 
"The toxicity of the Arsens rests above all on that that it chemically similarly behaves like phosphorus." 
"Through it it falls the organisms heavily to distinguish" an element from the other. 
"But the difference is so large that Arsen functions differently as a phosphorus. It arrives smears into our biochemical system, where it more or less everything," explains Anbar. 
The researchers stopped the bacterium GFAJ-1 of an increasing Arsenkonzentration. It adapted itself and grew. 
The microbe are awake to be sure in phosphorus better, but that it can survive also in Arsen, shows that an Arsen been based life form naturally can occur, either on the earth or on one of other planet or moon, on which Arsen more frequently occurs. 
According to Jamie S. Foster, instructor for microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by Arsen, not newly. But previously there was yet no functioning example. 
Arsen occurred in the early earth years more frequently, says it, therefore assumed the science that early life forms used it. 
"That gives reason to the acceptance, that life itself also differently develops have can as in the early earth age," so forest that was not member in wolfs Simons research team. 
The research projects became of the NASA, that energy ministry and the national health authorities supports.
