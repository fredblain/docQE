The American troops used in Afghanistan for the first time a new "intelligent" weapon, that is previously only under its code name XM-25 well known. 
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon influences the conflict there with the Taliban and shifts the balance of forces to its favor. 
The new weapon is so something, like a super exact canon. 
Your projectiles are directed namely per laser with an accuracy of only some few meters into the goal. 
The special stories of calibers 25 mm, that were developed for this weapon and contain highly explosive explosive material, function practically like small garnets. 
The stories can be programmed so that they can explode not only in the impact on the goal, but rather at an any point of its ballistic flight path. 
That is, one it can use against an enemy, who hides behind a hindrance - a wall or in the marksman ditch. 
From above it not usually is protected namely, can set the homicidal Stahlsplitterregen from above it therefore easily except combat.

"Let's say once, one measured" 543 ms. 
"If one fires, the weapon loads itself and shoots down the story on the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
