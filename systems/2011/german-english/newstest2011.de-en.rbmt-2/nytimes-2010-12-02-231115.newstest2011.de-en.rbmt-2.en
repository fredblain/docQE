Tech Toys holds your gift budget in the balance 
This year's favorite under the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed of a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both player eggs can tear a considerable hole into your gift budget. 
An iPad costs so much like five BMX wheels for $99, during the price for a Kinect game of about 10 classic jump rope or ca. 48 doses Play Doh corresponds. 
But you can protect your gift budget. 
Recently visited I in search of three electronics toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's IT Wholesale club. 
Became immediately clear to me that bog law had stepped effective. This year the technology toys are more efficiently and cost simultaneously something less than in the last year. 
And although less new toys appear with own web page, Penguin, a wider offer is found on the best known of this type, Webkinz and club. 
More and more button cells operated toys come on the market, and many contain again chargeable rechargeable batteries. 
Here some recommendations. 
(If not differently indicated, are all prices of Toys "R" Us). 
Sing-a-ma-hunt are (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) plush figures, so largely like guinea pig, that sing a note, if one presses on its belly. 
Once press corresponds can play a note, through multiple pressing one a song. 
Several Sing-a-ma-hunt sing in harmony. 
Attention: If you began with the pressing once, you can stop no longer. 
For a combination out of Gesand and dance, the Dance star Mickey (Fisher Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice. 
On base that in the last year developed offers Elmo live technology the animatronische doll change game such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the novel hinge feet with wheel blockage controls it the Moon Walk. 
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. Your parents complained however about the missing volume control. 
If you are a child of the 80, remember certainly Alphie, one of the first computerized trained toys. 
Now it is again there (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with an entire pile question cards, with which a car trip can become a period, with a know-it-all with car correction function as a teacher. 
If you would not like to entrust your Smartphone gladly to your child, are here three independent alternative. 
MobiGo of VTech ($60 for children of 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. The games contained on that are equipped is however not as instructive as that on the Leapster explorer ($70, for children by 3 to 12), that of revision first large after Leapfrogs of the Leapster row with a new, brighter screen. 
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes. 
IXL of Fisher Price ($90 for children of 3 to 7) uses a system for the games and eBOOKS similarly iTunes, and thanks to the SD card drive, also family photos can be looked at on that. 
In the end there is yet Scrabble Flash ($30 of Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not more largely than a match box and control an own LED screen. 
In the game, it goes therefore to put together the blocks to words before the time expires. It is suitable magnificently for an improvised spell competition. 
More and more toys have a type Online connection. 
If one goes alone to the offer in the toy stores, Webkinz and club are Penguin the most important. 
In order to give your child an Online animal in the club Penguin, you can buy for example a Disney club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match figure package ($5 for children of 6 to 12), contain the one coin with a secret code. 
If you input the code Online, your child in the club Penguin Store sufficient Credits receives for two further parts. 
Roller-skate or a Puffle material animal can be that. 
The newest head cell operated Mikroroboter, Hexbug nano ($10 for children from 5) is not larger than the head of your toothbrush. 
The bug moves quickly on 12 vibrierenden silicone legs into each any direction. 
It is fun to send it through a labyrinth out of hulks. 
And it endures a few things. 
Ours fell of the kitchen table and overcame even some time in the mouth of our dog.
