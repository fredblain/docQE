CECA excludes a second fusion wave of the savings banks 
The general director of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility that it could come to a fusion wave of the savings banks and emphasized the speed with which the industry would be restructured. 
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks existed not to participate on that in the first phase. They reserved themselves the second round. 
On the other hand the general director of the Spanish savings bank association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round did not assure would take place. 
"I believe that the largest part of the fusions is locked. The inclusion of Cajasol into the group Banca Cívica cannot be regarded as a second round, it concerned rather adaptations." 
"The largest part is locked. It can be that we have in place of of siebzehen thirteen or fourteen, but all important processes already are completed. They were controlled of Banco de España that strongly supported all processes,." 
In one of the association of the managers and manager breakfast of organized Aragoniens (ADEA) Olavarrieta carried out that the concentration process "as quickly as possible performed became and that we be satisfied must with the timely flow, that in earlier times, not now, in the frame of the business plans with Banco de España determined became," emphasized he. 
"The transition of 45 savings banks with 000 million fortune existence average 28 on 17 with ever 75 500 million a historically incomparable process is. The amount of the financial institutions was reduced around 62 percent and are have it now very much larger, wherewith we that Baseler come off fulfilled," lifted it forth. 
Olavarrieta explained, "it would give a row unabgebrachter opinions over the slowness of the process, that Unseriösität and absurdity" revealed, for "Banco de España admonishes us to lock" within the specified time end of the year ago. 
The general director of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain would have and supplemented one of the rigorousest financing systems of Europe and "perhaps" the entire world, that that that would do the anzweifeltenn this "without deeper knowledge." 
The manager noted that we must worry in the present economy economic trend "no" about the situation of the financial institutions and the savings banks, that endured a "very important" concentration process, that would become "as quickly as possible" performed. 
It remembered also that the Spanish banks had existed the stress tests that the EZB carried out in July, very well.
