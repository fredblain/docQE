450 Million in contracts without announcement 
Hydro Québec allowed project planning firms in mutual agreement 450 million dollars at contracts for the water power project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert. 
Middle in this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium stands, consisting of the firms BPR, the sow, Groupe SM and Axor that received the most important share, namely that of the project direction, to a sum of 295 million dollars without announcement. 
This consortium, named "Énergie gérance," was formed 2004 as an accompaniment of the decision of Hydro Québec, that private sector to entrust its responsibility, this important, hydroelektrische project in height of a sum of 5 billion dollars. 
Beginning 2005 managed to grab the consortium "Énergie gérance" the lucrative contract, without that there would have been a public announcement. 
For the Parti Québécois, that represents fall back on business consortia a serious ethical problem, that conjures up the risk of the Wettbewerbsverdrändung as well as a price increase. 
"This is a new type and manner of a rigged game and weakens the competition." 
"That means, that one instead of rigged games instead of on secret type and manner now in open form carries out," explained yesterday Sylvain Simard, delegate of the PQ, on the press conference. 
At the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the national assembly, for it seems heavily intelligibly to it how the interest of the public can be served on this type and manner. 
Resource minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon on that in that she placed vehemently in agreement, that it would have concerned in this contract a rigged game. 
"I remain my line faithful," it cursed in that it strengthened, the PQ would be "dishonest" advanced and it "false its at hardness." 
It said, it "would be the least" that the PQ would apologize. 
The model of the consortium is worldwide current practice. 
It concerns usually a temporally so temporary alliance, that permits it two or several business, to bundle its expertise with respect to a commandment on an announcement for a complex project. 
The project "Eastmain" shows a high complexity level regarding its work size. 
The building procedure is in the gear and is supposed to be set up until 2012. 
Nevertheless the contract was forgiven, without that a competition had been able to take place; there had been already negotiations. 
Moreover the model of the consortium in the Quebec itself represents more in relatively simple projects in no way an exception. 
How the newspaper "Le Devoir" last week noted, that in the area of the Bauingenieur- and consultation being is model of used the consortium object of government ascertainments. 
A short flying over of the Quebecer of business index permits it to name more than 200 consortia, of which some of steady duration seem to be. 
On this type and manner, the firm collaborates for example the sow in partnership with the majority of its kernel competitors, to which CIMA count +, Génivar, SNC Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult,. 
Each connection, and therefrom there are several dozens, attributes to one and the same juristic person, namely on the sow. 
What concerns the consortium "Énergie gérance," emphasized minister Normandeau, constructed subjected is that "the territory of that James of a special labor force dynamics and that Hydro Québec accords" this fact since the '70's in special type and manner calculation. 
Réal Laporte, the large employer of the Société d' énergie de la James (SEBJ) constructed, delivered an explanation, has let that the nose over the fact hulls that the contract was allowed over the project direction after agreement. 
"If you make an announcement and there is only a few applicant, your prices become into the height of fast." 
"You have therefore two possibilities: either you take be the people, that on this Mart and say will negotiate": one a satisfying agreement to a good price to you. 
"The thought is however, that not the price decisively is, but rather the special intellect of the people," strengthened Laporte. 
This contract allowed the consortium "Énergie gérance" is part dollar preserved a long list by contracts over more than 50,000 by the Parti Québécois. 
The contracts became either approves of the Hydro Québec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert. 
After examination, the newspaper counted "Le Devoir" more than 100 engineer contracts and adviser contracts, that firms or its branch were allowed, under that especially resource laboratory, between 2002 and March 2010. 
SNC Lavalin had snatched up 22 contracts at itself, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and the sow 10 without including herewith its participation in "Énergie gérance." 
All these contracts were negotiated. 
They amount to included themselves in that entirely on 449,783,344 $, therein the contract with "Énergie gérance" over 295,131,564 $. 
Sylvain Simard had be reported let, form would be that the four firms, that the consortium (BPR, the sow, Groupe SM and Axor) the "Parti libéral you Québec well well known." 
Minister Normandeau had be discernable let, the PQ would be likewise connected with the firms, that it "financed" before she specified, that it would concern rather its managements.
