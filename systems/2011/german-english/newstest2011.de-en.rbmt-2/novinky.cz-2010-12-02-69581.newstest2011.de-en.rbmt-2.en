The accustomed costs of the households climb around several hundred monthly 
The households must reckon as of January not only with higher costs for all energy types, but rather also with higher water fees and sewage fees and for district heating and many a plotted, also the rents grow. 
Families will have to pull so as of January several hundred crowns monthly more out of the wallet than previously. 
Current becomes until around 4.6 percent more expensive, gas around 2 percent and more, in many cities becomes one to one-tenth more for water deliveries pay must and mark up many a plotted also the district heating deliveries. 
Alone the current increase in prices costs the dwelling households annually several hundred crowns more. 
The power current prices were reduced at the same time of all head suppliers, guilt is therefore the clear support of the current production on renewable authority, nominally out of Fotovoltaikanlagen. 
Gas become to be sure only moderate more expensive, this to be sure exactly then if the people must heat most and have the highest consumption. 
Also here is to be reckoned therefore with several hundred crowns more per year. 
While current and gas become throughout the Czech Republic more expensive, the prices are for district heating different from city to city. 
Price increases plan above all larger places. 
So for example the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové must pay as of January more for district heating monthly up to 50 crowns, pay more than 1000 crowns more per year families in Liberec. 
9 percent threaten the inhabitants of Prague again water fees and sewage fees higher and this for the case that the city increases the infrastructure rent. 
If the rent does not change, only 6.8 percent are it. 
The price in Prague belongs in comparison with entirely the Czech Republic however also further to the lowest. 
In the north bohemian where the prices belong already now to the highest, should climb water fees and sewage fees around 7.4 percent. 
Enormous rent price increases are to be expected for example in 140,000 rent dwellings, with which as of January that so-called. Rent regulation is omitted. 
So for example the dwelling business CPI Byty, that possesses 2500 dwellings in Ústí nad Labem, plans, that to raise rents as of January immediately by hundred percent. 
He, who is not agreed with this rent increase, that judicially wants to sue the business. 
The regulated rents, that one pays today yet in approximately 300,000 dwellings, would be allowed to increase next year around more than 10 percent.
