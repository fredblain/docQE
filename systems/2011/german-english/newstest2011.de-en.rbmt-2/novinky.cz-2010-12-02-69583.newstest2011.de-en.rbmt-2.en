Two training airplanes L-159 for the first time in strange hand - in Spain 
Two easy military aircraft L-159 of altogether five, that the Czech defense ministry against the carrier airplane Casa C-295M exchanged, flew on Tuesday into the Spanish city Sevilla where the Spanish airplane manufacturer settles Casa - EADS. 
It is the first time that machines of this type are in possession of a strange army. 
Abroad they were to be seen previously solely in maneuver or Flugshows. 
It concerns herewith the flight capable Zweisitzerversion L-159T1, that was operated by the Czech army. 
The remaining three airplanes are einsitzige L-159. 
These vouch presently yet preserves in the Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the firm Omnipol - received it past week. 
When it dispatches the airplanes physically out of Vodochody, is Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the defense ministry according to not yet well known. 
The einsitzigen military aircraft L-159 again were separated out of long-termed warehoused airplanes and this without further enclosures and investments on the part of the department of the ministry. 
"The doppelsitzigen L-159T1 became in present condition and appearance exchanged," said Pejšek of the newspaper Právo. 
It added, the army would not have to come out without two-seater military aircraft because the defense ministry signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody a 200-Millionen-Vertrag 200-Millionen-Vertrag million 200-Millionen-Vertrag contract over the reconstruction of four superfluous L-159 to the two-seater version. 
A new airplane received the army in July, the second wants to receive it until end of this year. 
According to Pejšek EADS promised to put through the military aircraft into the equipment one NATO of countries. 
"In the contract is cited plainly and clearly that the business is EADS buyer of the airplanes L-159 and that this to the education of pilots NATO of countries should serve. 
"It is therefore thing of the buyer, on which manner he the thing realizes," led Pejšek on. 
The financial newspaper (HN) had reported formerly that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159. 
The barter of five L-159 against a carrier airplane Casa and the purchase of further airplanes for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved in the past year yet by the government of Mirek Topolánek. 
The defense ministry had written out at that time no announcement procedure to the purchase, but rather EADS spoke directly on. 
The at that time defense velvet argued, this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad. 
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it uses only 24, it wanted to sell the remainder. 
The purchase of the airplanes Casa would be allowed to have by the way also another judicial aftermath. 
The European commission accused the Czech defense ministry namely at the European court. The reason? It should have selected the airplanes based on an entire European announcement and by no means through response a single manufacturer. 
The army received already three airplanes Casa, that land should last on the airport Kbely within fourteen days.
