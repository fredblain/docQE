Talent battle around High potential 
Lively press rules at the Buffet. 
16 students press themselves around salmon roll, tomato soup and sweet. 
The mechanical engineering students and design students to a workshop invited the technical University of Braunschweig and the car farmer Volkswagen. 
In a kind of idea competition, they should together fachsimpeln with VW developer over the car of the future - and very incidentally become acquainted with Volkswagen. 
In the contest around the smartest heads, many businesses go meanwhile into the near battle and set, like VW, on cooperations with the universities. 
Your mission: To recruit the most gifted graduates if possible early in the auditoriums before they come on the labor market and are courted of others. 
And because the universities publish no assemblies over the achievements of its students, to spot tried one the exception talents in practice projects and to tie to itself. 
At the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweigs, the car group seeks the talents. 
A young lady out of the personnel department distributes ball-point pen, Gummi Bear and portfolios with VW Logo. 
It tells the hopeful boy talents of practical course programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the group up. 
Nico Selle of the TU Braunschweigs looks after the project with VW. 
It sees the advantages for both sides: "The students get in touch to the industry and gather experiences." 
"VW can become acquainted with simultaneously students, more closely can look at interesting candidates and consider, who would come" as a colleague into question. 
Such cooperations, so Selle, are not unusual. 
Would be new that so offensive around the students gebuhlt would become. 
"Otherwise lay the focal point sooner on the professional project," says Selle. 
The fight for that graduated fresh will become probably even harder. 
In many industries, the businesses can choose themselves its colleagues no longer out of a large multitude of applicants. 
They separate must extol itself and court especially around highly qualified labor forces. 
Above all graduates out of the engineer disciplines are at the same time in an excellent bargaining position.

And the so-called engineer space will become according to VDI prognoses even larger.

It advises its customer to more authenticity. 
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
