Secret of the complex shaken Canada ventilated 
The new, American diplomat directions that were spread by WikiLeaks ventilate the secret over that, what the United Nations consider under the inferiority complex of the Canadians vis-à-vis the Americans; they put however the superiority feeling with the same blow last-nameder vis-à-vis Canada openly. 
Consequently the American diplomats are astonished about the fact that the Canadian voter has not in the ballot the Canadian American relations in the sense, and believe it, that the visit of president Obama would have the conservative government at the same time helped to put through its budget of 2009! 
The four new communications between the American message in Ottawa and Washington that publicly were spread yesterday offer yet more spicy details as the bare substantial contents, at which one has to nibble. 
A connection dating by the 22nd of September 2008, i.e. in the period, in which the federal Wahlkampage in the full gear was present, reports about that, from which point the United Nations are involved no longer in the uses discussed by its political bosses. 
For large astonishment of David Wilkins, the ambassador used, American in Ottawa. 
Mr. Wilkins offers different explanation possibilities of this situation. 
"An inferiority complex almost characterizing the Canadians contingently causes possibly the Canadian, political managements much sooner in addition, over internal issue of the everyday life to speak, when the United States in this choice the black Peter to impute (like 1988 in the campaign over the free trade) ," describes he. 
The United Nations, concludes it, are therefore "the proverbial Goliath of this choice: omnipräsent, but potentially too threateningly in order to speak" about it. 
The ambassador understands this "deafening quiet" the fewer because both countries intensive political and economic relations cultivate. 
"Logical manner," values it, "should it the capacity of a candidate, a party and yet much more of a party chief for leading a such essential relation be, that of the voters in the going to the polls than a key factor in the sense has." 
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads in that at the 22nd of January 2009 of Terry Breese, business carrier in Ottawa, sent communication that should prepare Präsident Barack Obama for its first visit in Ottawa. 
"Your trip at the same time will help, the further existence of the government in the confidence vote over the federal budget beginning of February to guarantee, with which Canada its first deficit after more than a decade well known give becomes, that based on an animation program in the height of 30 to 40 billion dollars emerged is," describes Breese. 
Nowhere it had mentioned that the government had had to adjourn the parliament session before Christmas in order to prevent that the parliament would be fallen by the coalition and would affect the so contingent further existence of the opposition parties the quality of the proposed animation program. 
A further, from January 2008 dating and on the part of the ambassador Wilkins communication composed notifies Washington of the always more negatively becoming picture that the series radiated, dramatic over CBC spread by the United States. 
The ambassador is disturbed over shipments such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one little subtle allusion at Maher Arar, that can observe "No-Fly-List" or also Abführungen to the purpose of through muscle swanks of the CIA of carried out interrogation. 
Again another communication reports in detail about how Hillary Clinten in its French office colleagues Bernard Kouchner had asked in its first bilateral meeting after that, whether Europe would be ready to receive certain prisoners out of Guantanamo. 
Mr. Kouchner should the question with yes answered have, to be sure on the basis of an individual "case to case" -decision. 
Àm end of the meeting, described, "has it the country secretary a paper as regards Omar Khadr issued, a 15-year-old Moslem of Canadian origin." 
"The Secretary of State accepted to look through" the document again. 
Let's notice in in the end yet that the minds get hot with respect to the web page WikiLeaks. 
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper of very closely standing advisers, had explained over CBC that that should "killed" become for this massive leak of responsible. 
It had reported here on Mike Huckabee out of the United States.
