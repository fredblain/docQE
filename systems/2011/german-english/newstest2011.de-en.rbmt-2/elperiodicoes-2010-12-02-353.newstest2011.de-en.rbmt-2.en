Zapatero and the red line of Germany 
Berlin decided on the Beibehalt of the Euros, but set up simultaneously conditions for the entire European Union. 
The tensions on the markets released a double answer of the government. 
On the one hand José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero produced new adaptations measures, begun in tax reductions for small business and small business, the regulation of temporary work business or the lifting of the 426 Euro support for the unemployed, that relate no unemployment compensation, up to the denationalization of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of the airports Barajas and el Prat as well as 30 percent of the national lottery. 
On the other hand the deputy head of the government, Elena Salgado, supported swears to out would have the criticism of the chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible, that by means of the former district president Felipe González the present crisis. 
How are these processes to be understood? 
It would be anticipated, is the Merkels position no mistake of its public work. 
To the contrary, it concerns a new round in the difficult process of the new definition of the Euro. 
At the same time Germany takes in a basically new perspective to the formation of our future, that collides with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of a large part its partners. 
In view of the resistances in Europe, one begins in Germany over three possible exits out of the crisis to spekuliern. 
The first: A strong Euro with Germany, Austria, that Netherlands and other countries while the south the Euro areas leave must. 
The second: The reintroduction of the Germans mark - although that currently sooner after Science Fiction sounds -, supported of a large part of the public opinion, ca. 50 percent of the population. 
The third: A change of the Euros in accordance with German suggestions. That means: more macroeconomic inspection; household leadership would exert; punishment of the countries that infringe the specification; more possible wise the payment attitude of some countries as well as the expansion of the costs of potential adaptations measures on the private sector. 
The German position is unambiguous and has been outlined already for some time. Therefore there are now no excuses. 
First 2009 when both the IMF such as the European commission of stimuli created for deficits and the German government stretched a constitution reform out of the sleeve in order to prevent this from 2016. 
That was the first indication of the Auseinanderdriften between that, what held Germany essential (severe tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. 
The second sign set the Central European country when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to the rescue of Greece. 
At that time that strongly was criticized. But fact is that the political consent in Germany that were public and the published opinion absolute against a rescue of Greece. 
In the end Merkel comes out into the last October day on the new with an unambiguous position. It demands a reform of the come off of the European Union in order to enable the rescue of a country and to obligate simultaneously the private loan givers, to carry a part of the costs. 
This position was displayed as an antieuropäisch because it pushed the Ireland crisis and all following. 
But its suggestion if also somewhat sweetens, was supposed. In the next months, we will participate at the reform of the European Union, that should enable these measures from 2013. 
Germany pulled a red line, that thought to not to exceed it. 
It says all that - also if now unpopular measures encountered will must - there will be the old functional method of the Euros from this appointment no longer. 
The year of birth of a new currency room will be 2013, forced will can receive must, in which the counteracting countries hard are punished, in addition to explain itself insolvent and in this case the private sector a part of the costs. 
Germany shows hit must, with high Spar- and investment rates, moderation of the consumption, us, that we a hard growth rate improvement of the productivity and competitiveness as well as positive outside economic balances. 
The other alternative, that is based upon indebtedness and building being with gigantic holes in the balance of payments, so how it was cited by Spain in Boomzeiten, simply will not be accepted. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would not do badly on that to understand it. 
It goes not only therefore to drive down the country deficit to the year 2013 to three percent. 
The demands are much harder. 
And the worst, what we could do under these conditions, is to be deceived us even. 
I hope that the present turbulences pass over in more quiet. 
And that we will use the possibilities that are offered to us, to the spring 2013. 
It seems that Zapatero understood that also so, and its double announcement (the promised reforms after the discussion with the large firms at the past Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) shows on that there that in spite of the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis to create, order in the own house, its way prepared has itself. 
But the line pulled red by Germany is there, and it does not look so that on that something would change. 
Under the possibilities pulled in consideration, that is that we would have to leave the Euro areas fully plugged with little serious countries not to exclude. 
In this case, Germany still could say us, it had warned us.
