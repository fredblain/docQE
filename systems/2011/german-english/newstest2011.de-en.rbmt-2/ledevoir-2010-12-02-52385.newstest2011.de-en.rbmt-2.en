Barometer verantworungsbewußten consumption - the "green" label is not confidence awaking 
Greener, but frank sceptically. 
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence to the head participants of the persistent growth, however just as few to the marked brands or the organically markings, that should drive its choice. 
Damage although it bathes in a medium effective universe, where it swarms with information for the benefit of a more responsible consumption only so: the barometer consumption responsible has a lack of trustworthy information to lament, an insufficiency, that makes itself than a brake of its engagement recognizable, how the first reading showed, that was held off yesterday. 
Although they pushed the consumption of the so named socially compatible products in 2010, the Quebecer seem nevertheless that that try to sell this to accord little credit. 
Two-thirds of the Quebecer population gives to give in the deed the environment engagement of the firms just as little belief like the green business advertising, betrays the gauge contrived by the responsible consumer center the university Sherbrooke. 
Another condition: the half of the consumer doubts the confidence worthiness of the official certificate joined at the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves as environmentally aware, so the barometer. 
After same pattern, the discourse of the politicians seriously is taken to this subject of solely 14.6% of the Quebecer population. 
The information with respect to responsible consumption seems nevertheless importantly to the Stimulation of this consumption segment, that is animated currently by approximately only of one-third the Quebecer consumer. 
In the deed, void and doubtful character of the information softened the zeal of 46% of the consumer. 
This is after the higher price of the products the second brake identified on the part of the barometer. 
Moreover one-third of the Quebecer of the indicated efficiency stands the green products and services, that one is to be put striven them at the hand, distrustfully vis-à-vis. 
According to another communication had changed its habits already over the half of the consumer in 2010 and changed predominantly the brand one or several products in order to give its conviction expression. 
According to barometer, they had preferred also to 61% purchase with dealers of its quarter and had favored the purchase of groceries cultivated in its region. 
Greener and more responsibly - the index of the environmentally aware consumption had this year a 64 the maximal value of 100 reaches - the homo consumus of the Quebec loves it to present himself as a king of the recycling, who tries to reduce its traces left behind in the environment in that he attends to the animal protection. 
Yet the social and ecological consciousness seems indicated to make nevertheless before its car simply, so the barometer: just once 28% of the Quebecer, used into 2010 public transportation or to have preferred the agency for shared rides, in order to demonstrate its ecological interest. 
The Zufußgehen as well as the bicycling were advocated also of 39.1% of the participant of this comprehensive behavior survey, that feeds the cliché presentations.
