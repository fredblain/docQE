Ogoniland is burned down 
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the gas station: Crude oil discontinued billions liter destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland. 
The people live of theft, corruption and illegal Ölkochen. 
Celestine Akpobari means it good. 
"Plagues you not from," calms the organic activist the journalists: "You will get" today yet enough oil mud before the lens. 
The 37-year-old Nigerian pursued the attempt to photograph one until boy wading to the breast in the water with the Schlieren surrounding it: In the regenbogenfarbenen water brightness, the scene causes almost lovely. 
That under the surface brown Rohölschwaden float, is not to be seen. 
Earlier it had gathered here by the bucket shrimps, tells Esther Badom at the bank of the Bodo-Jetty-river. 
In the meantime let the sluggishly fluent waters be perfectly dead. 
Five years ago enormous quantities crude oil poured out of a burst piping into the gigantic wetland. 
Fishermen out of the nearly lain village Bodo must row now six hours in order to arrive into fish containing waters: The Ogoniland lain in the heart the Niger delta counts polluted as one of that most badly regions of the world. 
On the trip through the mangrove swamps gotten through by river courses, the entire size of the devastation becomes obvious. 
Broth brown instead of bright water wühlt the motorboat up, who immerses its hand into the water, extracts oily fingers. 
The roots of the mangrove trees jut like black licorice poles out of the ground, sadly let hang isolated palms trees to be found its fronds. 
Bird swarm how they are usual otherwise in wetlands, seeks forgive one: As soon as the Außenborder is quiet, ghostly quiet spreads out in the paradise smelling earlier like a gas station. 
"What here happens, is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari darkly: "We live in permanent danger for the health." 
The war comparisons is mounted. 
The settlement zone of the Ogoni is a battlefield fought over since decades: Here the first Explorateure screwed in had to adjust themselves before more from Europe, here than 60 years organized in the 80er-Jahren with the later executed author Ken Saro Wiwa the first resistance, here the Shell groups 1993 its production because it became for its oil worker too dangerous. 
Yet today the return is forbidden the business after Ogoniland: While out of the entire delta region by the triple size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling sources and 7000 kilometer pipings are pumped daily more than two million casks of the black gold, the oil fields in the Ogoniland lie broke, is too unstabile the group the situation. 
All couples of hundred meter jut steel stands such as bizarre sculptures out of the water: "Christmas tree" are named the heads of the drilling holes much too tender. 
They are corroded up to 50 years old, that to the quick. 
Again and again would break such a drilling head apart, means Akpobari, then groove a constant current crude oil into the water. 
More than two billion liters flowed after expert estimations in 50 years into the ecosystem of the delta: Year for year the quantity of oil, like it in the loss by sea of the super tanker "Exxon Valdez" into the sea before Alaska 21 years ago penetrated - one of the largest environment catastrophes in the story of humanity. 
Who is to be made responsible for the continuous organically GAU, about that is fought. 
While the Shell group responsibly makes sabotage and the organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the soiling, conservationists see bursting drilling heads and would lick pipelines as a head cause. 
Shell puts lower security standards in Nigeria substantially at than otherwise in the world usually, threw the US scientist Richard Steiner the group 2008 before: Alone let the rate of defects at the directions be "around a multiple higher than elsewhere." 
At a place, that looks from a distance like a left, oil smeared workshop under free sky, shapes emerge out of the mangroves: They are stark naked and to the neck oil smeared. 
Under one of the many casks, that connected partly with tubes to settle partly arbitrarily scattered on the terrain are, flickers a fire: an illegal small refinery. 
In the cask, the crude oil is heated over the fire several hours long, explained Michael, the boss of the group. 
First gasoline penetrates drips through the pipes into the catch pot, later at the end of the direction kerosene and in the end diesel out. 
So Michael and four colleagues produce daily 300 liters up to four casks diesel à: "That brings us 34,000 Naira a" - approximately 22 dollar. 
The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel scarcity in the largest petroleum country of black Africa. 
Nigeria controls only a single refinery. 
The illegal cooks yet can underbid the diesel price laughably low with nearly 40 Euro cents per liter: They get for its raw material for nothing. 
It comes of "Bunkerern," that tap the pipeline network diagonally through Ogoniland: In this manner at least 16 million liters get lost the country according to experts in the entire Niger delta daily crude oil. 
Only a disappearing small part of the provisionally between stored raw material illegally will refine to be sure: Organized criminal networks, to which also politician and high-ranking military should belong, fill the lion's share, in tanker and sell it on the world market. 
The debate, whether the environment catastrophe sooner that worried owed is the population or the lax production manner, considers the activist Akpobari to be purely academically. 
"Became not the oil companies as an intruder perceived and not so thoroughly would have destroyed it the basis of life of the fishermen, would give it neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries." 
In the meantime the ratio of the Ogoni would be destroyed above all to Shell however to such an extent that only a deduction of the group eligible: "Perhaps turn out yes other nationality such as the Chinese as better." 
There Michael becomes nervous. 
"Highest time, that you disappear," says the muscular oil man. 
"Each minute the soldiers can come." 
The illegal Ölveredler are caught threatens of the special unit of the military forces, them to be sure no arrest, probably however a painful bribe. 
Also the soldiers coming especially out of the country north want to profit - like all Nigerians - by the raw material. 
"This damned thing has our country in every regard on the dog brought," says Akpobari.
