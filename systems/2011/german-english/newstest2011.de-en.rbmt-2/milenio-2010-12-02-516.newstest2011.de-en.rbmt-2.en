Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final game, he experienced on that and Abs in its career, but three times he had decisive games, and previously he held himself well why this opportunity of entirely special importance is for it. 
The Argentinian has high played himself with the medal to the second champion, he remained a step behind the victors and amazingly he expedited with the same team successive final games. 
The santistische strategist reached the first final game as a trainer in that 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when del Morelia had the bridles in the hand, with which he learned a large defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, in that' Clausura 2003' reached he the decisive duel that he lost also with 3-1 against Rayados. 
Already with Santos Laguna on that 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', with which they played against lot Diablos, had to put away Rubén again a setback because the game with 2-2 against lot Choriceros went out after 210 game minutes undecided, but in the eleven meter, it came with 3-1 forwards and got missed turned two possibilities to put its title away, but last of all three of its players the eleven steps and the game to a 4-3. 
Rubén had already two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, its large rival, lost. Therefore it would not like to be pursued once again by the misfortune and free itself by the evil magic in order to be able to celebrate for the first time a title although it strengthens, that for it the most important is the game itself. 
"I would like champion become, I would like no statistics break, that is for a club, for my affection, that I me would give away, and therefore becomes the title me come, but what previously happens, is the most important," commented on the helmsman when one questions it over the lost final games. 
The last final game remained it yet strong in the memory to have learned it assured, much from that: "The single apprenticeship that we can pull from that, is that until the arbitrator the end does not whistle, cannot celebrate we, are prepared we at the line, were prepared the players also, for the last time we with two eleven meters already on that, to eliminate believe, and I that the one apprenticeship is, until the game is not concluded, gives it no occasion for celebrating." 
To know that this series could be decided by eleven meter ski meal, disturbs it not, for it trusts its players: "One wants never in the eleven meter ski meal depend, one would like in the regular game time lock, but sometimes gives it no alternative and one must prepare be, were prepares in the prior tour we, but unfortunately prepared us the fate a bad game, sometimes as a result of of nervousness or the violent endeavoring, that title to hold already in the hands, that left behind us something for this final game, and we hope that it this time not In addition come becomes." 
It lies in Romanso power to be no longer only second champion and to cost for the first time the renown, that the titles with itself bring.
