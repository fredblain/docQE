Vindictive hackers and busy spies 
The affaire WikiLeaks has a dual meaning. 
On a side, she turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal, that is solely a scandal in the Sinner sanctimony, that the relation between the countries that reigns citizens and the press. 
On the other side, notice gives gives it far-reaching changes on international level on, and a foretaste on the future dominated by regression. 
But let's advance according to the row. 
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each document generated by a secret service (a x any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper cut. 
The "extraordinary," American uncovering over the sexual habits Berlusconis throw nothing further from as that, what one got to read for months anyway in every x any journal, (except which, whose owner Berlusconi is), and that frightening karikaturierte profile Gaddafis offered already for some time time material for its sketches to cabaret artists. 
The rule, after which the secret dossiers may consist only of already well known novelties, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and that not not until this century. 
If you go into a library, that dedicates itself esotherischen publication, you will recognize that each work (over the Gral, the Mysterium of race-le-Chateau, that Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) repeats exactly that, what was written already in prior works. 
That does not come alone therefore that the author of occult texts wants to publish no investigation (yet therefore, that he would not know, where novelties over the not existing to find would be), but rather because that that dedicate themselves occultism believe, in nothing unlike that, what it already know and confirms, what they already learned. 
This is also the success mechanism of served Brown. 
Just as the secret acts. 
The informant is is rotten, and rotten (or restricted spirit) also the boss of the secret service (otherwise could he what also always be, for example editor in Lib√©ration), that only as true considered, what he acknowledges. 
The Top Secret information about Berlusconi, that had sent the American message in Rome the Staatsdezernat, were that like that, that had published Newsweek already the week before. 
Why was therefore such a canceling made around the uncovering of these dossiers? 
On a side, these purport what each formed person already knows, and to be sure that the messages - at least since the end of the second world war and since then also the heads of the government itself mutually call can or an airplane take can, around itself to the supper to encounter - lost its diplomatic function and changed themselves, with exception of some small representation task, in espionage centers. 
Every any spectator of ascertainment film knows this very exactly, and it does not happen out of sanctimony that one does so to ignore this. 
Nevertheless: the fact to repeat it publicly, the task of the sanctimony injures and serves in addition to set the American diplomacy into a bad light. 
At second place: The idea that a x any hacker can tap the most secret secrets of the most powerful country of the world, rescues the considerable blow against the prestige of the Staatsdezernats. 
Moreover the scandal brings fewer the victims, than rather the "executioners" in oppression. 
But let's dedicate the profound nature its, what happened to us. 
Formerly, to Orwells times, one was able to bundle all power such as a Big Brother, that each gesture of its subjects controlled. 
Orwells prophecy would have since then as perfectly correct turn out can where one can control each movement thanks to the telephone, each handled transaction, the visited hotel, the selected freeway and so further; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of the power. 
If one went himself however before eyes, what expires today that even the secret crypts of the power can escape no longer the inspection of a hacker to be arranged hears the control gear up, unilaterally and becomes circle-shaped. 
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - selects as an avenger of the citizen -, can bring the secrets of the power in experience. 
How can a power hold itself however, that is no longer in a position, to preserve its own secrets? 
It agrees, Georg Simmel said already that an actual secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret never revealed can become); it is also aware that jedwede knowledge of is the character Berlusconis or Merkels in the reason a secret free of Geheimis, there it the public sphere exposes; but in the style of WikiLeaks to disclose that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to rob it each power. 
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, on the other hand however Clinton and Obama. 
What will the consequences of this insult be, that such a powerful power was added? 
It is obvious that the countries in the future will place no reserved information more Online - that would become a notice glued on at the street corner match. 
But it is just as obvious that it to hope forgiven is with the current technologies secretly to be able to hold confidential reports on telephone. 
Is nothing more simply than to find out whether and when a head of state moves away himself in an airplane and contacted one its colleagues. 
How could private and only for certain ears certain relations be maintained in the future? 
I know very probably that my prediction in the moment sounds Rome fastened after Science Fiction and, but I see compelled myself in addition to imagine the government agents, myself on secret type and manner busily on uncontrollable march routes moving, its communications nowhere unlike in the bare memory with itself carrying, and in addition the few written information that got it, in the shoe paragraph concealing. 
The information would be stored had in only copy in locked drawers: in the reason the espionage attempts of Watergate less success to indicate, than a WikiLeaks. 
I had the opportunity to write that the technology yelled at before nowadays like a cancer, namely backwards. 
A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionized the communication, reconstructs the Internet a telegraph with (by telephone) wire. 
The (analogous) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to scout a film volume for volume in that one was able to ventilate spool and all secrets of the assembly of behind forwards, while the (numeric) CDS enables nowadays nothing other, when from chapter to chapter to jump, therefore in macro portion. 
With the high speed trains, one goes Rome to Milan within three hours from while this requires three and a half hours per airplane including the changing. 
It is therefore not extraordinary that politics and communication technology return on car and horse. 
A last observation. 
To understand tried the press in earlier times, what were forged for secrets between the messages. 
The messages, that demand confidential information of the press, are present it.
