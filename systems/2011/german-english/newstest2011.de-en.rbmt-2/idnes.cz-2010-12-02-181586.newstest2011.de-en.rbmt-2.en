More and more parents want people supervision devices in order to have the kids under control 
The anxiety around the own children are awake and so more and more parents consider to supervise it per GPS. 
The system, that was invented originally to the search after cars, can locate namely just as well people, what would be helpful also in such cases, like recently in that without a trace disappearance of the nine year old Janatkov√°. 
The device is not would be allowed to be larger presently about as large as a cigarette box however already soon it, than a watch. 
The case of the disappeared in anxiety and frights transferred many people and so they keep a lookout for way and means to protect its children better. 
Also for the price of an impairment of its privacy. 
"We strive us, all to say, that it herewith in no case around Herumspionieren concerns, but rather an effective means, the probability to diminish, that it to the tragedy comes," leads Petr Pilin of the company Macro because on, one of the suppliers of GPS orientation devices on the Czech market. 
"I admit that it can come in the individual case to the abuse of such devices, for example if one sticks it someone into the pocket, without that it knows therefrom, but we had previously no such case to indicate." 
"Most customers buy itself it really for safety reasons," joins Pilin thereto. 
According to its opinion the child however always should know, which purpose the "box" serves and uses it like one in the emergency. 
The child psychologist Dana refers however on that that a child does not like to carry, if it such a thing, it its simply gets rid of. 
"Also very small children show large creativity if it goes therefore to lose certain things intentionally if they do not want" become controlled. 
"Already the mobile phones woke originally at the parents large expectations, but it let itself just as easily disengage, like these new supervision devices," means woman. 
According to your opinion is also disputed whether such one arrangement actually helps in the case an attack. 
"In planned kidnappings, the kidnapper controlled practically always whether the child has any electronics with itself, with that it located become could." 
"Today it is the mobile phone." 
"If such supervision devices were used wider, they would seek this also because its sale would be certain" of massive advertising accompanied. 
"In these cases are the criminals of the police always a step ahead," means the psychologist. 
It clears however that similar devices can be thoroughly helpful in a sudden attack through a pedophile. 
Roberta of the company according to RC Monitoring, the orientation services both for automobiles and for people offers, can help the existence of such a device also then if it is destroyed immediately after the attack. 
"The device can be adjusted namely so that it reports" the respective position in certain intervals. 
"Also if it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the concerned person is available." 
"In more expensive devices is even an inclinometer integrates, that is, if one falls down and motionless lie remains, sends the device immediately a warning under statement of the position," maintains gentleman. 
According to its opinion similar services could perform mobile phones also intelligent with navigation, needs one to balance out only a special software. 
The problem of the present orientation devices exists therein that it concerns herewith either devices in match box size, that resemble followers or around smaller mobile phones. 
Always so the danger exists that one loses it. 
Mr. Pilin of the Macro because according to one tests therefore in the present devices that look like normal digital clocks. 
"That has the advantage that the possible aggressor doesn't have to recognize at all, that it concerns a supervision device and/or orientation device. 
"Or it notices that first after certain time, what the police a time advantage gives," joins it thereto. 
Equal, in which direction the development goes - there to bracelets or followers, always is used at the same time the same technology, like in the vehicle orientation. 
Therefore around the combination out of orientation function with the help of the GPS system (just as in the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone, that reports the current position.
