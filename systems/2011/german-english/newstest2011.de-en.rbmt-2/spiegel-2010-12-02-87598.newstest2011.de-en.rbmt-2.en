To the hell, warrior! 
Does Splatter to the art movie theater fit? 
The director Nicolas Winding Refn plumbs old genre boundaries with its fighter epic "Walhalla Rising" newly. 
At which audience may the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought when he turned "Walhalla Rising"? 
A caught Viking warrior with only an eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself of its tormentors and puts its opponents with almost superhuman powers in rows around - sounds ideally for young masculine spectators in search of bloody Action just because our hero makes use of gladly furious killing methods and tears its enemies already once the Gedärme out of the living body if he has bad mood. 
On the other hand on eye says how it actually is named, the entire film over no word, and also the other figures let themselves at most once too on or two sentences or a couple of death scream agonizing carry away. 
Otherwise is been quiet and indulged in the creepy beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, that offers the Viking world of about thousand years ago the scenery. 
Ideally sooner for adult Cineasten with interest for existentialism and very quiet camera trips. 
Beautifully, if a film has several target groups, damage only if they mutually exclude itself. 
Director Winding Refn counts since its wild and gestylten Drogendealer trilogy "Pusher" as a type Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, refuses however stoic to make its works with somewhat more humor the Mainstream or somewhat less brutality the Arthouse accessibly. 
Most art movie theaters friends would be allowed to deter let themselves of the brain mass injecting around and the Gedärmen. 
The Action fans die at the latest then before boredom if on eye breaks open out of freely interpretierbaren reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and festival sticks an eternity in recession and fog before the team arrives evidently in America and is quiet there further. 
No wonder therefore that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany found no movie theater distribution and appeared now only on DVD. 
That is especially because of the grand pictures a lamentation, but also because behind the prätentiösen until bloody facades an at times exciting piece of movie theater hides itself, that earned something attention. 
In this film, it does not concern is dialogues or a compelling action, it all atmosphere, a film become fever dream. 
And out of that, there is no escaping for the spectator. 
Refn grants it hardly a moment of the relaxation and ties it with its icy pictures and the dark trance good Soundtrack very slowly the throats to, above all however with the inconceivable hate, that strikes it out of the hearts of the figures. 
Only a small blond boy, who stands faithfully to the side to on eye, preserved be driven himself something akin to innocence, everyone others of wrath. 
At the very most the one-eyed hero whose subjects never are explained, who becomes however for enemies and temporary ally sometime the warrior out of the hell, if possible to the ambassador of the devil himself. 
It means ruining, perhaps however also only for that anyway ruined. 
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that one can hate and admire, for annoying, excitement and marveling. 
An experience.
