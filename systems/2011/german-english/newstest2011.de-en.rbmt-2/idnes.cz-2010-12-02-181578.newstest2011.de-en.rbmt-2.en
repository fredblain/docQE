A bone house fascinates also yet after 100 years. Look at the Interieure of Gaudi 
The roof requests at like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairway such as the spinal column of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn open fish mouths. 
That is the Casa Batlló of the catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. 
Of the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms got the nickname "bone house." 
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile gravel and mosaic, the facade remembering at barn and omnipresent soft lines, all this typical features are for art nouveau by Antonio Gaudi. 
The facade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colors and textures, that remind one of nature and living thing. 
First in more exact looking, one notes that all is controlled by geometry, rhythm and thought out order. 
In the night, the entire facade causes yet plastic, more dramatic and the special Anleuchtung reinforces the brightness of the colors yet. 
The same spirited lines and verschlungenen forms control also that in the house. 
Wood -like formed wavescopies the window frames, railing, ornament elements by doors, even look holes and strips. 
The house Batlló in the quarter Eixample at the animated purchase street Passeig de Grácia no. 43 was caused by the reconstruction of a house from the year 1877, that architects Emilio Sala Cortese carried out. 
The reconstruction used two years and was locked 1906. 
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, insisted originally on the abstract of the old and the building of a building new totally, but in the end it agreed the idea Gaudís on an unusual and also cheap reconstruction to. 
The rent house Casa Batlló sketched Antoni Gaudí however not alone. 
It collaborated at the same time with the architect Josep Maria Jujol. 
Just on its tear board, the decoration for the representative dwelling of the reality owner and also the use of mosaics emerged was at the facade its idea. 
At the formation of the facade, also numerous further Bildner and artist cooperated however. 
The joint work at the designs for the Casa Batlló was the start of a fruitful collaboration of Jujola and Gaudí. 
So Jujol was involved also in the building of Gaudís house Casa Milá in the park Güell, in which also further works of Antoni Gaudí are. 
Already shortly after its completion, the house got of because of the local inhabitants of its organic forms the nickname "bone house." 
Other again named it the special window opening mechanism because of the "yawning house." 
One says would be represented also, very above on the building the sword of the holy Georg, the patron of Katalonien. 
But also further sculptural elements symbolize concealed religious subjects. 
Gaudí sketched a headquarters heating system unique for the at that time time with ventilation canals and typical fireplaces for the house. 
Somewhat bizarre seems its 45-Grad-Neigung 45-Grad-Neigung degrees of 45-Grad-Neigung inclination already. 
Gaudí ignored in its creating consistently all at that time building directions and let itself shake in no way by this. 
Before building start, it overtook were to be sure of the city the corresponding building permit however the details made by it about the planned reconstruction so vaguely that the city fathers were two years later in the completion so appalled of the result, that they demanded remedy. 
The aldermen knocked themselves among other things also that the building with its pillars interfered even in the public sidewalk. 
To changes, it came to be sure no longer, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the request of relating to this the quarter placed Josep Batlló a proposal to the permission of the rental both highly lain floors of the house - and it became it promptly given. 
The home owner herself took in into the lower floors. 
In the gallery on the 2nd floor a company drawing-room was found, on the third floor itself the bedrooms and private room of the dwelling. 
The ground floor was leased at a jeweler business. 
The entire sechsstöckige building passes through a stairway until up to the roof terrace. 
Through the basic elements of the reconstruction, all right angles and straight lines were removed and were replaced by bent and swung walls. 
Gaudí worked however also with a modern draft to the mutual connection of rooms. 
The social part can be connected through the opening of the drawing-room doors totally and so a larger company comfortably was able to chat without having to forgo in more confidential conversations a certain intimacy. 
The house received also a quite unusual roof and two further floors through Gaudís reconstruction except a new facade. 
Also Gaudís game with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles is impressive with which the patio is disguised and the light yards. 
The game both colors lends all floors of the house a maximum at light. 
At the same time it made simply the principle to utilize itself that white the light better reflects, than dark colors, that absorb the sunlight to the contrary in addition. 
The house Casa Batlló, that was included 2005 in the world heir list of the Unesco, anybody can visit today. 
On the first floor the roomiest and grandest dwelling of the public accessibly is made. 
The home owners decided not until the year to this step and this out of occasion the 150. birthday of the famous creator. 
When one assessed, that this is a quite profitable business, one retained widened the examination, yes one it also on further joint and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace from. 
The price to the examination of the building monument is to be sure no peanuts, it amounts to get 16.50 Euro, students, pensioner, groups and proprietor of tourist expulsion 20 percent reduction. 
This sum exceeds Gaudí constructed the prices of admission to other in the city. 
He, who would like to know learn the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon turrets, should try to close friendship with one of the house inhabitants and it at home visit.
