The correct mattress and the bed rust correct? Women have other wishes as men 
Not the craziest bed frame, but rather the quality of the couch area - therefore mattress and rust settle the good bed. 
These harmoniously must supplement itself to be sure in order to become the wishing of the concrete user just. 
In the selection, many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and not finally also the sex of the sleeper. 
Also the interior, in which mattress and rust have to subordinate themselves, is just as important. 
Typical example? 
In a chateau, in which regularly heated becomes not, latex mattresses are not suited well because they more long need much in order to become" "warm. 
In addition they are clearly heavier than an usual polyurethane mattress. 
And - it regularly should be turned. 
If they have namely not enough ventilation tubule in the kernel and lie yet in addition on a firm disk, staut itself moisture on: It is not excluded therefore that under its mold forms. 
In the choice, naturally also a roll plays at which one is accustomed. 
He who longer time was abroad where very high mattresses with soft layer are usual, will be able to become accustomed heavily to a low mattress with hard surface. 
"Probably all ice hockey players who returned out of the NHL burdened themselves with me that they can" correctly sleep here no longer. 
"For its worked very hard shoulders, heel and hips need it simply a soft layer out of Visco foam (memory Foam - a Formgedächtnis-Polymer)." 
Recommend I "this among other things also diabetic person, who suffer from an interference of the nervous system, so that it the" information" out of the joints and the skin badly receive can," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, that specializes in cushion furniture. 
Therefore I provided already years ago many ice hockey players, but also other customer this mattress with Visco foam (memory Foam). 
"Today this is no more problem, for such mattress the manufacturers offer among other things Tempur, the Italian firm Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico at." 
And one doesn't have to be unconditional a famous ice hockey player in order to learn appreciate the advantages of the Visco foam. 
This "miracle" functions actually very simply. 
The foam optimalisiert its hardness and corresponding to form that absorbed said warmth, differently, it schmiegt itself regular at the warm body on. 
Nowhere it does not press rolls itself, in which night one around like after a heavy battle. 
One sleeps simply much better. 
The viskoelastische foam offers in addition also protection from Dekubitus (wound fire). 
In the choice of the mattress size, one should add to the height still the length of the sole, therefore ca. 21 to 34 cm. 
Man such as woman, who are large at the 180 cm, need such a 210 bed long until 220 cm. 
At least 90 cm of couch width should be available everyone the sleepers, together therefore 180 cm. 
In single beds, for example with singles, are mounted 120 to 140 cm. 
Because of the comfort and also for possible visitors. 
Otherwise the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If one on the back lies, should yet enough place for the easy angewinkelten arms be," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the guild master of the upholsterers and room outfitter, that already for years the problematic nature of the healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture dedicates itself and lectures this subject also on vocational schools. 
In a double bed needs pay attention are also high every one own rust and its own mattress, but in the purchase, therewith the mattress. 
Otherwise does nothing remain other when the rust to mount in different height and that is by far possible in every bed frame. 
Foam mattresses should be high at least 14 cm, should fall mattress with feather skeleton 15 cm, therefrom at least three centimeters to the form layer and the fine cushion. 
"By hand or in the sitting may one the cushioning under no circumstances sense," warns Helena Prokopová. 
Each mattress makes a special rust type required. 
Entire cushions beds with mattress and document such as grown together Siamzwillinge have nothing to seek in the bedroom. 
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and cannot wash the reference one, what is today already perfectly acceptable. 
And there one in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, is clear that the mattress becomes after five to seven years slowly a gigantic (and clogged sieve). 
Also therefore specialists reject advertising slogans, that promise a service life of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee in mattress. 
Each thing has its if and however. 
And therefore a practical advice of the dealers: In mattress of 120 or 140 cm widths one should not shun the hygiene of the washable, deductible references, nevertheless it recommends itself to use a mattress cover, that one easily can draw-off and wash. 
Also if today as a rule mattress references with all around zipper are produced, so that one gets two halves after the opening (immensely important to the wash process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, above all alone carried out, requests often like the unequal battle between David and Goliath on. 
Do they have a firm disk in bed instead of a rust? 
Out therewith! 
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night. 
Also so they should equip the disk rather with ventilation holes (as far as already no inside are) and mattress with feather skeleton and 15 cm least height with so-called. Use pocket feather kernel and fine cushion. 
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such one document. 
For not adjustable slat rust with 14 to 18 feather strips (Lamellen), latex mattress or sandwich mattresses are suited (where appropriate also combinations of latex and Kokos), always pay itself at the same time rust with a larger slat amount, therefore by 28 and more feather strips from to regulate with Lordosenstütze in the lumbar vertebra area and the possibility, the slat hardness. 
On adjustable Lamellenroste, no mattresses with feather skeleton belong because they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment. 
Next to the attitude the stiff of the feather strips also special flexible shoulder modules are offered. 
Herewith it concerns a special reinforcement of the feather strips, that enables it to imprint the feather strips or quite so to verwinkeln that they enable that at particular points sinking of the shoulder of the sleeper. 
Nominally for men with wide shoulders an important thing. 
There is even mattress manufacturer who began to use mattress" soft zones with "gentleman for the shoulder area. 
Also at the ladies is thought - them grants one these soft zones in the Hüftgegend. 
For most demanding customers, point elastic wing feather systems (Lattoflex) or rust with point elastic contact Pads are with so-called. Multitorsionsfederung determines. 
The pressure is distributed among several points by what means the tension diminishes itself. 
But - if one uses a bad (too large and portly) pillow to the correct mattress and correct rust, most advantages get lost again. 
Also here a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, should pass its tip only to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax. 
Ideally a 50 x appears therefore 60 cm of large pillow how it for example the scandinavian like. 
In the side situation, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height. 
Our modern mattresses have have something with the former (with hay of filled) straw sacks yet meanly. 
Modern manufacturers use always more frequently natural materials or at least its additions. 
Also in mattress, the new magic word is named "organic." 
Instead of petroleum raw materials, one uses to the manufacture of polyurethane foams of always frequent naturelle oils - for example castor bean oil and soya bean oil. 
Soya bean is used probably of all well known manufacturers. 
"Organic is named in mattress, the origin purely natural its kernel out of materials exists," explains Petr by the firm Tropico plus. 
Nature materials are used however also in the manufacture of mattress references - one of the first was there Aloe Vera. 
One can grant himself however also Mikrokapseln, that spread fresh forest aroma or lavender aroma in the sleep. 
Also here one makes a difference between man and woman. 
While at the men a "cooling" plant extract is used out of birch leaf, so that the mattress reference can absorb the warmth and can cool off the body, have the references for women "warming" effect. 
Extract out of red peppers of lively the blood circulation on, that weaker sex becomes in the sleep therefore comfortable warm. 
And the current favorites? 
Mattress out of cold foam (it has larger pore with destroyed cell structure and is therefore respiration more active than a standard practice polyurethane and also much more flexibly). 
Through the combination the different stiff (hardness) of cold foams and Visco foams more emerge-zones-mattress that exactly know, where head, hip and heel are. 
For a high-value mattress, one has to shell out to be sure 7000 crowns and more. 
Health mattresses are burdened however usually with slighter value-added tax because they count than medical remedies. 
First Czech business became Gumotex this advantage given. 
One does not see is, to save at the mattress and at the rust so easy. 
There and again there is special offer of manufacturers and dealers that offer two mattresses for the price of one. 
So the brand Magniflex the mattress Duofreeze offers with in the reference verstepptem Visco foam memory for 11,990 CZK. 
One gets the second free in addition. 
It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of the viskoelastischen foam materials with open cell structure and higher density in almost cosmic speed. 
No wonder, were developed it yet for the NASA, for the astronauts are stopped in the starts enormous overburdenings. 
Tempur is hardened itself in warmth soft, in cool milieu it again. 
So it adapts itself the human body perfectly and distributes in optimal manner the body pressure. 
It is therefore not only ideal to the prevention of pressure fire, but rather increases generally the sleep comfort. 
Viskoelastische foam materials become however not only in mattress, but rather also in other health products how for example in special foot cushions uses, that should provide the legs and the containers relief. 
Domestic manufacturers use for example the foam materials Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
