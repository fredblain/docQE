The Spanish government had no objections against the CIAS flights with Taliban and al-Qaida-prisoner over Spanish country zone after Guantánamo how out of a telegram of the ambassador of the U.S.A. in Madrid follows. 
That of Wikileaks enhüllten and at the daily newspapers "els País" (per cable) reflect that forwarded documents. It is added that the former deputy head of the government María Teresa Fernández demanded de la Vega, that Spanish government become should informed, "around to prove, that foreign airplanes, that Spain fly over, appropriate supervised become."
