Dupont in part rebuked 
The Quebecer broadcast moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian supervisory board for broadcast standards (CCNR) because of its controversial remarks over social care and Haitianer just as as because of its abusive speech manner over radio. 
The CCNR represents the opinion, M. Dupont and its CHOI 98.1 FM teams would be right to be sure the on own statement of opinion, to be sure would have certain remarks "inexact information about the social care and unauthorized negative representations of the Haitianer as well as also one so ungehobelte speech manner contain, is" that the during the day radiated shipments not appropriate. 
The supervisory board had concluded also that a discussion over suicide, that includes the distribution of the names of these people, that suicides committed, against which code of the broadcast offends. 
The CCNR had received several troubles regarding that during that in the period of 2008 and 2010 radiated shipments made commentary. 
The first decree became sun per inserted commun as a result of a trouble of the "front the assistées sociales you Québec." 
The activist organization had burdened itself that the sums named in the shipment would be inexact. 
The moderators should give rather solidly as misleading information. 
With respect to the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had represented the opinion, would be the suicide an expression of cowardice. 
The majority of the supervision councilors had pulled the conclusion, let the mediated message be herewith that suicide might not be looked at as a solution by life crises. 
"The majority of the supervisory board considers, cut would have that the in question standing consequences of the shipment" Dupont le midi" a sensitive subject in and suitable type suitable for families and manner." 
Therefore it was covered with no blame at all vis-à-vis its person. 
The last issue concerned the statements that had had references to the earthquake in Haiti. 
Stéphane Dupont and Jean René Dufort had delivered themselves relating to this a medium effective dispute conversation that a quantity had evoked of reactions. 
The CHOI moderator had explained to not to have contributed for the benefit of the Haiti aid because one would not know with certainty, whether the needy would receive also really the financial donations. 
The supervisory board is of the opinion that these commentaries of improper character had not been, that however its cumulative effect would present an unauthorized negative representation of the Haitianer. 
"I served" already my three-day suspension punishment in this thing. 
"My document is since one and a half years chaste," explained the moderator. 
In all decisions, the supervisory board denounces the distribution of an ungehobelten expression. 
In all cases, the CHOI FM broadcast announcer had acted "on the far side of its obligations." 
The consequences for the radio station, that had announce should among other things its decisions uniquely during the head broadcasting time within a time period of three days, are negligible.
