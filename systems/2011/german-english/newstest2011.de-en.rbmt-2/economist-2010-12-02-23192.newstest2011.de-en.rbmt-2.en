The demokatrische routine 
The democracy movement in Latin America becomes stronger, so like the support of private businesses. 
Crime is a larger problem than unemployment. 
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is larger than that of the United States. 
To these results, the Latinobarómetro survey, that was carried out in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist, came. 
This survey regularly is carried out since 1995 and shows so the opinion change in this region up. 
Two facts fall in this year's survey of the September and October especially in it eye. 
First the good mood in Latin America 
And secondly the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions. 
In numerous countries at the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement strongly increased (s. table 1). 
In Peru for example where the economy since 2002 annually around ca. 6% are awake, climbed the number of the democracy advocates of 40% in 2005 on 61% this year. 
Also in Mexico where the economy recovers since the strong break-in in the last year again, is to be recognized such a trend. 
Yet only the half of the questioned in Mexico and Brazil, the population richest countries of the region, are convinced democrats, what the regional average sinks (s. charts 2). 
Ca. 44% of the questioned explained that they are satisfied with the democratic practice of its country. Those are soviele such as in the last year, however 25% more than in 2001 (charts 3). 
About 34% trust to the congress of its country and 45% of its government. Both values correspond which the last year, show however a clear climb vis-à-vis 2003, (17% and/or 24%). 
A decade ago economic crises undermined Latin America the efforts toward more democracy. 
That this also during the world economic crisis lasted, lies possibly that the countries of Latin America recovered only a short recession phase of experienced and quickly again. 
In addition the arms were caught through a stronger social network. 
(According to reports of the UN economy commission for Latin America of this week climbed 2009 the poverty rate in Latin America only negligibly on and is this year again around 32% please). 
Yet of country by land there are strong mood differences (s. charts 4). 
Economy strong Brazil and the popularity of the separating Präsidenten Luiz Inácio Lula there Silva is reflected in a common Fortschrittsdenken. 
In Mexico and Central America where the recession more strongly noticeably was and increased violent crime, is this fewer the case. 
First for the second time since survey start, many questioned in Latin America in the crime in its country see a larger problem than in unemployment (s. charts 5). 
Ca. 31% state that either it itself or a member of the family in the last year became victim of a crime. Yet vis-à-vis 38% in the last year, the values sank and have reached therefore the lowest state for 1995. 
The increasing economic performance reflects itself in the stronger support of that privately and the market economy against: ca. 71% of the questioned nationally gave on that the private economy is inevitable for the development, in 2007 were it 56% (s. charts 6). 
Ca. 58% explained that only the market economy can bring its country progress, compared to 47% in the last year. 
Interestingly enough this view retained 62% of the questioned in Venezuela (and 80% are for a private economy) although its left president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private businesses. 
Brazil has had according to 19% of the questioned (18% in the last year) the largest weight in the region, followed of the United States (9%, unchanged for last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% in the last year). 
The questioned in Mexico and most countries Central Americas on the other hand see the most influential country in the USA whereby this roll in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua is received by Venezuela.
