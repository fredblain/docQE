The old nursing home strengthens that the deaths are not to be attributed to "missing measures" 
The owners of the old people's home in Olot do not exclude that its caretaker killed over eleven older people 
The responsibles of the old nursing home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave yesterday a press conference in which they laid out, which damage had added the criminal actions Joan Vila Dilmés - the caretaker, the person at least eleven old during its work, for which he was responsible, killed had - to the arrangement. 
The leader of the old nursing home, Joan Sala, appeared in accompaniment of its lawyer, Joan Cañada, before court and announced, "La Caritat would like the responsible (for the deaths) accuse," but "the right and our liability duty force to suppose us in addition the process and the civil law liability." 
The arrangement must accept not only a social loss of face because it had assessed the criminal actions of the caretaker not on time, but rather pay now also a high compensation sum, that is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims. 
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime is due to August 2009 and that it had murdered since then further. 
The judge arranged the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the old nursing home - because he assumed, that no physician personally had examined the deceased, but rather the formalities by telephone were completed based on its age and illnesses. 
The leader of La Caritat denied this point plainly and explained, been could" that "staying away measures keinerzeit the reason for the occurrences its. 
The lawyer of La Caritat added that it "in the lawsuit no indication ions for careless actions another person would give" as the accused. 
That already as a "death angel" baptized confessed the day before yesterday eleven murders and explained, commits the first crime on the 29th of August 2009 and to have murdered one and a half months later the second old lady. 
In this case, it killed with an overdose insulin, in the difference for first crime, with which it had dispensed a mixture out of different sedatives. 
The leader of La Caritat explained, the access of the personnel to the medicines is to be controlled only heavily. 
The insulin syringes and the sedative cocktail used the caretaker in six of nine committed crimes in order to free the patients with death of its suffering. 
But the results of the laboratory investigations will lay out whether Vila lies and selected a less cruel death for its first victims actually or whether it burned out this from within, in that it dispensed them pale lye, how it had done it according to admission with three women, whom it murdered between that 12th and 17th of October. 
In La Caritat, one gives the statements of the caretaker no belief, not once, what concerns the amount of the stood murders, that could be thoroughly more. This attitude is justified therewith that Vila had made very different statements before court and that it would make no sense to change its procedure after eight successful murders suddenly. 
They say, they made available itself it for this reason and clarification of the range of these occurrences the justice to the.
