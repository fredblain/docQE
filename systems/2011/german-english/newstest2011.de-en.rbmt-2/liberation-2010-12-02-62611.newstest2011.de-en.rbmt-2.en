Alarm - of children taken in pesticides 
A child of 10 years takes in published 81 different chemical substances over the day, so one this Wednesday of the union Générations future (former movement to the protection of the rights and the respect of coming generations) study. 
The union that explains that its results "in view of the slight amount at analyzed samples no statistically significant value represent, but rather illustration character of the treated problematic nature represent," had bought between July and September that usually within four, of an approximately ten-year-old child to the meals consumed groceries plus a between meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris. 
These typical meals - inclusive of the official recommendations of five fresh fruit part and fruit part, three milk products and 1.5 liters of water per day - became just as as examines Naschereien of laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutant. 
The plate balances is shattering: 81 chemical substances, under that 42 as possibly or probably carcinogenically classified and five as karziogen certain classified, just as as 37 substances with Endokrinin disruptive influence, according to studies of several institutions such as for example the international cancer research center. 
"Even if in the approximate entirety of the cases the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken in substance not exceeded become, takes one this elevation yet very good, that reality, in which the consumer possibly carcinogenic materials or substances with Endokrinin disruptive influence stopped becomes, apprehension exciting is," notes the union. 
Already in the breakfast, alone the butter and the tea with milk contain already more than ten of the possibly carcinogenic residues and three certainly as carcinogenically proved, just as as more than twenty residues, that can impair the hormone system. 
The apple imported from Brazil when between meal planned for the study, shows traces by six chemical substances, under that a fungicide forbidden in France. 
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, in the lunch included, with which the study traces of an insecticide exertally forbidden in the EU assessed. 
Furthermore also the hack steaks, the tuna out of the can, even the Baguette and the chewing gum of pesticides and other chemical materials g sharp thrilling were. 
In the tap water, the analyses brought the presence of nitrate and chloroform at the light. 
In the supper, the salmon steak with 34 was determined, was chemical residues at the "abundantest," and itself the plastic plate related for warming up the meal in the microwave not unencumbered. 
That in conclusion risk of this "pollutant cocktails" for the consumer "probably will undervalue," so the study. 
The "Alliance Europes Ecologie harvest Verts" (I / O LV) proposed on their part "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium over the use of pesticides, in order to stop the "increase at diseases of civilization." 
In July a study of the European authority had identified identified for food safety (EFSA) of reference on the presence of residues 365 more differently, in fruit and vegetable pesticides, that are consumed in Europe, under that 76 in grains.
