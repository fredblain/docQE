Secretly into the middle 
In the weeks after the sudden death of your man, president, Cristina Fernández, learned Argentina a wave of sympathy that drove its popularity rate around 20 points on more than 50% towards the top. That is the highest value since its choice in the year 2007. 
Whether it this helps however in the next year to a re-election, depends therefrom whether the evidently mourning Cristina Fernández willing to compromise is than its deceased husband, its predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner. 
The signs for that are not unambiguous. 
Néstor Kirchner, that also after the choice of its wife the economic policy directed, set up frequently budgets, that the tax collections that did not consider economic growth and the inflation fully. 
This permitted it the president couple to issue the extra revenue after own discretion. 
On the paper, the Fernández government in the last year lost the majority in the congress. 
Yet the opposition is divided and led Kirchners death after a heart attack on the 27th of October to further disputes. 
Some regime critics out of the rows of the reigning Peronisten stood behind Cristina Fernández. 
Yet after chaotic sessions (with which a parliamentarian one of other into the face struck and other the government of the bribery accused), it did not succeed the congress to dismiss the household for 2011. 
"I about that will not discuss," so the president. 
The households 2010 applies now also to the next year by what means the president still has more opportunity to issue money after own discretion. 
The economy runs be named: it probably becomes this year around up to 9% grow. 
The official inflation rate is z. Z. about 11.1%, but numerous private estimations - and wage demands of the labor unions - drive the value on almost 30%. 
Kirchner that 2003 received the office when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, explained growth and poverty fight to its main goal, and not the inflation decline. 
It denied the collaboration with the IMF, tormented the private sector and cleaned the national institute for statistics and census INDEC, that thereupon the official inflation statistics schönte. 
Can Fernández hit now a bulkier way? 
It called the private economy and the labor union leaders to conversations. 
According to and official statements raises in the next year are supposed to be limited to 18%. 
The high world market prices for Argentina agricultural products gave the economy a strong buoyancy. 
Yet the inflation undermined the growth spurt through a large Devaluation in the year 2002. 
Possibly Cristina Fernández would like to connect for this reason Argentina finance economic again to the remainder of the world. 
The government encountered beginning of this year an agreement with security proprietors that had rejected the earlier debt funding of the country in 2001. 
Now Fernández seems to press club on an agreement with the financiers out of the Paris, which it ca. $6.7 billion owes. 
The Kirchners had an examination through the IMF how other plotted rejected usually, always. 
Yet in the last month, the Secretary of Commerce Amado Boudou announced that the fund will perform "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index. It looks so, as would be this the first step to the cleansing of the INDEC. 
It is not well known whether Fernández will be politically active after termination of its tenure also without the support through its husband. 
If yes, it requires in addition the support of the means layer that has chiefly enough of the Kirchnerismus. 
If the Argentinians return in March out of its summer vacation, becomes the wave of the Sympatie, that was offered it, faded away be. 
If she would like to win a further choice, she must decide whether she quietly cancels many political decisions of its man still and.
