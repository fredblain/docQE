Oozed US document portrays Moscow as a harbor of the corruption 
The inspection of the city lies gives in the hands of the "Kleptokratie" and it a part of the bribes and the protection money that gathers it, at the Kremlin further. So the American message in Russia in a memo reported in February. 
Both police and the state security service blackmail high protection moneys so that they can hold its expensive standard of living in Moscow, is named it. 
They gather money not only of legitimate businesses, but rather also of organized criminal volumes. 
Each layer of the bureaucracy - what prime minister Vladimir Putin as "vertical of the authority" designates has - takes itself its part of the money that the leaders hikes towards the top. 
The memo, that was sent under the name of the ambassador John Beyrle after Washington, was published on Tuesday of WikiLeaks on its homepages. 
The memo is based on sources, whose names were revised. 
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov of yet Moscow mayor was, and it accuses it the corruption. 
It was fired in October of Präsident Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly a proof that in the meantime cleaned up become would be. 
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who possesses a well known construction company rejected over years of corruption accusations again and again, and it won numerous slander complaints against such accusations. 
In September it explained a Russian television station when it was asked about a documentation, that suggests, it would be corrupt: "It is displaced, it is dirty, it is dirty." 
> An incredibly large number at Russians believe that its company is corrupt. Surveys yielded that. 
But it is unusually that, how in the report of the ambassador happen, single people named become, and it is unheard that this happens through a diplomat of a foreign country. 
"The direct connection of the government of Moscow with the crime led in addition, disturbed designate that some it as"" and come to the end, acts that the government sooner like a Kleptokrat than a government," so the memo. 
"Criminal elements enjoy covers a" kryshna" (a concept out of the world of the criminal / the mafia, what literal "roof" or protection means), that the police, the state security (FSB), the service regulatory agency (MVD) and the office of the district attorney just as like through the entire moscovite government bureaucracy. 
Specialists discovered a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow. 
"Luzhkov stands at uppermost place." 
"FSB, MVD and the militia stand on the second step." 
"Finally the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow on the lowest step." 
"This is an incompetent system, in which criminal groups in many areas close a space, because the city no aid at all offers." 
The report says further that the FSB money collects of the largest firms and arrests the businessmen small the police. 
A source, is named is, "explained, that Moscow shopkeeper understand, that it best is, the protection of the MVD and FSB to get (and not of the organized crime), there it not only more weapons, resources and power have as the criminals, but rather also because it through the law protected become." 
"For this reason the protection is asked through criminal gears no longer so like earlier." 
The memo notes that, while the gathering of the moneys is comprehensively, the protection of even very modest be be arrested no; even that that pay, sometimes. 
That that do not pay find very quickly closed its business before - based on the on or other pretext. 
Medvedev spoke repeatedly about that to fight the corruption, however simultaneously noticed in that it made only little progress. 
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men, that with with suitcases, that were probably full with money, in which Kremlin go. 
"In its battle against the corruption must Medvedev itself on the bureaucrats leave," said Georgy Satarov, director of in that, a moscovite expert commission, recently in an interview. 
"But it is part of this bureaucracy." 
"It is no part of the political class because a political class in Russia exists" no longer. 
Without politician, without an opposition, without a separation of the forces, says he, is corruption unavoidable. 
Nationwide, appreciates in that, costs the corruptions Russia more than $ 300 billions per year. 
The country ranked on place of 154 a newer investigation to the global perception of the corruption through the non-governmental organization Transparence internationally (countries become of "at that least corrupt" "most corrupt" itemized). 
The uncovering of the memo of the American message which happened after moscovite time spätabends, will release be can with security displeasing within the Russian government although, because Luzhkov can be accused for the mistakes of Moscow, it for the Kremlin also a possibility to maintain that one would solve the problems. 
Putin maintained in an interview with Larry King for CNN that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and reacted named furiously on the uncovering, that American diplomats it Batman and Medvedev Robin. 
"The truth is, that it around our interaction goes, that an important factor of the domestic policy in this country is," said it. 
In order but around to be honest, we would not have expected that this would happen with such an arrogance, with such a pressure and on so unethische type and manner, know you."
