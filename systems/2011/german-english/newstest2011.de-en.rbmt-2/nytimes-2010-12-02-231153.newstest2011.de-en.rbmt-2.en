The federal choice commission concluded last month to adjust the ascertainments because of a separate complaint through the ethics group, after the payment one of $96,000 of Mr. Ensigns parents at the Hamptons against the federal choice law offended would have. 
The choice commission said, there had not been enough proofs that the money had been something else as a gift.

Mr. Ensign was moreover with Mr. Hampton and one of other customer out of Nevada, Allegiant Air, to the lunch arranges and asked the transportation minister to arrange a meeting in the name of the airline after these Mr. Hampton for the purpose of lobby work adjusted had. 
When last year turned information for the first time about this affair at the public, Mr. apologizes. Ensign at its voters and abandoned its position in the senate where he had stood in the order of the republicans at fourth place. 
After it was been noticeable many months no longer, Mr. told. Ensign two weeks ago reporter whom he would strive for a third tenure in the senate. 
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign no longer longer the goal of police investigations are, declared its press officer, Jennifer Cooper, whom senator would hope, that the ethics commission would follow very quickly the example of the justice ministry and would adjust its ascertainments.
