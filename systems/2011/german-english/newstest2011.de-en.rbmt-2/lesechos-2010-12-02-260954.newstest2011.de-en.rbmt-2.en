Second mandate: the obvious-ness 
De Gaulle really had supported. 
Middle edge had believe let that it would support. 
Valéry Giscard d' Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation. 
And Nicolas Sarkozy yet less than this. 
A mandate in the Elysée summons the next. 
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012. 
But the obvious-ness does not stand the side of the Mysteriums that fastens the presidency function, well to face. 
Therefore one must do so as if the doubt would exist henceforth. 
In the one, like also in the other sense. 
2006 purported the followers Jacques Chiracs, a third mandate would not be excluded without believing even on that. 
Nicolas Sarkozy assured on the 15th of November in serious tone to make its decision "sometime in the autumn of the year 2011." 
That it would be discernable let on Tuesday evening the perspective of "two mandates" in the Elysée before the UMP parliamentarians, had spread accordingly a little feverishness. 
Was that the official announcement of its candidacy? 
Far been missing. 
The president let remember solely that the constitution change of 2008 would restrict the amount of the five five year-old office periods on solely two. 
It made a determination, no announcement. 
It is not the first time that it mentions the presidential election on the occasion of such meeting in a humorous tone. 
"You still have at worst seven and a half years with me, or at best," explained it in July 2009 to them. 
On a new in May 2010: "Does not believe that I do not think" about the phase after that. 
Its words of the day before yesterday make it no longer to the candidate as on the day before; but also not fewer. 
If they should evoke commentaries, then for a dual reason. 
The acceleration of the race around the candidacy with the HP on a side. 
It is not however the reception of the competition with Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy in addition to reveal itself. 
To the contrary, it is its obvious candidacy in 2012 that many members of the HP admonish supposed more prematurely than to the declaration of war. 
The bad surveys on the other side. 
For the first time, the voters of the rights would prefer a candidacy of François Fillon of that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to survey of the BVA-L' express). 
"We have a candidate, and it gives with the UMP no discussions at all about that," reacted directly and carefully the background of the prime minister. 
"If it a defeat as possible find would become, would be it not candidate," divides Jean Pierre Raffarin with. 
"It always on that will believe, win to can," corrects Alain Juppé, that came to terms with the obvious-ness.
