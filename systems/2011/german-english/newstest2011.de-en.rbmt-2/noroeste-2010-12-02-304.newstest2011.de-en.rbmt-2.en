In the new procedure, most applicants must imagine before its conversation in the consulate in the service places to the visa application (ASC, that initial in English). 
The personnel of the ASC receives the biometric data of the applicant, that are reviewed by the consulate before the conversation. 
The new procedure has count certain advantages for the candidates, in addition: 
The totals costs for the settlement of the visa sink, for it is no longer required the appointment arrangement, the preparation of the visa proposal and the carrier services with which the document is issued to pay separated. 
The applicant performs only a single payment that uncovers the three services. 
The present price remains unchanged: the Gegenwerit to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with proposal (including visas for temporary worker) and 390 dollars for hands and investors. 
That that only would like to extend its visa must lead no conversation in the consulate, they must imagine only in the neighbor lying ASC where they produce its documents and its fingerprints are taken. 
Because the biometric data are overtaken in the ASC, remain the applicants, that require a second appointment for the conversation in the consulate, there less time than earlier. 
That, that apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Ju√°rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo, must pay the service impact of 26 dollars no longer.
