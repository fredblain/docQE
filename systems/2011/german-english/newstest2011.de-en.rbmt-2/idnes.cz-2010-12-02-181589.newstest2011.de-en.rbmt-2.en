The army has wrap up could hold so many ignition cords, that one entirely the Czech Republic you however only two years 
The Czech army shopped become 445 kilometers of ignition cords, ignited become with explosive charges. 
In the previous year the defense ministry had delivered already 224 kilometers of ignition cord at the army warehouses. 
It is to be known already calming that the military forces provided from for 225 years. 
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cords - two, at most however four years. 
The army bought the ignition cords of the corporation STV Group, a. s. for läppische 40 million crowns. 
In its establishment for the purchase of this powerful quantity ignition cord the general staff MF DNES, the soldiers answered would consume annually ignition cord at the 60 kilometers. 
The investigations of Armeepyrotechnikern according to, the MF DNES on that addressed, goes out of this statement forth that the entire army would have to graduate annually an extremely intensive pyrotechnische education - of all generals and officers of the army command, up to the secretaries and cleaner. 
Ministers of Defense Alexandr Vondra and army general Vlastimil Picek not excluded. 
Only so the notable annual consumption of sixty kilometers ignition string could be justified half-way. 
This length corresponds by the way 25,000 detonations. 
But also so these army supply would pass for more than ten years. 
If however yet the old rule counts of experts, that to the training of each new occupation soldier two meters of ignition cord suffice totally, the army created itself through these new purchases - also under the viewpoint of the increased requirement of the pioneer units and special units - a calming supply for the already mentioned 225 years. 
At the same time soldiers of the fast use brigade burdened himself recently at the Minister of Defense Vondra, they would have almost no patrons for hand firearms more so that shoot practices are restricted because of the missing means strongly. 
Of the underpants deficiency very to are quiet. 
Goes in "me also not why they buy" such enormous quantities of ignition cords of us. 
But that is in the end its decision, they already will know, need to which it it." 
"For us is the army a good customer, that we as a dealer most extensive contrary to come would want," says the sales and marketing manager of the STV Group Jan. 
Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the defense ministry establishes the purchase Hunderter kilometer of ignition cord therewith, the army would have stocked up so at least for ten years with this "ammunition." 
Jan of the STV Group speaks however only about a four-year-old use duration of the ignition cords and police and Armeepyrotechniker quite only of two years. 
"In perfect storage are well also the four mentioned years possible," clears one of them, that however anonymous remain wants in order to not to be accused as a soldier the criticism of the army. 
At the end of the use duration, each ammunition thoroughly must be tested whether it yet dependably is and does not endanger life of the soldiers. 
These tests are however not for nothing, but rather cost further money. 
A further argument of the defense ministry is the bulk discount for the 445 kilometers ignition cord. 
"You cost us sixty percent fewer, than the last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," divides us speaker Pejšek the standpoint of the buyer of the defense ministry with. 
Only to the comparison: The annual consumption of ignition string of Pyrotechnikern of the police, that ammunitions liquidate out of the second world war or the Soviet brother army, exceeds already some years long hardly 1,500 meters. 
And the police orders always only such quantities of this ammunition that it can consume before flow of the use duration. 
Already the security because of the Pyrotechniker, moreover one holds himself so the possibility to flexible purchases more modern and therefore also more dependably ignition cords openly. 
The defense ministry has anyway gigantic problems in the liquidation ten cable transmitter tons of ammunition out of times of the Resident of Warsaw of contract when the two hundred thousand headed Czechoslovakian people army prepared itself for its expedition to the Rhine. 
According to the Pyrotechnikern, the MF DNES addressed, expected the Czech military forces into a couple of years of ignition cords older the same problem in the liquidation Hunderter kilometer, that has so "favorably" shopped it today.
