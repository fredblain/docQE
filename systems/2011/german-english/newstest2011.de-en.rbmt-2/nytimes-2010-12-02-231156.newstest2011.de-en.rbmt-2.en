Cheshire calling makes aware of Twitter 
A half dozen of them typed itself in the Krawallen in the courtoom away. 
In the minute tact, they sent over Twitter its reports on ghastly testimony. 
At the end, so the defense,, there was more than 140,000 Twitter messages over the process around rape and at beds chained children in a house who rose in flames. 
On Thursday the process pursued attentively will become by Steven J. Hayes that was accused, three members a family out of Cheshire, Connecticut to have killed, an official end find if the sentence falls over the death sentence, that expressed the jury. 
Yet Mr. Hayes lawyers submitted already proposals in court, that will represent reasons for a calling and that will busy the courts on years. 
Reasons provoking is one of that that that it so far spread through the intensive reporting over the process - also through the extensive use of Twitter through average reporter - to a "circus atmosphere" and one, immediate penetration of rebellious details come would be so that the jury in more inadmissibly manner had been influenced through the public indignation. 
This objection could cause the Appelationsgerichte to be concerned with the question whether the new technologies let become new rules in the courtoom necessary. 
"So like I it during this process experiences would be right, believe I, that it actual a danger is, if the entrance of the new technologies into the courtoom the of each single on a fair process influences," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes head defender. 
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the colonel supreme court, showed past week the proposals per decree shortly and conclusively back when he said, that the new media would become "carefully controlled," and that there would be no proof, that the jury had been driven of passions. 
Yet that was not with security yet the last word in this thing. 
For decades court objections assessed that the reporting lets arise over famously notorious cases doubt about the fairness of a process. 
In its historic decision of 1966, the colonel court of the United States canceled the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an Osteopathen out of Cleveland, that his wife should have killed, and said in its decision that there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtoom" because of the new media. 
Many one believes that the TV series and the feature film is based "on the flight" on this crime. 
Some lawyers say, court objections, which Mr. Later observe Hayes convictions a half century, could follow the argument that new rules became necessary, around the communication ways out of the courtoom, that at present the if Dr. Sheppard yet unimaginable were, to regulate. 
"It gives a good reason, over the influence of the new media in processes, that of a wide public pursues become, disturbed to be," said John J. Donohue III, professor at the Stanford Law School, that the death penalty in Connecticut examined. According to its report it arbitrarily is imposed. 
Professor Donohue said, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea, more fairly could make that the restriction of an immediate communication out of the courtoom the processes. 
The Twitter matter is only one of many, that the lawyers of Mr. Hayes represent in order to discuss on years and therefore a conviction out hesitant. 
The defenders maintain for example also that Mr. Hayes already before convicted been be could when judge Blue had not permitted them to test the reactions of potential Juroren in that one showed them during the Jurorenauswahl ghastly crime scene photos. 
Some of the Juroren said, photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke Petit, 48 years, and its TÃ¼chter, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, would have fulfilled it with abhorrence. 
The defenders say, they would question argue also the constitution temperance of the death penalty constitution, and that the judge had exchanged falsely a Juror, that a critic of the district attorney's office had been, and that he would have exerted more inadmissibly manner pressure on the judgment, than he the unorthodox decision encountered had to place the jury over the weekend freely. 
The Juroren were not isolated. 
Yet its arguments over the influence of the detailed reporting over the process the largest interest stretches perhaps on. 
In a judgment attack, that submitted it past month, they assessed that the case had dominated the messages in Connecticut and was discussed during the campaign for the office of the governor and for the American senate of the candidates. 
They argued that the new media would have newly kindles continuously the flames of the emotions over the case. 
"One every day press of the Medienpiepser, cameras and reporter outside of the courtoom," wrote the lawyers, "still has one previously in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide not yet experiences." 
Your focal point on the reporting through Twitter is controversial. 
In interviews said some journalists, that the statement, these direct messages would be aufwieglerischer as reports, that are returned slower, a technology hostile view would be, that would become impoverished the reporting over future processes. 
Yet some lawyers said, Appelationsgerichte would be confronted often with the argument, social and technical variations needed the Adaptation through the courts. 
Mr. Hayers lawyers reinforce this statement. 
In its objection, they had references to the decision of the colonel court of 1966, in which the conviction was canceled by Dr. Sheppard based on the reporting, and made clearly that the new media require new rules. 
"These cases," wrote it, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
