Police uses in China becomes softer 
How an education officer seaweed Shenbin stepped over a municipal place, reviewed its nervous subordinates and delivered at the same time with military Authorit채t and softened voice commands. 
It wanted that its feminine members of the Chengguan - China of guard robust of the municipal order, feared and despises for its arbitrary Razzien and its cliff to the force - impress the spectators. 
"Just stand"! 
"View straight ahead"! 
"Shows them," whispered it them to, "like pretty girls so are"! 
Four girls, hardly the teenager age outgrow, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pairs of pants stood tightly. 
Pumps black four couples stood in straight row. 
Four orderly hats sat perfectly on that with blue knows roved bows of held hair. 
"For me see it on the average out of," notes Mr. seaweed derogatory. 
"Models are pretty." 
Several governments already tried to polish the image of China city inspectors up. 
In a city, all new applicants must have a high diploma. 
The province Guangdong introduced an illuminating blue uniform instead of the gray green. 
Wuhan in means China replaced force by Niederstarren: 2009 circled reports according to 50 officials a not regular set up snack vehicle and stared the operator on until this packed up after a half hour and left the place. 
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, basically would like to change the image. 
Since 2003,13 women have reinforced the municipal police patrols. They were selected special based on its appearance, its good figure and its youth. 
They should yield the grobschl채chtigen police one, lend feminine aspect. 
Yet unfortunately it would hardly succeed also Scarlett Johansson to improve the bad picture, that the Chinese of these city commands have. 
With right, so the critics. 
Unlike the police these officials may the municipal laws only with the help of of fines or other administrative punishments put through. 
Yet the Chinese media show routinely another picture. 
In January 2008 thrashed official in the province Hubei a spectator too deaths when this filmed it with its mobile phone at the same time, how they struck down a protest action against a M체llhalde. 
In the last year, a training handbook of that was stolen Beijing official and was published on the Internet. Therein is described how offenders can be beaten without bloodshed. 
This year a Shanghaier water melon dealer suffered brain injuries after a melee with five officials. 
A video-game abounding before force that out of the Internet downloaded will can, shows trained officials in China in an attack on street dealer. 
"Chengguan makes the government anxiety," lamented the national newspaper China Daily in the last year, after further controversies regarding the tactics. 
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough cleansing." 
Skeptics find the present extension for clearly insufficiently. 
When the Distrik sought in October eight feminine recruits per notice, an Editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked the question whether the women would have real tasks or should serve only as an optical diversion. 
Probably both. 
According to job advertisement, women in the age of 18 to 22 with good figure and "harmonious features" were sought. 
They should be above average large - over 1,5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 customs. 
The employment ratio ends with reaching of the 26th year of life. 
Loud the official the activity is for women over 25 physical to strenuous. 
"The most important is its image," indicated an unbenannter district official in that more or less governments web page Rednet. com. 
"Whether the candidates get the job, hangs first of its external appearance off, such as size, weight, features, etc." 
Then temperament and "internal qualities" come. 
"Feminine Chengguan are like flower vases," it said and joined thereto, "but in addition still have it other duties." 
Zheng Lihua, deputy leader of the city administration of the district, would not like this description beipflichten 
Admitted however that in China size specification in job advertisements is not for sex both kinds of unorthodox. 
The same applies to uniform features. 
Whether that is to be equated with good appearance, is disputed in China. 
But people with handicap or physical distortions do not need to apply himself. 
"We can here unfortunately no lame or hump-backed utilize," so Mr. Zheng. 
"Your image would not be good." 
Liu Yi, that on the Baoguang place nearly a cloister patroliert, is 22, has to be apple baked and a probably formed mouth. 
You perceived not as sexist that so large value on its appearance put becomes. 
Find you "see, I in this uniform sexy out of"? asks it with ironic view. 
Your colleague with the dimples, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments on, "we have the task, the image of the city to represent." 
According to your statements they do not regret the short attitude because they would have more ambitious career plans to scare away than simple only dealer through the lanes, in order to prevent from it the Gesch채ftemachen. 
Every morning Been concerned that would rove with ca. twelve street dealers, who try to sell on foot or on the bicycle if possible many rolls and Tofugerichte before they are hunted away. 
"Mr. Wang, disappear here please." 
"We already so often said" that to you! explains Frl. Xu a dealer who was implored on foot and had let at the same time its noodle kitchen of secured on a bicycle carts temporarily in the sting. 
According to the officials, the activity is rather monotonous as strenuous. 
"It is almost every day that," explains Huang Jing, 20 that in the leisure time sales and marketing being studies. 
"All routine." 
A reason is, were that the feminine officials that the dealer not how its masculine colleagues may confiscate. 
They can threaten offenders only therewith to report it its masculine superior. 
That should protect it against public Anfeindungen, which officials in China frequently are stopped. 
This year rioted hunderte inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of the province Yunnan, after the rumor circulated, Chengguan official would have killed a dealer. 
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan official were injured in the nightly occurrence, were overturned 14 government vehicles or set on fire. 
Xindu remained of such force riots previously spared. 
Yet unrest is not to be excluded. 
Only two blocks removes of the quiet Baonguang place, at that the feminine officials this morning patroulierten, met itself over 50 people at a street corner. 
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, that was repaired contrary to the directions on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop. 
The owner screamed Zeter and Mordio. 
After 15-minute hesitation, the officials with grim face cleared themselves the way to its vehicles and went with the motorcycle and its owner away. 
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the masculine would rove, remained back. At the same time it turned around its white name sign in order to remain anonymous. 
How its colleague the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supporting role. 
Yet they were not educated therein to present a clean image. 
"Sometimes we go verbal before." 
"Sometimes however also physically," explains Mr. Li soberly. 
"Most time the people with the dispute catch at."
