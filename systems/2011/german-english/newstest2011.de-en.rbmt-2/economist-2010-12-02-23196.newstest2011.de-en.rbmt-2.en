Weak applause for China 
Taiwan voter approach slowly a narrower connection to the mainland. 
What does Taiwan of its large brother hold on the far side of the strait? 
On the 27th of November, those opened are themselves more than 7.5 Mio voters, 70% of all entitled to vote, in order to select in the five city districts mayor and Stadträte. This is appraised as a wide estimation of the Präsidenten Ma Ying jeou. 
Through the construction of pioneering business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, is Ma itself a symbol figure for the relations to the mainland. Its politics persistently changed the relation to the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949. 
Ma existed the test, however only tightly. 
Although its Kuomintang party (KMT) places three of the five mayors, it received no majority of votes. 
Instead received the democratic progress party (DPP), the one larger independence of Taiwan advocates, almost 50% of the voices, the KMT received 45%. 
In a presidential election, this would have meant for Ma problems. 
Since its choice two years ago the percentage of votes of its party is around ca. Please 8%. 
For the first time, the DPP took in even together with the KMT into the Stadträte. 
During the choice, it came to the incidents usual in Taiwan such as truck convoy with Krawallmachern, flags swinging measure moves and only sparse clothed dancers. 
There was even the obligatory, mysterious murder attempt. 
Sean Lien, that son of Lien Chan and honor chairperson of the KMT a speech held at the eve of the choice on a KMT candidate 
As it a man out of the quantity into the face shot. Lien was wounded and a next spectator killed. 
Bizarre manner is not clear whether the protection Lien wanted to kill or wanted to enclose a dispute with the candidate. 
Independently therefrom the attack has according to Tsai Ing whom, whom leader of the DPP, who impairs choice and the DPP moved into a bad light, what gave the KMT more voices. 
Possibly China was the largest winner of the campaign. 
Remarkable manner was not brought up for discussion the relations to the mainland. 
Instead the candidates debated social dwellings and the creation of jobs over plans to. 
The Taiwanese of dear its factual independence and reject China military threat. 
For this reason the KMT places its relations to the government in Beijing not gladly into the foreground. 
Yet this time also the DPP avoided to stir up the anti Chinese feelings to very. 
It reacted therewith to the new consciousness that Taiwan economy cannot survive without China. 
Ma for its part would like to be confirmed let that the majority of the Taiwanese advocates its China politics. 
The government in Beijing will pursue further its strategy, Taiwan with economic stimuli into the partnership back attractive. 
China sent immediately a negotiator after Taipeh in order to prepare a summit meeting to investment security and medical collaboration. 
Certainly it wishes also a political integration. But the most important first. 
It waits therewith rather until after the presidential elections 2012. 
The DPP newly invented itself in the meantime. 
Two years ago it strongly was weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui bian sat because of corruption in the prison. 
During its presidency of 2000 to 2008, it entered vehemently for the absolute independence. 
Yet under Tais regency, a new generation of moderated politicians and the DPP developed fights around the voices of the employed and the youth. 
Tsai found large approval as a presidency candidate of the DPP, like Su Tseng chang under Chen. 
Your party does now all in order to show that also it is in a position to construct narrow relations to Beijing. 
Tsai plans an idea smith as a contact point between the DPP and China. This prefaces however unprejudiced discussions. 
Tsai explained publicly that its party would offer a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas of hasty approach at China. 
Chen seems annoys over this change very. 
Of its cell out of it, that candidates of the DPP done would have better on that, explained to insist on Taiwan independence. 
It requested the pragmatist Su even to forgo the presidency candidacy. 
Also without Chens interference, the DPP has trouble to select its possible candidate. 
The KMT will have to subject itself an own even analysis. 
Mas values are bad, in spite of the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead its campaign without it. 
The main reasons for its unpopular-ness seem to be unemployment and the always further scissors between arm and empire. 
According to statements of a KMT speaker, he will be reshape cabinet as well as the local arrangements. 
The strong appearance of the DPP lets assume that Taiwans advocated only restricted a rapprochement. 
Simultaneously most Taiwanese see the economic collaboration with China as unavoidable. 
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "gives it already no back more."
