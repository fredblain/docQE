I wish my successors a quieter year, had it than we in Farmet 
The victory euphoria was removed quickly of the consequences of the crisis. 
Thanks to its determination, Farmet has the worst behind itself. 
The price for the first rank of the competition Vodafone firm of the year in the past year Karel of the firm proprietors of Farmet took toward. 
The jury lauded at that time the exertions, with which it tramped out of the small tool building in Skalice a business out of the ground, that makes hundreds of millions of revenues. 
"I can say, that this assessment not only me even, but rather also all my colleagues encourages and our self-confidence in the battle with the competition strengthened has," says the preceding year winner. 
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet, the effort stood to do something useful. 
And as then the country as a compensation for that of the communists, property seized offered a small workshop to the lease to its father Karel, hesitated rush he not long, let its career in the firm, in which he was busied until there, and established with a couple of comrade of its father an own firm to the manufacture of plastic tubs. 
Short time they later began to concentrate on vegetable oil presses. 
Within 18 years, they climbed to the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in entirely central Europe. 
But first through the success in the mentioned competition and its Medialisierung, it did not enter also into the consciousness of the specialty public. 
"Not only, that our customers the brand Farmet now clearly more intensive perceive, also our foreign partners began the circumstance, with a firm collaborate to can, that in its country the utmost success obtained has, larger value to ascribe," says Karel. 
The past year stood in Farmet to be sure not only in the sign of the victory euphoria.

And straight 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool building products. 
The crisis, that at that time yet fewer shook the citizens, but rather above all business, reached just its highpoint - many firms were forced to adjust its investment projects and to restrict the purchase of new arrangements and technologies. 
We not naturally also were able to escape" "this situation. 
"The revenues concerned 40 percent back, we must the production restrict and even to releases grasp," explains Karel 
A viable business must seize sometimes also such unpopular measures. 
It succeeded however to get the situation into the handle and to hold the firm in the black numbers, also if with slighter profits, than before the crisis. 
With one, the business was not willing to make cuts - in the investments into the research and development. 
"Out of the subsidy constructed we a researches and training center, we strengthened our presentation on international fairs and acquired head prices in native displays," says. 
Everything witnesses therefrom that we overcame the crisis. 
The revenues grow again and with them also the amount of new colleagues. 
"The new victor wish I much joy in the victory - however in quieter atmosphere," lets align Karel.
