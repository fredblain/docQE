Inspectors in the twilight 
The European groceries authority Efsa would be infiltrates of the industry experimenting with gene plants. 
This accusation the expert group formulates now test biotech that understands itself as an independent institute for the consequence estimation of the biotechnology. 
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have it well documents," said test biotech boss Christoph Then in Munich on Wednesday. 
Let the leader of the Efsa expert group for genetically changed plants, Harry Kuiper, and a further Efsa expert have been for years also at the lobbyist association Ilsi under contract. 
That becomes of groups such as Monsanto, fumble or pays Bayer. 
Kuiper had cooperated authoritatively on the Efsa test directions for gene plants and stand therewith in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then. 
Let the Efsa directions be paragraph by paragraph word same with position paper the Ilsi and deceive therewith the handwriting of the industry that is supposed to be controlled actually by the authority in the Italian Parma. 
Let it be already the second time that test biotech would criticize an interest collision. 
So let a high-ranking Efsa manager be most young without levies or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and would have therewith the sides changed. 
Also the central german broadcast (MDR) had revealed recently personnel connections between controlling EU authority and industry lobby, what clairaudient made the environment federal bureau just as as EU parliamentarian. 
The Efsa can recognize meanwhile no conflict of interest. 
Fall back on all serious data, also on such of the industry as long as they would be of high professional quality, is named it in an attitude. 
Of the experts, who work for Efsa do not demand that they have no contacts to the industry. 
They would have to disclose this however. 
Kuiper clears its work for that internationally Life Sciences institutes (Ilsi) in the USA. 
This designates itself as a neutral forum for experts out of science, industry and politics - among other things to the risk estimation for biotechnology without lobby order. 
In the thing, independent experts such as Then criticize that genetically changed plants are allowed presently with no feeding attempt with animals and the reaction would not be tested by gene plants on environment influences. 
"We want to know, what for example genetically changed corn on the field makes," says Then. 
Let it be the present practice to not to test solely isolated proteins, but the entire gene plant, what would deliver no reliable results. 
Does "if one not seek the risks, how one should find" it then?, asks Then accusing. 
That sees also Angelika Hilbeck so. 
The scientist has searched since 1994 in genetic engineering and is presently at the technical university Zurich active. 
The industry tries on this zone such as in the USA also in Europe now more and more to influence or to discredit critical scientists. 
There is therefore hardly yet researcher who would not be entangled with groups. 
Studies critical for business not as a rule would be published. 
"The industry controls the security research," maintains Hilbeck.
