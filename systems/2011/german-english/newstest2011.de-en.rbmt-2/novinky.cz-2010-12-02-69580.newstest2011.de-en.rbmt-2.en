Pilsner ground fund - arrests of the police in a public announcement 
In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen undertook the Antikorruptionspolizei in the last days arrests. 
At the same time the local medium entrepreneur and real estate agent Lubo G was taken away. of the detectives in handcuff. 
This had tried nominally to manipulate a just taking place public competition to the settlement of restitution claims so that the plots of land offered in the competition fell to a concrete interested party. 
This should have paid Lubo G. for that a half million. 
"At this time can I only confirm, that the police a person because of the offense of deceitful wheelings and dealings in a public competition pursues," said Antonie Zelená, the boss of the Pilsner district attorney's office of the newspaper "Právo," further details could it with regard to the running investigations do not grant. 
The 46-year-old entrepreneur later became release 24 hours of the police again. 
On which manner was able to manipulate it the public competition, about that one only can speculate in view of the sparse official information. 
The speaker of the ground fund Lubomír cited had undertaken on the question relating to this of Právo, that police in the Pilsner branch of the ground fund actually arrests and this during a public competition. 
"It concerned a client and by no means around one our colleagues," concretized it. 
The public competition had woman according to the correct label "request to the making of the offer of claims to the transfer of plots of land in accordance with the ground law" and would take place in cases, in which several applicants interests in the offered plot of land share. 
"These people offer a higher value in the frame of the request its through the transmission to settling restitution claims, than the exclaimed plot of land value." 
"Corresponding to the offered claims becomes the sequence of the potential Erwerber determined, subsequently transfers the ground fund the plot of land to the person with the highest offer," explains the speaker of the fund. 
Luboš G. information was available obviously, who had registered on the request there and was there he even justified person, because he had bought himself a row of restitution claims, offered he on to a plot of land interest that he withdraws out of the competition. 
Obviously against a fat settlement. 
That would be also a sufficient explanation why it had in its arrest such one large cash amount with itself. 
Luboš G. had already all too good contacts to the Pilsner ground fund in the past. 
So he played also in the Causa of the earlier boss of the ground fund Václav Sankota a role that was pursued criminal, because he published into replacement restitutions plots of land, to which already location decisions were pleases become building intention. 
At that time Lubo G acquired more exactly said. of the ground fund for example also plots of land, that were intended for the building of public streets,, at the place where the building of the Zufahrtsmagistrale was planned to the business zone of Borské poles. 
Later it exchanged far exceeded this very favorably with the magistrate against a house directly in the historic center of the city, that the value of the plots of land. 
The city hall must at that time heavy heart small addition in order to not to endanger the building intention through the blockage of the plots of land.
