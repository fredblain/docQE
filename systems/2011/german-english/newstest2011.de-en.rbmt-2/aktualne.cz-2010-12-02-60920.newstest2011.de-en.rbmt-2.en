A tenant of Bakala: It heats to be sure in the oven - nevertheless pays higher rent 
An older placed under man leaves just the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "of coal baron" Bakala, the largest private owner of rent dwellings in the Czech Republic. 
Under the arm a portfolio with three new leases to three dwellings: for the own and of the dwellings its daughters and its son, the verbüßt just one prison sentence. 
All three became in the frame of that so-called. "Deregulation" just the rent increases. 
Instead of of 3500 crowns month rent the son in the next year should shell out for a 2-Zimmer-Wohnung 2-Zimmer-Wohnung room 2-Zimmer-Wohnung dwelling with kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns. 
"And there gives it in the dwelling not even fluently warm water and heat must one in a simple coal oven," types annoys he with the finger on the new lease of the son, to whose signature he has an authority. 
"But what - signed have I," declared it half upsets and half resigns. 
The citizen union BytyOKD. cz, that designated the new rent conditions as "incorrect and immoral," to sign advises the tenants, the new contracts simply not and to wait to the 7th of December, at which they thought to publish some instructions, how one advances against such contracts. 
But the man declines only. 
"One says this, that other that," makes it a dark face. 
The region Ostrava becomes laboratory" so the large "deregulation. 
After New Year this deregulation will be forthcoming most rent dwellings in the Czech Republic, whose tenants pay previously no market-driven rent. 
Concluded therefore to visit this "laboratory" personally. 
The RPG waiting room in is one of four in the region Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning this Tuesday breaking full. 
Immediately next to the door, the Bodyguards of a security agency and with it a proclamation device stand. 
"Would rent 2011," illuminates a special key field on the Touchscreen. 
Shortly touched and already spits the device a number slip of paper from. 
Hardly we decoded and already chirps the number "157" it on the large display at the cover of the waiting room. 
A half second one is later at the row. 
Somewhat later an older married couple enters the waiting room in order to ask about the rent, but the onset in the waiting room counts evidently not at all the new rent. 
Most people are here, to solve around the usual problems - repair proposals, insurance matters and similar. 
From in the middle of November, the envelopes with the new leases flutter in the region Ostrava most tenants of the altogether 44,000 dwellings of the portfolio the RPG into the mailboxs. 
The RPG Byty strikes them in the letter a rent increase of ca. 15 to 38 percent before. 
The special switch for the new rents in the client center is opened for the 18th of November. 
"The action runs somewhat over a week, that is, that is first the beginning," answer the ladies behind the switch after a moment hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist. 
The deregulation and Bakalas former miner dwellings are a disruptive subject. 
Before the choices, the parliament vice president coming out of Ostrava Lubomír Zaorálek by that had taken up this subject rather lauthals, no wonder that the newspapers are full therefrom today. 
I want "twenty years of them a new floor." 
"Not even ne besch. They were able to exchange WC glasses," makes itself the from the outset mentioned man air. 
Until now stand the colleagues according to above all pensioner at the switch in order to convince itself whether they really receive the promised rent reduction, that promises them RPG, if they sign the special offer on time. 
Into the enjoyment of a February rent reduced to the half, also the other tenants should come, who sign the new lease to the 15th of December. 
Until now, "deregulation is anything but switch" in however, overburdened of demands. 
"Of the yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because of here," appreciate the switch officials. 
RPG offers at the same time both on its web pages and blackboards necessarily appears individual rent agreements, where it. 
If the rent parties should not agree however on the new rent, it would be determined of an independent court. 
"That should no threat be, but rather is as an information about the only possible and totally legitimate legal procedure to understand," explains RPG on its web pages. 
"Here goes no one before court," means gives one of the colleagues of RPG Byty and a man on the street before the client center its at least partially quite. 
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pensions, therefrom remain me 5,000 for the meal over, where should I the money for a court dispute take here," means it. 
Then becomes the employees yet unsteady. 
See" "time. 
"Mr. Zaorálek says them over the media, it should not sign and so wait the people yet from," gives it to consider. 
The regulated rent ends in the largest part of the Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty is the rent increase an economical necessity. 
"The existing height of the rents passes not even to the maintenance of the accustomed fund out of," argues Pavel climatesš, the director of the dwelling portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - straight the neglect criticized by the raised tenants of the dwelling fund is in the opinion of the home owner the main reason for the rent increase. 
While RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010 was able to invest out of the taken in rents four billions into the dwellings, in the four years of 2011to 2014,5.2 billions should be it. 
On the großformatigen LCD display at the cover vis-à-vis the easy chair in the waiting room of emerge in between again and again a couple of information red illuminating. 
"The rent increases in 2011 around 15% and fewer concern 31,200 dwellings, that is more than 90% of the dwellings of RPG." 
"Always means this at most 7.50 CZK per square meter and month," is to be read on the LCD monitor. 
Only in 400 dwellings out of the portfolio of RPG, the rent raises itself by 38 percent. 
"In these cases concerns it the increase of extremely slight rent prices of 19.66 CZK per square meter," argues RPG. 
In 2600 dwellings, the rent in the next year remains on same height. 
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not drive the rents jerky into the height, but rather results gradually within four and eight years. 
What more - the business a further obligation imposes itself: The business wants to stick all revenue out of the rent increase (see chart) again into the dwellings, above all in warmth savings - into new windows and into the thermal insulation. 
But - in priority these should benefit that people, who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
