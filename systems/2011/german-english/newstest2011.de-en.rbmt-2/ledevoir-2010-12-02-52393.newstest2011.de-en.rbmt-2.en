Government bond for the acceptance of eXcentris 
To be involved the Quebecer government, that was requested by the Société Angus as well as the business Parallèle in addition, financially in the acceptance of the movie theater complex eXcentris, explains itself with a collaboration agreed, however only in form of a competitive loan. 
The developer company Angus as well as the business Parallèle, that had hoped for itself a contribution in height of seven million dollars of the ministry of education and cultural affairs to the acceptance of the Daniel Langlois of belonging movie theater complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint Laurent, in order to entrust this again of its actual cineastischen function, receive evidently not, what they demanded. 
The government accepted to be sure to involve itself in this thing, to be sure to its own conditions. 
Instead of the expected contribution, the Quebecer government offers rather a loan in slighter than the initially hoped for height, that could call an existence capable solution to advantageous conditions into life, at least in the opinion of that out of the national rumor kitchen entnehmbaren sources. 
A first action plan as well as an inquiry after 12.8 million had been rejected already last spring by the Quebec, the favor petition was corrected since that again sum moderate downward. 
A suggestion together with an action plan became already of the president of the "Société de développement of the entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, at minister St Pierre sent, that leads the document eXcentris. 
Several days ago it had approach let it a last special report. 
The counter-proposal of the cabinet was transmitted the SODEC however on Wednesday. 
Parallèle and Angus have now to the 31st of December time to answer on this. 
In any case the premise of the country contribution seems pressed become really the side to be. 
Let's call in memory that the Quebecer owner partnership of the movie theaters and movie theater complexes had resisted itself against a direct country investment to the support of the acceptance of eXcentris, in that it proposed the argument, the minister of culture would have us no financial aid for real estate projects there to perform, that it would not have approach let also other movie theater halls. 
Several other market participants of the segment sued for however in contrast to that substantial, economic assistance. 
Movie theater boss Daniel Langlois had after the own financed construction of the movie theater over for ten years under large difficulties the author movie theater in the accomodations of its movie theater complex presented, what could justify the exception position on the part of the treasury. 
The lack of movie theater halls that independent films show, is knew in Montreal more than obvious, and eXcentris to hold its clientele in the pole. 
The Société Angus as well as the business Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the tip, head for on their part a privately financed Campagne, of which they hope for itself a sum 700,000 $ in order to boost the acquisition. 
Since the spring 2009 only a single linen has continued therewith to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle. 
It is check goal of the future Erwerber, that three movie theater halls at the 27 February next year with the demonstration the very gelungenen of film of Xavier Beauvois "the to open et of the dieux" newly. 
Christian Yaccarini however did not recall the newspaper "Le Devoir" and ignored one, what it and its group of the downward corrected suggestions hold, that one made them.
