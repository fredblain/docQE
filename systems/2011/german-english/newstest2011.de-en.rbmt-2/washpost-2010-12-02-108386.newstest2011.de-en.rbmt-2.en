Can courtesy connect the separating? 
After a campaign at insult words and negativity, this week broke out little courtesy in Washington. 
Is it that grandmas of a real bipartisan cooperation or a moment of the illusion before one returns quickly again to the battle of the parties in the capital? 
The meeting on Tuesday between president Obama and tip of the congress brought itself no breakthrough in the large questions, with that one during that so-called. "Lame duck session," that session had to busy at the end of a government period, in which no more decisions are encountered. 
After all that, what one hears, was to be reigned it neither a polite discussion between two different sides another notice of its divided responsibility, but rather sooner an empty episode one Punktesammelns party laughed. 
The public meeting of the deficit commission of the president on Wednesday likewise was civilized, in spite of which political differences that exist between the members further. 
It seems to be clearly that a narrow interaction lets emerge over a period of months a mutual respect, that disguises the ideological crevice, that further the members separates from one another. 
That is hardly enough in order to maintain, would be opened a new era of the cooperation. 
Both sides are now in a test phase - in that the one of the other sign of the cooperations and willingness to compromise calls for while one himself tries to weigh the boundaries of the public opinion and the patience of the voters after a renewed party warfare. 
Therefore the meeting on Tuesday itself and its estimation were limited through the participants to a minimum at demands or accusation. 
The philosophical differences between Obama and the republicans are too large and too deep when that one could expect a fast change of the atmosphere, that prevailed in the past two years. 
Equal whether it concerns taxes, contributions, health or Anwartschaften, both sides are removed for miles and miles from one another. 
In the end the November choice agreed Washington at least for short time mild. 
"No question, the intonation has itself changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government who works now for the "Ethics and Public Policy center." 
"That is unavoidable after choices. 
Choices awake party would laugh passions that die out again. 
And that is well so." 
In some questions, especially in which, that on the order of the day of the "lame session" duck stand, have republican and democrats hardly another choice to find when a solution." 
Bushs tax declines end end of the year, and no one advocates that. 
Both sides want to find a way, would receive around some or quite everyone too, would be it now temporary or durable. 
Just as a compromise is to be expected regarding the increased unemployment compensations if also only, because the republicans cannot afford it, that one believes, the favored tax declines for the empires while they deny unemployed workers a support. 
After the meeting on Tuesday in the white house the optimism climbed, duck ratify can himself that one in these questions during the "lame session" of some and simultaneously also the new START contract. 
Yet William glass tone of the Brookings Insitution warns, duck lead must that a successful collaboration in urgent questions of the lame session" not compelling to a durable collaboration of the parties if the new 112th congress is convened in January. 
Instead, so says it, is a phase of the disagreeing more probable, perhaps even indispensably. 
"After the things, that done will must, done are, becomes this short-term psychology in confrontation turn over," said it. 
Wehner is leads also sceptically - and this scepticism becomes of many divided - the courtesy to true cooperation. 
"I see much, what of today at until 2012 happens, when before battle, or shadow-boxing, for the head event of 2012," said it. 
The reasons for this have much with the presentation of the new republican majority in the white house to do and with the tea parties voters, who were serviceable its development. 
How concerned the republican leaders like to be also about that, that they must know to highly poker, it, that they must try, its promises to sink the editions of the government and to set, to keep the health reform except power. 
These party lines become already in the first reactions regarding the recommendations of the deficit commission clear, which include a tax reform and the raising of some taxes as well as the raising of the retirement age and the sinking of the country editions. 
One of the most difficult jobs received the deputy chairpeople Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles in Washington and have, pressed in accordance with its own estimation, so very on that to set the deficit question on the public order of the day that these can be ignored no longer. 
But they need within the commission of 14 the 18 voices in order to make its plan to the recommendation official and it fight very in order to come also only into the vicinity of this number. 
The largest resistance is found in the selected representatives of the group because in finance questions, at least today, only little latitude or little sympathy is for compromises. 
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the white house and the republicans in the congress. 
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party collisions if the republicans Obama followed with respect to the country household, that demand taxes and the health system, later then of a phase of larger zweiparteilicher cooperation. 
What lead becomes to this change? 
The public opinion. 
It is proved that, in spite of the bias of the current choice, that majority of the Americans yet always wishes for, that both parties together work. 
If confrontation leads into a dead end, how it happened to 1995, both parties must pay attention painstakingly to the public reaction. 
He, who is convicted also always for losing, will must change the course and seek the compromise. 
That likes to be in the deed an optimistic visibility manner. 
Bias and polarization are today larger than in the middle of the '1990's, and they seem a larger ideological crevice between Obama and the congresses republicans to its as at that time between President Bill Clinton and the republicans. 
Simultaneously the activists of both parties 2010 see as a pure prologue for a choice by far more long-range at consequence 2012. 
So seen likes the courtesy, that is displayed this week, of many Americans welcomes become. 
Yet it will require very much on both sides more effort to find a joint denominator in the questions, that separate both as always from one another.
