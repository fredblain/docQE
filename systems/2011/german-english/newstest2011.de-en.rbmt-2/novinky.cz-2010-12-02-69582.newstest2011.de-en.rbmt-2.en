Czech children betrinken with Fernet and around beer out is itself - it causes simply too slowly 
Fernet, around and vodka, exceptionally also once a good whiskey that one stole the father out of the house bar. 
Those are the drinks after whose enjoyment drunk Czech teenagers must need treated become under fifteen most frequently. 
Children, who must have a good sleep its tom-cat repeatedly in the hospital, are no exception. 
This follows out of the experiences of physicians, who are confronted with similar cases in the reception of the child departments by clinics. 
"Beer or wine are entire out of the fashion because it lasts simply too long, until one is" drunk. 
"The current trend is unambiguously hard alcohol," said Právo Pelikán, the superintending doctor of the child department in the mittelböhmischen clinic. 
"Whiskey if it succeeds to steal the father a bottle out of the house bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka. 
"Vodka has the advantage, that one it with Juice mix can, smells it not so strongly," explains the superintending doctor. 
The speaker of the faculty hospital Motol Eve Jurinová gives it quite. 
"Most frequently it concerns Fernet or around." 
"That is the current alcohol trend, nominally at elementary schools." 
"Isolated concerned it also Slibowitz, that one of at home brings," led woman Jurinová on. 
According to superintending doctor Pelikán thirteen or fourteen four ten-year drinkers in the hospitalization are a long time no exception appearance. 
Before the clinic in at that it for this year has worked, was it for ten years in the paediatrics department of the hospital Motol active where the rescue vehicles students drunken delivered from far and wide. 
"A girl had to become" four times hospitalisiert. 
"Your career began it at 12 years of age when they the first time with 3.5 Promille alcohols in the blood and yet in addition in combination with" Extase" delivered became," described the physician an especially heavy case. 
"You was in the display terrain in would getšovice on any dance party." 
"The interesting at the same time was, that it its mother not at all strangely occurred, that its daughter 48 hours not home came," is surprised the superintending doctor. 
Just the missing interest of the parents or its incredible tolerance in the activating with the own offsprings applies as one of the primary cause to the growing alcoholism of children. 
Around a real dependence in the true sense of the word, it does not go according to expert with children. 
"Under alcoholism, a long-time chronic dependence of the alcohol is to be understood including all phenomenon of therewith related and is that at these children not the case." 
With which, that enjoy repeatedly alcohol, mostly a negative informally social Background is characteristic," explains superintending doctor Pelikán. 
The speaker of the hospital Motol, woman according to Jurinová, were instructed until in the middle of November approximately forty drunk children into the local department for child medicine and youth medicine. 
However only the cases with heavy alcohol poisoning that made a hospitalization required go in into the statistics. 
Drunk children, who are brought after ambulatory treatment by the parents or if necessary by the police home, are not registered. 
Except the cases, in which children only once so a bottle hard liquor in the school bench finish gives it in the opinion of of Mr. Pelikán three seasonal amplitudes on which hundred percent reliance is: Whale pure g sharp night, new year's eve and the end of the school year. 
"The last-named for two reasons - either out of grief because of the bad testimony or out of joy on the vacation." 
"In the whale pure g sharp night have I also already seven drunk children all at once in the reception experiences," emphasizes doctor Pelikán. 
A drunk child, who spends the night under medical supervision, is paradoxically better at it when a child who has to fight at the next day only with an unpleasant tom-cat. 
The headache at the morning after that, that stem of the Dehydration and of the glucose deficiency, one can banish in the hospital namely with a flüssigkeitsspendenden infusion with glucose and nutrient, that are missing the organism. 
"You are unambiguously better at it, for after the" lovely" experience in the evening, rouse somewhat blow does it with good mood, without that somewhere." 
"You are only something confuses about that, where it are," clears doctor Pelikán on whereby he ruins the patient sometimes at least through it the good mood, in that he itemizes them the costs, that it will cost the treatment. 
For the carrier with the rescue vehicle and the night in an acute bed come good and gladly on a couple hesitated thousand crowns. 
"There and again have I that as an upbringing means uses, if I directly the children in the visit enumerated would have, what its drunkenness cost has and that it thoroughly happen can, that it once the entire vacation over work must, around the money for an only such party to earn," joined doctor Pelikán thereto. 
According to its opinion the health insurance companies do not grasp however after recourse procedure, around which to the healing of the trunkenen children necessary costs of the parents call for.
