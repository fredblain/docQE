Speech formed into a ball wins in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens 
The vehicles are improved with a software in real time. 
Since speech formed into a ball 2004 into the world of the formula 1 penetrated, is stamped its story in this selected universe of the speed of surprises and successes. 
Originally no one gave the novice notice and in spite of its steeply climbing development during the last seasons set all in the sprint in the last November on the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso. 
Without wanting to reduce the capacities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the achievement strength of the motor of Renault, is the "secret weapon," that the Multi Siemens speech formed into a ball into the hands put, and so that a victor team created, to the legend become. 
In reality concerns a high-performance software to the simulation of processes, that the German business 2007 too purposes, that don't have to do with car race, on which market brought. 
This information technology program designated as PLM was used for the development by assembly chains in factories in the entire world, energy works and high-precision instruments. 
Planned a loyal reproduction and/or simulation of a product or process becomes before this actually is constructed in order to avoid so mistake and superfluous costs. 
PLM has the development of the cameras of Canon for which airplanes of Sukhoi and the most famous utility vehicles of Nissan eases. 
Siegfried soot worm, leader of the industry department of Siemens, explains that with the use of this software in the formula 1 - factory speech formed into a ball "in few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements, that are assessed on the races and in the tests, sketch and carry out can. 
Soot worm carries out that 1992 in the race stables on the average ten technicians worked, who were able to introduce at most three or four improvements in a season. 
In speech form into a ball are team 180 highly qualified young people today busies. With high-performance EDP plants, they carry out analyses and all possible changes at the race vehicle. 
The Siemens manager explained, who would be PLM software in a position, all components of the race vehicles of speech formed into a ball to analyze and to improve, with exception of the motor, for which excluding Renault responsibly explains itself. 
The materials, that fuel, that changed become aerodynamics and the security elements. 
The changes can be transmitted thanks to progressive production plants and Hightech Autoklaven within less than 24 hours by the virtual reality of the simulator into the reality. 
The single boundary, that is set this crazy technical Perfektionismus, are the 40 million dollars, that may issue a formula 1 - team for its races in a season. 
Speech formed into a ball has its Hightech factory for the development and manufacture of its race vehicles in a 50 kilometer of London removed place constructed. 
It concerns two buildings, in which visits - especially of journalists - strongly limited. 
All what happens there, Top Secret is. 
The personnel comprises 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and mark Webber. 
But speech form into a ball true formula 1 - hero is doubtless the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell. 
Behind the enormous technological resources, that the Energy-Drink-manufacturer puts into the operation of its participation on the race track, further protagonists, whose support is inestimable and its familiarity same zero, hide. 
The Technologichef of the work, Steve Nevey, emphasizes that one five years ago yet was able to say, that the progress contributed in the area of F E for race vehicle with 50 percent to the victory and were responsible the pilots for the remainder. 
Today the share values changed. The technology settles 85 percent of the success while the contribution of the pilots is appreciated to 15 percent. 
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber never can be replaced by EDP, for they "are not predictable gladiators."
