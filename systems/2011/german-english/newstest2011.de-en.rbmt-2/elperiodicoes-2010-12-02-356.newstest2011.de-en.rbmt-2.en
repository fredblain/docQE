Sport and rule evasion 
Trick such as that of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax do not show invention spirit, but the will to go around a sanction. 
That supposedly of two players the actually Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) instigated from end in the game of the 23rd of November against the Ajax in the champions League led in addition that much ink was spilt about that, whether it did not concern an unsportsmanlike action or and whether possibly both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA. 
How generally well known is, a couple of minutes lost both player before playing (its team already unambiguously had won) time and played several fouls so that the arbitrator showed them the second yellow card. 
In this manner, and because that actually Madrid its group would cite, the prescribed sanction will fulfill both player in the next league game against the Auxerre and will get into so without cards into the next game phase. 
In the end the Disziplinarkommitee of the UEFA punished the trainer of the club, Jos√© Mourinho, with two games and the involved players with different cash amounts. 
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is no new practice, it is to be found sooner frequently in the world of the soccer. 
It so far is spread that it is part of the ethic - the unwritten, but in this sport followed rules -. 
Part of the arisen debate around the represented case is due on that that a team of the soccer club played actually Madrid (that in its hymns noble courage and honor purports and on other occasion its players for similar occurrences punished had) at the same time the leading role, and to the dramatization through Mourinho, that an episode added to its long story than a theatrical and provoking technician to more. 
In any case the debate revolves therefore whether this manner forbidden not specifically by the regulations contradicts the principles of the sport, that is, whether these actions represent a rule evasion. Actually this procedure complies with the regulations of the sport, seem to go around however its sense. 
In this matter, the damage caused the sport spirit should be examined. 
The sport spirit defended was the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect, that was not endangerd by these actions, for it no aggressive game. 
A further aspect of a clean game exists to avoid therein that the counteracting players pull an unjustified utility out of the against team. Also that did not happen. 
The paradoxical of the action of the player the actually Madrid is not that it does not correspond to that, what we understand normally under incorrect game or rule evasion, for the evasion of the rule secretly was performed in order to avoid a sanction, but rather it as noticeable as possible should be so that it is punished by the arbitrator. 
The players awaited and supposed the sanction joyful. 
Another question is, which type of advantage pulled the counteracting out of the intentional fouls. 
Here should be emphasized, brought became became was that the rivals neither into a more unfavorable situation yet advantages for the played game erheischt, for the obvious result of this action that the own team must further play with less players. 
It is also no useful strategy for the next game, for the club does not control then these players. 
The advantage exists obviously therein that the players begin the next game phase of the champions League without cards, that could participate threaten hers in a future game. 
But it concerns a long-term advantage uncertain to a certain degree because the team could eliminate sometime also. Moreover the players with this procedure receive a sanction and go eliminating in the second card cycle over, in that it because of card accumulation with a card less than in the first cycle. 
Therewith it is not so clear whether it concerns really an advantage. 
In the end are not directed such procedures at the sport spirit, to which also strategic decisions belong in order to pull an utmost utility out of the directions. 
In this case, the players wanted to go around wanted to select no sanction (that would be actual an unambiguous case of rule evasion), it sooner when they subject itself to this. 
They made a strategic decision without avoiding a punishment or to flee from its. 
Although the boundary is smudged between creativity and rule environment, I believe that it concerns in this matter a clear case of creativity. 
I have the impression that the polemics emerged as a result of of two factors: Because it concerned two same obstruction ends, and because of the type of the provoked rule transmission. 
The damage, that was added by these actions to the principles of the sport, is less ethicaler than a rather aesthetic type.
