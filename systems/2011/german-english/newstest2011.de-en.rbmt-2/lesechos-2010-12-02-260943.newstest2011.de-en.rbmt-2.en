World championship 2018-2022: the FIFA the from judge country appoints 
In bright excitement on the basis of corruption suspicion, the executive committee of the FIFA will appoint on Thursday the from judge countries of the world championships 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice with which the rank el threaten to press the technical criteria around influence as well as the Lobbying into the background. 
A thing is certain however: the edition of 2018 the king discipline of the FIFA becomes in Europe, its traditional stronghold, take place (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain Portugal, Netherlands Belgium). 
The edition 2022 then somewhat more exotically will fall out; the international soccer association hopes to be able to win after the premiere on the African continent into 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) for itself, or to pursue its agency in the United States or in the far east (Japan, south Korea) further. 
The list of the personalities, that to the delegation accompanying (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of the government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) the measure of the economical and political use of a world championship purports. 
The wheelings and dealings behind the scenery threaten to stop therefore to the last minute. 
To set up hard otherwise, a hierarchy of the candidates. 
After the evaluation report of the FIFA, offer the English, Spanish Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) document bessseren arguments as that of its competitors. 
But these deliberations will not be so serious for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees to the hour of the choice. 
The Sunday Times, that stood with the arrangement of the suspension of these members the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the uncovering, would have just as well the chances for its own country, cradle of the soccer, ruin can, expedite might that only a single time the world championship, namely 1966. 
The BBC had given that on Monday again breeding ground in that it had radiated a Dokumentarbericht, that three influential members of the Kommitees, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under gunfire takes. 
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and to bring the English responsibles in embarrassment, that had operated primarily an intensive Lobbying with David Cameron in this last week. 
The head of the government hopes for a reprint the of its predecessor Tony Blair gelungenen gambit that had obtained the organization of the Olympic games 2012 in 2005 for London. 
Would this intensive use suffice in order to revalue the image of England before the Kommitee again? 
Is nothing certain less, for the duo Spain Portugal it is not missing at trumps with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its soccer culture. 
Yet the economic and financial shadow sides both countries could soften its ambitions. 
The possible Repressalien against the Englishmen as well as the doubts over Solvenz of Spain and Portugal let increase the chances of Russia, that became in spite of its spaces in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, carrier) the serious outsider. 
Prime minister Vladimir Putin concluded however, that denounced frank hints on the accusation of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the voting" on the part of the Kommiteemitglieder. 
"One plasters it with dirt, one tries, it to compromise," cursed Putin. 
For 2022, the United States seem to be, strengthened through the experience of 1994, the logical favorites. 
First economical world power, seat of the FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to show a long list of advantages vis-à-vis Japan and south Korea, that set up separately a very beautiful project. 
Yet these new candidacys seem premature for two countries, that had organized with the contests in 2002. 
Another threat: the permission be named longed for by the FIFA of the World Cup 2026 for China, that let become the Asian chances for 2022 null and void. 
With Australia and Qatar, that had pulled all indices with the attendance of futuristic stadiums, the FIFA pursues place its expansion toward new areas, however both countries a larger risk, for certainty there. 
Australia could just as as have to suffer Japan and south Korea from that of the European countries akquittierten weakness of the TV rights (based on the time difference), the sensitive nerve of the FIFA.
