Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was priced surprisingly newcomer of the year in the category 
If you on inquiry of a president auftritts, the people will note it. 
President Obama itself asked Esperanza Spalding to appear in the ceremony on the occasion of the noble award ceremony 2009. Now the 26-year-old jazz bass and singer became over rake send would prove nominated for this year's Grammy in the category newcomer of the year. 
In view of the fact that Spalding is since its album "Esperanza" 2008 in the jazz scene already a celebrated star, appears the nomination a few unusually. Yet it corresponds to the Grammy rules, after which an artist became before publication of the album, with that he in the wide public well known, at most three albums published have may. 
Your ambitious album from the year 2010, "Chamber Music Society," is certainly a step forwards. And with its lively voice and a good feel for pop, radio and Latin Music, can compare one Spalding quietly to Norah Jones 2003, whose large success in 2003 comes as a jazz interpreter in this category of the nomination Spaldings at the next. 
Furthermore the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer trio in the category instrumental albums was nominated. This favorite of the critics experienced through it a giant success. 
To the competitors Iyers, "Moody 4B" of the learned Saxophonisten James belong among other things Moody and "Positootly" of the Keyboarders John Beasley. 
Trombone Shorty, a robbery united favorite out of New Orleans and frequent guest in HBOs "Treme," was priced in the category of contemporary jazz, in which otherwise sooner albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber are to be found. 
The Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received large group in the category probably earned attention. It steps therefore at against the Billy Childs Emsemble with its chamber jazz and the adventure funny Dave Hollands and be Oktett whose Life Ablum "Pathways" is a good example for a bass as a democratic Bandleader.
