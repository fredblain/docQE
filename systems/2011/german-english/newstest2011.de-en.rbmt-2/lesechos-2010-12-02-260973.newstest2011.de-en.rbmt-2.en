Euro: the EZB is forced to retain its purchases of country paper 
The last meeting of the Central Bank Council of the EZB in the past year should offer opportunity to show possibilities how one comes out out of the crisis, or announce at least the arrangement of a large amount at unorthodox measures of the monetary policy, that should come end of the year to its conclusion. 
The crisis of the European country indebtedness obligates, the central bank in Frankfurt not doubtless can afford it, also the current to forfeit more than a tense situation on the European loan markets, in order not to evoke its aggravation. 
The political costs at the same time would be by far too high. 
The French Treasury Minister Christine Lagarde had welcomed yesterday that of the EZB on the occasion of a press conference taken in, active roll for the benefit of the solution of the country household of indebtedness Europe. 
It did not venture to say whether it would be of the opinion, the central bank could do yet more, for example through boosting of its program of the purchases of government bonds. 
"I retain my deliberations for my European trade partners before (..) ." 
Jean Claude Trichet, president of the EZB had not appeared in Brussels on the day before on the occasion of its hearing through the economy shot and currency sow shot of the European parliament very eloquent regarding its intention, but rather is content fall out" itself rather to refer on that that the program of the purchases would become "continue to operate" of country paper on the secondary market and that we become "see in the meeting on Thursday, like the decisions. 
Only certainty: The EZB will leave its prime lending rate unchanged in 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009. 
In the practice, the bond purchases of the treasury were doubled of the EZB last week on approximately 1.35 billion Euro. 
And according to indiscretions of some dealers, it should yesterday new purchases at Irish and Portuguese country paper handled have. 
Altogether the central banks of the Euro system undertook since May 2010 purchases in the amount of 67 billion Euro. 
Under the dealers, the Antizipation of a following of the purchase course is disputed in no case (see side 29). 
The economists expect already no remarkable course change more. 
If the loan businesses of more than three months will have disappeared already out of the arsenal of the EZB, becomes to create make itself latter yet at the unrestricted money means reserves on freigiebige type, and to be sure over a period from a week to three months. 
The economists make grasped themselves already today on that that this measure will expand yet around some months. 
"I cannot introduce me that the EZB becomes" alter its program on essential type. 
"Otherwise would become it the risk go in, new tensions on short visibility to provoke," assumes Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank. 
"An exit 2011 planned, progressive for the course the first quarter seems me more probably," anticipates for its part Norbert Bräms, economist in Sal. 
Oppenheim. 
In the area of its interventions on the market of the country indebtedness "should the EZB such a purchase volume at bond upright hold, that the inert market animates," joins Norbert Bräms thereto. 
In consideration of the relevance of the exposed position the European banks on the markets of the country indebtedness in the Eurozone the central bank has no other choice when its presence to retain on the market. 
"You must to every price at the Steller of the lacking investors on the market step and so act, around the hasty enthusiasm over the yields paid at the weakest countries to prevent," attested yesterday an important bond proprietor. 
For if the interests rates prepare to the height flight, the countries would be prevented yet more on that to reduce its indebtedness or to stabilize also only. 
This is the price to the protection of the Euro.
