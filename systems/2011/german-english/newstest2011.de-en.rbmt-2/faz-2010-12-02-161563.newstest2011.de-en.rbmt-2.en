The ice university 
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for better seasons. 
The three-day mean course for future Gelatieri has the largest demand and visitor out of the entire world. 
From where does the entire ice come actually? 
Of the Gelatiere and of the Gelataio. 
The Gelatiere, in German somewhat ancient the ice confectioner, produces the cream after all rules of the Italian ice maker art. 
The Gelataio gets the ice cream with a Spachtel out of the cool counter, paints it into the waffle and sells it then. 
In order to know that, one doesn't have to go to Anzola Dell' Emilia in the province Bologna. 
But who yet more over ice do not know would like to come, that at the "Gelato University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani past. 
The manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 arranged the ice university so that the ice cream becomes that out of its machines everywhere high Italian ideal just. 
The three-day mean course for future Gelatieri has the largest demand and visitor out of all world. 
There are however also multi-day special courses all around the chocolate ice and practical courses in the company-internal ice hall. 
Somebody dream in the Midlife Crisis of a new career, others venture themselves simply once on the smooth ice of its vague longings. 
It are this time 40 participants out of 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia. 
Jacky, art teacher from California, the Slow-Food-movement loves and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial Ice Cream in the future. 
Anke from Berlin is management consultant and wants to bag after years in a nerve-racking job something own. 
Two young egyptians dream therefrom to open an ice hall in Cairo. 
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in its bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because its children love Italian ice cream. 
Maestro Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains first of all the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream to the participants. 
Decisively not only good taste is, but rather also the silky pliability and the good consistency. 
Luciano does not forget the creme hood of the national and generally southern superstructure in its training however also: "Italian Gelato is simple the best - and then is yet a lot of romanticism there." 
The first step to the manufacture seems very simply. 
Luciano tips over the reason ingredients milk, creme, dried milk, sugar and stabilizers into a large mix device, that heats with an electronic program of all on 85 degrees and cools off then immediately on four degrees. 
Then it loosens a rooster at the machine, and out a pasteurized white basis cream, base comes for all milk ice sorts. 
Immediately the instructor with questions is stormed: Can one produce ice cream only with natural materials without stabilizer? 
How can one let the own experiment desire free course? 
Luciano warns before that let lead be mistaken of the zeitgeist in that. 
He, who would speak of ice cream "only out of natural ingredients," used if possible nevertheless stabilizers - usually a nature product, about Guarkernmehl out of the Guarbohne. 
Naturally one can produce ice also without stabilizer, only must sell become it then within one day, otherwise sackt it in itself together, and the customer bites on pure ice grain. 
Certain variations at the standards are permitted. 
It becomes more exciting with the aromas. 
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano between the ingredients, that one buys in the fruit department or in the candies of the supermarket, distinguishes. 
Moreover there are gives powder and paste. 
"The suppliers will try everyone to turn on" you dozens of additions aromatized. 
"But you should experiment" simply once. 
Either in the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruits. 
Or just in the ice cream out of the white standards, that becomes with eggs the yellow cream, and with cocoa powder to the base for all possible chocolates seductions. 
Now the course participants may at the ice machines. 
Luciano lets produce it respectively four different types of vanilla, chocolate produce, mocha produce and produce hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the standards, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additions. 
Also the fruit ice sorts are subjected to the same experiment. 
More aroma material, more fruit Püree - taste laughed is that not unconditionally better. 
Hazelnut ice does not taste unconditionally nussiger if it contains more hazelnuts. 
The most popular Kiwi ice produces the team, that uses more fruits, less water and somewhat less stabilizer. 
First a well-balanced mixture lifts the taste of a Gelato really forth, says Luciano. 
Ice manufacture is a math problem: If peach Püree with much sugar is used, the sugar share in the reason prescription must be diminished. 
For lemon ice, an extra portion sugar is necessary. 
Luciano pulls a device forth, with that it the sugar content of the fruit sorts certainly (wine-grower measure therewith the Oechsle in the grape cider). 
Luckily tables ease the calculate. 
To make ice required no longer so much physical use such as earlier. 
Not only the device for the automatic manufacture of the standards helps. 
There simultaneously creamy is struck also a device, in that the finished ice mixture and cooled becomes on temperatures below freezing. 
Small breakdowns do not stay away all automation to the defiance. 
The Brazilian Gustavo bekleckert itself and its course colleagues from above until below with Fruchtpüree when it the oversized hand blender except inspection runs. 
"In every course," means Maestro Luciano, "is it only a matter of time, until so something happens."
