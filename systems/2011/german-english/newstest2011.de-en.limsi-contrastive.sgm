<seg id="1"> What should they do the SSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "Konditorei." </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new Ratsherrs of capital from the ranks of the SSD will obviously have to overcome some language barriers, with their alt-neu colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and city representation at all able to understand. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The newspaper Aktuáln.Cz members of the new Council of SSD times a little "abgeklopft," as they dominate the notorious slang that has become common practice in recent years, in which the current coalition partners in Prague have been at the helm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The encoded vocabulary in the elapsed era of Mayor Pavel Bém was introduced by the Prague political elite, some of the best-known actors, situations and Causae. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Surprisingly, it became clear that the new councils in relation to these new terms somewhat in the dark. </seg>
<seg id="6"> They say that, at least. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Who is Voldemort?" </seg>
<seg id="8"> "No idea." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am more a newcomer in the Prague policy," responded Luká Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, the test of the "Paten-Wortschatzes." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But it is also the councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar way. </seg>
<seg id="11"> As an example to the term "golf hole." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "This is the only expression of which you are presenting me here, I occasionally use." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Otherwise, I do not think a lot of slang." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> From the vocabulary, the daily newspaper Aktuáln.Cz in this year's June before the electoral congress of the ODS was published, the editors pickte six concepts, it turned out, especially those that are notoriously associated with the Prague government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Social Democrats should the terms "Voldemort," "greatest Prague golf hole," "go in the Konditorei," " nacken ," " betrayal of the capital " and " verblechen " define. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Three Prague Ratsherrs agreed the test on the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - first promised his participation in the meeting, then less than the listeners. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, the test was rejected from the outset. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "These things have given me no matter how the Civic Democrats and chatting with each other about it, I am not passing judgement." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "I think it is important, as we understand in the context of our programmes," he countered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> As already indicated, would have been Luká Kaucký in the abovementioned headline allegedly not recognized by the influential businessman and friend of the Ex-Oberbürgermeister Bém, Roman Janouek of the speech. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The term "Voldemort," Kaucky says nothing at all and the only word he was erriet correct on the test, "the main Prague golf hole." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, to safety but added: "But the more I know from the newspaper." </seg>
<seg id="23"> And jokingly: "I am probably a language course requirement." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The "golf hole" will not only of matador Karel Březina, but also from the town councillor for the Environment Luká Plachý right as a Blanka tunnel through the entziffert. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Both Social Democrats but also know for whom the term Voldemort stands and Luká Plachý idea even where to find this character, and thereby also what it means, "to go in the Konditorei." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "I think that is to say, to go into any Prague catering industry" is pretty Plachý close to the solution to the problem, if you know that this is the seat of Janoueks firms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> However, in line with Březina but he claimed that this knowledge is more likely to have accessed from the newspaper, than for him this vocabulary would own. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> According to the Testteilnehmern judging by, it seems really under the Social Democrats have no similar popular slang. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I asked my colleagues as well, but obviously there is something we are really not." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "We call upon us by name, occasionally even using words or colorful names," says the chairman of the Prague SSD Petr Hulínský - of his party peers loosely "Hulda." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "I was in school Bíza (Birke) called, but I do not know whether my colleagues also called" Karel Březina tells us his nickname of. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The newspaper Deník Aktuáln.Cz has tried out the name and behold - he works. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Weinert councillor for the party allies and friendly "one's grandfather" or less friendly to the "old" Representative Miroslav Poche before the elections by activity in the party sponsorship drew attention from some colleagues "Igráek" (renowned Czech do figure) mentioned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Colorful names as the only the Social Democrats in the intra-Party parlance permit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Hulínský, it may not be alleged if it "Hulda," but Deník Aktuáln.Cz registered yet another nickname of the Prague chairman. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> His nickname of "doctor Gummiknüppel-Rechte" was supposed to do that Petr Hulínský its title Doctor juris has acquired in the Bratislaver police academy. </seg>

<seg id="4"> All three were in the framework of the so-called "deregulation" has just increased the rent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> So, instead of 3 500 kronor monthly miete is the son next year on a 2 room home with kitchen fork out £3.3bn 4100 kronor in the second category. </seg>
<seg id="6"> "There are less than fluid in the house hot water and heat must be in a simple carbon," he angrily tippt a finger at the new lease of the son, whose signature he a power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "But what - signed and I," he explains half and half resigned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The civic association BytyOKD.Cz, the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral," advises the tenants, the new contracts are not easy to sign up and until 7 December to wait, in which it intends to publish a guidebook, as it fights against such contracts. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But the man only is dismissive. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "One says that the others," he makes a grim face. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The region of Ostrava as the great "deregulation laboratory." </seg>
<seg id="12"> After the New Year is this deregulation most rental housing in the Czech Republic before, whose tenants pay no rent market. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Aktuáln.Cz therefore decided that this "laboratory" on a personal visit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The RPG-Warteraum Havíov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning packed on this Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Bodyguards are right beside the door of a security agency and an aufruf machine. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="16"> "Rent 2011," stands as a special Tastfeld on the touch screen. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In a nutshell touched upon by and already spuckt the device with a numerical list. </seg>
<seg id="18"> We hardly have the number "157" entziffert and already piepst them on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting period. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Half a minute later in the series. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> A little later, an older couple walks into the waiting area, in order to ask for the rent, but the onslaught in the waiting area apparently does not apply at all the new rent. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Most people are here to solve the usual problems - Reparaturanträge, Versicherungsangelegenheiten and similar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> From the middle of November fly over the region Ostrava Kuverts with the new leases most tenants of a total of 44 000 homes of the portfolio of RPG in the mailboxes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The RPG Byty beats them in the letter, a rent increase of around 15 to 38 percent. </seg>

</p>

<seg id="25"> "The action runs a little over a week, which is to say, that is only the beginning" to answer the ladies behind the counter for a moment of hesitation, as the "client" emerging as a journalist. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The deregulation and Bakalas former Bergarbeiterwohnungen are a sensitive issue. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before the elections was the parliamentary Vice-President originating from Ostrava Lubomír Zaorálek SSD quite loudly taken up this issue, no wonder, then, that today the newspapers are full of them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> "Twenty years, I want a new bed from them." </seg>
<seg id="29"> "It is not even look at besch. WC-Brille they could change" makes the aforementioned man air. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Until now, according to the staff are all pensioners on the counter in order to convince themselves whether they really get the promised tenants' moderation, which promises them RPG if they have the specific requirement to sign in time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In the enjoyment of a half reduced February miete should also get the other tenants, the new lease until 15 December to sign. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Until now, "deregulation" in Havíov but everything else, as an overloaded of enquiries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> "From yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because here" appreciate the schalter beamtins. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> RPG offers both on their websites, as well as Wandtafeln individual rental agreements where necessary. </seg>
<seg id="35"> If the parties do not agree on the new rent, they will be determined by an independent court. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> "This is not a threat, but as the information on the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach to understand," RPG said on its website. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> "Nobody here goes to court," says a staff of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client centre gives her, at least partly right. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="40"> "Time to see." </seg>
<seg id="41"> "Mr Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so people prefer to wait and see," it must be borne in mind. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The regulated rent ends in the main part of the Czech Republic on New Year's Day of 2011 and RPG Byty, according to the rental increase is an economic necessity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> "The existing level of rent is not enough times to the maintenance of the housing funds from" argues Pavel Klime, the director of the society Wohnungs-Portfolios RPG Byty and - just to criticize the neglect of the angry tenants of the Housing Fund, according to the homeowners of the main reason for the rent hike. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> While RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010 from one's rent four billion could be invested in the houses in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it should be 5.2 billion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> In the broadsheet LCD-Display on the ceiling over the polster sessels in the waiting area of Havíov in the meantime, there are always a few red shining information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> "The rent increases by 15% in 2011 and less concern 31 200 homes, which means more than 90% of the homes of RPG." </seg>
<seg id="47"> "This means that whenever a maximum 7,50 CZK per square metre and month" is to read on the LCD-Monitor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> Only 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG increased the rent by 38 percent. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "In these cases is the increase of extreme lower rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG. </seg>
<seg id="50"> In 2600 housing remains the rent on the same level in the next year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> RPG Byty promises that the deregulation of the rent is not erratic in pushing up but staged within four and eight years. </seg>
<seg id="52"> What is more - the company imposed an additional duty: all revenue from the rent increase (see graph) wants to keep putting the company back into the homes, especially in Wärmeersparnisse - in new windows and insulation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> But - and this should primarily benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent hike. </seg>

<seg id="1"> A bone chamber fascinates even after 100 years. If you look at the Interieure of Gaudi </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The roof looks like a prehistoric Echse, the back stairs, such as the vertebral column of dinosaurs and behind Fischmäuler. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This is the Casa Batlló by the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="4"> From the local residents got the house with its organic forms the nickname of "bone house." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Organ forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, Kachelsplittern and Mosaiks, which covered facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of youth style of Antonio Gaudi. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The facade of the house plays with fantastically lines lack paints and Texturen out to nature and living things. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> It was only on closer inspection, you notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and conceptual order. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In the night still works against the whole facade of plastic, dramatic and specific Anleuchtung stepped up the glamour of the paint still. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The same buoyant lines and tortuous forms also dominate the interior of the house. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wave type of shaped wood frames, support Zierelemente by doors, even Gucklöcher and. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The Batlló house in the district Eixample in the busy shopping road Passeig de Grácia 43 arose from the renovation of a house from the year 1877, the architects Emilio Sala Cortese said. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Americans took two years on the right and finished 1906. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The investor, the wealthy industrialists, Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but he ultimately voted Gaudís to the idea of converting to an unusual and even cheaper. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The rental house, Casa Batlló was an architect, Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone. </seg>
<seg id="15"> He worked with the architect, Josep Maria Jujol together. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Dekorations have been created for the ceremonial home to some of the Realitätenbesitzers and even the use of Mosaiks in the facade was his idea. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> At the design of the facade but also many other Bildner and artists. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The joint work on the drafts of the Casa Batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís House, Casa Milá in Güell Park, in which other works also located by Antoni Gaudí. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Not long after its completion was the home of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the nicknames for "bone house." </seg>
<seg id="21"> Others called it the specific window opening mechanism for the "yawning home." </seg>
<seg id="22"> It also says that on top of the building was the sword in the holy Georg, presented by the Patron of Catalonia. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But also other bildhauer elements symbolize hidden religious motives. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Gaudí was an architect of the House a unique central heating system for the time with Entlüftungskanälen and typical Kamins. </seg>
<seg id="25"> It is a little bizarre is its 45 degrees inclination already. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> In his creation Gaudí consistently ignored all former building codes and in no way anyone could be discouraged by this. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before start, he was one of the relevant permission from the city but the information presented by him on the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers in the completion of two years later were so appalled by the outcome that they change the situation demanded. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The Ratsherrs were also among other things, that the building with its pillars, even in the public sidewalk. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Among the changes, however, there was no longer quite the opposite - just 15 days after the relevant request of the district asked Josep Batlló a request for approval of the property of the two highest situated floors of the House - and it has given him promptly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The homeowners themselves pulled into the lower floors one. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In the gallery on the 2nd floor was a company showroom, on the third floor were bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The ground floor has been leased to a juwelier business. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The entire sechsstöckig building is going through a set of stairs up to the dachte race. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> The basic elements of the reorganization were all right corner and just lines removed and replaced by bent and waved walls. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Gaudí also worked with a modern approach to the mutual connection between rooms. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The social part is quite connect through the opening of the Salontüren and so could comfortably chatting, without a major society in vertraulich more talks will have to give up on a certain intimacy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The House received by Gaudís restructuring, apart from a new facade is also an unusual roof and two other floors. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It is also a formidable Gaudís game with the light and the blue and white glasiert Kachels with which the courtyard is dressed and Lichthofs. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The right mattress and the right bed rost? Women have other aspirations than men </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It is not the tollste bed frame, but the quality of the surface - mattress and make a good bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, this must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Many things in the choice to play a role - the weight, size, health, and last but not least, the sex of the Schläfer. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Equally important is the Interieur mattress and subordinate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> A typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a weekend house, which is not heated on a regular basis, Latexmatratzen are not good, because they need a lot longer, "hot." </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition, they are clearly more difficult than usual Polyurethan-Matratzen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And - they should be turned on a regular basis. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If they do not have enough Entlüftungskanälchen in the heart, and still to lie on a solid record humidity, the movement: it is not excluded that is emerging from its mold. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the election, of course, also plays a role in which it is used. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Anyone who wants a longer period of time was abroad, where very high Matratzes with soft layer are normal, hard on a low mattress with hard surfaces can get. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "Benefit all ice-hockey player who have returned from the NHL, have complained to me that they cannot sleep very well here." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "For their abgeschundenen shoulders, Fersen and Hüften they simply need a soft layer of Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam - a Formgedächtnis-Polymer)." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I would recommend this including sugar sick people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that the" information "from the joints and the skin can receive bad," said Sylva Hadamcziková, which specialises in polster möbel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> That is why I have a few years ago many ice-hockey players, but also other customers these Matratzes with Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam) concerned. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Today, this is not a problem any more, because those Matratzes offers, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And we should not necessarily be a famous ice-hockey player, in order to appreciate the benefits of the Visco-Schaums. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" works really quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The foam optimalisiert its severity and type in accordance with the absorbed heat, or in other words, he is downright schmiegt on warm body. </seg>
<seg id="21"> There's nowhere else in the night shifts go around like after a heavy battle. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It simply sleeping a lot better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The viskoelastische foam also provides protection against Dekubitus (fire). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> With the election of the matratze size to body size, we should still include the length of the sohles, then approximately 21 to 34 inches. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Men like Mrs of the 180 cm wide, so need a 210 to 220 cm long bed. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Each of the Schläfer should be at least 90 cm of width available together so 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In single beds, for example in Singles, 120 to 140 cm are appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Furthermore, a comfort and, for the sake even for any visitors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise, the following thumb for the ideal bed band: "If it is on the back, should still have enough room for the easy angewinkelt to be poor," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the zunft model of Polsterer and Raumausstatter, who for many years the issue of healthy sleep and devotes the ergonomics of furniture and this issue also presented at technical schools. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> In a double bed needs every one of his own and his own bed, but be careful with the purchase, so that the Matratzes are equally high. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Other than that, nothing else other than the Rosts to assembling in differing degrees, and that is not long on each bed frame possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Foam mattresses should be at least 14 inches high, mattresses with stroke skelett 15 inches of it should be at least three centimetres accounted for formal classes and fine cushion. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "With the hand or in the Hinsetzen you can feel the feathers in any case," warns Helena Prokopová. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Every mattress requires a special Rosttyp. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document how together increased Siamzwillinge in the bedroom to find nothing. </seg>
<seg id="36"> These Matratzes are not strip and you can't wash, which is already commonplace. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And since we are in a single night between 0.2 to 0,75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years, becoming a huge (and clogged sieve). </seg>
<seg id="38"> This is also why experts reject Werbeslogans Matratzes a lifespan of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee promise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Each thing has its if and buts. </seg>
<seg id="40"> So a practical advice from the dealers: when Matratzes of 120 or 140 cm diameter should be the hygiene of the waschbar, abziehbaren salary will not be afraid, nevertheless, it is recommended to use a Matratzenschoner, you can wash and drain slightly. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even if today the rule Matratzenbezüge made with Rundumreißverschluss, so that you get two sides after the opening (immensely important for the washing process, and the waschmaschine size!) is the manipulation with larger Matratzes, especially alone exported, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> They have to sleep on, rather than a solid record of a Rostes? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Order! </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or, at most for a bed for unpopular guests and for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Even so, they should be labelled the record would rather Lüftungslöchern (if already are not included) and mattresses with stroke skelett and 15 cm minimum level with so-called pocket stroke nucleus and fine cushion use. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethan-Matratzen belong to such a document is not. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For not verstellbar latte rosts with 14 to 18 stroke play (Lamellen) Latex or sand emphasis mattresses suitable (possibly even combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay Roste with a major latte number, then 28 and more stroke play, with Lordosenstütze in the lende area and the ability to regulate the latte härte. </seg>
<seg id="48"> At verstellbar Lamellenroste does not include Matratzes with relevant skelett, because they do not respond to the ergonomische pretexts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> In addition to the suspension of the Steife stroke play will be offered particularly flexible modules. </seg>
<seg id="50"> This is a particular stroke play, enabling the stroke play einzudrücken or even verwinkeln so that they allow the occasional Einsinken from the back of the Schläfer. </seg>
<seg id="51"> For men with wide shoulders an important matter. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There are even matratze makers, which started with "Beatles' mattresses" soft zones to use for the shoulder area. </seg>
<seg id="53"> I also thought about the ladies - they might be this soft zones in the Hüftgegend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For demanding customers are scoring load large guidance systems (Lattoflex) or Roste with scoring burden Kontakt-Pads with so-called Multitorsionsfederung certain. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure will be distributed on several points, which reduces tension. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But - if you're on the right mattress and correct a bad (too big and fülliges) head bed used to get the most benefits will be lost. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Here too a thumb: a bed should be based on the head, its leaders should only go to the shoulders, so that the Schultermuskeln can relax. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The ideal seems a 50 x 60 cm wide cushion, as for example the Scandinavians might. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In the situation should head bed (along with the discharge zone in or the soft zone in the bed) to compensate for the shoulder height. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Something our modern Matratzes with the former (with hay filled) Strohsäcken but common. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern manufacturers increasingly use natural materials, or at least their mixtures. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Even Matratzes is the new magic word "bio." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of Erdölrohstoffen used for the manufacture of Polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturell oils - for example Rizinus and soya oil. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soy is used by all the well-known manufacturers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> "Bio says in Matratzes, her heart is pure natural materials," said Petr Vaíek of the company Tropico Plus. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Naturstoffe are also used in the manufacture of Matratzenbezügen - was one of the first Aloe Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> You can also kapseln the spread of fresh wood or Lavendelduft in sleep, Mr. President. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Here too it makes a difference between man and woman. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While the men a "cooling in the existing" plant extract from birke sheets will be used, so that the matratze relationship can absorb the heat and cool the body, the salary for women "current mend" impact. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Extracts from Red Paprikaschotes stimulate the blood circulation to the weaker sex is wohlig hot during the sleep, Mr. President. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> And the current favorites? </seg>
<seg id="72"> Mattresses of foam may (he has more Pores with devastated cell structure and is therefore breathing more active than normal Polyurethan and also much more flexible). </seg>
<seg id="73"> The combination of the various Steife (toughness) arise from Kaltschäumen and Visco-Schäumen Mehr-Zonen-Matratzen who know exactly where head, hip and Fersen are located. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> For a quality mattress, however, has 7 000 kroner and more to fork out £3.3bn. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Health mattresses but are usually burdened with lower value-added tax, because they are considered to be medical assistance. </seg>
<seg id="76"> As the first Czech companies this advantage Gumotex has been given. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> You can see on the bed and on to save is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Every now and again there are special offers from manufacturers and distributors, the two mattresses on the price of an offer. </seg>
<seg id="79"> For example, the trademark offers the mattress Duofreeze Magniflex in verstepptem Visco-Schaum Memory 11 990 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="80"> The second you get for free. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the material Tempur the era of the viskoelastischen foam with open cell structure and high density in almost cosmic speed. </seg>
<seg id="82"> Small wonder, then, they have been developed for NASA, because the astronauts are subjected to enormous excess loads on the landing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83"> Tempur is a soft warmth, entrenched in a cool environment again. </seg>
<seg id="84"> For example, it fits perfectly in the human body and distributed in an optimum manner the physical pressure. </seg>
<seg id="85"> It is therefore not only ideal for the prevention of printing brandy, but generally increased the sleeping comfort. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86"> Viskoelastische foam but not only Matratzes but also for other health products, such as special Fußpolstern used the legs and will provide the equipment relief. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Local manufacturers use, for example, the foam Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Czech army has 445 kilometers Zündschnüre bought with weapons. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the year before, the Defense Ministry had 224 kilometers Zündschnur delivered to the army camp. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have ausgesorgt for 225 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The problem is just the durability of the Zündschnur - two, at most, but four years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The army bought the Zündschnur company STV Group, others for paltry 40 million kronor. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In his explanatory memorandum for the purchase of these huge amount Zündschnur said the General Staff MF DNES, the soldiers would annually consume about 60 kilometres Zündschnur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to the research by Armeepyrotechnikern, according to the MF DNES to show for this indication that the whole army annually should undertake an intensive pyrotechnics training - by all the generals and officers of the army command, right up to the Sekretärins and cleaning women. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Only in this way could be considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometres Zündschnüren reasonably justified. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This length corresponds 25 000 Detonationen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> But even this army stocks would be sufficient for more than ten years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But if even the old rule of experts that every new professional soldier for training two metres Zündschnur quite sufficient, then the army by those Neueinkaufs - also under the point of view of the increased needs of pioneer and special teams - a reassuring stockpile for the above-mentioned created 225 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> It complained soldiers of the Rapid Border Intervention Brigade recently in the Defence Minister Vondra, they had almost no look for hand-held weapons more so that Schießübungen the lack of resources are limited due to strong. </seg>
<seg id="15"> From the same shortage demure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "I am also not a why it from us to buy those legions of Zündschnüre." </seg>
<seg id="17"> But it is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "For us, the army is a good customer, we, as traders want concessions to as much as possible," says the marketing manager of the STV Group, Jan Dcký. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Jan Pejek, the spokesman of the Defense Ministry justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of Zündschnur, so that the army would have been at least ten years with this "ammunition" acknowledges the covers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Jan Dcký of the STV Group, but only talks about a four-year span of the Zündschnur and the police and Armeepyrotechniker even just two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "In a perfect storage is also possible the four mentioned a number of years," admits one of them, but wants to remain unnamed, as a soldier not accused the criticism of the army. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the expiry of the period of any ammunition must be tested thoroughly, whether it is reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But these tests are not in vain, but costs further money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Another argument of the Defense Department is the quantitative rebate for 445 kilometers Zündschnur. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "It cost us 60 per cent less than any year supply of 244 miles," Pejek spokesman us shares with the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> It is only by way of comparison: the annual consumption of Zündschnüren Pyrotechnikern the police, the ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Army, liquidate exceeds some years barely 1 500 metres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> And the police are always ordered such quantities of these weapons, which they still can use before the end of the term of use. </seg>
<seg id="28"> It is wonderful for the safety of the Pyrotechniker, so it also considers the possibility of flexible procurement of more modern and hence reliable Zündschnurs open. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The Defense Ministry has already huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, as the two hundred thousand members Czechoslovak People's Army on their campaign was on the Rhine. </seg>
<seg id="30"> According to the Pyrotechnikern, according to the MF DNES of the Czech armed forces, expected in a few years ago, the same problem in the killing of hundreds of kilometres of old Zündschnurs, which they now as "favourable." </seg>

<seg id="14"> Lubo G. were obvious information available to anyone who had registered on the invitation, and because he himself had the right person was because he had bought a number of ways claims, he offered a property interest that he is withdrawing from the competition. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Obviously against a fat severance package. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It would also be a sufficient explanation for why he his arrest such a large sum was. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Lubo G. was already in the past too good contacts with the Pilsner land fund. </seg>
<seg id="18"> For example, he also played in the issue of the former head of the land fund Vaclav Sankota, a role which was prosecuted because he issued in Ersatzrestitutionen land, which already location decisions had been taken to construction. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Men whose finger long than the ring finger is obviously a lower risk of prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This is a surprising result of a study on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer, was published. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This is the mirror of the male hormone testosterone are linked. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Our results show that the relative length of fingers as a simple test can be used for the risk of prostate cancer and this roll-call in men by 60," said the coauthor of the study, Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University in Warwick. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The finger may help to determine what men absolutely must undergo a prostatakrebs test, especially when genetic risks or other risk factors are in place, such as family health burden, Mrs Eeles added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In the period between 1994 and 2009, they sat with their counterparts in Britain, more than 1 500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3 000 healthy men. </seg>
<seg id="8"> With more than half of the participants in the study was the finger of the right hand is shorter than the ring finger. </seg>

<seg id="9"> For these men was seen the same probability of prostate cancer, such as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and finger were the same for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In men, whose finger was longer than the ring finger, but this risk was reduced by 33 percent in men by 60 even at 87 percent. </seg>

<seg id="13"> Some dreams in the midlife crisis of a new career, other cars simply backing the treacherous ice of their vague aspirations. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="19"> Luciano Maestro-Gelatiere Ferrari, the participants initially said the ideal characteristics for the perfect ice cream. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The key is not only good taste, but also the seidig fluidity and good consistency. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Luciano forgets his training but also not the icing on the cake of the national and even südländischen superstructure: ' By Gelato is simply the best - and then there is still plenty of romanticism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first step towards the manufacture seems quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Luciano repeals the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a large Mixgerät with an electronic programme everything at 85 degrees heated and then immediately to four degrees cooler. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Then he turns on the machine turning off a tap in and out of this mess is a white base cream, foundation for all the milk eiss. </seg>
<seg id="25"> As the teacher bestürmt with questions: can you ice cream only produce with natural substances without agent? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How can you own experimental free course? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Luciano warns the Zeitgeist mislead. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Who of ice cream "only" speech from natural ingredients, has possibly yet stabilisers used - usually a natural product, such as Guarkernmehl from Guarbohne. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Of course you can ice also produce without agent, it should only be sold within a day, otherwise sackt together, and the client bites in loud Eiskörnchen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Some variations on the basic chips are allowed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It will be more exciting with the flavours. </seg>
<seg id="32"> For the taste in ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes the ingredients in the fruit department or to buy the sweets from the supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition there are bullets and Pasten. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "The suppliers are all trying to get dozens of aromatic ingredients you try to foist on." </seg>
<seg id="35"> "But you should simply experimenting." </seg>
<seg id="36"> Either in the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruit. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Or just on the ice cream from the white primary chips with eggs on the yellow cream and cocoa powder on the basis of all possible Schokoladen-Verführungen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Now we can change players in the Eismaschines. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano leaves them each four different types of vanille, chocolate, produce Mokka and Haselnuss-Eis - with or without eggs in the basic material, with more or less whatsoever aroma or other natural additives. </seg>
<seg id="40"> According to the same experiment will be subjected to the eiss assembly. </seg>
<seg id="41"> More flavourings, more fruit puree - taste is not necessarily better. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Haselnuss-Eis is not necessarily palatable nut palm, if it contains more hazelnuts. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The most popular Kiwi-Eis is the working group, and used more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Only a balanced mix will highlight the taste of a Gelato correctly points out Luciano says. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: if used peach puree with a lot of sugar, the sugar share must be reduced in the basic recipe. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For Zitroneneis, an extra oats sugar is needed. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano prefers a device is to be resolved, with which he the sugar content of fruit varieties certain (winemakers measure so that the Oechsle in the grape must). </seg>
<seg id="48"> Fortunately facilitate calculation tables. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Ice to make no longer requires as much physical use as in the past. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is not just the device for the automatic production of basic material helps. </seg>
<seg id="51"> There is also a device in which the finished Eis-Mischung at the same time cremig beaten and chilled to freezing temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="52"> All automation in defiance not remain small mishaps. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The Brazilians Gustavo late and its stock price colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree than him outsized hand blenders control. </seg>

<seg id="3"> The director Nicolas Winding Refn lotet with his combatant saga "Walhalla Rising," new from old the genetic boundaries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Danish director at which audience may Nicolas Winding Refn thought when he "Walhalla Rising," revolved around? </seg>
<seg id="5"> A captured wikinger warriors with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) liberated from his Peinigers and sets with almost superhuman forces order as his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero like rough killing methods used and its enemies before the Gedärms alive, if he bad mood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On the other hand says Einauge as he is called, in fact, the whole movie about nothing, and also the other characters are at most times on one or two sentences or a few painful Todesschreis. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Otherwise, silence and gruselig beautiful hill scenery in Scotland have feasted upon the wikinger world of about a thousand years provides the backdrop. </seg>
<seg id="8"> More ideal for adult Cineasten with interest of Existentialismus and very quiet camera journeys. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Fine, if a film has several target groups, only a pity if they are mutually exclusive. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Director Winding Refn has been in force for his wild and gestylt drogendealer trilogie 'Pusher' as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but refuses to have stoically, his works with a little more humour to the mainstream, or a little less brutality to make the Arthouse available. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Most Kunstkino-Freunde are likely from around spritzend brain mass and the Gedärms be deterred. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> It is no wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising," has found no movie in cinemas in Germany and is now only appeared on DVD. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is particularly due to the magnificent images of a shame, but also because behind the grandiose until blood triefend facade hiding a sometimes exciting piece of cinema deserves attention. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This film is not about dialogue or a coherent plot, it is all atmosphere, a film had fever dream. </seg>

<seg id="16"> And for which there is no escape for the spectators. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Refn he might barely a moment of relaxation, and he undertakes with his icy images and the sinister Trance-artigen sound track very slowly, but above all with the incredible hatred of him from the hearts of the characters has anti-American. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Only a small blond boy, the Einauge faithful to the side, retains something like innocence, everyone else will be driven by anger. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Most of the blind hero whose motives are never explained, but for enemies and temporary allies sometime on the warrior from hell, possibly with the ambassadors of the devil himself. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence to a secret nuclear program in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The country does, however, to comment - still leaves it controls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Mr. President, around midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007 will jump at least four Israeli F-15 i warplanes a mysterious, würfelförmiges building in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is on the banks of the Tigris; the next major town, 30 miles away, is Dair as-Saur. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Your name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor to Syria, allegedly with help from North Korea has built in the Quader, hidden in a valley of the stream. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing from the CIA, US-Auslandsgeheimdienstes by the end of April 2008 would be well under the name of the near village el-Kibar familiar reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium - which could be employed to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes hardly worth the technology from the fifties. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA has led a video presentation with vague satellite imagery. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Per computer they ignored a animation which components of the reactor should be have been before the destruction of a smaller copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyong nuclear center is. </seg>
<seg id="11"> They also presented photographs showing the building from the vicinity or even the interior compartment. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor was briefly stood before the beginning of the operation, it was said, but has not yet been drawn up with fuel rods. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more aware than it was then, of course, the mystery has been even wider with the passage of time. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Former US President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoir that the CIA was fairly safe before the attack that Syria has built a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly evidence saw that in the country, "an active nuclear weapons program existed." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some intelligence officers in Europe, there are more cautious prefer to see and speak only of an "alleged reactor," even if they CIA-Präsentation to keep "plausible." </seg>
<seg id="16"> You lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> What we need, as I am sure he was a nuclear reactor, a high UN-Diplomat replied only flat over the summer, the IAEA was "enough material to ask questions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> According to the rubble of the alleged "ungenutzten Militärgebäudes" the Syrian authorities rushed to one side and thoroughly planierten the terrain. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by the former chief inspector Olli hein in el-Kibar traces of uranium had been produced by people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, the IAEA received commercial providers of a Member State satellite images directly from the time after the attack, which should be more powerful than the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, these recordings are not to get on the market, because the unknown purchaser - perhaps Israel - she has bought the exclusive. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Therefore, the IAEA could not independently verify its authenticity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always declared, never pursued a secret nuclear program or a reactor built. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, Damascus said. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But the IAEA indicated that, according to analysis of particles as unlikely back. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss - just as it did about the satellite imagery. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In addition, it denied the inspectors access to a second inspection in el-Kibar and the rubble of bombed-out buildings. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But Israel also says the iron. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We never comment on ', recently reiterated at the time of the attack incumbent Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, the official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> So the investigation of the case since June 2008 in vain, "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority," as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - after all, a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area, about which the IAEA monitoring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As a key to progress in resolving the IAEA appears to be three more bodies, "functional contact" with the alleged reactor should - and unlike those still exist. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In doing so, the inspectors have neither disclosed which assets it is still what role they are or what they can appear to be suspicious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they will be on the IAEA internal as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah called in turn derived from nearby towns. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and at satellite images tracked down a building complex in Masyaf, where it is most likely is one of the suspicious objects. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It is probably in or adjacent to a military base - exactly with this justification, Syria denied the IAEA access to the three places. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In Vienna, it says, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be vorgeschickt by the United States, auszuspähen at military installations. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Because the Nukleardetektive were caused by a piece of the US intelligence agencies learned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three locations and the Quader material on the Tigris, was transported. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could "in connection with the fuel production." </seg>
<seg id="40"> But there is "no indication of sensitive activities" so uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes which are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The type of reactor is operated with uranium is not enriched. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But where the uranium could have come from and where it has turned into at a later date should be separated plutonium for the bomb, these central issues if anything, there are plausible assumptions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> It is also unclear whether debris, which could involve valuable clues in the three places were stored. </seg>
<seg id="44"> When would the hundreds Lastwagenladungen disappeared from the ground, no one wants to have information on where the rubble has remained. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The only a few kilometres from el-Kibar located on the other side of the Tigris salt mine in al-Tibni, Syria in 1998 on their suitability as a storehouse for radioactive waste has been analysed, the IAEA is regarded as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley she was recently in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor in mid-afternoon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Photographs from orbit show, however, that Syria in three suspicious places Erdarbeiten and large containers, after the IAEA access had requested. </seg>
<seg id="48"> This cannot be coincidence, but has contributed little to dispel the suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> It is also in diplomatic circles, the IAEA had spent a number of months to develop a plan for inspections there, Syria should allow to maintain any military secrets - only the tape shows how great the interest of the inspectors. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Meanwhile, Damascus also bügelte this proposal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Although Western diplomats in Vienna before a year to appease the reactor was destroyed, the matter was therefore no urgency, brings about US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months the so-called special inspection into the game, one of the strongest funds that has the Vienna nuclear agency to enforce controls. </seg>
<seg id="52"> IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, which should propose these inspections, has been " an option for which I am open in the future ', even though he hesitates. </seg>
<seg id="53"> There is a high risk in this way: first, it needs for a majority in the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and a number of the 35 countries represented are anything but eager for an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other hand, as a diplomat to bear in mind: "What if they find nothing in the end?" </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Since Angelina Jolie in the summer with the work of their still nameless debüt has begun, there is anger. </seg>
<seg id="3"> She has even written the script, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serb man. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Rather, we do not know about it - but it is sufficient for unrest. </seg>
<seg id="5"> There is the rumor, the woman, a Muslim woman, verliebe during the Yugoslav war in her Serb rapist. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Bosnian women's associations have immediately protested, and some Drehtags planned in Sarajevo have been transferred in the short term after Hungary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In the meantime, the film marginalised in Hungary and in the postal production, but it is still protested in Bosnia. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote on the UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerk UNHCR, Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - even the UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerk Goodwill Ambassador Jolie. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is not Diplomatisch - it was the women from several weeks before a meeting in Hungary offered what but refused. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The meeting should take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Liebesgeschichten, it was not given in Vergewaltigungscamps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims would not be betraying her enough about the script. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Your organization has recommended, according to the UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerk to dismiss as a Goodwill Ambassador Jolie, the Guardian reported. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But what exactly Jolie wrote for scenes? </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Bosnian Culture Ministry, which was to read their script, after some to-ing and fro-ing issued a permit for Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie then nothing came. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The young author even claimed to have no political intentions with her film was incorporated into the Yugoslav conflict with a lot of effort, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Content, however, it remains vague. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Thus, even a second Synopsis for the film in the network, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew it before war broke out and meet again, a Bosnian Muslim woman when she is kidnapped in a Serbian camp, where he works as a guard. </seg>
<seg id="18"> What sounds considerably different than the variant "rape verknallt torturer." </seg>
<seg id="19"> The fact that Jolie's film actually starts before the war - so much is safe. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The pressure on them, as Jolie is "unfair and based on misinformation." </seg>
<seg id="21"> She can now probably just give the hackers of Hollywood peace: in dismissing the script, like so many before, illegally on the Internet. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The demokatrische routine </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The pro-democracy movement in Latin America will be stronger, as the support of private companies. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is larger than that of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="5"> These results came the Latinobarómetro-Umfrage, which carried out in 18 countries and exclusive, was published in The Economist. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Since 1995, this survey will be carried out on a regular basis and shows so the freedom of change in this region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two facts fall in this year's survey in September and October, particularly in's eye. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First, the good mood in Latin America </seg>
<seg id="9"> And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In many countries the democratic movement in the South American Pacific Coast has increased sharply (Table 1). </seg>
<seg id="11"> In Peru, for example, where the economy since 2002 is growing by approximately 6% per year, has increased the number of democracy activists by 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Even in Mexico, where the economy since the sharp downturn in the past year recovered, is to see such a trend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the world's two most populous countries in the region are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (graph 2). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Approximately 44% of the respondents said that they are satisfied with the democratic practices of their country. That as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3). </seg>
<seg id="15"> Approximately 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values are equivalent to those of last year, but to show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% or 24%). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Before a decade undermined Latin American economic crises efforts for more democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This continued even during the global economic crisis is probably due to the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a brief recession, and speedy recovery. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, the poor were absorbed by a stronger social network. </seg>
<seg id="19">  (According to reports by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week rose in 2009, the poverty rate in Latin America only slightly and has again fallen by 32% this year). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Yet from country to country there are strong Stimmungsunterschiede (graph 4). </seg>
<seg id="21"> Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread progress thinking reflect that. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> It was only the second time since polling began to see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country a greater problem than unemployment (graph 5). </seg>
<seg id="24"> Approximately 31% say that either themselves or a family member in the past year, victims of a crime, but however compared to 38% in the last year have sunk the values and thus achieve the lowest since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The rising economic performance is reflected in the greater support from the private sector and the market economy is mirroring: approximately 71% of respondents to a regional that the private sector is essential for the development, in 2007 there were 56% (graph 6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared with 47% in the last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), even though her leftist president, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private companies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil has loudly 19% of the respondents (18% last year) the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year). </seg>
<seg id="29"> The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, however, see the most influential country in the US, although this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua from Venezuela. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Whether it resulted in a re-election bid next year depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández kompromissbereiter as her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Nestor Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The signs are not clear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Nestor Kirchner, who also directed the economic policy after the election of his wife, often budgets on tax revenues, the economic growth and inflation are not fully covered. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This enabled the presidential couple, the extra revenue to spend as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In the paper last year Mr. government lost the majority in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further clashes. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some dissidents from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten rallying behind Cristina Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But after chaotic meetings (in which a parliamentarian another hit in the face and others lying to the government of corruption), the Congress failed to pass the budget for 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I will not discuss," as the President. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The budget for 2010 now also applies to the next year, which the President has more opportunity to spend as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy is running hot: it is likely this year to grow up to 9%. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official inflation rate is for Z. at 11,1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the unions - push the value to nearly 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was racked by economic crises, growth and poverty reduction to its key objectives, and not the inflation reduction. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He refused to cooperate with the IMF, the private sector schikanierte and säuberte, the national institute for statistics and census INDEC, then schönte the official inflation statistics. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Fernandez can now take a path? </seg>
<seg id="18"> It was the private sector and the trade union leaders called to talks. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And, according to official statements are supposed to pay increases in the next year will be limited to 18%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the inflation undermined the spurt by a great devaluation in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> May wish to Cristina Fernández why Argentina financial back to join the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="23"> At the beginning of this year, the government took an agreement with the country's previous restructuring had rejected in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Fernandez now appears on an agreement with the lenders to push from the Paris Club, to whom it owes around 6,7 Dollar billion. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Kirchners had a review by the IMF, as elsewhere, the usual always rejected. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But in the last month, the Finance Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund in the drafting of a new national consumer price index "technical assistance" it looks as it would be the first step towards the cleansing of the INDEC. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not known whether Fernandez after their term even without the support from her husband will be politically active. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of Kirchnerism. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the Argentines in March to return from its summer recess, will be the wave of Sympatie, it has been shown to be fizzled. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If they want to win another election, they must decide whether they have many political decisions to lift her husband's quietly. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="6"> Ma took the test, but just barely. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) three of the five mayors, they did not receive a majority of votes. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Instead, the director of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates a greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In a presidential election that would have meant for Ma problems. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Since his election two years ago, the share of his party has fallen by approximately 8%. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For the first time the DPP even pulled together with the KMT in the local councilors a. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="18"> China was perhaps the biggest winner of the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Remarkably, the relationship was not addressed to the mainland. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Instead, the candidates debated on plans to social housing and the creation of jobs. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and are opposed to China's military threat. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This is why the KMT its relations with the government in Beijing does not like to see in the foreground. </seg>

<p>

<seg id="36"> Tsai is planning a of think tank as a contact point between the DPP and China. This would require an unbiased discussions ahead. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Tsai said publicly that their party will offer a "credible alternative" to Ma's hasty rapprochement with China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Chen seems very angry about this change. </seg>
<seg id="39"> From his cell, he said, the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan independence. </seg>
<seg id="40"> He urged the pragmatist Su even to forgo the presidential candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even without Chen's interference does the DPP difficult to choose their potential candidate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The KMT will undergo its own self-analysis must. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Ma's values are poor, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT-Kandidaten wanted to conduct their campaigns without him. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The main reasons for his unpopularity seems unemployment and the increasing gap between the rich and the poor. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Arsen-resistente microbe could new life forms on Earth or elsewhere permit </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The discovery of a foreign variety of bacteria, including arsenic can live, opens up new opportunities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Although scientists this unusual bacterium discovered here on earth, their view, it is a sign that a life even without the previously deemed as essential elements is possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "This organism has two options." </seg>
<seg id="5"> "He needs to grow, either phosphorus or arsenic." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "This makes it quite special, even though it is almost a kind of 'fremde ' way of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University and Co-Autor of the report on Thursday appears in the online edition of the journal Science. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Until now, there have been six main elements considered essential - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> But as the researchers discovered that the bacterium grows in California's mono Lake even further if it has to be replaced by arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "One wonders what else is possible," said the report's Co-Autor Ariel D. of Anbar of Arizona State University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is an important step in the search for outside life, as scientist lives and need to see its forms as of Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study deals with microbes that have been found on the planet. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were disclosed about the discovery was cause for widespread speculation on the Internet, that the report could act by the discovery of außerirdischen life. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "shows that in other Planetensystemen organisms with the help of other elements biochemical processes can set in motion, and that the 'Standardelemente ', which, in our view, are absolutely essential, are not necessarily fixed prescribed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University in the United Kingdom from Milton Keynes. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockel was not part of the research team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "This work is a new thing, because it shows that in an element of fundamental biochemical processes and structures can be replaced by another," said Cockell will be added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> This discovery was not accidental. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrobiologischen Institute, who led the study, chose the mono Lake as a result of the high Arsengehalts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Since arsenic and phosphorus chemical equal, they thought that microbes, which are both suspended, possibly an element can be replaced by the other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "The toxicity of the Arsens above all is that it is chemically similar phosphorus." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "It is difficult, the organisms to distinguish one element from the other." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "But the difference is so great that arsenic if it works differently than phosphorus. It ends up in our biochemisches system, where it verschmiert at almost everything," said of Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 rising arsenic concentration. It wanted and grew. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The microbe grows in phosphorus better, but it can also survive in arsenic, shows that a life form can happen, of course, either on the Earth or another planet or moon, the arsenic occurs more frequently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> According to Jamie S. Foster, believe in microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new but so far there has been no functioning example. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Arsenic was more frequently in the early Erdjahren, she says, so the science is based on the assumption that early life forms have used it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> "The reason the assumption that life may have developed differently than in the early geologically important," as Forster, which is not a member in Wolfe-Simons research team was. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="28"> The research were from NASA, the Energy Department and supported the national health authorities. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to the statements on Thursday, the plan has met the requirements of the US-Konkursrecht, so that the relaunch of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass entertainment, nothing more stands in the way. Barber and Birnbaum are the slightly slimmed-down studio as CEO. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The staff numbers about 400 to approximately 320 reduced. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For MGM will enter Chapter 11 real first in force when JPMorgan Chase a planned loan of 500 Dollar million to finance the new MGM-Produktionen has been completed. </seg>
<seg id="7"> At the moment is leading a consortium of investment bank, even 75 Dollar million of revenue, the company. The funding will be until the middle of December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009, with the mandate to the investment bank Moelis & CO, the company's board, with interest payments in the amount of output of 300 Dollar billion--an Mio/ year, struggled to help solve their financial problems. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In August, Harry Sloan, the chief executive has been replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, through his work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts was known. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The efforts of Moelis & Cooper MGMs to resolve the financial concerns and the more than 140 Gläuber of Studio auszubezahlen, lasted longer than expected. </seg>
<seg id="11"> After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009, to offer to buy the company. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But the auction drew only a few bidders and nobody wanted to pay the $2 billion requested by the creditors. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In the spring of this year, everything started from scratch, as the MGM-Team began with the restructuring plan, after months of debate and infighting at the end of October was finally signed by the creditors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> If MGM formally in the next few weeks, the bankruptcy has survived, preserved Moelis and Cooper for their work, a bonus amounting to several millions of dollars. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The proportion of Moelis and the rest, which is already 1,2 Dollar million received amounts to 9,5 Dollar million </seg>
<seg id="16"> Cooper, who are paid a monthly 375.000 Dollar for the leadership of the company has received a "success bonus" of $4 million </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM, and this year brought only a movie, it turned out the studio and produced an annual plan with seven or eight movies, beginning in 2012, are to arrive in cinemas. </seg>
<seg id="18"> They also plan two films after " small Hobbit ' in Co-Produktion with Warner Bros. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The studio needed a separate bond between 265 Dollar million to 275 Dollar million for its financial share in these two films, under the aegis of Peter Jackson should arise. </seg>

<seg id="5"> I recently visited on the search for three electronic toys in 80 Dollar three national toy retailers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys 'r' and a BJ's whole sale club. </seg>
<seg id="6"> I was immediately clear that Moore's Law in force, and this year the technological toys are more efficient and at the same time costs a little less than last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> And while fewer new toys appear with their own website, is the best-known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, a broader supply. </seg>
<seg id="8"> There are more Knopfzellen-betriebene toys on the market, and many include rehabilitation and aufladbare batteries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Here are a few recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="10">  (If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "r"). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 Dollar for children 3 years) are Plüschfiguren such as sea pigs sing a note if it depresses her belly. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The first dodge corresponds to a note by repeated pressure it can play a song. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Respect: when you started with the pressure, you can no longer stop. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> For a combination of Gesand and dance the dance star Mickey (fisher price 60 Dollar for children from 2) the best choice. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Based on last year's Elmo developed technology offers the animatronische doll exchange games such as 'Simon says ', and thanks to the innovative Scharnierfüße with Radblockierung, they dominated the Moon-Walk. </seg>

<seg id="20"> If you go back to your child does not want to entrust your Smartphone, here are three independent alternatives. </seg>

<seg id="22"> None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> IXL fisher price (90 Dollar for children from 3 to 7) used for the Games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes and, thanks to the SD-Kartenlaufwerks can also family photo to be seen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Finally, there is still Scrabble Flash (30 Dollar Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED-Bildschirm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The game is about to merge the units into words, before the time is running out. It is great for an impromptu Buchstabierwettbewerb. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Prosecutor will not denounce Senator Ensign </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Prosecutors from the Justice Department have Senator John Ensign acquitted of the charges after his Affaire with a former election worker and his attempt to give their husbands a lobbying against him were collected, gave the lawyers familiar with the senator on Wednesday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This decision will put an end to the most serious legal accusation against Senator Ensign, a Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which caused headlines nationwide and dealt a setback of his career, he was seen as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As Senator Ensigns office announced that he was on the ruling after the year-long investigation "delighted." </seg>
<seg id="5"> The ethics committee of the Senate could still impose an Disziplarstrafe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to a statement made by Ensigns lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice, that the investigations against Senator Ensign hired and that no further indictments are available in this matter. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Justice Department did not want to comment on the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The ruling was for many Ethik-Anwälte outside the Justice Department a surprise. In your opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign the lobbying ban has been flouted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Interviews, emails and other documents for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times revealed were prompted to suspect that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of its election agents to lucrative contracts for his silence on a Affaire with Hamptons Cynthia wife to buy. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Cynthia Hampton was Ensigns during an election campaign working as a treasurer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Ensign took part in contact with some political friends to Hampton work. According to the documents and Verhören he took for it to halt Hamptons lobbying. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Since Hampton recently in Ensigns election team was, it was he was allowed a year no lobbying for his former employer, or the entire Senate. </seg>
<seg id="13"> According to experts in the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton Affaire were chummy, against the so-called Drehtür-Lobbykratie ban. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> According to the published evidence " is apparently a consultation and the violation of the Drehtür-Statuten ' so Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who has specialised in the defence of clients who are in the sights of the government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> While the Justice Ministry official refused, the reasons for the decision to announce in Ensign-Fall, said Mr. Brand and other Ethikanwälten notes, the ministry is very cautious in the Aufnehmen of political charges after a variety of setbacks have been followed with great interest by the media, including the decision last year, the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens because of misconduct on the part of the state prosecutor decided to drop. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Prosecutors "are clearly fearful confinement," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organisation whose objective is the fight against corruption in parliament and government circles in the United States), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr. Ensign was brought before the courts. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "This basically means that high-level officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Paul Coggins, the main defenders of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview, on Monday, he received a telephone call from a prosecutor and another on the next day, in which he was told that no complaints against his client, the ministry will levy. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with prosecutors in order to convince them that the senator, as his office in a statement on Wednesday again reiterated, "acted in accordance with the law" was. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr. Coggins refused, the legal arguments that he had raised in relation to the prosecutors to explain in more detail. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "I was not well in the negotiating details between me and the Justice Department to go with it, but so much is said:" we believe the right decision, " he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Last month, the Federal Election Commission has decided to stop to investigations because of a separate complaint with the ethics group, for which a payment of 96 000 Dollar by Mr. Ensigns parents in the Hamptons have violated federal election law. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The electoral commission said it was not enough evidence existed that the money is anything but was a gift. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which long supported the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found, thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign Lobbyisten-Arbeit. </seg>
<seg id="25"> An Email in December 2008 proves that, after the company, "Mr Hampton has been promoted as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he announced that he was at the Interior Ministry for a cause" anklopfe ." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and a different customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, agreed to lunch and asked the transport minister, to agree to a meeting in the name of the airline, after this Mr. Hampton had been hired for the purpose of lobbying. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> As the last year for the first time, information came to the public on this affair," Mr. Ensign apologize to his constituents and gave his position in the Senate, where he had stood in the hierarchy of the Republican Party in fourth place. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Having no longer struck many months ago, told Mr. Ensign two weeks ago of reporters that he would like to see a third term in the Senate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> In the announcement that Mr. Ensign no longer be the target of criminal investigations, said his press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, the senator would like to hope that the Ethics Committee very quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and closing its investigation. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "Senator Ensign looks forward to his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada to continue," she said. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Cheshire on Twitter draws attention </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A half-dozen of them tippten in the riots in the courtroom. </seg>
<seg id="3"> They verschickten in their reports on Twitter of gruesome testimony. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the end, as the defense, there were more than 140 000 Twitter-Meldungen on trial for rape and gekettete children in beds in a house, the flare-up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Thursday the closely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was charged with three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to have killed an official end, when the judgment on the death sentence, which the jury pronounced falls. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted requests submitted in court, explain the reasons for an appeal and the courts for years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> It is one of the most provozierend reasons that it through the intense coverage of the trial - even with the extensive use of Twitter by average reporter - into a "circus atmosphere" and a more widespread immediately penetration aufrührerischer details came, so that the jury in an improper manner had been influenced by the public outrage. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This appeal could prompt the Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question whether the new technologies, new rules are needed in the courtroom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "As I have seen during this process, I believe that it is really a danger, if the arrival of new technologies in the courtroom, the right of each individual affected to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes main defenders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue by the Supreme Chamber of Appeal rejected the requests last week by ruling succinct back when he said that the New Media "carefully controlled" would, and that there is no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But it was certainly not the last word in this matter. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For decades Gerichtseinsprüche have noted that the coverage of notorious cases of doubt on the fairness of a trial. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In his historic decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, which is supposed to have killed his wife, lifted and said in its ruling that because the new media with a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" would have been. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some believes that the TV show and the movie "on the flight" is based on this crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some lawyers say, Gerichtseinsprüche, which Mr. Hayes conviction be seen half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary to ensure the channels of communication from the courtroom at the time of the case, Dr Sheppard was unimaginable to regulate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "There is a good reason, about the impact of new media in trials, which will be followed by a broad public to be concerned," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut, but his report also says that it will be imposed arbitrarily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor Donohue said, some Appelationsgerichte may be intrigued by the idea that the restriction of immediately communication from the courtroom, it turned out, could make the trials fairer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Twitter affair is just one of many who set out by Mr. Hayes lawyers to discuss a number of years and thus delay a condemnation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> For example, the defense lawyers also claim that Mr. Hayes may already have been vorverurteilt as a judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential Jurors, by giving them showed gruesome Tatortfotos during the juror selection. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some have said the Jurors photos of the victim, Jennifer hawke petit 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, they would have met with disgust. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The protesters say they were also questioning the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judges have mistakenly exchanged a jury, which has been a critic of the prosecutor, and that he had exerted undue pressure on the ruling, as he had taken the unusual decision to ask the jury free over the weekend. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The Jurors were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But their arguments about the impact of the extensive reporting about the process prefers perhaps the greatest interest. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In a anfechtung, which have submitted them last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and has been discussed by the candidates for the U.S. Senate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They argued that the New Media continuously had rekindled the flames of the emotions of the case. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "Such a daily crush of media piepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," wrote the lawyers, "it has been previously in New Haven, and perhaps even nationwide have yet to be seen." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Your emphasis on the reporting by Twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Some journalists have said in interviews that the assertion that these direct messages are rabble-rousing but as reports, which will be reimbursed at a slower rate, is a technikfeindlicher glance, the verarme reporting on future processes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> But some lawyers said, Appelationsgerichte would often faced with the argument, social and technological changes, the Adaptation sidelined by the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr. Hayers lawyers to strengthen this assertion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In her appeal, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the conviction of Dr Sheppard was removed as a result of the reporting and made it clear that the New Media new rules require. </seg>
<seg id="32"> "This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Politeness can combine the division? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> After a campaign of dirty words and negativity this week erupted little civility in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It is the sign of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before quickly returning to the struggle of the parties in the capital? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and congressional leaders brought no breakthrough on the big issues during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government session, in which no decisions will be taken longer had to employ. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After all, what is being said, it was neither a polite discussion between the two sides are still a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of partisan Punktesammelns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meeting of the president's deficit commission on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences that still exist between the members. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months created a new mutual respect can the ideological divide that still divides the members disguised. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> This is hardly enough to say that it is a new era of cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Both sides are now in a testing phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise, even while trying to cross the borders of the public opinion and the patience of voters to weigh a renewed partisan warfare. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This was why the meeting on Tuesday itself and its estimation by the participants limited to a minimum of demands or accusations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep when a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, could be expected. </seg>
<seg id="12"> No matter whether we are talking about taxes, donations, health or Anwartschaften, the two sides are miles apart. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Finally, the November election Washington has, at least for a short time bribed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, which is now on the "Ethics and Public Policy Center" works. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "This is inevitable after elections. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elections appear partisan passions again. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This is so good." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In a number of issues, particularly those on the agenda of the "lame duck session," Republicans and Democrats have hardly any other choice than to find a solution. " </seg>
<seg id="19"> Bush's tax cuts end up at the end of the year, and no one advocates. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way to make some or even all receive, whether temporary or permanent. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is also expected to reach a compromise on the increased unemployment money, even if only because the Republicans cannot afford that it believes the preferred tax cuts for the rich, while they are unemployed workers to refuse a support. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House has increased the optimism that these issues during the "lame duck session" to reach an agreement and at the same time, the new Start treaty can be ratified. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame duck session " soft must lead to a lasting cooperation between the parties, if the new 112. Congress convened in January. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead, he says, is a period of failure for huge likely, perhaps even inevitable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "After the things that need to be done, done, will transform this short-term psychology in confrontation," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Wehner is also sceptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - the politeness leads to real cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "I see many things from now on will be done by 2012, as a Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event from 2012," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority to do in the White House and the Teeparty-Wählern were instrumental to their education. </seg>
<seg id="29"> As the Republican leader also expressed concern may be that they vie to high, they know that they must try to keep their promise to cut government spending and the healthcare reform to set aside to adhere to. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> This party lines are already in the first reaction on the recommendations of the deficit commission clearly what a fiscal reform and raised some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and cutting government spending include. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The stellvertretends Chairman Alan Simpson and Bowles Erskine have one of the most difficult jobs in Washington accepted and, according to their own assessment, pressed so much on the public agenda, the deficit issue, that they can no longer be ignored. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes in order to make its plan for the official recommendation, and they are fighting very well to come only in the vicinity of these numbers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The biggest resistance is reflected in the elected representatives of the body, because financial issues, at least today, little room or little sympathy for compromises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Galston says two stages in the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress ahead. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The first fight next year will take place in the form of Parteizusammenstößen, when the Republicans Obama on the state budget, taxes and challenging the health care system, then followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will lead to this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> The public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It is shown that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties to work together. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If confrontation in a blind alley, as happened in 1995, then both parties need to be careful to respect the public reaction. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Whoever wins will be doomed to lose, will change the course and the compromise must seek. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> This may in fact be an optimistic view. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Partisanship and polarization are now greater than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem to have a major ideological divide between Obama and the Kongress-Republikanern to be at the same time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At the same time to see the activists of the two parties in 2010 as a mere prelude to a consequence far broader election in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> So it may be courtesy display this week will be welcomed by many Americans. </seg>
<seg id="45"> But on both sides, it will require much more effort to find a common denominator in the issues that the two still separate. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Both police and the state security service blackmail high protection money, so that they can keep their expensive living in Moscow, it says. </seg>
<seg id="4"> They not only collect money from legitimate business, but also by organized criminal gangs. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as a "vertical authority" - takes its part of the money, which, according to the top of the ladder. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The memo under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was sent to Washington, was on Tuesday by Wikileaks published on its website. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The memo was based on sources, whose names were edited. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It was written while Yuri Luzhkov still Moscow's mayor was, and it accused him of corruption. </seg>
<seg id="9"> He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that had been cleaned up in the meantime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, a well-known operator has over the years makes repeatedly rejected, and he has won numerous libel actions against such accusations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He told a Russian TV channel in September, when he was asked for a documentary, which suggests that he was corrupt: "It is crazy, it is a dirty, dirty." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">A huge number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. The surveys show. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But it is unusual that, as has happened in the report of the ambassador, individual persons, and it is heard that this is done by a diplomat from a foreign country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "The direct link with the government in Moscow with the crime has meant that some of them as" disturbed "and come to the conclusion that the government is acting as a Kleptokrat rather than a government," as the memo. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "Criminal elements enjoy a" kryshna " (a term from the world of criminals and the mafia, which literally" umbrella " or protection means) on the police, the Public Safety (FSB), the service supervisor (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor onscreen as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy. </seg>

<seg id="17"> "Luzhkov is uppermost." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "The FSB, the MVD and militia on the second stage." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "Finally, followed by the perfectly ordinary criminals and criminal inspectors at the bottom." </seg>
<seg id="20"> "This is an incompetent system, where criminal groups fill a gap in some areas, because the city is offering no assistance." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The report says further that the FSB money received by the biggest companies and the police small businessmen have been arrested. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> One source, so it is, "said that Moscow shopkeepers to understand that it is best to protect the MVD and FSB to get (and not by the organized crime), because they are not only more weapons, resources and power than criminals, but also because they are protected by the law." </seg>
<seg id="23"> "For this reason, the protection by criminal gangs, not more sought-after as before." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The memo noted that while the collection of the money is fully protected even very modest no; even those who pay are sometimes arrested. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The same people who do not pay, find their business very quickly closed - on the basis of one or other excuse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Medvedev spoke several times to combat corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The memo of the message contains descriptions of men with suitcases, which were presumably full with money, go in the Kremlin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> "In its fight against corruption Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said named Georgy, who Satarov, director of by a Moscow expert commission recently in an interview. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "But it is part of this tape." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "It is not a part of the political class as a political class no longer exists in Russia." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Without a politician without an opposition, without a separation of powers, as he says that corruption is inevitable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Nationwide, as estimated by the corruption is costing Russia, more than 300 Dollar billion per year. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The country is ranked 154, a recent study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparence International (the countries "least corrupt" to "most corrupt" listed). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> The revelation of the Memos of the American Embassy, which after Moscow time late in the evening was done, it will certainly be sorry cause within the Russian government, though, because Luzhkov can be blamed for the errors of Moscow, the Kremlin may also be an opportunity to claim that one answer to the problems. </seg>

<seg id="15"> When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-Ied government, fled the remnants of the regime and its armed forces on the border of Cambodia to Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In this case it until December 1998, when the last movement, to surrender unrest. </seg>

<seg id="22"> Even if a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts, because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> "These people have benefited little from the capitulation," said Sok Leang from the Centre for justice and reconciliation throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng holds public forums </seg>

<seg id="32"> The mandate of the court, the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for atrocities to be condemned, but it has not said whether it is on these four cases will pursue further action. </seg>
<seg id="33"> This has contributed little to ease fears in Anlong Veng. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> "Cambodia should dig a hole and bury the past," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to be able to go forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation. </seg>
<seg id="44"> "Reconciliation with the Khmer times means to collect the broken pieces," he said. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Belarus agrees not continue to collect weapons-grade uranium </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to global security of nuclear material the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it no longer will collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The deal has been in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarussian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov announced in an additional article of the Sicherheitsgipfels. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The US government had been trying for years to persuade Belarus, not to collect more highly enriched uranium and appeared last spring reached a hurdle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But the US administration officials told the Washington Post that in the last two months, two secret agreements were made with Belarus, 187 pounds weapons-grade uranium to remove from a White Russian research centre. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This was the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official staff, who will remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue, roughly 500 pounds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> It seems one of the main findings of Obama's "nuclear security summit of 47 nations" in April, the Belarus ruled. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And it was apparently good enough, at the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012 to secure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I was thrilled by the fact that they have a seat at the nuclear security summit (by 2012) want." </seg>
<seg id="10"> "This shows me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership Global Security, a group on the promotion of nuclear safety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Clinton called the agreement " a very significant, important step ' of Belarus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Obama promised in Prague in April 2009, within four years to secure all vulnerable nuclear material. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since then, the US government has helped six countries, its highly enriched uranium to be loose. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Belarus will be the seventh. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A dozen did so under the government of George W. Bush. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At the time of Obama's Nuklearem security summit in the Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up their uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamental weapons-grade, and fewer enriched uranium," said Lukashenko at the time. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "This is our raw materials... we will not make it a dirty bombs and we will sell it to anyone." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We will use it solely for research purposes, that is all." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Belarus is still a few months ago, the United States, as interest in the meeting of an agreement anzeigte. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The first attempt to remove the uranium in Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was irradiated easily, say officials. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It was loaded in a Spezialzug of more than 1 300 miles on a Russian factory for storage and disposal, say officials. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The second attempt was approved on Monday and was carried out according to the officials by plane. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The US government pays for these efforts - 14 million, with a large part of the money in the Belarussian research goes with low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "This was very carefully coordinated and concerted confidence" to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton led, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Energy Department, which is working with the global risk reduction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende Studies estimates that Belarus this year at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Belarus wants, according to the joint agreement to remove his camp until 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harschen lack of respect for human rights. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But the statement on Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> "According to the progress of this global security issues welcome liable to cancel out the United States of America and Belarus aware that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she says. </seg>

<seg id="2"> The owners of the old people's home in Olot does not preclude their carers on 11 elderly people killed </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The people in charge of the elderly nursing home in La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which she highlighted what damage the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the carers during his work at least 11 old people, for which he was responsible, was killed - had caused the institution. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The head of the elderly care home, Joan Sala, came in the company of his lawyer, Joan Cañada, before the court and announced, "La Caritat would like to thank the people responsible (for the deaths) tribunal," but "the right and our liability force us into the process and the civil liability" to adopt. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The institution must not only accept a social prestige lost, because they are the criminal activities of the nurses had not detected in time, but now also pay a high compensation sum by the legal representatives of the families of the victims will be calculated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Joan Vila Dilmé acknowledged that the first crime is falling in August 2009, and that he had murdered since even further. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The judge ordered the exhumation of eight Körpern - former patients of the elderly nursing home - because he thought that no doctor examined the dead personally, but the paperwork because of their age and disease have been handled by phone. </seg>

<seg id="11"> In this case he was killed with an overdose of insulin, compared to the first crime, in which he is a mixture of various sedatives had. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The head of La Caritat, said the staff access to the drugs is difficult to control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The insulin injections and the sedative middle cocktail suspended the carers in six of the nine crimes a to liberate the patients with the death of their suffering. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But the results of laboratory tests will point out whether Vila is lying and for its first victims actually chose a less cruel death, or whether he ausbrannte them from the inside by calling them bleich lauge forecast was, as it had done, according to three women he killed between 12 and 17 October. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> In La Caritat listens to the statements of the carers no faith, not even as far as the number of confessed murder, which could well be more. This attitude is justified that Vila very different statements made in court and that it make no sense, his approach after eight successful assassinations to suddenly change. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The European Central Bank (ECB) </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Investors reacted yesterday sharp on the threat of ECB President Trichet warned that "the markets should not underestimate our capacity." </seg>
<seg id="3"> The risk premia have risen dramatically in the Euro-Peripheriländer and the shares of European banks by more than 5%. </seg>
<seg id="4"> However, we should have the possibility that the ECB can deceive themselves and the euro has gained little points, which led to concern, not underestimate. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The events of yesterday are typical for an illiquid market in the deal, in which he collapses recovers, however, as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The institutional investors do not lose his fear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Now a month ago, the European Central Bank urged on us to reverse our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen, according to which the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably still a number of times in the future, must make a U-turn. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The Bundesbank called for the lifting of the plan for the purchase of government debt, because they are ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. It should only be a week's indefinite access will be maintained. </seg>
<seg id="9"> After the Ireland crisis, we expect that the current liquidity measures "at least until March," extended and the quarterly tenders with unlimited access on the quarterly of the year in order to guarantee the liquidity will be maintained until at least June. </seg>
<seg id="10"> We also expect that the programme for the purchase of bonds continued and will spend a reinforcing message. </seg>
<seg id="11"> If the managed expectations are not met, the excellent response of the markets of yesterday back and if halstarrig insistence that we withdraw our liquidity measures, can only God help us! </seg>
<seg id="12"> Like the EZB-Sitzung in May, in which the bank confirmed the purchase of government debt securities do not need to be considered and then collapsed, the markets could repeat this story tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The ECB must be credible and tenacious. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In May, they showed the teeth and on Wednesday, she said to have bought a lot, provoking a new collapse of the market. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Yesterday was the auction of one-year government permits in Portugal rather weak. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The state asset management was only 500 million at 5,28%, compared with 750 million at 4,81% in the previous auction. </seg>
<seg id="17"> However, the interest rates fell by 30 basis points in Portugal in the whole curve and thus reflected a perceptual change the markets after the words Trichet's reflect that. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In Ireland were the figures of the debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland published. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The amount is approximately 10 000 million short-term and possible further 15 000. There is time until February in order to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after the problem with the stress tests had not detected in July, the figures are acceptable within the framework of the rescue plan and help to reduce uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, the government Tuesday received parliamentary approval to his new budget, but the fact that they still do not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Angela Merkel has its discourse with regard to the summit of the Heads of State and the government of moderate shaped on 14 December where it needed political unity in order to show that we shared the same score to play. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The problem is that Germany, Wagner wants to play and the other countries of the Beethoven's ninth symphony. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The Spanish government minister yesterday asked the action plan, which is due to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reduction of the deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures in the ears of investors such as Vivaldis sound for four seasons. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Compared to February was the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank quickly and convincingly, and we benefit from the surprise result. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Today, there is an authoritative auction of three-year bond, which benefit from the trichet effect, and that is why we put on a strong demand, which remove all doubts about our debt-restructuring capacity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> For Spain would be the application of an aid plan is a self-sacrifice. </seg>
<seg id="30"> We get liquidity, which we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion available, three times as much as in March. the interest rates are very expensive and would get access to the markets closed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with the motto "Caesar's wife:" now what counts is not only his, but also on the bill. " </seg>

<seg id="3"> Nevertheless, he sees a collapse of the banks with interest margins ahead to offset increases in the fees and prices for loans to try. </seg>

<seg id="5"> Saba dell has found the way to the next three years, and so in a very complicated economic environment to survive. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In 2011, the bank will introduce a new three-year flagship plan. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The goal is not only to survive without public aid from the FROB to enjoy, but also the market share of about a million retail customers - 700 000 if the customer leaves the bank will lose - to increase. This is the great challenge facing this bank, because until now it has its business customers more attention than their private customers. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This year it has 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies get. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Your market share in retail is at 3.5 percent, while the business customers account for more than 10 percent. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="10"> Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase of productivity, or rather Austerität, cost reduction. The challenges faced by the bank so that it is facing, it will present, along with annual Summary. </seg>

</p>

<seg id="18"> "The issues of liquidity and funding are structural in nature, and they will exert pressure on the credit." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We have not marginalised Hahn, but the Zinsdifferenziale are very high," were Guardiola. </seg>

<seg id="22"> Saba dells guiding plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It is no coincidence that he assured that in Spain "more companies are necessary." </seg>

<seg id="27"> After he assured that saba dell also can survive a temporary closure of the markets, he refuted the argument by some bankers, who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis. </seg>
<seg id="28"> He stressed that nothing can be put into circulation, but compared to the events in June, could be short-term funding beyond Repogeschäfte reach, and hence the crisis. </seg>

<seg id="12"> The second point: the restoration of the German mark - although that is currently more sounds like science fiction - supported by a majority of the public opinion, around 50 percent of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The third point: a transformation of the euro, according to German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict budget; the punishment of the countries that overstep the targets; möglicher as the default of certain countries, as well as the extension of the cost of potential adjustments to the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is clear and has been for some time, and that is why there are no excuses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First of all, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission to provide incentives for deficits in the past and the German government is a constitutional reform has withdrawn from the case, in order to prevent this from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This was the first sign of the divergence between what Germany saw fit (strict fiscal plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second signal suspended the Central European country, as Merkel the decision on the rescue of Greece is also more than painful. </seg>
<seg id="18"> At the time was heavily criticised. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion were totally against a rescue of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Merkel is finally in the last Oktobertags again with a clear position, which calls for a reform of the agreements between the European Union in order to facilitate the rescue of a country and at the same time to commit the private lender to bear a portion of the costs. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position was interpreted as anti-European because they Ireland crisis and propelled all the following. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But her proposal, albeit slightly sweetened, Parliament approved in the next few months, we will be in the reform of the European Union, these measures should enable from 2013, participate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has drawn a red line not to cross does. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It says all that - even if now unpopular measures must be taken - from the date of the old workings of the euro will be no more. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In 2013 it will be the birth year of a new monetary area in which the offender countries be punished harshly, may be forced to declare itself insolvent and in this case, the private sector must take a share of the cost. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows us that we must take a hard growth rate, high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The other alternative to debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments is based, as they led by Spain in boom times, will simply not be tolerated. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would do wrong to not understand it. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not just about the public deficit to three percent by 2013 runterzufahren. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much harder. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the worst of all, what we could do under these circumstances is to cheat ourselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the current turmoil to move into more calm. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And that we have the opportunities that are available to us, until the spring of 2013 will use. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero has understood this, too, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies on last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel hypothesis to create order in your own home, is getting its way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not seem that it would change anything. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Among the options taken into account is that the euro area packed with little serious countries would have to leave, not be ruled out. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In this case, Germany could still tell us they have warned us. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Sport and regulatory tax evasion </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tricks like Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax of show inventiveness, but not the desire to avoid a sanction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The alleged by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) exclusion in the game on 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League meant that there was a lot of ink about whether it is an unsporting act or not acted upon and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA. </seg>
<seg id="4"> As is well known, lost two players for a few minutes of the game of the year (her team had already clearly won) time and played several Fouls, so that the referee they showed the second yellow card. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way, and since the Real Madrid would cite his group, the two players the prescribed sanction against the Auxerre meet in the next league game and so without maps in the next room for stage boarding. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Finally, the UEFA disciplinary kommitee, Jose Mourinho, the coach of the club with two games and the participating players with different amounts of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow card in this or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is so widespread that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed rules in this game -. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of the debate about the portrayed event is due to the fact that a team of football club Real Madrid (the find and honor claims in its national anthem and on other occasions for similar incidents had punished his players) played the main role, and the drama by Mourinho an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician has added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case, the debate revolves around whether this is not explicitly prohibited behaviour by the statutes contradicts the principles of the sport, which is to say whether these actions constitute a virtual evasion. Indeed, this approach will abide by the statutes of the sport, but they seem to evade its terms. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this matter should damage the spirit of the sport will be investigated. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect which was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the offender players an unwarranted benefit from the team, and this did not happen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradox of the plot of the players of Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally understand under false game or regulatory evasion, since the circumvention of the rule was not taken secretly in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as visible as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players waited eagerly and sanction attended. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is what kind of advantage the offender went from the deliberate Fouls. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Here, it should be stressed that the rival either in a disadvantageous position was still an advantage for the played game were erheischt, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue to play with a few players. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, then the club lacks these players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The advantage is obvious is that the players the next ground phase of the Champions League without tickets, which could threaten their participation in a future game begin. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a long-term, up to a certain extent uncertain advantage, because the team could also be absent at some point, and we get the players with this approach, a sanction and go in the second cycle on where they are for card acquisition disappeared with a card less than in the first cycle. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Thus, it is not so clear whether it is really an advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Ultimately, such practices are directed not against the sporting spirit, which includes strategic decisions, in order to derive from the rules for a maximum benefit. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case, the players did not want any sanction deal (which would indeed be a clear case of regulatory tax evasion), they wanted to elect more when they undergo these. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They met a strategic decision to avoid without a penalty or to flee before her. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Although the line is blurred between inventiveness and regulatory environment, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because it involved two Selbstausschlüsse and because of the nature of the regulatory operation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The damage of the principles of the sport was caused by these acts is less moral rather than aesthetic nature. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shoot-out, concerned him not because he trusted his players: "You never want to arrive at the penalty shoot-out, we would like to finish in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is no alternative, and we must be prepared, we were prepared in the previous Tournee, but unfortunately we gave a bad game the destiny, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the fierce desire to keep the title already in the hands, which left us something for the endgame, and we hope that it will not happen this time." </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hydro-Québec mutual understanding Projektplanungsfirmen 450 million dollars in contracts that have been approved for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, the major proportion, namely the project pipeline, has received a sum of 295 million dollars without tender. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This consortium, known as "Énergie gérance" was in 2004 as a side effect of the decision by Hydro-Québec, the private sector for their responsibility in this important hydroelectric project a sum amounting to 5 billion dollars to entrust formed. </seg>
<seg id="5"> At the beginning of 2005, the consortium ergatterte 'Énergie gérance' the lucrative contract without that there had been a public invitation to tender. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For the Parti Québécois is resorting to Unternehmenskonsortien a serious ethical problem, which evokes the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung and an increase in prices. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "This is a new way of conspiracy and distorted the competition." </seg>
<seg id="8"> "This means that rather than fix games rather than in a secret manner is now carrying out in an open way," said yesterday Sylvain Simard, a delegate of the PQ, at the press conference. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the early morning Simard had raised the issue before the National Assembly, because it seems hard to understand how the interests of the public can be used in this way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Resource minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon by they vehemently deny, that it is a conspiracy in this treaty would have acted. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "I am sticking to my faithful," they raged by them confirmed that PQ was "dishonest" raiding "and lacked rigour." </seg>
<seg id="12"> She said it "is the least we can do," the PQ. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The model of the consortium is world practice. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is usually such a temporary alliance the two or more companies allowed their expertise on an imperative to concentrate on a tender for a complex project. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The project " East main ' a high komplexität level indicates about his Arbeitsausmaßes. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This is well under way and construction techniques should be established by 2012. </seg>
<seg id="17"> However, the contract was awarded without a competitive campaign had can take place; it had already negotiations were held. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> It also represents the model of the consortium in Quebec even relatively simple projects by no means an exception. </seg>
<seg id="19"> As the newspaper 'Le Devoir' last week noted that in the field of civil engineers and Beratungswesens used model of the consortium are the subject of Regierungsermittlungen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> A brief overflying the Quebecer Unternehmensregisters allowed more than 200 consortia to appoint, some of which seem to be steady duration. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In this way works, for example, the company Dessau in partnership with the majority of its key competitors, CIMA, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roach and Tecsult also count together. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Any link, and there are several dozen leads to a and the same legal person back, namely Dessau. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> As far as the consortium "Énergie gérance," as Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special Arbeitskräftedynamik and Hydro-Québec this fact since the 1970s in a particular way account pays." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ) has issued a statement that the nose has right now on the fact that the treaty was approved after agreement on the project pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "If you makes a call for tender and there are only a few candidates, your prices will soar." </seg>
<seg id="26"> "So you have two options: either you nimmst the people who find themselves at the Mart and saying:" we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price. " </seg>
<seg id="27"> "The idea is, however, that it is not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," confirmed Laporte. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> This consortium "Énergie gérance" approved contract is part of a long list of contracts on more than 50 000 dollars received by the Parti Québécois. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The contracts were either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ approved for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> After reviewing the newspaper 'Le Devoir' more than 100 Ingenieurs and consultancy contracts, the companies or their branches, including, in particular Ressourcenlabors, between 2002 and March 2010 have been awarded. </seg>
<seg id="31"> SNC-Lavalin had 22 contracts, Génivar received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without here their participation in "gérance" count Énergie. </seg>
<seg id="32"> All these treaties have been negotiated. </seg>

<seg id="4"> It is a shame, while swimming in a media universe where information for the benefit of a responsible more consumption just so: the barometer responsible consumption has to complain about a lack of credible information, a failure as a brake makes his commitment displayed as the first reading showed, which was held yesterday. </seg>

<seg id="6"> Two thirds of the Quebecer population is in fact the environment-friendly companies to pay as little faith as the green corporate advertising, so does the responsible Consumer Centre of the University of administered brooke sophisticated measuring instrument. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Another record: half of the consumer doubts about the credibility of the official supposedly fair products included certificates, but also the credibility of the products and brands, which turned out to be environmentally conscious, so the barometer. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Following the same pattern is the discourse of the politicians on this issue of only 14,6% of Quebecer population seriously. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The information about responsible consumption seems nevertheless important to stimulate this Konsumsegments, which is currently around only one-third of Quebecer users crowded. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In fact, dämpften Blank and dubious nature of the information the zeal of 46% of consumers. </seg>
<seg id="11"> After the higher price of the product, this is the second obstacle identified by the barometer. </seg>
<seg id="12"> There is also a third of the Quebecer of the specified performance of green products and services that they are trying to put in the hands of distrust. </seg>

<seg id="16"> But the social and ecological consciousness seems nonetheless to stop his car, so the barometer: just 28% of the Quebecer have indicated that in the year 2010, public transportation, or the Mitfahrzentrale preferred to have in order to demonstrate their ecological interest. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Quebecer government of Société Angus and called on the company Parallèle has been financially to participate in the takeover of the eXcentris Kinokomplexes agreed to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive loan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Angus entwickler society, as well as the company Parallèle a donation amounting to seven million dollars from the Ministry for the adoption of the Daniel Langlois covered by Kinokomplexes eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint laurent had hoped to bring this back to his real cineastischen capacity to respond, do not seem to get what they demanded. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, but on their own terms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Instead of the expected donation offers the Quebecer government instead of a loan at less than the initial desired level, a viable solution to create favorable conditions could, at least according to the entnehmbaren sources from the state-owned scaremongers. </seg>
<seg id="6"> An initial action plan and a request for 12.8 million were already last spring by the Quebec rejected a further request has been made since the renewed layoff moderately revised downwards. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> One proposal, along with an action plan has already been the president of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, sent to St-Pierre Minister, who chairs the eXcentris act. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Before several days, he had her a grant last factual report. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The counter-proposal of the cabinet, the SODEC was sent on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Parallèle and Angus now have time until 31 December to respond to this. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In any case, it seems that the premise of public donation really been pushed to the side. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Let us remember that the Quebecer owner's community theatres and cinema complex against a direct government investment to support the takeover of eXcentris had revolted by making the argument invalid, the Culture Minister did not have any financial help for real estate projects there, which he did not even other cinemas to send. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Several other players in the segment, however, in contrast to substantial economic aid one. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Movie chief Daniel Langlois was after the self-financed design of the cinema over ten years under great difficulty the authors' cinemas presented in the premises of his Kinokomplexes, which could justify the exception from the public purse. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The lack of cinemas showing independent films in Montreal more than obvious, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients in the bar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Société Angus and the company with Christian Yaccarini Parallèle at the top, for their part, are heading for a privately financed Campagne, of which it is a sum of 700, 000 dollars, hoping to boost the acquisition. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The new American Diplomatenleitungen, which have been disseminated by WikiLeaks reveal the mystery about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of Canadians feel toward the Americans; but they put the the latter superiority with the same blow against Canada open. </seg>
<seg id="3"> As a result, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters to the ballot, not the kanadisch American relations in the spirit, and they believe that the visit by President Obama would have helped the Conservative government, their Budget of 2009 to enforce! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The four new communications between the US Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were prevalent yesterday publicly offer even more juicy details than the mere substantive content, with which it has a very bad outcome. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A previous link on 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period in which the federal Wahlkampage was currently in full swing, reported from what point the United Nations is not more of the operations involved discussed by their political bosses. </seg>
<seg id="6"> With regard to the great surprise of David Wilkins of Ottawa deployed American ambassador. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Mr. Wilkins offers various channels in this situation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "One of the Canadians are almost inherent inferiority complex conditional leads possibly the Canadian political leaders far more on internal issues of everyday life to talk as the United States in this election the buck (as in 1988, when the campaign on free trade) ," as he describes. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The United Nations, he concludes, are thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially threatening to talk to him." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The ambassador understands these "deafening silence" especially since the two countries have intensive political and economic relations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Logically," as he assessed, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a leader to drive such processes relationship, which the voters at the polls as a key factor in the mind." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The other expression of this sense of importance reads on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business sources in Ottawa, written communication, President Barack Obama on his first visit in Ottawa to prepare. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Your visit will help the survival of the government in a confidence vote on the federal budget at the beginning of February to ensure that the Canada its first budget deficit after more than a decade, will announce the result of a recovery programme in the level of 30 to 40 billion dollars has arisen," describes Breese. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had parliamentary session before Christmas must be postponed in order to prevent that Parliament would be toppled by the coalition and the conditional continuation of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed Belebungsprogramms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Another, from January 2008 dating of the year and written communication from the Wilkins ambassadors agreed to Washington from the increasingly negative hard-line image, the dramatic series broadcast on development, spread by the United States. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The ambassador is concerned about programmes such as Border, little Mosque on the Prairie Intelligence and H2O, where little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even Abführungen for the purpose of interrogation analysis by the CIA Muskelprotze watch. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Yet another communication reported at length about how Hillary Clinton remarked on their French counterparts, Bernard Kouchner, during their first bilateral meeting asked whether Europe is ready to include certain prisoners from Guantanamo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Mr. Kouchner is expected to answer the question yes, but on the basis of an individual " case to Fall"-Entscheidung. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Àm at the end of the meeting, as described, "he was the Secretary of State distributed a paper on the issue of Omar Khadr, a 15-year Muslim Canadian origin." </seg>
<seg id="20"> "The Secretary of State has promised the files again." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Finally, we can still see the sensibilities on the website WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Tom Flanagan, an old and very close Stephen Harper standing adviser, explained on development, that the people responsible for this massive leak "should be killed." </seg>

<seg id="5"> The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. </seg>

<seg id="5"> You describe how the Elysée Americans had declared its strategy, which went as far as this advice for dealing with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of Wanderers). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> They show how the French people in charge have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman not the release of Majid Kakavand, a France detained and of the American justice system as a result of trade with material for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme ' Iranians voted for Gegeleistung. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Finally, they put the manner in which the French Presidency to manipulate the media to the purpose has tried this idea to convince Syrian President Bachar al Assad took a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a harsh light. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In truth, he had not done anything in this regard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> One in Paris on 12 August 2009 redigiertes diplomatic telegram of condolences bears the title "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostage-taking." </seg>
<seg id="10"> François Richier, the Elysée adviser in strategic issue, kept in the accompaniment of Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay in North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> They told her the French method. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Americans urged to do everything possible to make their own nationals back to bring the violent in Iran would be recorded. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Power noise," she said, "loud and clear, articulate and endlessly," the words ' fundamental human rights ,"" innocence ,"" immediate release " in the media. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which respects very sensitive to his image. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> "Betreibt all the more so, especially if you ask the Iranians not to do." </seg>
<seg id="16"> The fact is that "silence solves nothing" over the discussion experiments on unobtrusive way, the Iranians are "masters in prevarication." </seg>
<seg id="17"> Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners a ' normal, Iranian tactic: "Kidnapping for the purpose of political blackmail." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from the prison (which should be reached on 16 August, on the day on which she takes refuge in French embassy) "demand the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (230 000 million). </seg>
<seg id="19"> And it can be reported, the display antizipiere more hostage-taking, a phenomenon which "will worsen." </seg>

<seg id="23"> An information was circulated: the Iranians Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States because of illegal trade in sensitive electronics materials to Iran, demand after ruling by a judge in Paris has been released from prison. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The US Embassy is like many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence. </seg>
<seg id="25"> For Washington, which is the illegal Iranian networks followed the acquisition of the material provided for the nuclear program is a bad news for the release of Majid Khakavand. </seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg id="29"> The display, as he says, was not only "quite surprised by the decision of the judges," but also tried to resist. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "It was a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French justice minister given" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government could not change the judicial decision," he says. </seg>

<seg id="34"> The Americans are watching this activity is not without irony and note that the manipulation is bearing fruit, since several articles reflect the official French version. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> A telegram datierendes on 25 August 2009 evokes "the media blitz of the French authorities." </seg>
<seg id="36"> What is based so much "thanks" towards Mr. Assad, wonders the Paris embassy. </seg>
<seg id="37"> "Despite their declarations, full of Lobpreis, the French authorities privately admit that they only have a vague idea about what the Syrians have actually done." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The document then addresses the reasons which led to the Elysée to plumb this fiction. </seg>

<seg id="42"> The aim is also to "discord between Syria and Iran." </seg>
<seg id="43"> The American Embassy knows this from a good source. </seg>
<seg id="44"> On 11 August Francois Richier had entrusted her: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians whatever they have done." </seg>
<seg id="45"> "But we have nevertheless thanked them." </seg>
<seg id="46"> "This should at least create confusion on the part of the Iranians." </seg>

<seg id="4"> At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs had the regional chairman, Giulio Tremonti, to the situation as a "unentzifferbar" train and it with an "unpredictable" weekend can expect to hear what the person concerned, however, immediately denied. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On Tuesday at least had the gap with the German interest rates its record of 210 base points achieved and the price of contracts to cover the Konkursrisikos are risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain amount of Kopflosigkeit in Rome. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Silvio Berlusconi was in his Council of Ministers pointed out that the discrepancy in Spain to the German interest rates is in the hands of 400 base points. </seg>
<seg id="7"> His right hand, Gianni Letta, was, however, as a "serious concern" about the "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland indicated. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro zone, not like Greece or Ireland." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "The bad news is that Italy, like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute. </seg>
<seg id="10"> To put it plainly, his problem is the shortage of economic growth and the concomitant anaemic tax eingangs the state in danger, no longer cover its funding needs to be able to. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In the future will be an Italian growth of 1,1% in 2011 and expects 1,4% in the year 2012... even though the current budget in the Senate for consideration with 1,3% respectively, 2% of the expected. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Under these conditions, as calculated by the European Commission, the budget deficit next year will be 4,3% of GDP (contrary to the government's forecast 3,9%) and 3,5% in 2012 (instead of 2,7%). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Hence the uproar about a new budgetary collective after the holidays to a sum of EUR 7 billion could be used. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says accountant Olli Rehn. </seg>
<seg id="16"> On the hour Italy receives the support of international institutions. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "The foundations of Italy's economy in order and its accounts are settled, we repeat this for a very long time," Arrigo Sadun assured Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF is charged with Italy. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "At the moment there are no problems, neither short-term nor long-term point of view, because of Italy, despite its high level of debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011, A. that R.), lesser Stabilisationsfortschritte will be required as of other countries," observed Pier Carlo Padoan, chief volkswirt of the OECD. </seg>
<seg id="19"> That leaves the question of political Unstetigkeit. </seg>
<seg id="20"> On 14 December Silvio Berlusconi is a motion of censure in the House of Representatives face as a result of those early elections at the end of March could be organized. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is therefore a little favorable period before a decisionmaking process on a serious crisis. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Since the debate about the modernization of the transport industry is in full swing on the Ile de France, it has been raining billions. </seg>
<seg id="3"> At least in the discussions. </seg>
<seg id="4"> We urge in particular the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris in memory of the Société du Grand Paris is to be built. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In order to guide the start of construction of the SGP in the ways that the state has a capital dotation of 4 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the theoretical system, this is the amount, which would then allow the SGP to the markets to their two times to give a part of the finance bill. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Today, it is, after all, come to first projections. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The supplementary budget from 2010, this morning seen by the financial committee of the National Assembly, contains measures intended to raise the first part of this money. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is two measures: the creation of a special tax on the Erschließund and a higher taxation of offices on the Ile-de France. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The former, we remove Article 15 of the bill, "for the benefit of the public clinic Société du Grand Paris." </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is the equivalent: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Two more, an overhaul of the existing business taxation: "In order to modernise them, in order to increase their resulting product and this increase of Société du Grand Paris to respond." </seg>
<seg id="13"> How much would this bring? </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is a mystery. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This amount is not quantified in the text. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> From the 4 billion is far away. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "It is said that the fiscal resources to the 4 billion euros will be added to the capital dotation, which can be found by the state and the Société du Grand Paris after and to be done for the project," as is apparent from the explanatory presentation. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="18"> In the case of the SGP, does not mean this system at all. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "Since the moment in which revenue (the two taxes that R.), you can cover long studies over three years and then extract from the 4 billion," so declared. </seg>
<seg id="20"> "This will be noted in the budget and gradually withdrawn." </seg>
<seg id="21"> The SGP estimated that it will be launched in 2013, the 4 billion to make a note on the budget in 2014. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> This measure, whose 4 promised billions of people will be able to search for a long time, runs the risk that a law is on the move, causing parliamentary debate. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Rachsüchtige hackers and industrious spies </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Affaire has a dual significance. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On one side, she was emerging as an obvious scandal, a scandal that only a scandal in the Sinner hypocrisy is the Beziehunge between the countries, ruled the public and the press. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand, it presents profound changes at international level, and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by recession. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But we are taking the series. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of Wikileaks is the confirmation of the fact that each act drawn up by a secret service (a nation) composed solely of newspaper cuttings. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary" that American revelations about the sexual habits Berlusconi's throw no more than what you for months on anyway in any Journal got to read (except those whose owners Berlusconi) and the terrifying karikaturierte offered Kabarettkünstlern already rebuffed profile stuff for a long time for their Sketchs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule, according to which the secret files should only consist of well-known news is essential for the dynamic of the secret services, and not only in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go into a library devoted to the esotherischen publications, you will see that every piece of work (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, Templer or Rosenkreuzler) repeatedly exactly what has been written in previous works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It is not alone, therefore, that the author occult texts intends to publish any research (yet, therefore, that he did not knew where to find would be news to report on the non existierende), but because those who dedicate themselves to the Okkultismus, nothing else than to believe what they already know and confirmed what they already have learned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the most mechanism of Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Similarly, the secret files. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informant is rotten and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (he might otherwise whatever it may be, for example, editor in Libération), which only considers to be true, which he acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Top-Secret information on Berlusconi, the US Embassy in Rome was sent to the Staatsdezernat, were the same as those which Newsweek had previously published the week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> So why such a fuss was made by the revelations of these files? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On one side they say what any educated person knows, and that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the leaders can call each other, or we can take a plane in order to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small classed have turned spy centres. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Every and any viewer of investigative movies knows this very closely, and it does not happen from hypocrisy, that it is doing so to ignore this. </seg>
<seg id="18"> However: the fact that to repeat it in public, violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put the American diplomacy in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Secondly: the idea that an ordinary hacker secret most secrets can become the most powerful country in the world, carries a significant blow to the prestige of the Staatsdezernats. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The scandal also brings fewer victims, rather than the "executioner" in trouble. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we address the profound nature what happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Ehemals Orwell's time, it was all power as a Big Brother to combine the controlled every gesture of his subjects. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwell's prophecy had since then as a perfectly correct can turn out when you can, thanks to the telephone control every movement, every site's operation, visited the hotel, the elected motorway and so forth; the total victims of citizens would be the eye of power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But if you are in mind, what is happening today that even the secret Kryptas of power will not be able to escape the control of a Hackers, listens as the monitoring of the elections to be addressed, unilaterally and zirkelförmig. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - chosen as the public - can discover the secrets of power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> How can they keep a grip on power, which is no longer able to protect their own secrets? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is true, Mr. Simmel said that a real mystery is an empty secret (and an empty mystery can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the character Berlusconi's or Merkel's essentially free of Geheimis is a mystery, because the public sphere of price; but in the style of WikiLeaks to reveal the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty secrets were means to deprive them of any power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Wikileaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wronged, however, Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What are the consequences of this injury, which has caused such an enormous power? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the states in future no reserved information will make more online - that would be tantamount to a posting added on the street corner. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is equally obvious that it is frustrated with the current technology to hope confidential reports to be able to keep secret via telephone. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of state in a plane move and one of his colleagues contacted. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could future private and only for certain ears certain relationships? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know very well that my prediction at the moment for science fiction and Roma confinement sounds, but I feel compelled to imagine the government agents in a secret manner inspired to uncontrollable road routes moving their messages anywhere else than in a mere memory key, and also the few written information they received in the shoe marketing verbergend. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Only copy the information would be stored in locked drawers: basically had the spy effort of Watergate less success than WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity to write that the technology nowadays like a cancer progresses, namely backwards. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A century after the wireless telecommunications had revolutionized communications, the Internet is a Telegrafen (telephone) line. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The (analog) Videokassetten had allowed the Filmforschern ribbon band for a film auszukundschaften by one spulen from the back forward and was able to reveal all of the secrets of the Montags, whereas the (digital) CDs allow nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter, in other words, Makroportionen. </seg>
<seg id="39"> With the high-speed trains travel within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this by plane, including the switching requires three and a half hours. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It is therefore not exceptional, policy and communications technology come back on car and horse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> A final observation. </seg>
<seg id="42"> In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets have been forged between the messages. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At the moment, there are the messages, which demand confidential information from the press. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A year after the Copenhagen treaty, it is time to observe the fast gelösten funding pledges (including "Fast Start" or premature funding mentioned) to investigate were carried out by the developing countries. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And already the rough French vulnerable to blandishments revealed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With the Copenhagen Treaty have committed themselves to developing countries, 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012 will be set aside. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The EU has 7.2 billion euros over three years, promised France 1,26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On the occasion of the opening of the COP16, the EU has taken all register their partners from the fact of their commitment to convince the Fast-Start-Finanzierungen: accurate course report of its Member States, press conference, large side events broschüre distribution. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The operation of transparency is remarkable and appreciated for their real value: the developing countries and civil society would look like if all developed countries the same made at the same level. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The EU announced, 2.2 billion euros in 2010 to have released what they on the right path to Respektbezollung its commitment of 7.2 Dollar billion in 2012 will bring. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But if you look in detail, things are a little more complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should, according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional deployment was introduced without the expense of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means. </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the European Commission had proposed a harmonisation, certain member states, including France, have blocked the process. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today, everyone chooses the benchmark, which he considers to be the best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The European Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for the person of the Year 2009: the international funding will be maintained, and in the framework of the "fast start" funding over three years of 150 million. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries have similar benchmarks, either on year or about conditions at the level of public development aid will be elected. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In contrast, France has been of the opinion that the financing "of all the new projects," the year 2010 are "new and additional." </seg>
<seg id="17"> In other words: there is no guideline in the spending of the previous year, or at the global level of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Specifically, the report said the total amount of French aid can remain stable in the developing countries (or even diminish) - France is its commitment with regard to the "new and additional" financing must be respected. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is still no rule, and each elects its calculation method. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, such as France, for example, 1 borrowed as equivalent to 1 donated. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This is obviously difficult reasonable: the effort is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loans for certain profitable investment (often projects tied to emission mitigation, which are based on effektivster technology) can be justified, it is wrong to portray the euro as the equivalent of a donated euro captured... let only the cost of loans for capital donor country to be counted as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France has nothing else in mind than the following thought: it "respected" his commitment of 420 million euros by 91,5% loans (389,8 million) for the negotiation and 8,5%) 36,1 million euros) - see also the EU documents in order to convince themselves. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only EU country that loans in large measure on its territory. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) with their obligations to 100% to follow up with donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union 1 spends to fulfil their commitments, France just 10 cents and meant a similar commitment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Schöner! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Everything is operating in all of France in his fast start with a double rip-off: a part with a Weiterentwicklkung of action over the period and partly with the reality of the financial commitment. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France will be able to believe that 420 million "new and additional" million has been spent in accordance with its promises, it will save 36,1 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it would appear that Bercy was carried out of the arbitrage) a double negative impact could entail; even internally (why continue with donations from other member states if it is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries do not completely fooled... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter of the premature funding only a small matter in a relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions on the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it could drop too much in the huge machinery of the UNFCCC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Let us hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As it always is, it is essential to its lesson from this first year to learn verfrühter funding. </seg>
<seg id="36"> First, France could be a change in his Verbuchungsart parade for the years 2011 and 2012, and in the spirit of respect for its commitments and the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> But, above all, France could be the discussions on the contentious subject of long-term financing forward (another crucial and current topic): you can escape the issue of "Verrechenbarkeit" or the Verbuchungsart of its loans are not. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could change its position, as advanced in terms of controversy, as it is in other things. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The hope is the new Minister for the Environment Kosciusko-Morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A surprising announcement on the fast starts of France and its vision of the "Verrechenbarkeit," as well as the use of loans would increase by nature of the international trust needed for further discussions. </seg>
