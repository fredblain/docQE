Secret of komplexgeschüttelten canada lifted 
The new american diplomatenleitungen, which have been spread by wikileaks reveal the mystery about what the united nations under the inferiority complex of the canadians vis - à - vis the americans but consider; they are with the same blow the superiority open the latter to canada. 
Consequently, the american diplomats not surprised that the canadian voters in round the canadian - american relations, in line, and they believe that the visit by president obama had helped the conservative government, its budget from 2009. 
The four new communications between the american embassy in ottawa and washington, the public were being disseminated yesterday, still offer more juicy details than the mere substantial content, to which it has become very bad outcome. 
A link of 22 september 2008 affair, i. e. in the period in which the federal wahlkampage reported in full swing peripheral was, moreover, from what point the united nations is not participate more in line with their political leaders discussed operations. 
The great surprise david wilkins, of the american ambassador used in ottawa. 
Mr wilkins offers various explanation of this situation. 
"One the inferiority complex to canadians almost led the canadian, political leaders may, on internal disputes of everyday life much more to speak about this, as the united states in this election the buck (as in 1988, when the campaign on the free trade)," he describes. 
The united nations, are so he concludes, thus "the proverbial goliath this election: omnipresent, but potentially threatening, in order to talk about him." 
The ambassador understands this' deafening silence "even less, because the two countries have intensive political and economic relations. 
"Logically," he assessed, "the ability of one of the candidates, should be a party and much more of a party to hold such a essential relationship that the voters at the ballot box as a key factor in the sense." 
The other reads expression of this sense of importance in the on 22 january 2009 of terry breese affaires in ottawa, broadcast communication, the president barack obama on his first visit to prepare in ottawa. 
"Their journey will help, the persistence of the government in the vote of confidence at the beginning of february on the federal budget to ensure that canada during the first deficit after more than a decade will be aware, as a result of a belebungsprogrammes emerged in the eur 30 billion and $40 billion is," breese described. 
Nowhere he had mentioned, that the government had the house before christmas to postpone, in order to prevent that parliament would be overthrown by the coalition and the so - related persistence of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed belebungsprogramms. 
A further, from january 2008 affair and on the part of the ambassador wilkins wrote communication agreed washington of ever more negative image that the broadcast on cbc, dramatic series of the united states. 
The ambassador is concerned about programmes such as border, little mosque on the prairie, intelligence and h2o, in which little is subtle references to maher arar, the 'no - fly list "or even contributions for the purposes of by muskelprotze interrogations can witness of the cia. 
Yet another communication reports about it at length, such as hillary clinton in their french counterparts bernard kouchner during her first bilateral meetings then asked whether europe is prepared to incorporate certain prisoners from guantanamo. 
Mr kouchner should have the answer is' yes', but on the basis of an individual "" decision on a case - by - case basis. 
Àm at the end of the meeting, so a piece of paper, "he has described the secretary of state in terms of omar khadr, issued a 15 - year - old muslims canadian origin." 
"The secretary of state has promised, the acts through once again '. 
Finally, we note that the heated debates on the website wikileaks heated. 
Tom flanagan, an old and stephen harper very closely, advisers, was over cbc stated that the 'responsible for this massive leak killed "should be.
