More and more parents want to people - have controls, in order to control the kids 
Consider the fear for their own children grow and so more and more parents, to monitor them by gps. 
The system that was originally was invented to searching for cars, cannot in fact people places as well, which would also help in such cases, as the spurlosen disappearance of the nine - anička recently janatková. 
The equipment is currently about the same size as a cigarette packet but soon there should not be greater than a wristwatch. 
Many people, the case of the disappeared anička in fear and terror and they think, looking for ways and means to protect their children more effectively. 
Also for the price of a impairment of their privacy. 
To say 'we are endeavouring to all, that it is not herumspionieren, but an effective way to reduce the likelihood that it leads to the tragedy ," petr pilin macro because by society, and one of the suppliers of gps ortungsgeräten on the czech market. 
"I have to admit that it can come to the abuse of such equipment in individual cases, for example when it someone in the pocket, without that he know anything about it, but so far we have had no such case. ' 
'The most customers buy it really "for safety reasons, adds pilin. 
Its opinion that child but should always know what purpose the "box" serves is and how they are being used in the event of an emergency. 
The kinderpsychologin dana bočková notes, however, that a child, if it does not take such a thing may be, it is simply rid of. 
"Also very small children show a great creativity, when it comes to certain things, deliberately to lose if they do not want to be controlled." 
"The mobile phones awoken initially great expectations among parents, but they can be shut down as easily, as mrs bočková these new controls," said. 
Its opinion is also questionable whether such a body in the event of an attack actually help. 
"The kidnappers virtually always checked at planned kidnappings, whether the child has any electronics in, with which it could be located." 
"It is today the mobile phone." 
"If such controls were wider use, they also found, since their sale would certainly accompanied by massive advertising." 
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of police," says the psychologist. 
It has, however, that in a sudden attack by a paedophiles, similar equipment can be extremely helpful. 
Roberta čech rc monitoring by society, according to the ortungsdienstleistungen offers both for automobiles, as well as for people, the existence of such a piece of equipment can also then help if it immediately after the attack will be destroyed. 
"It is as the machine, that the respective positions in certain intervals circumstances it." 
'If it would be destroyed immediately, it is also available at least the final position of the person concerned. " 
"With more expensive equipment, even a neigungsmesser integrated; in other words, if we remain motionless hinfällt and are, sends out the equipment immediately a warning, indicating the position," claims mr čech. 
Its view, similar services could also do intelligent mobile phones with navigation, it is just a question of a particular piece of software einzuspielen. 
The problem with the current positioning is that it is either machines in matchbox - size, which resemble supporters or smaller mobile phones. 
There is always the risk that it loses. 
Mr pilin testing of according to the macro because, therefore, it is in the present equipment, as normal digitaluhren. 
"Which has the advantage that the potential attacker has not needs to recognise that it is a monitoring - or localisation device. 
"Or he notes, the only after a certain time, what the police there is a zeitvorsprung ', he adds. 
Regardless of the direction in which development is to armbändern or supporters, has always been used the same technology, as in the case of fahrzeugortung. 
So the combination of ortungsfunktion through the gps system (just as in the case of ms) in the car and the function of a mobile phone, which the current position.
