Cheshire - appeal draws attention to twitter 
Half a dozen or so you tippten in the riots in the courtroom. 
In the minutentakt verschickten you on twitter their reports on grausige testimonies. 
At the end, so the defence, there were more than 140 000 twitter - reports about the process in order to rape and beds gekettete children in a house that up in flames. 
Pursued attention on thursday, the process of steven j. hayes, who was accused, killed three members of a family from cheshire, connecticut, to have a formal end to find, if the judgment on the death sentence, the jury, falls. 
But mr. hayes lawyers have already tabled amendments in the court, explain the reasons for an appeal and the courts in years. 
One of the provozierendsten reasons is that it by the intensive reporting on the process - and also by the extensive use of twitter by durchschnittsreporter - to a "zirkusatmosphäre" and such a widespread, immediate penetration rebel details, so that the jury came in an improper manner has been influenced by the public indignation. 
This objection could appelationsgerichte act, to deal with the question of whether the new technologies can be new rules are necessary in the courtroom. 
'As i have seen it during this process, i believe that it is a real danger, if the arrival of new technologies in the courtroom influenced each individual' s right to a fair trial, "said thomas ullman, mr j.. hayes main. 
The presiding judge, jon c. blue by the supreme kammergericht, last week the applications by ruling short and concise back, when he said that the new media "would be carefully controlled ', and that there is no proof that the panel has been driven by passions. 
But this was certainly not the last word on this matter. 
For decades gerichtseinsprüche have discovered that the reporting on famous cases raising doubts about the fairness of a process. 
In his historic decision from 1966, the supreme court of the united states the judgment against sam sheppard, dr. a osteopaths cleveland have killed, his wife is lifted, and said in his decision, that because of the new media, it had been a "karnevalsatmosphäre in the courtroom." 
Some people believe that the tv and the movie "based on the flight" in this crime. 
Some lawyers say, gerichtseinsprüche, what mr. hayes sentencing a half - century later, could follow the argument that the new rules are necessary, communication from the courtroom, at the time of the if dr sheppard were still inconceivable to rules. 
"There is a good reason, on the impact of the new media in processes, which will be followed by a broad public," to be concerned, said john j. donohue iii, professor at stanford law school, the death penalty has studied in connecticut. according to his report, they arbitrarily imposed. 
Professor donohue said, some appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction out a prompt communication from the courtroom could make the processes fair. 
The 'twitter affair is only one of many, the lawyers of mr. hayes, in order to discuss for years and therefore delay a condemnation. 
The defenders of claim, for instance, that mr. hayes already been cage could be, as judge blue had not allowed you to test the reactions of potential judges, by giving them during the jurorenauswahl grausige tatortfotos showed. 
Some of the judges have said, photographs of the victims, jennifer hawke petit, 48 years, and their tüchter, hayley, 17 years, and michaela, 11 years, they have filled with horror. 
The defender say, they would also call into question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge mistakenly a juror have exchanged, a critic of the public prosecutor 's office was, and that he would have unacceptable pressure exerted on the judgment, as he had the unusual decision, the jury freely over the weekend. 
The judges were not isolated. 
But their arguments on the influence of the detailed report on the process, perhaps the greatest interest in itself. 
In a urteilsanfechtung, which you have tabled last month, it is clear that the case had dominated the news in connecticut and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the american senate has been discussed among the candidates. 
They argued that the new media continually the flames of the emotions rather than the case, would have rekindled. 
"Such a day - to - day crush of medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," wrote the lawyers, "we have seen in new haven, and perhaps not even nationwide do." 
Your emphasis on the reporting by twitter is controversial. 
In interviews some journalists, have said that the claim that these direct news are rabble than reports to be reimbursed for the slower, a technikfeindlicher view is, on the report on future processes verarme. 
But some of the lawyers said, appelationsgerichte would often faced with the argument, social and technical changes need of adaptation by the courts. 
Mr hayers lawyers reinforce this claim. 
In its action they were based on the decision of the supreme court of 1966, in the condemnation of dr. sheppard due to the reporting been lifted and made it clear that the new media require new rules. 
"This case," wrote, "she represents sheppard against maxwell of the twenty - first century."
