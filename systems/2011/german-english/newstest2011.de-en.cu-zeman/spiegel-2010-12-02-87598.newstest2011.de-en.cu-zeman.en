To hell, warriors! 
Does splatter to kunstkino? 
The orchestrator of nicolas winding refn testing with his combatants - rising "old genre epic poem" asian valhalla over - new borders. 
To which public may be the danish director nicolas winding refn have thought, as he has spun "asian valhalla over rising"? 
A prisoner vikings - warriors with only one eye (mads mikkelsen) liberated themselves from his tormentors and lays down with almost superhuman forces multitudes of his opponents in order - sounds ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because it is our hero like bolder use of murder and its enemies already time the gedärme from the vibrant tearing limb, if he has bad - tempered. 
However, as it is actually mentioned says einauge throughout the film not say a word, and also the other characters are more than time one or two sentences records or a few painful todesschreien. 
Otherwise, silence and in the gruselig fine hügellandschaft of scotland, the wikingerwelt offers the scene from around a thousand years. 
Ideal rather for adults cineasten with interest existentialismus and very calm kamerafahrten. 
Well, if a film several target groups, it is a shame, if they are mutually exclusive. 
Director winding refn applies since its wild and gestylten drug dealers trilogy "pusher" as a kind of danish version of quentin tarantino, refuses to stoically, but his works with a little more humour the mainstream or a little less brutality to make available to the arthouse. 
May well be the most kunstkino friends around spritzenden gehirnmasse and deter the gedärmen. 
The latest then die action fans before boredom, if einauge from free interpreted reasons with a force of violent christian missionaries via ship off to jerusalem and an eternity languishes in slack and fog, before the team apparently arrives in america and there continue to remain silent. 
No wonder, then, that "asian valhalla over rising" in germany has found no cinema distribution and is now only appeared on dvd. 
This is particularly important because the magnificent images a shame, but also because, behind the prätentiösen until bluttriefenden façade a sometimes hidden exciting piece of cinema and one that deserves some attention. 
In this film is not about dialogues or a stringent act, there is everything atmosphere, a filmgewordener fiebertraum. 
And from which there is no escape for the viewers. 
Refn at him scarcely a moment of détente and undertakes him with his frosty images and the dark trance cut - like soundtrack very slowly, but above all with the incomprehensible hatred of him from the hearts of the figures. 
Only a small blonder young, faithful to the einauge side is preserved, something like innocence, all the others are driven by anger. 
Most of all we never explained the one - eyed king hero, whose motives, but for enemies and temporary allies to warriors from hell will at some point, perhaps the ambassador of the devil itself. 
He also means, but perhaps only for the blighted anyway. 
"Asian valhalla over rising" is a puzzling film, who can be hate and admire, up to the unhappy, and wonder. 
An experience.
