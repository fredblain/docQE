The argentine, with the coin on the second champion hyped up, it is a step has lagged behind the victors and surprisingly it with the same team successive endspiele. 
The santistische strategist achieved the first endgame as coach in the 'torneo apertura 2002', as del morelia had the reins in the hands, with which he against toluca with 4 - 2; later, experienced a great defeat in the 'clausura 2003' he reached the crucial match, which he also with 3 - 1 against rayados lost.
