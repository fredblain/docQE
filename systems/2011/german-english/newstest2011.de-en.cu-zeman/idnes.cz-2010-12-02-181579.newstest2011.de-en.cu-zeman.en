The right mattress and the right bettenrost? women have other wishes than men 
Not the tollste bettrahmen, but the quality of liegefläche - in other words make mattress and rusteth the good bed. 
This must, however, harmonising, in order to fulfil the wishes of the specific user. 
Many things a role to play in the selection process - the weight, the size of the health and, last but not least, the sex of the schläfers. 
Equally important, is the interieur, in subordinate the mattress and become rusty. 
Typical example? 
In a wochenendhaus, in the regular heated, are latexmatratzen is not well suited to because they need to be "hot" for much longer. 
In addition, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethane - mattresses. 
And they should be regularly. 
If you do not have enough entlüftungskanälchen in heart and are still on a solid record, they so snarled humidity: it is not excluded, that under its mould. 
In the election, of course, also plays a role, and what we are used. 
Who was longer time abroad, where very high common mattresses with weichschicht will be difficult to have become accustomed to a low mattress with hard surface can. 
"All hockey player, from the nhl have returned, have complained to me that they are no longer able to sleep properly." 
"For their abgeschundenen shoulders goons and hüften, they simply need a weichschicht from visco foam (memory foam - a formgedächtnis - polymer)." 
"I recommend including diabetic people who suffer from a disruption of the nervous system, so that they are the 'information' can receive from the gelenken and skin bad," says sylva hadamcziková, the specialised in polstermöbel. 
I am, therefore, many years ago eishockeyspielern, but also other customers these mattresses concerned with visco foam (memory foam). 
"Today, it is no longer a problem because provide such mattresses. for example, the manufacturers. tempur, the italian firm magniflex or the czech manufacturers tropico." 
And we must not necessarily be a famous hockey player, they will learn to appreciate the benefits of the visco - schaums. 
This "miracle" actually works quite simply. 
The foam optimalisiert his rigour and form in accordance with the absorbed heat, in other words that he schmiegt downright on warm body. 
Nowhere is it, in the night shifts not around as well as a serious fight. 
We simply sleeping much better. 
The viskoelastische foam in addition to offering protection against dekubitus (gangrenous). 
In the election of the matratzengröße we need to height still along the length of the fußsohlen, i. e. approximately 21 to 34 cm. 
Men as women, to the 180 cm are in need of such a large 210 to 220 cm bed. 
Each of the liegebreite sleepers should at least 90 inches available, so together 180 cm. 
In einzelbetten, for example in singles are 120 to 140 cm appropriate. 
And also, for the sake of the comfort for any visitors. 
Otherwise the following rule of thumb for the ideals bettbreite applies: "if you on the back, should still be easy enough room for the angewinkelten poor ', advises helena prokopová, zunftmeisterin ing. the polsterer and raumausstatter, have been working for years the issue of healthy sleep and devoting ergonomics of furniture and also on this subject colleges. 
In a doppelbett, everyone needs a own rusteth and its own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattress also at the same level. 
Otherwise nothing else is left, as the roste in different level assembling and that is something that is not in every bettrahmen possible. 
Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high with federskelett 15 cm, mattress, should be at least three centimetres accounted for by the formschicht and the feinpolster. 
'With their hands or to sit down the feathers in any case felt "helena prokopová warns that. 
Every mattress makes a specific rosttyp required. 
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document as zusammengewachsene siamzwillinge have nothing to seek the bedroom. 
These mattresses not lift the veil and the terms, we cannot wash what today and there is already motion. 
And since we in a single night loses between 0.2% to 0.75 l sweat, it is clear that the mattress, after five to seven years, beginning to be a huge (and congested sieve). 
For this reason also experts sales patter reject, the lifespan of up to 25 years in mattresses, yes even lifelong guarantee promise. 
Every matter has its ifs and buts. 
And is therefore a practical council of the distributors: in mattresses of 120 or 140 cm broad should be the waschbaren hygiene, abziehbaren references to not hesitate, nonetheless, it is recommended that a matratzenschoner to deduct the it is easy to use and can wash. 
Even if today in the rule matratzenbezüge be established with rundumreißverschluss, so that they can get open after the two halves (immensely important for the waschvorgang and the waschmaschinengröße!), seems, especially the manipulation with greater mattress alone, often carried out as the unequal struggle between david and goliath. 
Have you in bed instead of a rostes firm record? 
Out so that! 
Or for a maximum of a bed for undesirable guests and for a single night. 
They should also provide the prosaic prefer with lüftungslöchern (if there are already not) and mattresses with federskelett and 15 cm minimum with so - called taschenfederkern and feinpolster use. 
Polyurethane - mattress on such a document not belong. 
For not verstellbare lattenroste with 14 to 18 federleisten (lamellen) are suitable latex - or sandwichmatratzen (where necessary. also combinations of latex and kokos), ever more figures are roste with a larger lattenanzahl, in other words, from 28 and more federleisten with lordosenstütze in the lendenwirbelbereich and the possibility to regulate the lattenhärte. 
On verstellbare lamellenroste with federskelett does not include mattress, since it is not on the ergonomische subterfuge respond. 
In addition to the attitude of the stiff federleisten also need special flexible schultermodule. 
We are talking about a specific securing the federleisten, which makes it possible to federleisten einzudrücken or even to verwinkeln so that they allow the selective einsinken the back of the schläfers. 
Particularly for men with broad shoulders an important matter. 
Indeed, there are matratzenhersteller which have started to use, "herrenmatratzen" weichzonen for the schulterbereich. 
Also the ladies is intended - you at this weichzonen in the hüftgegend. 
For ambitious clients are punktelastische flügelfedersysteme (lattoflex) or roste contact with punktelastischen - pads with so - called multitorsionsfederung. 
The pressure will be distributed on a number of points, thus reducing the tension. 
But, if we at the right mattress and right rusteth a bad (go to great and fülliges) kopfkissen used, lost most of the benefits. 
Here, too, a rule of thumb: the kopfkissen should uphold the head, its leaders should only up to the shoulders of rich, so that the schultermuskeln can relax. 
Ideal is therefore a huge 50 x 60 cm cushion, as it may, for example, the scandinavians. 
In the seitenlage should the kopfkissen (together with the schulterentlastungszone in rusteth or compensate the weichzone in the mattress) the schulterhöhe. 
To have our modern mattress with the former (hay fat) strohsäcken but common. 
Modern manufacturers use increasingly natural materials or at least whose mixtures. 
The new magic formula 'bio' also means in mattresses. 
Instead erdölrohstoffen we used for the manufacture of polyurethanschäumen are becoming increasingly frequent naturelle oils - rizinus - and soya oil, for example. 
Soya will probably used by manufacturers of all known. 
"Organic, in other words mattress which is at its heart from materials purely natural origin," says petr vašíček by the firm tropico plus. 
Naturstoffe but are also used in the manufacture of matratzenbezügen - it was one of the first aloe vera. 
But one can also be mikrokapseln sleep, the fresh pausing forest - or lavendelduft spread. 
Here too we make a difference between men and women. 
While the men a "kühlender" pflanzenextrakt from birkenblättern is used, so that the matratzenbezug can absorb the heat and cooling the body, have the salaries paid to women 'wärmende "effect. 
Extracts from red paprikaschoten rain the blood circulation to sleep, the weaker sex with so wohlig warm. 
And today 's favorite? 
Mattresses from kaltschaum (he has greater poren with zellstruktur destroyed and is, therefore, atmungsaktiver than standard polyurethane and also much more flexible). 
By the combination of the various stiff (tough) by kaltschäumen and visco - foaming does occur, the more zones - mattress know exactly where head, hip and closely. 
For a high - quality mattress, however, it has 7,000 kroner and more to fork. 
Gesundheitsmatratzen, but are usually burdened with lower vat, since they apply as medical device. 
The first czech companies have received this advantage gumotex. 
We see, but to save the mattress and on rusteth is not so easy. 
Now and again there are special of manufacturers and distributors, the two mattresses for the price of a offer. 
So the mattress duofreeze offers the brand magniflex with in relation verstepptem visco foam czk memory for 11.990. 
The second will be free to do so. 
It was the material tempur, the era of the viskoelastischen schaumstoffe with open zellstruktur and dense began in almost kosmischem pace. 
No wonder, when they were developed for nasa, because the astronauts are exposed in the launch huge excessive. 
Tempur in heat soft, operate in a cool it again. 
So it is the human body fits perfectly and distributed in the best possible way körperdruck. 
It is therefore not only increased ideal for prevention of druckbrand, but in general, schlafkomfort. 
Viskoelastische schaumstoffe, but not only in mattresses, but also in other gesundheitsprodukten, such as, for example, used in specific fußpolstern the legs and is intended to provide relief gefäßen. 
Local manufacturers use, for example, schaumstoffe eucatherm c, twinsaver or similar products.
