Sport and regelumgehung 
Tricks as by alonso and ramos, on game against the ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to circumvent a sanction. 
The supposedly by two players of the real madrid (xabi alonso and sergio ramos) instigated exclusion in the game of 23 november against the ajax in the champions league led to much ink has been about the fact, whether it is a unsportliche act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by the uefa. 
As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before match (playing their team had already been clearly won) time and several fouls, so the referee you showed the second yellow card. 
In this way, and as the real madrid would cite his group, the two players will meet the prescribed sanction in the next ligaspiel against the auxerre and so without maps in the next spielphase. 
Finally penalising the disziplinarkommitee uefa the coach of the clubs, josé mourinho, two games and the players involved with different sums of money. 
The provocation a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often to be found in the world of football. 
It is so widespread that they form part of the ethos of the unwritten rules - is being followed, but in this game. 
Part of the debate that have arisen is outlined the case to the fact that a team of the real madrid (the football club in its national anthem rotating and honour and on other occasions had chastised his players for similar incidents) are the major role, and to the drama by mourinho, of an episode its long history of more than theatralischer has added and provocative technicians. 
In any case, the debate about whether this does not explicitly banned by the statutes behaviour runs counter to the principles of sport, that is to say, whether these actions constitute a regelumgehung. indeed, this approach to the statutes of the sport, but whose sense seem to deal. 
In this matter should be examined the sporting damage caused. 
The sporting defends the physical integrity of antagonist that one aspect, which was not compromised by these acts, because it was not a aggressive game. 
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the players at fault an unjustified also benefit from the gegenteam. it did not happen. 
The paradox of the action of the players of the real madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally under deceit or regelumgehung understand, because the circumvention of the rules of procedure has not been secretly, in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as striking as possible, so that the referee will be punished. 
The players waited and took the sanction relish. 
Another question is what kind of benefit the offending from the deliberate fouls went. 
Here, it must be stressed that the rival has not been placed in a situation of disadvantage and benefits for erheischt played the game, because the obvious result of this action was that had to continue to its own team with less players. 
There is also no useful strategy for the next game, because then the club does not have these players. 
It is clearly the advantage that the next spielphase the players of the champions league without cards, which could threaten their participation in a future game, begin. 
But it is a long - term, up to a certain extent uncertain advantage, because the team might eventually leave. also gives a sanction the players with this approach and, in the second kartenzyklus on, in which you because kartenanhäufung with a card less than in the first cycle. 
It is not clear whether it is really is an advantage. 
At the end of the day, such practices are not directed against the sporting, belong to the strategic decisions also, of a to derive maximum benefit from the regulations. 
In this case, the players wanted to deal not a sanction (which would actually be a clear case of regelumgehung), they wanted to vote before, when they undergo this. 
They took a strategic decision to avoid without a punishment or refuge before her. 
Although blurs the border between inventiveness and regelumgebung is, i believe, that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness. 
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because there are two selbstausschlüsse was, and regelübertragung because of the way the cause. 
The damage that has been inflicted on the principles of sport through these actions, rather than ethical, is aesthetic nature.
