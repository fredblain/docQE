The demokatrische routine 
The democracy in latin america is more, as the support of private companies. 
Crime is a greater problem than the unemployment. 
In many parts of the region, brazil 's influence is greater than that of the united states. 
To these results, the latinobarómetro survey carried out in 18 countries and exclusively in the economist was published. 
This survey is being carried out regularly since 1995 and shows the meinungswechsel in this region. 
Two facts, particularly in this year 's survey of september and october in' s eye. 
Firstly, the good mood in latin america 
And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions. 
In many countries of the south american pacific coast has increased considerably the democratic movement (s table 1). 
In peru, for example, where the economy has been growing at an annual rate of around 6% since 2002, the number of democracy rose by 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. 
Also in mexico, where the economy recovers, since the sharp drop in the last year is such a trend. 
But only half of the people polled in mexico and brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, reducing the regional average (s graph 2). 
Around eur 44% of the respondents said that they be satisfied with their country 's democratic practice. these are as much as in the past year, however, 25% more than in the year 2001 (graph 3). 
Some 34% trust the congress of their country and 45% of their government. both values correspond to those of the last year, but show a clear increase in relation to 2003 (17% or 24%). 
Undermined latin america 's economic crisis a decade ago the efforts towards more democracy. 
This also lasted during the great depression, is perhaps due to the fact that the countries of latin america only have a brief recession, and a speedy recovery. 
In addition, the poor have been absorbed by a stronger net. 
(According to reports from the un economic commission for latin america by this week, the poverty in latin america only slightly and 2009 has fallen again this year in by 32%.) 
But there are strong stimmungsunterschiede from country to country (s graph 4). 
Brazil 's strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing president luiz inácio lula da silva is reflected in a widespread fortschrittsdenken. 
In mexico and central america, where it was the recession more tangible and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case. 
Only the second time since umfragebeginn see many respondents in latin america in the crime in your country a bigger problem than in the unemployment (s graph 5). 
Some 31% say that either they themselves or a person in the last year have been victim of a crime. but fallen compared with 38% last year, are the values and thus achieve the lowest level since 1995. 
The rising economic performance is reflected in the increased support private - and the market economy: around 71% of those surveyed cross said that the private sector is crucial for the development, in the year 2007, it was 56% (s graph 6). 
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can bring to your country progress compared with 47% in the last year. 
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in venezuela (retain this view and 80% are in favour of a private sector), even though its left - wing president, hugo chávez, many private companies nationalized. 
Brazil has according to 19% of respondents (18% in the last year) the biggest weight in the region, followed by the united states (9%, unchanged since last year), and venezuela (9%, compared with 11% in the last year). 
The respondents in mexico and the vast majority of countries in central america, on the other hand, see the influential country in the us, but this role in the dominican republic and nicaragua of venezuela will be accepted.
