Red bull prevails in the f1s with a secret weapon of siemens 
The dare be improved with a piece of software in real time. 
Since 2004 red bull in the world of formula 1, is your history in this splendid universe marked the speed of surprises and successes. 
Initially, no one paid the newcomer attention and, despite its sharply rising background to during the most recent seasons, the final spurt all last november to the victory of ferraris, by fernando alonso. 
Without the capabilities of the german pilots and champion sebastian vettel or the performance of the motors of renault, is to reduce the "secret weapon," the multinational siemens red bull in the hands, and that a siegerteam created, has become the legend. 
In reality is a powerful software to simulate processes, the 2007 to the german firm purposes, who do not have to do with motor racing to have on the market. 
This has been described as the plm informatikprogramm for the development of montageketten in factories in the world, energiewerken and precise instruments used. 
Goal is an exact reproduction or. simulation of a product or process, before this really is being built, so as to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs. 
Plm of canon, the development of the cameras, the aircraft of sukhoi - and of the most famous vehicles of nissan easier. 
Siegfried russwurm, head of the industrieabteilung of siemens, declared that, with the use of these software in the formula 1 - factory red bull 'within a few hours, almost in real time, "the changes and improvements to the race and in the tests are discovered, design and can carry out. 
Russwurm leads from that in 1992, in the race average working ten technicians, in only three or four improvements have been able to introduce a season. 
In red bully team are employed today, 180 highly qualified young people. with powerful computer facilities in analyses and all sorts of changes to the racing cars. 
The siemens managers said that the plm software is in a position to analyse all the components of racing cars of red bull with and to improve, with the exception of the motors, responsible for the only renault declared. 
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and safety will be changed. 
The changes, thanks to progressive production and high - tech autoclave within less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of simulators will be transferred to reality. 
The only border, which is set this insane technical perfectionism, is the $40 million, a formula 1 - team for their race must spend in a season. 
Red bull has its high - tech factory for the development and production of its racing cars built up in a 50 kilometres from london distant location. 
There are two buildings, where visits are very limited, particularly of journalists. 
Everything that is happening there is top secret. 
The workforce is 580 persons, including the two pilots, the champions of vettel and mark webber. 
But red bully true formula 1 - hero, zweifelslos the latest world champion sebastian vetell. 
Behind the enormous technological resources, the energy drinks - producer in the services of its participation in the tracks, hide other protagonists, whose support priceless and whose reputation is zero. 
The technologichef the plant, steve nevey, stressed that, five years ago, one could say that the progress made in the field of r & d for racing cars with 50% contributed to the victory and the pilots have been responsible for the rest. 
Today, the anteilswerte changed. the technology accounts for 85% of the success to 15%, while the contribution from the pilots estimated. 
Nevey acknowledges that vettel and webber can never be replaced by computer, because they "are not voraussagbare gladiators."
