An election 
No one had expected that the elections on 28 november would be perfect in haiti. 
But the facts surpassing the fears of the voters who rushed to the aid of the beleaguered country, by far. 
Votes cast, ballot papers on several occasions in the rinnstein overcrowded ballot box and intimidation, destroyed polling stations were only a part of the problems. 
Polling stations opened with hours late. 
Many haitians, many of whom have been displaced by the earthquake in january, around off in search of a choice. 
Lastly, some gave at all. 
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged front runners, because of alleged fraud demanded the lifting of the election results. 
It came to partly violent protests throughout the country. 
Nevertheless described edmond mulet, the head of the un mission in haiti, the election "than rather well in many respects." 
According to a cautious statement by observers of the organisation of american states and the caribbean community "to make these irregularities, so they may be seriously, the process does not necessarily" invalid. 
In other words, the show goes on. 
The electoral, supposedly the unpopular outgoing president rené préval and his candidates, jew célestin, is obliged, on 7 december the preliminary results will proclaim. 
The expected run - off is scheduled for january. 
There is still some hope in the election. 
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musicians, mr michel martelly and the former first lady mirlande manigat, have their initial ungültigkeitsklage withdrawn. 
If jew célestin, of the voters little or no agreement will take place, from the wahlberhörde declared the winner of the run - off, this could lead to problems. 
Because of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the victims of the earthquake was still living in tents, fear of a low turnout. 
On the day of the election, many haitians prevented by a lack of organisation of the vote. 
Shortly before wahlbeginn were approximately 250,000 laissez - passer on the election will be needed, not yet distributed. 
There is a great deal at stake. 
Look at the donor countries a legitimate, recognized government as an important step towards the reconstruction of haiti. 
The haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
