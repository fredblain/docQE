Their projectiles are intrinsically lasers with one objective soundness of just a few metres. 
The specific projectiles mould 25 mm, which were developed for this gun and contain dangerous explosive, practically in small grenades work. 
The shells can be programmed, so that it not only in collisions with the aim, but at any point of its ballistic trajectories can explode.

"We say time, people have measured 543 m." 
"If you abdrückt, invites the weapon firing on and the geschoss on the distance 543 metre plus minus one, two or three metres.
