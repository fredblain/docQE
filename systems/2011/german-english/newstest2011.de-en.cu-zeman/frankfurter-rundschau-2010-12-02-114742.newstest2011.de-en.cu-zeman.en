Inspectors in jeopardised 
The european food authority efsa is of genpflanzen undermine experimental industry. 
Now the group of experts testbiotech formulated this accusation, which as an independent institute for the analysis of the impact of biotechnology. 
"It sounds like a theory, but we have it well documented," said testbiotech head christoph then on wednesday in munich. 
The head of the efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, harry kuiper, and another efsa, also for years, an expert in lobbyistenverband ilsi under contract. 
The will of groups such as monsanto, paid nestle or bayer. 
Kuiper have significantly contributed to the efsa - test requirements for genpflanzen criticised and am in a clear conflict of interests, then. 
The efsa - rules are absatzweise word with position of the ilsi and carry so that the hallmark of the industry, which really is to be controlled by the authority in the italian parma. 
It is already the second time that testbiotech a interessenskollision criticism. 
It is a high - level efsa manager recently without restrictions or transitional period for the swiss agrarkonzern syngenta - and have changed sides. 
Also the mitteldeutsche broadcasting (mdr) had personal links between overseer recently revealed that what the eu authority and industrial lobby has made the environment as well as eu parliamentarians suspicious. 
However, the efsa can see no conflict of interest. 
We would like to pick up on all serious data, including the industry, as long as they are of a high technical quality, it says in an opinion. 
Of the experts who work for efsa, you do not, that they have no contact with the industry. 
They should disclose this but. 
Kuiper gives his work for the international life sciences institute (ilsi) in the united states. 
This describes itself as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and policy - among other things, the risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbyauftrag. 
Independent experts as then in the matter of criticism that genetically modified crops are at present without any feeding animals are permitted and the reaction of genpflanzen environmental shall not tested. 
"We want to know what, for example, of genetically modified maize on the field power," then says. 
Current practice is it, but only isolated proteins, not the whole genpflanze to test, which is no reliable results. 
"If you do not seeking the risks, as they should be asking then find? ', then accusing. 
This is also angelika hilbeck so. 
Since 1994 the scientist research in the genetic engineering and is currently working in the technical university of zurich. 
The industry attempts in this area, as in the united states now in europe, too, more and more critical scientists to influence or to discredit. 
There are therefore hardly researchers, not with corporations are intertwined. 
For businesses critical studies in the rule would not be published. 
"The industry the security," claims hilbeck controlled.
