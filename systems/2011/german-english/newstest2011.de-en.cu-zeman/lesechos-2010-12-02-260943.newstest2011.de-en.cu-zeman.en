Appoints the fifa world cup 2018 - 2022: the whole 
In the heat of the moment and because of corruption appoint the executive committee of the fifa and the ausrichterländer the world cup 2018 2022 on thursday, a highly political choice, in the influence - and the lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria in the background. 
One thing is certain, however: the issuing 2018 the queen of the fifa will take place in europe, of its traditional stronghold, (4 candidates: the united kingdom, russia, spain, portugal, the netherlands, belgium). 
The issue will 2022 something exotic; the international football federation hopes, after the first on the african continent in the years 2010 (qatar, australia) for new territories be able to win, or its establishment in the united states or in the far east (japan, south korea) to pursue. 
The list of personalities, belonging to the delegation (david cameron, prince william, josé luis rodriguez zapatero, josé socrates, bill clinton, the emir of qatar, the belgian and dutch government, zidane, beckham, cruyff) is the level of economic and political use of world cup. 
The machinations of behind - the - scenes threaten so until the last minute. 
Difficult otherwise, draw up a hierarchy of candidates. 
After the evaluation report by fifa, the english, spanish - portuguese offer (2018 and american (2022) acts bessseren arguments as their competitors. 
But these considerations for the 22 members of the exekutifkommitees to hour of choice not to be so important. 
The sunday times, with the need to create the suspension of two members of the exekutifkommitees (reynald temarii and amos adamu) at the beginning of the revelations state, could just as well the opportunities for their own country, can ruin cradle of football, which has only one single occasion was allowed to thrash out the world cup, namely in 1966. 
The bbc had been the breeding ground again on monday, by you had broadcast a documentary, of the three influential members of the kommitees, namely ricardo teixeira, nicolas leoz and issas hayatou under attack. 
Reason enough to alienate the fifa and the english to embarrass responsible, in the first instance, with david cameron had an intensive lobbying in these last few weeks. 
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the successful schachzuges by his predecessor, tony blair, in the years 2005 for london had achieved the organisation of the olympic games 2012. 
Would meet this intensive use, in order to restore to the image of england before the committee? 
Nothing is less safe, because the duo of spain, portugal there is no lack of success stories with its already finished stadiums, its expertise in spain (world cup 82, olympic games, 92 in barcelona euro 2004) and its fußballkultur in portugal. 
But the economic and financial downsides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions. 
The potential reprisals against the english and the doubts about solvency spain and portugal russia 's opportunities which, despite its loopholes in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become the weighty outsiders, increased. 
Prime minister vladimir putin has, however, decided that the candidly suggestion on the bezichtigungen in the english press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote 'on the part of the kommiteemitglieder denounced. 
"They bewirft you with filth, trying to make them to compromise," lashed putin. 
For 2022 appears to the united states, strengthened by the experience of 1994, the logical to be endorsed. 
First, the seat of the fifa - are major sponsors economic world power, the country seems a long list of benefits against japan and south korea, which have set a very good project separately. 
But these new candidates seem premature for two countries, who had the host competitions in 2002. 
Another threat: the long - awaited by fifa approve of the world cup 2026 for china, the asian opportunities for 2022 lapses. 
With australia and qatar, it with the appearance futuristischer stadiums had pulled out all the stops, fifa to pursue its extension towards new areas, however, these two countries is an even greater risk, because certainty. 
Australia might as well as japan and south korea from the akquittierten weakness of television rights (by the european countries have suffered due to the time), the sensitive nerve fifa.
