Secretly in the mid - 
In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband, argentina 's president, cristina fernández, a wave of sympathy, the their ratings for 20 points to about 50% upwards. this is the highest value since your election in 2007. 
However, whether it on a re - election next year, depends on whether the is visibly mourning cristina fernández compromises than her deceased husband néstor kirchner, your predecessor and political partner. 
The omens are not clear. 
Néstor kirchner, even after the election his wife, drew the economic policy, often budgets, the tax revenues, economic growth and inflation not fully into account. 
This allowed the präsidentenpaar, spend the extraeinnahmen as they see fit. 
On paper lost the fernández - government over the last year, the majority in congress. 
But the opposition is divided and kirchners death after a heart attack on 27 october has led to further divisions. 
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling peronisten, rallying around cristina fernández. 
But, after chaotic meetings (in which a parliamentarians another in the face, and other accused the government of bribes) the congress have not managed to adopt the budget for 2011. 
"I am not going to discuss," the president. 
The 2010 budget is now also true for the next year, thereby giving the president will have more opportunity to spend money as they see fit. 
The economy is hotly: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year. 
The official inflation for such. in 11.1%, but many private estimates - wage and the trade unions - drive the value at almost 30%. 
Kirchner, in 2003 the took office, as argentina was battered by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction on its main objectives, and not the inflationssenkung. 
He refused, bullying the private sector and the cooperation with the imf säuberte the national institute for statistics and census of the population indec which then the official inflation schönte. 
Can fernández a path that is mäßigeren now? 
It has the private sector and the trade union leaders called for talks. 
And according to official statements, wage increases are limited to 18% next year. 
Argentina 's high world prices for agricultural products have a strong boost to the economy. 
But the inflation undermined the spurt of growth through a great devaluation in the year 2002. 
Cristina fernández for this reason argentina economic may wants to return to the rest of the world. 
At the beginning of this year, the government took an agreement with the former owner, the restructuring of the country had rejected in the year 2001. 
Now it seems fernández on an agreement with the other donors to push from the paris club, which it owes around $6.7 billion.. 
The kirchners have had a review by the imf, as is customary elsewhere, always rejected. 
But in the last month, the minister amado boudou aware that the fund, the creation of a new national consumer "technical support" will make. it looks as if this is the first step towards the cleansing of the indec. 
It is not known whether fernández after the end of its term of office, even without the support by her husband will be politically active. 
If so, it needs to get the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of kirchnerism. 
If the argentines return from their summer holiday in march, the wave of sympatie, which she has been shown to be, abgeebbt. 
If you a further to win, it must decide whether they lift many political decisions quietly, her husband.
