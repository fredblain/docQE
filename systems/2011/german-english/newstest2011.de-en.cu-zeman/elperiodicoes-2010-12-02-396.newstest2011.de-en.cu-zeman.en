Puigcercós searching for the wink of an eye to close the carod peace in the erc 
The republican allows the party leaders, a secret vote on his persistence in office. 
Huguet, a pluralistic government and the end of the vollversammlungsprinzips proposes. 
Mr joan puigcercós appears to have found a recipe for the umpteenth time a internal uproar in the ranks of the following the loss of 11 members and half of the votes rudderless erc from the way to go. 
The party 's leader is aware that its threat of resignation the close of the former party josep lluís carod - rovira not enough. but he also knows that the influence of this sector is now so weakened as her mentor itself and it is not the same concern, such as other former currents of opinion. 
Therefore tried the leader of esquerra with a nod to win the new critics, which would ensure its position until the next elections. 
For the beginning announced yesterday that the over 200 regional council of erc could comment on his remain in office secret. 
With ballot papers, not with superior hand. 
If the carodisten the präsidenen wanted to miss a fine, they can do this, without having to fear of reprisals. 
Indeed, the head both the impression of division as also avoid the subjection to his person. 
In several interviews he confirmed that he would deal with half of the votes plus a not feel confirmed, and he added without any indication of prozentwerten add, a result of "in the bulgarian - style" is not good. 
The close carod are calling on president more than simply the party office available. an inadequate gesture, since puigcercós controlling the supreme body of the congress. 
But, since they do not have a sufficient majority to speeding up of resignations, they will agree with the chairman of a policy plan from now until may. 
For this, they expect in the drafting of this document on strategic reorientation, that the guidance on 18. the council will be put to the vote, to be able to participate. 
It is your intention to guarantee puigcercós. in return, these promises, the us congress in the autumn of 2011, whatever the leader already thinks is a fact. 
The leader of the erc is of the opinion that the "polyphonie" pity the stability and he wants a once and for all, to bring the organisation in the situation to wash their dirty linen behind closed doors. 
In this sense, the article which the president - in - office of the conseller josep huguet signed in his blog, symptomatic. 
In view of this, the puigcercós is an ideologue, felt that the holder of innovació it for a fact that the party 's leader "will be based in exchange for various objectives'. 
He was five on, two of which are at the forefront of consideration. 
Firstly, the 'restructuring' of the board, so that this represents at least 90% of the party, that is to say the inclusion of new faces from carods environment. 
The second could be the big news. 
Huguet proposes that erc should begin to abandon the vollversammlungsprinzip than functioning. 
So that verfechtet it is a reform of the statutes, which should make it possible to hold the congresses with elected delegates. 
By the end of the vollversammlungsmodells - an exception in the spanish party - is puigcercós' team, which has in the last two conferences fought for, obsessed with. 
Indeed, on the bebenden assembly of 2008, the party with the revision of the vollversammlungsprinzips at a congress, which should deal with the reform of the statutes, instructed. 
This deadline is still pending, infogle the internal aufruhe of recent years, addressing this matter was not advisable. 
Now, without the critical sectors are on the lookout, could be the time has come, in order to bring this matter again and for ever.
