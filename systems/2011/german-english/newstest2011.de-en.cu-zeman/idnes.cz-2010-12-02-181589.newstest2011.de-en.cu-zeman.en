The army has so many install detonators and that there is a czech republic umwickeln could you but only two years 
The czech army has 445 kilometres of install detonators, with explosives detonation purchased. 
In the year before the ministry of defence had already 224 kilometres zündschnur delivered to the army. 
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces for ausgesorgt 225 years. 
The problem is only the shelf - life of install detonators - two, but no more than four years. 
The army bought the install detonators, s. a. by the company stv group for mere 40 million kroner. 
In his explanatory statement for the purchase of this huge quantity zündschnur replied the general staff mf dnes, the soldiers would annually to the 60 kilometres zündschnur consume. 
The research of armeepyrotechnikern according to the mf dnes point raised, is for this information, that the whole army should every year a very intensive pyrotechnic training - of all the generals and officers of the armeekommandos, up to the secretaries and putzfrauen. 
Defense minister alexandr vondra and army vlastimil picek not excluded. 
Only in this way can the substantial annual consumption of 60 kilometres zündschnüren reasonably justified. 
In fact, this length corresponds 25,000 detonationen. 
But even so, these armeebestände for more than ten years. 
But if is the old rule of experts, that two metres to any new professional training zündschnur quite sufficient, then the army by this neueinkäufe - and also from the point of view of the increased needs of pioneer - and special units - created a reassuring supply for the above - mentioned 225 years. 
It complained soldiers of schnelleinsatzbrigade the defense minister vondra recently that they no longer have almost no cartridges for small arms, so that firing because of the lack of resources are severely restricted. 
Not to mention the unterhosenmangel. 
"Is also not a to me why they buy of us such huge install detonators." 
But that is ultimately your decision, you will already know to what they need it. " 
A good customer "for us, the army, which we want to meet when some traders largely," says the vertriebsmanager stv group jan děcký. 
Jan pejšek, the speaker of the defense establishes the purchase of hundreds of kilometres zündschnur the army has been so for at least ten years with this "bullets." 
Jan děcký is, however, only by the stv group of a four - year gebrauchsdauer install detonators and police - and armeepyrotechniker even only in two years' time. 
"With perfect storage are probably also mentioned the four years possible ', one of them, but wants to remain as a soldier not to be accused of criticism of the army. 
After the expiry of the gebrauchsdauer, any munitions are thoroughly tested, must be reliable, and if they are not endanger the lives of soldiers. 
These tests are not in vain, but cost more money. 
Another argument of the ministry of defence is the mengenrabatt for the zündschnur 445 kilometres away. 
"They cost us sixty per cent less than the last supply of 244 kilometres," spokesman pejšek tells us with the position of the purchasers of the defense. 
Only by way of comparison, the annual consumption of zündschnüren pyrotechnikern by the police, the munitions from the second world war, or of the soviet bruderarmee liquidate exceeds even some years hardly 1 500 metres. 
And ordered the police only always such quantities of these munitions which it before the end of the gebrauchsdauer can consume. 
Already the security of pyrotechniker because, in addition, there is the possibility of more modern and flexible shopping, therefore, also, reliable install detonators open. 
The ministry of defence has already huge problems in the winding - up tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the times of warsaw, when the treaty zweihunderttausendköpfige czechoslovak army prepared to their campaign on the rhine. 
The pyrotechnikern according to the mf raised dnes expected the czech forces in a few years, the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres age install detonators, which today you "good" has purchased.
