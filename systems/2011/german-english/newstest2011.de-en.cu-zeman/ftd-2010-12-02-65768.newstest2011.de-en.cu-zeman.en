Ogoniland is burnt 
The water in the rivers is ölbraun it smells, such as the station: billion litres of crude oil ausgelaufenes have destroyed the nature in ogoniland in nigeria. 
The people of theft, corruption and illegal ölkochen. 
Celestine akpobari believes it is good. 
"Do not spread,," reassured by the ökoaktivist journalists: "you 'll still enough oily slime before the lens through wars." 
The 37 - year - old nigerians has followed the attempt a until the breast in water watenden young with the schlieren surrounding it abzulichten: in the regenbogenfarbenen wasserglanz, the scene almost nicely. 
That, under the surface brown rohölschwaden threat is not to see. 
Sooner have told you here eimerweise shrimps, esther badom on the shores of bodo - jetty river. 
Now is the sluggish fluid waters completely dead. 
Five years ago poured from a geborstenen pipeline loads of crude oil in the huge wetland. 
Fishermen from the nearby city rowing bodo must now six hours, in order to reach fischhaltige waters: the located at the heart of the niger delta ogoniland applies as one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world. 
On the journey by means of the river basins criss mangrovensümpfe noticeable is the full extent of the devastation. 
Instead of bright water wühlt this motonaútica brown brühe who his hand out into the water is, ölige finger. 
The roots of the mangrovenbäumchen stand out as black lakritzstangen from the soil, sad sporadically to palms their wedel depend. 
Vogelschwärme, such as is customary in wetlands otherwise, one looks in vain: as soon as the außenborder silent, spreading in the former paradise haunts calm as a filling station riechenden from. 
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says celestine akpobari gloomy: "we live in constant danger for the health." 
The war is a good one. 
The settlement of the ogoni is a disputed battlefield for decades: there were more than 60 years ago the first explorateure from europe, here are organised in the 1980s, with the later executed writer ken saro - wiwa the first opposition, here the shell corporation 1993 had to abandon its production, because it has been for its oil workers too dangerous. 
Even today is the companies have denied the right to return to ogoniland: while from the whole of the delta region of the triple the size of switzerland, with over 5 000 bohrquellen and more than two million barrels a day of the 7 000 kilometres pipelines being pumped black gold, are the oil fields in ogoniland collapsed, the situation is too unstable the corporation. 
Every couple of hundred metres stand out steel gestelle as bizarre sculptures out of the water: "christbäumchen ', the heads of boreholes much to be zärtlich mentioned. 
They are up to 50 years old, the most corroded to the core. 
Ever stop such a bohrkopf again apart, akpobari believes that then rinne a constant stream of crude oil into the water. 
More than two billion litres of are channelled into the ecosystem of the delta after experts in 50 years: every year, the quantity of oil, as they are in the shipwreck of the supertankers' exxon valdez 'into the sea 21 years ago in alaska drive - one of the biggest environmental disaster in the history of mankind. 
Who is to blame for the continuing eco - meltdown, it will be. 
While the shell - sabotage and the group organised öldiebstahl blamed for more than 90% of the pollution, see environmentalists berstende bohrköpfe and leaky pipelines as the main culprit. 
Shell in nigeria, much lower safety standards than usual else in the world, the us - scientists richard steiner accused the corporation in 2008: the rate of defects in the pipes alone was "are several times higher than elsewhere." 
In one place, from the distant as a deserted, looks workshop in the open air, from the oil mangroves on: they are splitternackt and ölverschmiert up to our necks. 
Under one of the many barrels, partly linked to vessels, partly arbitrary dispersed identified are on the premises, future a fire: an illegal kleinraffinerie. 
In barriques will the crude oil on the fire declared heated for several hours, michael, the head of the group. 
First pressing petrol through the pipes in the auffangtopf, and later at the end of the leadership spits kerosene finally diesel. 
So produce michael and four employees a day to four barrels diesel à 300 litres: "this brings us 34.000 naira a" - - roughly $22. 
The use deltabewohner chronic treibstoffknappheit in the largest erdölstaat of sub - saharan africa. 
Nigeria has only on a single refinery. 
The with just eur 40 cents per litre ridiculously low diesel are still able undercut the illegal kocher: because their raw material you are in vain. 
He comes from "bunkerern," the pipeline across ogoniland tap: in this way are the country according to experts in the niger delta every day lost at least 16 million litres of crude oil. 
Only a tiny part of the provisionally intermediary raw material, however, will fill illegally processed: the lion 's share organised criminal networks, including politicians and high - level military should belong in tankers and selling him on the world market. 
The debate about whether the environmental disaster more to the activities of the population or the lax production is due, does the activist akpobari for purely academic. 
"The oil companies would not perceived as intruders so thoroughly and they would have the livelihood of the fishermen do not destroyed, there would be neither sabotage or theft and illegal refineries." 
Now is the ratio of the ogoni, above all, to shell destroyed but so that only a withdrawal of the company 's question would be: "may ask is other nationalities as the chinese than better." 
As michael nervous. 
"High time that you, 'says the muskulöse" disappears. 
"Every minute can come the soldiers." 
Will the illegal ölveredler caught the special forces, are in danger of you may not arrest, but a painful bribes. 
Also want to the soldiers originating mainly from the north - as all nigerians - benefit from the raw material. 
"This bloody stuff has brought our country in every respect to the dog," says akpobari.
