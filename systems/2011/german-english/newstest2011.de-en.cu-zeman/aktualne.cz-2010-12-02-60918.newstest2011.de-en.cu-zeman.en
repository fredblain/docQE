What can you do, the čssd? the czech social democrats in prague are not aware of voldemort, nor the "employs." 
The new ratsherren of capital from the ranks of čssd will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers, to their old - new colleagues from the ods in prague council and in the stadtvertretung to be able to understand at all. 
The newspaper aktuálně. cz members of the new council has cut off from the čssd time a little ,"" as they dominate the notorious slang, which has been established in the last few years, in which the current coalition partners were in prague at the helm. 
The encoded vocabulary, in the, era of mayor pavel bém was introduced by the prague political elite is, some of the most prominent actors, situations and causae borrowed. 
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils in relation to these new concepts something groping in the dark. 
The claim that it is at least. 
"Who is voldemort?" 
"No idea." 
"I am a newcomer rather in the prague policy ', lukáš responded kaucký, the new ratsherr on culture, on the test of the" godfather - vocabulary'. 
But also the ratsherr karel březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar way. 
For example, on the concept of 'golfloch'. 
"It is the only expression of which, i present here, which i use now and again." 
"I do not think otherwise a lot of often infiltrated by slang." 
For the vocabulary, the tageblatt aktuálně cz in this june had before the electoral congress of the ods published, pickte the editors six concepts, particularly those that are notoriously associated with the prague magistrate. 
The social democrats should the concepts of "voldemort," "the greatest prague golfloch ',' in the employs,," "stiernacken," "betrayal of the capital," and "verblechen" define. 
Three prague ratsherren agreed to the test, the fourth - mr weinert, the future head of the prague school system - promised first its participation in the conversation, the listeners, but then did not time. 
The fifth ratsherr, petr dolínek, rejected the test from the outset. 
"These things are indifference to me whether and how the civic democrats with each other, as i do not judgments." 
'Is important for me, as we understand, "he responded within the framework of our programmes. 
As already indicated, lukáš would have kaucký in the above - mentioned headline supposedly not recognized that the influential entrepreneurs and friend of the ex - mayoress bém, roman janoušek is the speech. 
The term 'voldemort' kaucky purely says nothing at all, and the only concept, the he was on the test erriet correctly, "the greatest prague golfloch." 
"It is the tunnels, blanka," says kaucký, added to security but still: "but i know this from the newspaper rather." 
And jokingly: "i will be required to attend a language." 
The "golfloch" will not only by matador karel březina, but also by the councillor for the environment lukáš plachý rightly described as tunnel blanka them. 
Both social democrats know but also, for whom the concept of voldemort and lukáš plachý senses even to find, where this figure and this is also what it means to "in the employs to go." 
"I believe, in other words, to go into any prague gastronomiebetrieb ', plachý is quite close to the solution to the problem, when we know that there is the seat of janoušeks firms. 
In line with březina, but he claims this knowledge to have drawn in the newspapers, rather than to him this vocabulary, it would be. 
According to the testteilnehmern judgments, it seems to give amongst the social democrats is really no similar naturalisations slang. 
"I asked my colleagues too, but obviously there are something we really not." 
"We call upon us by name, and we also use acronym or nicknamed" again, says the chairman of the prague čssd petr hulínský of his party rather loosely, called 'hulda'. 
"I bříza (birke) was called in the school, but i do not know whether i am also mention my colleagues so ', tells us karel březina its nicknamed. 
The newspaper deník cz has tried and see aktuálně. there, and it works. 
Ratsherr weinert is for the party friendly 'grandfather' or less friendly the "old" miroslav representative saying that before the elections by machinations at party sponsorship in drew attention, is "igráček" (known by some colleagues czech lego - figure). 
Nicknamed are so the only, the social democrats in the whose language allow that to happen. 
Hulínský it may not, if it 'hulda supposedly', but deník aktuálně. cz registered or other nicknamed the prague chairman. 
Be dubbed 'doctor of gummiknüppel - rights' has allegedly to do that petr hulínský its title doctor juris at the bratislaver police has acquired.
