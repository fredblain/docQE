Weak applause for china 
Taiwan 's voters is slowly approaching a closer link with the continent. 
What is beyond the straits taiwan by its big brother? 
On 27 november, are more than 7.5 million voters, the 70% of all voters, on, in order to the five municipalities to elect mayors and local councillors. this will be seen as a wide - ranging evaluation of the president ma ying - jeou. 
Through the establishment of cutting - edge business, einschl. a partial free trade agreement, ma itself is a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland. its policy the relationship to the chinese mainland has changed since 1949 sustainable for the first time. 
Ma has the test, but only short. 
Although his kuomintang (kmt) three of the five - party mayor, it received no votes. 
Instead, the democratic progressive party (dpp), which advocates a greater independence for taiwan, almost 50% of the votes, the kmt received 45%. 
In a presidential election would mean this for ma problems. 
Since his election two years ago is the vote his party fallen by around 8%. 
For the first time, the dpp even in the local councillors, together with the kmt. 
During the election, there was the usual events in taiwan as convoys of lorries with rioters, from the flags - schwenkende massenumzüge and only scantily clad dancers. 
There were even the obligatory, mysterious attempted murder. 
Sean lien, the son of lien chan and honorary president of the kmt, on the eve of the election of a speech on a kmt - candidate, 
As back him, a man from the amount to a slap in the face. lien wounded and a umstehender spectators was killed. 
Bizarrerweiser, it is not clear whether the save lien wanted to kill or settle a dispute with the candidates. 
Quite apart from that, the attack according to tsai ing - whom, the leader of the dpp, the election and affects the dpp brought in a bad light, what the kmt has brought more votes. 
Perhaps china was the biggest winners of the campaign. 
Remarkably, was not addressed the relations with the mainland. 
Instead, debated the candidates on plans to housing and the creation of jobs. 
The taiwanese love their de facto independence and china 's militärbedrohung reject. 
For this reason, not like the kmt their relations with the government in beijing to the fore. 
But this also avoided the dpp, to stir up the anti - chinese feelings too much. 
You responded to this new awareness that taiwan 's economy cannot survive without china. 
Ma its would confirm that the majority in favour of the taiwanese his china policy. 
The government in beijing will continue to pursue its strategy attract taiwan with economic incentives in the community. 
China sent a negotiators after taipei, immediately in order to prepare a summit to investment and medical cooperation. 
Certainly it wants a political integration, but first and foremost. 
It is waiting to prefer until after the 2012 presidential election. 
The dpp has reinvented in the meantime. 
Two years ago it was greatly weakened: the former party leaders chen shui - bian sat in prison for corruption. 
During his presidency, from 2000 - 2008 he was strongly for the absolute independence. 
But under tais reign has developed into a new generation gemässigter politicians and the dpp struggling to find the voices of working and the youth. 
Tsai was as presidential the dpp great approval, like su tseng chang under chen. 
Your party is now doing everything, in order to show that it is also in a position to establish close relations with beijing. 
Tsai is planning a think tank as a point of contact between the dpp and china. this presupposes, however, open - minded discussions. 
Tsai stated publicly that your party a "reliable alternative" to offer mr mas vorschneller rapprochement with china. 
Chen seems very annoyed about this change. 
From his cell, he declared that the candidates for the dpp would have done better to have to insist on taiwan 's independence. 
He called for the pragmatists su even to renounce the presidential candidacy. 
Even without chen 's interference, the dpp is difficult to choose their potential candidates. 
The kmt will need to undergo a own selfanalysis. 
Ma 's values are badly, despite the rapid economic growth; the kmt - candidates wanted to lead their campaign without him. 
The main reasons for his unpopularity unemployment and seem to be the increasing gap between rich and poor. 
According to a statement of a kmt - spokesman will transform his cabinet and the local bodies. 
The strong emergence of the dpp suggests, that taiwan is a rapprochement limited supports. 
While at the same time, the most taiwanese the economic cooperation with china as inevitable. 
According to antonio chiang, a prominent columnists, "there is already a point of no return."
