A knochenhaus fascinated even after 100 years. if you look at the interieure of gaudi 
The roof seems to as the backs of prehistoric echse the stairs as the vertebral column, a dinosauriers and the balkone are aufgerissene fischmäuler. 
This is the casa batlló of the catalonian architect, antonio gaudi in barcelona. 
This house of the local inhabitants with its organic forms the nicknamed "knochenhaus." 
Organic forms, wild paints, the unusual use of coal, kachelsplittern and mosaic, to shed like facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all of these are typical features on the jugendstil of antonio gaudi. 
The façade of the house plays with beautiful lines, zärtlichen paints and texturen, the recall nature and living creatures. 
Only on closer inspection noticed that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order. 
In the night, the whole façade, plastic, dramatic and the specific anleuchtung exacerbates the glory for the colours. 
The same dynamic lines and tortuous forms dominate the home of the house. 
Creates ripple formed wood copied the window frames, banister, zierelemente of doors, and even gucklöcher. 
The house batlló in the quarter eixample the busy shopping passeig de grácia no 43 was created by the restructuring of a house 1877 from the years, the architects emilio sala cortese said. 
The reconstruction has taken two years and was completed 1906. 
The investor, the wealthy industrial josep batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he voted by the idea gaudís in an unusual and also cheaper condition. 
This does not, however, mietshaus casa batlló devised antoni gaudí alone. 
He worked at the same time with the architects josep maria jujol together. 
Stems precisely on the drawing board the rhetorical flourishes housing for the representative of the realitätenbesitzers and also the use of mosaics in the facade was his idea. 
In the design of the façade worked but also many other bildner and artists. 
The joint work on the drafts of the casa batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation of jujola and gaudí. 
So jujol also participated at the construction of gaudís house casa milá in the park güell, in which there is also another works by antoni gaudí. 
This house very shortly after its completion of the local inhabitants of its organic forms because the nicknamed "knochenhaus." 
Others called it the specific fensteröffnungsmechanismus for the "yawning house." 
It also says that at the top of the building is the sword of holy georg, of patrons portrayed by catalonia. 
But also other bildhauerische elements of a symbol of hidden religious motives. 
Gaudí devised for the house a unique zentralheizungssystem, with entlüftungskanälen and typical for the time kaminen. 
Rather bizarre seems their 45 - degree tendency already. 
In his create ignored gaudí consistently all building codes and did not at the time of this ideology. 
Before start of construction holte although it from the city the appropriate planning permission a but the claims made by him on the planned reconstruction were so vague that the stadtväter two years later in the completion so horrified demanded by the result was that they remedy. 
The ratsherren met, among other things, also bear in mind that the construction with its pillars even in the public sidewalk intervention. 
It to amendments, not more, however, quite the reverse, in fact - only fifteen days after the relevant call from the neighbourhood, josep batlló a request for approval of the lease of the two höchstgelegenen floors of the house - and they were given him promptly. 
Even, in the lower echelons of homeowners. 
The 2. stock in the gallery there was a gesellschaftssalon, on the third floor were the bedroom and privaträume of housing. 
The ground floor was of a juweliergeschäft leased. 
The whole sechsstöckige buildings undergoing a stairs up to the dachterrasse. 
By the fundamental elements to dismantle all right corner and precise lines have been removed and replaced by bent and geschwungene walls. 
Gaudí but also worked with a modern approach of mutual link rooms. 
The social part is completely by the opening up of the salontüren chatting combine and a greater society could comfortably, without in vertraulicheren talks on a certain intimacy must dispense with. 
The house has been given by gaudís restructuring apart from a new façade is also a rather unusual roof and two further floors. 
Is also gaudís impressive game with the light, and the blue and white glasierten kacheln, with which the inner disguised and the lichthöfe. 
The game of these two colours gives all floors of the house a maximum of light. 
Mind he simply to capitalise on the principle that know better reflect the light, as dark colours; on the contrary, the sunlight to absorb. 
The house casa batlló that 2005 was included in the world heritage list of unesco, can today everyone visits. 
In the first stock is the geräumigste and prächtigste housing made accessible to the public. 
Until the year the homeowners decided to take this step and that on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the famous creator. 
As you said, that this is a very profitable business, it has maintained the surveys, indeed we extended you also on further common and the dachgeschossräume, including the dachterrasse from. 
However, the price to visit the monument is no trifling matter, it is 16,50 euro, students, retired people, groups and holders of touristenausweisen get 20% reduction. 
This amount exceeds the eintrittspreise to other gaudí, buildings in the city. 
Who know the real atmosphere of the house with his drachentürmchen would like to learn, should try to close friendship with one of the hausbewohner and visit him at home.
