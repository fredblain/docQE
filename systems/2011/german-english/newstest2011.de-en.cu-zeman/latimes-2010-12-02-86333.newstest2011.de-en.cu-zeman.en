Arsenic - resistant microbe could enable new life or elsewhere in the world 
The discovery of a foreign variety of bacteria can live, for example, of arsenic, opens up new possibilities for new ways of life on earth, and elsewhere. 
Although researchers discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, in your view, it is a sign that a life without the so far too regard as vital elements is possible. 
"This body has two options." 
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." 
"The makes it a very particular reason, even though it is almost a sort of 'alien' way of life ', paul c. w. davies declared by the arizona state university and co - author of the report, on thursday in the online edition of the magazine science seems. 
So far, there have been six main elements - carbon, hydrocarbons, nitrogen, regarded as a vital oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur. 
But as the scientists figured out, is growing the bacterium in california 's mono lake even further, even if it phosphorus replaced by arsenic. 
"Because otherwise, one wonders what is still possible," said the co - author of the report ariel d. anbar of arizona state university. 
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists must recognise, as life and its forms of anbar. 
The study deals with microbes that have been found on the planet. 
The announcement of a press conference, in which there is no details were given to the discovery of known, gave rise to widespread speculation on the internet, that the report of the discovery of aliens life could act. 
This is not the case. 
The discovery "shows that with the help of other elements biochemical processes in other planetensystemen organisms can set in motion and that the 'standardelemente', which, in our opinion, are absolutely vital, not necessarily see have been laid down," declared charles cockell, professor at the planetary and space sciences research institute of the open university of milton keynes in the united kingdom. 
Cockel was not part of the research teams. 
"This work is a novelty, because it shows that an element in fundamental biochemical processes and structures can be replaced by another," cockell added. 
This discovery was not accidental. 
Felisa wolfe - simon by the astrobiologischen institute of nasa, who chaired the study, chose the mono lake because of the high arsengehalts. 
Since arsenic and phosphorus chemically same, they are exposed in that microbes that both, perhaps an element by can replace the other. 
"The toxicity of arsens is based above all on the fact that it is behaving chemically similar as phosphorus." 
"By these organisms are finding it hard to distinguish, an element from the other." 
"But the difference is so great, that acts as a phosphorus differently arsenic. it in our biochemisches system, where it covered almost everything," says anbar. 
The researchers, the bacterium gfaj 1 a rising arsenkonzentration. it suited to and grew. 
The microbe is in phosphorous better, but that they also can survive in arsenic shows that a arsenic - based way of life, of course, can occur, either on the earth, or on a different planet or moon, on the arsenic often. 
According to mrs foster, dozentin for microbiology jamie s. at the university of florida, is the idea that phosphorous can be replaced by arsenic, not new, but so far there were still no functioning example. 
Arsenic came in the early erdjahren more, she says, the science is based on the assumption that early life it have been used. 
"That gives reason to believe that life is also can have developed differently than in the early geologically important period ', so forster, which was not a member in wolfe, lord simon research team. 
The research by nasa were supported, the energy and the national health authorities.
