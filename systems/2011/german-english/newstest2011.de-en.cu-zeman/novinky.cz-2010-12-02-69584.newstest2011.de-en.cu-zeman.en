A long finger than ringfinger means a lower risk of cancer of the uterus 
Men, whose finger long, than ringfinger, are is obviously a lesser risk, prostate cancer of the uterus. 
This is a surprising result of a study, which was published on wednesday by the british journal of cancer. 
This is the mirror of the male hormone testosterone contexts. 
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer and this specifically in men and 60," declared the joint author of that study, company ros eeles, professor on cancer research centre at the university in warwick. 
The finger could help to determine what men is necessarily a prostate cancer - test should, above all, if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as, for example, family health burdens, mrs eeles added. 
In the period 1994 - 2009 we had with their colleagues in britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time also 3000 healthy men. 
In more than half of the participants of the study was the finger right - hand shorter than the ringfinger. 
For these men was the same likelihood of prostate cancer, as well as for ring - vaccination and 19% of those men, whose finger were the same length. 
In men, whose finger longer than the ringfinger was, however, this risk fell by 33%, to sixty even by 87% for men. 
The relationship between the length of the two finger, mentioned the forming itself in prenatal age, obviously reflects the different mirror of sex, which was subjected to the child in the womb. 
Less testosterone responds to a longer finger. 
Former research show that it is precisely the testosterone accelerate the growth of prostate cancer. 
Václav pačes, leading czech geneticists and former chairman of the academy of sciences, čtk said that he was aware of this study fleetingly, nevertheless consider it the relationship between the fingerlänge and the risk of cancer have so far not proven for "no."
