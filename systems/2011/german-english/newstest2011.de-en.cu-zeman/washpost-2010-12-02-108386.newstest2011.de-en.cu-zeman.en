Can combine courtesy that which divides us? 
Following a campaign to schimpfwörtern and negativity little courtesy in washington this week has broken out. 
It is the omen of genuine zweiparteienkooperation or a moment the illusion that before we quickly back the struggle of the parties in the capital? 
The meeting between president obama on tuesday and leaders of the congress, no breakthrough in the major issues, with during the so - called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government, in which no more decisions be taken, had to employ. 
After all, what we have heard, it was neither a polite debate between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode a partisan punktesammelns. 
The public deficit of the president on wednesday meeting was also civilised, despite the political differences that exist between the members continue to exist. 
It seems clear that, to be a close interaction over a period of months can create a mutual respect, the ideological divide, which continues to separating the members to make. 
This is hardly enough to claim that it is a new era of cooperation. 
Both sides are now in a test phase - in the one of the other signs of the cooperation and compromise, while it tried to the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a renewed parteienkriegsführung. 
Therefore, the meeting on tuesday were itself and its assessment by the participants of demands or accusations limited to a minimum. 
The philosophical differences between obama and the republicans are too large and too low, given that a rapid change in the atmosphere, which prevailed in the last two years, might expect. 
Whether we are talking about taxes, donations, health and pension rights, the two sides are miles apart. 
Last but not least, the novemberwahl washington has at least mild voted for a short time. 
"No question, the tone has changed," said pete wehner, an official representatives of the bush government, which now for the "ethics and public policy center" works. 
"After elections this is inevitable. 
Elections again give partisan passions, the death. 
And that is a good thing. " 
In some issues, particularly in those that are on the agenda of the "lame duck session ', republicans and democrats have barely a choice, than to find a solution'. 
Bush 's tax cuts, and no one is in favour of the end at the end of the year. 
Both sides want to find a way to some or all receive, whether it is temporarily or permanently. 
A compromise on the increased unemployment is also to be expected, if only because the republicans cannot afford that it believes that the tax cuts for the rich, while they favored unemployed workers reject a support. 
After the meeting on tuesday at the white house is increased, the optimism that in these issues during the "lame duck session 'some can ratify and, at the same time, the new start treaty. 
But william glaston the brookings insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent questions the lame duck session 'does not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation of the parties must, if the new 112 will convene. congress in january. 
Instead, he says, is a phase of the nichtübereinstimmens likely, perhaps even essential. 
"After the things that have to be done, which is done, will turn this short - term psychology in confrontation," he said. 
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - leads the courtesy of true cooperation. 
"I see a lot of what is happening as an vorkampf by 2012, as of today, or shadow for the main of 2012," he said. 
The reasons for this have a great deal to do with the presentation of new republican majority in the white house and everything to do with the teeparty - voters who were serve their education. 
As the republican leaders also concerned may be that you vie too high, you know, that they must try to their promises, to reduce the expenditure of the government and the health - care reform to be repealed. 
This party are already in the first reactions in relation to the recommendations of the deficit, which is a tax reform and the raising of certain taxes, as well as the increase in the retirement age and the lowering of public spending. 
The deputy chairman alan simpson and erskine bowles have one of the most difficult jobs in washington and have, in accordance with their own assessment, so much insisted that the defizitfrage on the public agenda, that they can no longer be ignored. 
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the commission, in order to make their plan to official recommendation and they are fighting, in order to come even in the vicinity of this figure. 
The greatest resistance will take place in the elected representatives of the body, because in finance, today at least, is little room or little sympathy for compromises. 
Galston tells us two stages in the fight between the white house and the republicans in congress. 
The first fight will take place in the form of parteizusammenstößen next year, when the republicans obama challenge in terms of the state budget, taxes and the health system, then followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation. 
What will lead to this change? 
The public opinion. 
It is a proven fact that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of americans are still hopes that the two parties work together. 
If confrontation in a cul - de - sac, as has happened in 1995, then both sides must have a careful look at the public reaction. 
Whoever is doomed to lose, will change the approach and the compromise must be sought. 
This may in fact be an optimistic view. 
Partiality and polarisation today are greater than in the mid - 1990 's, and they seem a greater ideological divide between obama and the congress - at the time to be republicans than between president bill clinton and the republicans. 
While at the same time, the activists of both parties of consistency 2010 as a mere prelude to a far greater 2012 election. 
Seen as may be borne the courtesy to flaunt the this week will be welcomed by many americans. 
But it will require a great deal of more effort on both sides, to find a common denominator in the issues that the two separate still.
