Tech toys keeps the balance of geschenkebudget 
This year 's favorite under the gifts is the ipad possibly followed by a microsoft kinect videokonsole. both games can be a significant hole in their geschenkebudget together. 
A ipad costs as much as five bmx wheels for $99, while the price of a kinect game approximately 10 traditional springseilen or roughly 48 doses play - doh. 
But they can geschenkebudget it. 
I recently visited on the search for three elektronikspielzeugen under $80 three national spielzeughändler - a wal - mart, a toys' r 'us and a bj' s wholesale club. 
It was immediately clear to me was that moore 's law in force. at the same time, this year, the technologiespielzeuge are more capable and cost less than last year. 
And although fewer new toys, with its own website, will take place on the best - known of this type, webkinz and club penguin, a wider offer. 
There are always more button cells contain - fuelled toys to the market, and many wiederaufladbare batteries. 
Here a few recommendations. 
(If not different, are all prices of toys' r 'us.) 
Sing - a - ma jigs (mattel, $13, for children from the age of 3 years) are plüschfiguren as large as guinea, the sing a note, if they are on their gut expresses. 
Again, with a note, by number, we can push play a song. 
Several sing - a - ma - jigs sing in harmony. 
Respect: once you have started with the express again, you can no longer stop. 
For is a combination of gesand and dance the dance star mickey ($60, fisher - price for children from 2) the best option. 
Last year on the basis of the developed elmo live - technology offers the animatronische doll recantations such as' simon says', and thanks to the novel scharnierfüße with radblockierung dominated the moon - walk. 
Children, use the equipment tested, mickey as dance teacher. their parents, however, complained about the lack of lautstärkeregelung. 
If you are a child of the 1980s, you will no doubt recall alphie, one of the first computerised lernspielzeuge.

Last but not least, there is scrabble flash ($30 of hasbro, for children from 8). the five bloc are no more than a matchbox and have their own led - screen. 
The aim of the game is to bring together the units of words, before the time is running out. it is great for a suitable improvised buchstabierwettbewerb. 
More and more toys have a kind of online link. 
If we simply for the supply in the toy, is webkinz and club penguin are the most important. 
An online animal in the club of their child penguin to pay, they can, for example, a disney club penguin 2 'mix' n match figurenpaket ($5 buy for children of between 6 and 12), which contains a coin with a ultimately.

It might be rollschuhe or a puffle - stofftier. 
The latest kopfzellen - fuelled mikroroboter, hexbug nano ($10 for children from 5) is no more than the head of your toothbrushes.
