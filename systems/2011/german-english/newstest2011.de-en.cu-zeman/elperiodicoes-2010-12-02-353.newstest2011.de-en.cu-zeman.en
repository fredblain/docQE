The red line zapatero and germany 
Berlin has opted for the keeping of the euro, but at the same time drawn up conditions for the whole of the european union. 
The tension in the markets have a dual response from the government. 
On the one hand, josé luis rodríguez zapatero has submitted new adaptation measures, starting with the tax reliefs for small - and micro - enterprises, and the regulation of temporary or the abolition of 426 euro support for the unemployed, which no unemployment benefit, relate to the privatisation of 49% of aena, the management of airports barajas and el prat and 30% of state lottery. 
On the other hand supports the deputy head of government, elena salgado, with the help of the former prime minister felipe gonzález as responsible, chancellor angela merkel 's criticism of the current crisis herausbeschwört have. 
How are these events to be interpreted? 
It is anticipated that merkel 's position is no fault of their public. 
On the contrary, it is about a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro. 
It is germany a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, the with maintaining the old traditions of one large parts of its partners. 
In the light of the resistance in europe begins in germany spekuliern on three possible ways out of the crisis. 
The first: a strong euro with germany, austria, the netherlands and in other countries, while the south have to leave the euro area. 
The second: the reintroduction of the german mark - although it sounds currently more science fiction, supported by a majority of public opinion, approximately 50% of the population. 
The third: a transformation of the euro in accordance with german proposals. this means: more macro - economic control; rigorous financial management; penalise the countries, the targets; möglichereweise exceed the default a few countries, as well as the extension of the costs of potential adaptation to the private sector. 
The german position is clear and has for some time been looming. that is why there is now no excuses. 
First of all, 2009, as both the imf and the european commission incentives for deficits created and the german government is a constitutional reform from the sleeves drew in order to prevent it from 2016. 
That was the first signs for the divergence between what germany was thought necessary (strict tax and stable public finances) and the practices of its european partners, including france. 
The second signal, which is a central european country, than to the rescue of greece painful hinausschob merkel the decision. 
Criticised at the time this was very much, but the fact is that the political consensus in germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of greece. 
Finally, merkel in the last oktobertagen anew with an unambiguous position. it calls for a reform of the agreement which the european union, in order to save a country and at the same time allow the private lenders to commit itself, a part of the costs. 
This position was interpreted as anti - european, since they are the irlandkrise and all the following. 
But your proposal, even if it is somewhat sweetened, was adopted in the next few months, we will be in the reform of the european union, which these measures should be able to participate from 2013. 
Germany has drawn up a red line, not to exceed the it does. 
It says, all that - even if unpopular measures must be taken, it has now, as of that date will no longer be the old functioning of the euro. 
2013 will be the geburtsjahr of a new currency, are punished in the recalcitrant countries hard, insolvent, cannot be forced to explain and in this case the private sector must assume a part of the costs. 
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth, with high savings and investment, moderation of consumption, improving the productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances. 
The other alternative, the debt and construction with enormous holes in the balance of payments is based, as it has been led by spain in boom times, simply will not be tolerated. 
The offer is clear. 
And we would do bad thing, it does not to understand. 
It is not only a question of, the government deficit to 3% runterzufahren until the year 2013. 
The demands are much harder. 
And the worst thing we could do so under these conditions, is ourselves to cheat. 
I hope that the current turbulence in more calm. 
And that we examine the possibilities offered to us, will use until the spring in 2013. 
It seems that zapatero has understood this so well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large last saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) points out that, in spite of the criticism to merkel to create the hypothesis, put his own house in order in the forced their way. 
But the outcome red line by germany is there, and it does not seem to, that would be a change. 
Among the options into account is that we leave the full gestopften euro with little serious countries should not, be ruled out. 
In this case, germany still tell us that it could have warned us.
