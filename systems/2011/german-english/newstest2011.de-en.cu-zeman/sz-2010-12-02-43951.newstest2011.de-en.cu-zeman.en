Puzzling erdarbeiten 
The international atomic energy agency has iaea new references to a secret nuclear programme in syria. 
The country is opposed, however, to take a position on this matter - nor does it controls. 
Against midnight from 5 to 6 september 2007 i at least four israeli f - 15 fighter a mystery, würfelförmiges building in syria. 
It is; the next major city on the shores of the euphrates, 30 kilometres away, is dair as saur. 
Its name is in documents of the international atomic energy agency (iaea), when it comes to the reactor, the syria supposedly with help from north korea has built in the quader, hidden in a valley, the electricity. 
According to a briefing of the us - auslandsgeheimdienstes cia at the end of april 2008 would be the also under the name of middle town el - kibar normal reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which we can build nuclear weapons. 
For other purposes against the technology from the 1950s is very little. 
The cia led a videopräsentation with satellite blurred. 
By computeranimation played a, where the components of the reactor before they have been the destruction of a verkleinerte copy of the north korean model from the atomzentrum yongbyong. 
Also, photographs before they clearly show the buildings from the proximity or even the innenraum. 
The reactor is on the verge of operation, was it, but not yet been with pellets alarms. 
Today, more than three years after the bombing that is little more aware than they were then, have been the mystery is increasing rather than with the passage of time. 
The former us president george w. bush has recently in his memoirs, revealed that the cia before the attack was quite sure that syria in el - kibar built a reactor, but little evidence that it was in the country were "an active nuclear weapons programme '. 
Some intelligence in europe there are even more cautious and only talk of a "alleged reactor," even if they hold the cia 's presentation for "plausible,." 
They lack hard evidence, as well as the iaea. 
Asked, as it is, a reactor before have replied to a high un diplomat in summer only baldly asserts that the iaea, "enough material to ask questions." 
The rubble of the supposed "unused militärgebäudes' surpassed the syrians hastened to one side and planierten thoroughly premises. 
Nevertheless took place in june 2008 an iaea team under the former chief inspector olli heinonen in el - kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people. 
Also the iaea on a member state satellite imagery received commercial service providers from the period immediately after the attack, which should be stronger than the presented by the cia. 
However, to get these recordings on the market does not, because the unknown customer - perhaps israel - it has bought exclusively. 
The iaea can therefore not independent verify its authenticity. 
Syria has always claimed that never to have built a secret nuclear program or a reactor. 
The uranium come declared by the israeli weapons, damascus. 
But the, the iaea back after analysis of the particles as unlikely. 
Since then, damascus, refuses to discuss - as well as on the satellite imagery. 
It also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el - kibar and access to the ruins of the bombed - out building. 
But also israel, staunchly is silent. 
"We will comment on the never," confirmed recently at the time of the attack president - in - office of the prime minister ehud olmert, the official position. 
So the investigation of the case since june 2008 has been dragging out fruitless and 'is becoming a serious credibility for the authority', as a high western diplomat at the seat of the iaea in vienna admits - after all, it is a serious breach of the treaty on the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons in the area, about the iaea. 
As the key to progress in the enlightenment, the iaea appear three other institutions, the "in functional link 'with the alleged reactor should - and other than this still exist. 
Yet the inspectors have so far not disclosed, about what installations, or what it is they are or what they appear to be suspicious. 
According to information from the süddeutsche zeitung, you are in the iaea internally than marj described as sultan, masyaf and iskandariayah, again derived from nearby towns. 
The independent institute for science and international security in washington (satellite isis) has identified these places and on a building in masyaf, in which it is probably one of the suspects objects. 
It is probably in or directly quite apart from a military base - precisely with the explanatory statement denied syria of the iaea access to the three places. 
It says in vienna, the syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the iaea ahead will be to military auszuspähen by the united states. 
Because the nukleardetektive were marked by a piece of advice for the american secret services of the institutions. 
The iaea has evidence, including satellite photos that between the three places and the quader on euphrates material out - and hertransportiert. 
A high western diplomat in vienna said that at least one of the installations could 'in connection with the brennstoffproduktion ." 
But there are "no indications of sensitive activities', in other words, uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes, the construction of nuclear weapons are necessary. 
The type of reactor will be pursued with uranium, which is not supplemented. 
But where the uranium should have come from and where it should be separated later the plutonium for the bomb on these central issues, there are only plausible guesswork. 
It is also unclear whether debris, could the valuable traces of mountains, have been stored in the three places. 
As if the hundreds of trailers disappeared from the face of the earth, nobody wants to have any information about them, has remained where the rubble. 
The only a few kilometers from el - kibar located on the other side of the euphrates salzmine al - tibni, syria in 1998 to their suitability as camp has studied for radioactive waste, the iaea as unlikely. 
The former iaea inspector robert kelley had it in an analysis of satellite recently for the venerable jane 's magazine associated with the reactor in intelligence review. 
Photographs from the orbit show, however, that syria in the three suspects places erdarbeiten and big container distant, after the iaea access had requested. 
This can be accidental, but little has helped, the suspicion. 
Also says in diplomatic circles, the iaea several months later used to develop a plan for inspections there, which should allow syria to maintain that any military secrets - the burden alone shows, is how much interest the inspectors. 
However, damascus bügelte this proposal too. 
Had western diplomats assuaged, even a year ago in vienna the destroyed reactor is, therefore, the matter have no high urgency brings us ambassador, glyn ford davies since, for example, a few months ago, the so - called special inspections into the game, one of the harshest means that the vienna nuclear organization has, in order to enforce controls. 
Iaea chief yukiya amano, these inspections should propose, has of "one option, for which i am open in the future ', but it is dragging its feet yet. 
There is a high level of risk in this way: on the one hand, there needs to be a majority in favour in the board of the iaea, and several of the countries represented there 35 are anything other than keen on an escalation. 
On the other hand, as a diplomat are concerns: "what is, if you find in the end nothing?"
