The quebecer government, from the société angus and the company parallèle was called upon to do it, to contribute financially to the adoption of the kinokomplexes excentris to participate, agreed with a cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive borrowing. 
The entwicklergesellschaft angus and the company parallèle, which is a donation of eur 7 million dollars by the ministry of culture for the adoption of the daniel langlois kinokomplexes belonging excentris on the boulevard saint - laurent had hoped for, in order to restore its actual cineastischen this function to leaving, do not seem to what they have asked. 
While the government has accepted, to involve itself in this matter, but on their own terms and conditions. 
Instead of the expected donation provides a quebecer government rather a loan in less than initially hoped - for level, which could launch a viable solution to advantageous conditions, at least according to the opinion from the state rumour mill entnehmbaren sources. 
A first action plan and a question after 12.8 million had already been rejected by the quebec last spring, the bittgesuch, once again since the overall has been revised downwards. 
A proposal together with an action plan have already been approved by the president of the "société de développement entreprises culturelles" (sodec), françois macerola to minister saint - pierre, who heads the acts excentris broadcast. 
Several days ago, he had send her a final report. 
The counter - proposal by the cabinet, however, sodec on wednesday.

Kinochef daniel langlois had after the self construction of cinema over ten years with great difficulty, the autorenkino presented in the premises of his kinokomplexes could justify what the exception from the public coffers. 
The lack of cinemas, the independent films show, in montreal is more than obvious, and excentris knew to keep his clients on board. 
Société angus and the company parallèle with christian yaccarini at the helm, taxes in turn a privately financed campagne, of which you are hoping to a sum $700 000 in order to stimulate the acquisition. 
Since the spring 2009 only one screen so that continues to show films in excentris, namely le parallèle. 
Objective for the future of purchasers is it the three cinemas, on 27 february of next year with the demonstration of the very successful film from xavier beauvois "hommes et des dieux 'to re - open. 
Christian yaccarini but the newspaper le devoir 'has not removed, and it ignores what he and his group of the downward proposals, which has made you.
