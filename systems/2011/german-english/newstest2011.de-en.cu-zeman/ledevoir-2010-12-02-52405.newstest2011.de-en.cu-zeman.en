Global plan for the renewal of the lighting 
The un has yesterday in cancun a plan for the renewal of the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (cfc 's) proposed, almost a third of the additional reduction is the equivalent of which must be carried out in order to stabilise the earth' s climate by 2020. 
This ambitious plan adopted its position in the steps of the specific large a implement hopes in cancun, the un, in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reductions of the industrialised countries. 
After yesterday 's plan would the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (gt) by the lighting of the earth cfcs made be avoided if the weißglühenden pears, yet a monopoly from 50 to 70% in the market, by fluoreszierende or, better still, were replaced with leds. 
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world 's emissions. 
This is in line with the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet. 
In copenhagen, last year the big abgasemittenten such as the united states, china, europe, and other, including canada, to voluntary reduktionsplänen committed, the global cfc - emissions by 53 gt to 49 gt should lower. 
Should, however, be 5 of this assessment gt in order to turn from now until 2020 to stabilise the klimaanstieg to 2 degrees celsius, in order to prevent this from spiralling out of control. 
In the weißglühenden pears escaping 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light. 
With the kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, with the new led bulbs reduced this energy once again to the double. 
The kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen on average between 6000 until 10,000 hours. 
The new led bulbs, such as those that the producer philips has brought onto the market this week - incidentally, this society has participated in the un study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and 80% are consuming less energy than a weißglühende pears, what a suggestion in 100 countries of the world from the savings of the auswechselungsplanes gives, if it is to be applied. 
Apart from the fact that iese entirely new light bulbs only very little heat, it can also function with a regelwiderstand. 
And they do not contain any mercury. 
Various specialists have pointed out, that kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves, because they contain mercury and that it therefore as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except for the producers are a bring available. 
The main source of mercury on the planet, according to the report, however, is not the kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal - fired power stations, which is much more mercury emissions, in order to generate the of the weißglühenden pears wasted electricity. 
In the united states alone, these coal - fired power stations 25,000 tonnes of mercury from every year. 
The report sets out in detail the profits, which each country would earn thanks to this international programme. 
Indonesia, it would, for example, a billion dollars a year in the purchase of electricity and save eight million tonnes of co2, it means an equivalent of indonesia 2.5 billion would cost 3.5 coal - fired power stations, whose edification.
