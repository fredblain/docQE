Rachsüchtige hackers and emsige spies 
The affair wikileaks has a twofold importance. 
Turning to one side, it proved to be an obvious scandal, a scandal, which is simply a scandal in sinner hypocrisy, the beziehunge governed between member states, the citizens and of the press. 
On the other hand announces profound changes at international level, and there is a foretaste of the dominated by regression future. 
But we are in turn. 
The first aspect of wikileaks is the confirmation of the fact that each act (a x - drafted by a secret service any nation) composed purely from press cuttings. 
The "extraordinary," american revelations about the sexual habits berlusconi are nothing more than the anyway, what you over several months to read any journal (except those whose owners berlusconi is), and the appalling karikaturierte profile gaddafi 's kabarettkünstlern already provided for a long time substance for their skits. 
The rule, in accordance with the secret dossiers only must consist of already known news is essential for the dynamism of the secret services, and not just in this century. 
When they go in a library, which focuses esotherischen publications, you will realise that every plant (via the grail, the mystery of rennes - le chateau, the templer or the rosenkreuzler) repeatedly exactly what has been written in previous works. 
This is not alone, therefore, that the author wishes to occult texts not publish research (still, therefore, that he does not know where to find news on the non - existing would be), but because those who devote itself to the okkultismus, to nothing other than the to believe what you already know, and confirmed what you have already learnt. 
This is also the erfolgsmechanismus dan brown. 
As well as the secret. 
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret services (otherwise he may be whatever, editor, for example in libération), the only regarded as true, what he recognises. 
The top - secret information about mr berlusconi, the american embassy in rome had had sent staatsdezernat, were the same as those who newsweek had already published the week before. 
So why was such a fuss made about the revelation of this dossier? 
On one side, this say what any educated person already know, and that the messages - at least since the end of the second world war and since then the government can take can mutually call or a plane, in order to meet the dinner - have lost their diplomatic role, and, with the exception of a few small representative in spionagezentren have turned. 
Any spectators of ermittlungsfilmen knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that we pretend to be unaware of this fact. 
Nevertheless,: the fact, to repeat it publicly, violates the task of hypocrisy and serve to integrate the american diplomacy to put in a bad light. 
In second place: the idea that an x - any hackers can tap into the geheimsten secrets of the most powerful country in the world, the considerable blow against the prestige of staatsdezernats. 
Moreover, brings the scandal less victims than the 'executioner "in trouble. 
But we ourselves to in - depth nature of what has happened. 
Formerly, orwell 's time, one could unite all power as a big brother, the controlled every gesture of his subjects. 
Orwell 's prophecy would turn out to be absolutely right, since then, where we can monitor any movement thanks to the telephone, made any transaction, the hotel, visited the elected motorway and so on; the citizens would be in power at the total victims of the eyes. 
If people are bearing in mind but, what expires today, that even the secret krypten power can no longer control of a hackers escape, so be listening to the kontrollgang directed at, unilaterally and will zirkelförmig. 
The power controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker elected - - as a sent vindicator of the citizen, can bring the secrets of power in experience. 
But how can a power that is no longer in a position to maintain their own secrets? 
, Mr simmel has already said, it is true that a real secret an empty secret (and is an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of berlusconi or merkel is in essence a secret free of geheimis, since it exposes the public sphere; but in the style of wikileaks intermediaries, that the secrets of hillary clinton empty secrets were, means deprive them of any power. 
Wikileaks but it has neither sarkozy nor merkel wronged, clinton and obama. 
What will be the consequences of this affront, which has caused such a huge power? 
It is obvious that the member states no more online information be reserved in the future - that would be a angeklebten posting in the street. 
But it is equally obvious that it is with the current technologies in vain to hope to be able to keep confidential reports on telephone secret. 
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of state in a plane moving and has been in contact with one of his colleagues. 
In future, how could private and only for certain ears certain relations be? 
I know very well that my forecast on science - fiction and romanhaft sounds at the moment, but i am forced to imagine the government, based on secret nature and active way to uncontrollable marschrouten moving, their communications anywhere else, than the mere memory with fundamental, and, in addition, the few written information, which you have, in the schuhabsatz verbergend. 
The information would be stored in single copy in closed drawers: basically, the spionageversuch by watergate success, less than wikileaks. 
I have had the opportunity to write that the technology today as a cancer progresses, namely backwards. 
A century after the wireless telegraf had revolutionized the communication, a telegrafen retrace the internet with (telephone) wire. 
The (analogue) video tapes had the filmforschern allows, bond for bond auszukundschaften, making a film from behind spulen forward and to reveal all of the secrets of the installation, while the (numerical) cds nowadays, allow nothing other than to jump from chapter to chapter, in other words makroportionen. 
With the high - speed trains, we have been travelling within three hours from rome to milan, while it requires including of switching three and a half hours by plane. 
It is therefore not extraordinary that policy and communication on car and horse return. 
A final observation. 
In earlier times tried to understand what the press for secrets were forged between the embassies. 
Now we have the embassies, demand the confidential information from the press.
