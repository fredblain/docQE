Khmer rouge veterans forced to confrontation with the past 
In a weak - lit, betonierten schoolroom with dirty money and abblätternden walls, the director of the anlong reminds veng high school built in the man who put him, to the subsequent khmer rouge leader ta mok alone. 
"Everyone here loves ta mok." 
"He was a good leader and he has in his people," said sreng kor ma, 42 years. 
Because of its brutality during the khmer rouge rule known as "the butchers," is the commander in this remote former khmer rouge stronghold in north - west cambodia popular, where he hospitals and bridges built, the infrastructure has developed and where thousands of former soldiers still lives. 
But this year, 12 years after the capitulation of the khmer rouge in relation to the government, longstanding supporters in anlong will veng challenge. 
In april, a local truth - and versöhnungsforum the victims, the public confrontation with the people who have supported once the regime. 
In june, the government distributed for the first time a schoolbook children former soldiers told the history of the khmer rouge. 
Cambodia and in july, a gemeinschaftstribunal the un and for the first time, a former member of the khmer rouge, as the former head of the infamous tuol sleng torture chamber, kaing khek iev, better known as duch, sentenced to 35 years in prison. 
With each of these developments, the fear amongst the khmer rouge veterans alnlong grew vengs, making it difficult to cambodia their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into society. 
"There are still in the former khmer rouge rejection and fear, but they have no power to do anything," said chhang youk, head of the documentation of cambodia, an independent body, the regime researched. 
'For them, life under the khmer rouge was impressive, but the regime has become a symbol of evil. " 
"It splits their own families." 
During the khmer rouge in cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed, or they died from diseases revision or hunger. 
When the vietnamese invaded and overthrew the pol pot 's ied government in 1979, fled the remnants of the regime and its military cambodia to thailand at the border. 
Widespread here until december 1998, as the final movement surrendered, unrest. 
As pol pot, nuon chea and ieng sary guerrilla warfare of its basis in the west of mountains and led jungle of cambodia, ta mok contested the next generation in anlong veng. 
But the mid - 1990 's, when a peace agreement in 1993, promoted by the un led the first democratic elections in the country, large groups of khmer rouge combatants, began to government floor, which led to the kapitulationen ieng sary led in 1996 and nuan chea and khieu samphan in 1998. 
Pol pot died a natural death, and ta mok in 1998, 1999, which did not have yielded, was arrested in the dangrek mountains by government. 
He died in prison in phnom penh in 2006, where he waiting for its process. 
Than their benefactors they no longer protected, fled most of the former khmer rouge fighters in the grinding poverty of the rural cambodia and many attempts to movement in nostalgic memory. 
Even if a few elite official retaining the khmer rouge their local government, because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, ill - educated farmers. 
"These people have benefited only very little of the surrender," said sok leang by the center for justice and reconciliation, the throughout the whole of cambodia, also in anlong veng, public forums, 
"They are enshrined in the utopian agrarideologie the regime." 
"They grew without any berufswissen '. 
Sor lim, 55 years, is the rhmer rouge had as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle in order anlang veng, before 1998 niederließ, to lead a life of poor reisbauer. 
"Life under the khmer rouge was very good," he said. 
"Ta mok has given each something to eat." 
"But now is the life difficult, because we must ourselves." 
The current khmer rouge tribunal has also raised concerns here. 
At the beginning of next year, the court will try, nuon chea khieu samphan ieng sary and his wife and ieng thirith, another former khmer rouge minister, be put on trial. 
It is the task of the court, the old leaders and those which are mainly responsible for the atrocities, to condemn, but it is not at all clear whether it is on these four cases further action will follow. 
It has done little to the fears in anlong veng to alleviate. 
Current media have focused on in chaem, 64 years, that during the khmer rouge rule in the late 1970 's distriktchefin in the province of manteay had been meanchey. 
2007 had told you envoy of the documentation of cambodia, you have the construction of the trapeang guided thma dam, a project, in which thousands of forced labour probably died. 
On a hot evening in chaem came as a result of the work in the fields its holzhaus of a dirty roads outside of anlong veng back. 
As the sun long shadow on the desiccated grass raised in the chaem it refused to discuss its past in the khmer rouge. 
The court should it come, so it would refuse to go, she said. 
'Cambodia lives in peace and stability, "she said. 
"If there were no more persecution, would be here war." 
Prime minister hun sen has fled, 1878 of the khmer rouge, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, the court would more suspects accusations, even though experts and historians are discussing this. 
"Cambodia must dig a hole and the past buried," he said. 
But the confrontation with the past, what cambodia must do, in order to be able to move forward, said chhang youk of documentation. 
"Reconciliation with the khmer - times means of compiling broken pieces," he said. 
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together, so that we can all understand." 
The centre created the first on the khmer rouge, approved by the government schoolbook the 75seitige "history of democratic cambodia '. 
In june it distributed the book of anlong veng as the annex to the history books for the high school of the ministry of education, the less than four sides on the khmer rouge contains. 
As is often the case in cambodia the young people in anlong know little about the khmer rouge veng, despite the city 's links to the regime. 
Touch valeak, 19 years, a student at the anlong veng high school, said that the new textbooks the students, helps to understand an important part of its history. 
But his parents, sceptical when he described the book reacted with home, if it is to be read. 
"My family many parts of the books and the court rejects," he said. 
'You are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people be condemned by the court. " 
Such a resistance makes the reconciliation complex and complicated, said sok leang. 
But the public forums, and the court, after and after the schoolbook influence, "he said. 
Still, the khmer rouge here has a powerful attraction. 
Upstairs in the dangrek mountains leads a sträuchern überwucherter and with plastikmüll verdreckter path to a rectangle covered by black soot, with a rostigen blechdach. 
Pol pot 's body was here have been burnt 1998 on a reifenhaufen after his death. 
Nuom sothea, 31 years, a handyverkäuferin on the roadside, said that it does not know a lot about the man who was burnt here. 
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here to him in order to pray," she said. 
It was nuom sotheas birthday and later in the day they wanted to go to pol pot 's final resting place, where they will give a bush mature bananas - in the hope that it will bring their luck.
