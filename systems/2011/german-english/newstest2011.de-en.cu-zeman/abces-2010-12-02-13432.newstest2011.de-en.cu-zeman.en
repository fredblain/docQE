Partido popular won 4 seats in the us congress and lost psc 9 
With the results of 28 november the pp lérida in the cities, tarragona could play a decisive role and barcelona 
After the important vote and abgeordnetenzuwachs in the last regional directed the pp their preferred look already at the parliamentary - or not. their expectations are more than positive, because the figures, this party made in these elections, is normally twice as high as in the elections in catalonia. 
The catalan people 's party was then 610.473 votes in the parliamentary elections of 2008, while this paragraph in the regional elections in 2006 only 316.222 fraud. 
Last sunday, the ppc 384.091 votes. 
If this rising trend - outcome of the diversion of the voting shares of the psc and should encourage the pegging of the electorate of the ppe, the analysts predict that the ep, in the elections, the ppc from 8 to 12 congressmen could rise, while also ciu four (she has now 10) effective and the psc at least 9 members (of 25) would lose. 
These calculations show the fundamental importance of catalonia for pp and psoe. 
In accordance with the analysis of the people 's party would lose the erc a member - it has three - at the moment, while icv keep their members or could be effective. 
But the election should be maintained, and the next meeting with the local falls in the may 2011. then, too, the people 's party (pp) can be the language of the balance in order to put an end to the socialist domination, namely in four provinzhauptstädten and with its majority in the city barcelona, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011. 
Both the nationalists as the people 's party also agree that the psc cities barcelona, tarragona, lérida' gerona and achieve a majority in which the group of the party of european socialists neither still rely on its traditional allies (erc and icv) can, will lose. 
After the republican debacle is it not absurd, that this party its representation in barcelona municipal, in which they ought to be 5% of the votes, will lose. 
The pp recorded, on the other hand, an increase in their voting shares in the four provinzhauptstädten and could be to the decisive force in barcelona, lérida and tarragona. 
The nationalists are convinced, to be able to play the leading role in tarragonas turnaround. they had before the current mayors, josep félix governed ballesteros, together with the pp. 
En lérida is the pp only 500 votes behind the psc. the mayor, àngel ros, maintains good relations with mariano rajoy - during the last election campaign met you several times. 
Also in other important areas, such as, for example, in badalona, castelldefels or reus could the people 's party show a significant increase. 
At present is the pp in 34 municipalities of catalonia and seeks the education of lists in so many places as possible.
