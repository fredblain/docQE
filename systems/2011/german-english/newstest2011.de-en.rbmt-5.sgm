<seg id="1"> What is to do it, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither VOL the place, nor the "confectionery."</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new councilmen of the capital from the numbers of the ČSSD will have to overcome obviously certain language barriers, in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prager advice and in the city agency at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The newspaper Aktuálně.cz "knocked off" members of the new advice from the ČSSD times a little, how they control the notorious Slang, which nationalized itself in the last years, in which the today's coalition partners in Prague at the rudder were.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The coded vocabulary, which was introduced in the verflossenen era by mayor Pavel Bém by the Prager political elite, is unites the most well-known participants, situations and Causae taken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Surprisingly it showed up that the new advice grope regarding these new terms somewhat in the dark.</seg>
<seg id="6"> They maintain that at least.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Who is VOL the place?"</seg>
<seg id="8"> "No notion."</seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am rather a beginner in the Prager politics," reacted Lukáš Kaucký, the new councilman for culture, on the test of the "godfather vocabulary."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In addition, the councilman Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.</seg>
<seg id="11"> For example on the term "gulf hole."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "That is the only expression of those, which submit here you to me, which I use now and then."</seg>
<seg id="13"> "Otherwise do not hold I much of Slang."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> From the vocabulary, which the day sheet Aktuálně.cz had published in June of this year before the congress of choice of the ODS, pickte the editorship of six terms, out above all such, which are notoriously with the Prager municipal authorities connected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Social Democrats should the terms "VOL the place," "largest Prager gulf hole," "into the confectionery go," "bull necks," "betrayal of the capital" and "sheet metals" defining.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Three Prager councilmen agreed the test, fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future boss of the Prager of public education - promised first its participation in the discussion, did not remove then however not times the listener.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The fifth councilman, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the beginning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "These things are me all the same and like the civil democrats among themselves maintained, about it judge themselves I not."</seg>
<seg id="19"> "For me is important, like we within the framework of our programs understand themselves," countered it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> As already suggested, Lukáš Kaucký in the headline mentioned above would allegedly not have recognized that of the influential entrepreneur and friend of the ex mayor Bém, novel Janoušek is the speech.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The term "VOL the place" does not say nothing at all to Kaucky and the only term, which it guessed with the test correctly, was purely "the largest Prager gulf hole."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "That is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, however still added for security: "However I know rather from the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="23"> And jokeful: "I will probably have to occupy a language course."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The "gulf hole" is then deciphered correctly not only of Matador Karel Březina, but also of the advice gentleman for environmental questions Lukáš Plachý as tunnel Blanka.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Both in addition, Social Democrats know, for whom the term VOL the place stands and suspects Lukáš Plachý even, where this figure is to be found and thus also, what it is called, "into the confectionery to go."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "I believe, i.e., into any Prager catering trade enterprise to go," is Plachý quite close on to the mystery solution, if one knows that it concerns here the seat of Janoušeks companies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Agreeing with Březina it protests however these knowledge rather from the newspaper to have drawn that this vocabulary would be own to it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> By the test participants to judge, it seems to actually give no similarly nationalized Slang among the Social Democrats.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I asked also my colleagues, but obviously it does not give such a thing with us really."</seg>
<seg id="30"> "We calls ourselves with the name, now and then use we also contractions or nicknames," say the chairman of the Prager ČSSD Petr Hulínský - of its party comrades casually "Hulda" mentioned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "At school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I do not know whether also my colleagues in such a way call, betray me" us Karel Březina its nickname.</seg>
<seg id="32"> The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz tried out and sees the name there - it functions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Councilman Weinert is friendly for the party comrades friendly the "Grandpa" or less the "old person," who representative Miroslav pounds, which made attentive before the elections by machinations with party sponsoring on itself, from some colleagues "Igráček" (well-known Czech Lego figure) called.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Nicknames are so the only one, which the Social Democrats in the within the party linguistic usage permit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Hulínský does not like it allegedly, if one calls him "Hulda," but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered still another another nickname of the Prager chairman.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> His nickname "doctor of the rubber club rights" it has to do allegedly with the fact that Petr Hulínský acquired its title Doctor juris at the Bratislaver police academy.</seg>

<seg id="1"> A tenant of Bakala: It heats in the furnace - nevertheless higher rent pays</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> An older untersetzter man leaves the straight client center of the society RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest owner of private of flat lets for rent in Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Under the arm a briefcase with three new leases to three dwellings: for the own and the dwellings of its daughters and its son, who serve a straight detention.</seg>
<seg id="4"> All three in the context of the so-called "deregulation" the straight rent was increased.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Instead of of 3500 crowns monthly rent is to shell out the son in the next year for a 2-Zimmer-Wohnung with kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns.</seg>
<seg id="6"> "And there there is warm water to heat flowing in the dwelling not times and must one in a simple coal furnace," does not tap it annoyed with the finger on the new lease of the son, to its signing it an authority has.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "However which - signed I," explains it half detuned and half resigned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The citizen combination BytyOKD.cz, which called the new renting conditions "inkorrekt and immorally," guesses/advises the tenants not to sign and by 7 December wait the new contracts simply, on which it intends to publish a guidance, as one proceeds against such contracts.</seg>
<seg id="9"> But the man only declines.</seg>
<seg id="10"> "One says this, the other one," makes it a dark face.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The region Ostrava becomes in such a way the large "Deregulierungslabor."</seg>
<seg id="12"> After New Year this deregulation is approaching for most flat lets for rent in Czech Republic, whose tenant pays so far no rent corresponding to real market conditions.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Aktuálně.cz decided to visit this "laboratory" personally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The RPG waiting area in Havířov is one of four in the region Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday breaking fully.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Directly beside the door the bodyguards of a safety agency stand and with it call equipment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "Rent 2011," then shines a special palpation field on the Touchscreen.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Briefly touched lightly and already the equipment spits a number note out.</seg>
<seg id="18"> We have the number "157" deciphered and already hardly beep them on the large display at the cover of the waiting area.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Is a half second later one in turn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> An older married couple enters the waiting area somewhat later, in order to ask for the rent, but the attack in the waiting area is not valid for the new rent obviously at all.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Most people are here, in order to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance affairs and the like.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Starting from in the middle of November flutter in the region Ostrava the covers with the new leases most tenants that altogether 44,000 dwellings of the portfolio of the RPG into the mail boxes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The RPG Byty proposes in the letters a rent increase from approx. 15 to 38 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="24"> The special switch for the new rents in the client center is opened since 18 November.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "The action runs somewhat over one week, i.e., that is only the beginning," answers the ladies behind the switch after one moment hesitating, when the "client" emerges as a journalist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The deregulation and Bakalas former mountain worker's dwellings are an explosive topic.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Before the elections the parliament vice-president Lubomír Zaorálek originating from Ostrava had taken up this topic by the ČSSD quite loud neck, no miracle that today the newspapers are full of it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> " I want twenty years from them a new Fußboden."</seg>
<seg id="29"> " Not times ne besch. They knew WC-eyeglasses auswechseln" , the initially mentioned man makes himself air.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Up to now above all pensioners at the switch line up according to the woman employees, in order to convince itself whether they keep the promised tenant moderation, which promises real them RPG, if they sign the special offer in time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Into the benefit of one to the half reduced February rent also the other tenants are to come, who sign the new lease by 15 December.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Up to now is " Deregulierungsschalter" in Havířov however everything else, as if overloads from demands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> " From the 360 clients of yesterday only about 40 to 50 of the rent was in the year 2011 because of hier" , the switch woman officials estimate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> RPG offers thereby both on its web pages, and blackboards individual renting agreements, where it appears necessary.</seg>
<seg id="35"> If the renting parties should not agree however on the new rent, them of an independent court one specify.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> " That should be no threat, but is too verstehen" as information over the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach; , RPG explains on its web pages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> " Here nobody goes before Gericht" , one of the woman employees of RPG Byty and a man on the road before the client center means gives it at least partly quite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> " I have 13,000 (crowns) pension, of it remain for me 5,000 for the meal, where I should the money for a court controversy hernehmen" , it means.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Then the employee becomes nevertheless uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="40"> " Times sehen."</seg>
<seg id="41"> " Mr. Zaorálek says to them about the media, it is not to sign and so not wait the people still ab" , it gives to consider.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The adjusted rent ends in the largest part of Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and RPG Byty according to is the rent increase an economic necessity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> " The existing height of the rents is not enough times for the maintenance of the apartment fund aus" , Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of the society RPG Byty argues and - the straight neglect of the housing fund criticized by the applied tenants is according to opinion of the home-owners the principal reason for the rent increase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> While RPG could invest four billion in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the taken rents into the dwellings, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it should be 5.2 billion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> On the large sized LCD at the cover opposite the upholstered chairs in the waiting area of Havířov occasionally always emerge few red shining information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> " The rent increases in the year 2011 around 15% and less concern 31,200 dwellings, i.e. more than 90% of the dwellings of RPG."</seg>
<seg id="47"> " This always means at the most 7.50 CZK per square meters and Monat" , is to be read on the LCD monitor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> Only with 400 dwellings from the portfolio of RPG the rent increases by 38 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="49"> " In these cases it goes around the increase of extremely small rents from 19,66 CZK per Quadratmeter" , RPG argues.</seg>
<seg id="50"> During 2600 dwellings the rent remains in the next year on same height.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> RPG Byty promises the fact that the deregulation does not drive the rents precipitously up but gradually within four and eight years takes place.</seg>
<seg id="52"> Which more - the enterprise imposes upon itself a further obligation: The enterprise wants to put all incomes from the rent increase (see diagram) again into the dwellings, particularly into heat savings - into new windows and into the thermal insulation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> But - with priority these are to benefit that people, which sign the agreements over the rent increase.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of the enterprise Arch.Design.</seg>
<seg id="3"> But who here already a mini kindergarten to expect, belonged which with everything to it: color-glad walls, creative furniture, a quantity toy and even a mini playground on the external terrace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This kindergarten is to the coworkers of Arch.Design since past year at the disposal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Project engineering and architect's office Arch.Design, from whose studios a whole number of considerable Brünner buildings originate, counted of the first drafts for the new building Avriopoint on on the premises for its firm mini kindergarten.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In wise foresight, because most of its 90 coworkers (inside) are in the baby boom age and the company are been because of the fact that the Projektantinnen returns and architect inside as fast as possible to its job.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Together with the possibility of working shortened the kindergarten is a further bonus, which Arch.Design has to offer to its person employed in the concept of its social program.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Civil engineer inside and - architect inside have it so more easily to bring their fastidious occupation and the child welfare service under a hat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The mini kindergarten is an original idea of the coworkers (inside) of Arch.Design and with the support of the management succeeded it them development funds of the European union and the Ministry for work and social for their project to win.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The operational mini kindergarten is financed by the operation program human resources and employment policy from means of the European social fund and from the state budget of the Czech republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Owing to this financing (subsidies at a value of 2, 8 millions CZK) the necessary mechanisms and the equipment could be procured and for the duration of 2 years are provided for qualified personnel and for the enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="12"> After the exhaustion of the conveyances (2 years) the society Arch.Design is obligated to operate the mini kindergarten 3 further years at the own expense further.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The preparation of this project took a whole year up, whereby the society Economy rating rendered energetic help during the request completion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> About the children completeactively qualified personnel worries - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can children without agemoderate restrictions visit, although most of them are old over three years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And there it here around a mini kindergarten goes, may be present at the same time only 5 children, however alternate the day over several children mutually.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The kindergarten enterprise is flexibly with the need of parents co-ordinated the same rights, the children of all coworkers have regarding the use of the kindergarten - without consideration for the firm hierarchy and its respective position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Although it concerns individual education and care, program contents are nevertheless comparable in the mini kindergarten with the master program of the Vorschulbildung.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The children do not only play here, above all them excellent instruction are ordered - from fundamental realizations up to the Vorschulunterricht, besides they learn also still English.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The classroom is equipped not only with toy and creative plays, but also with a computer, which is to the children at the disposal.</seg>

<seg id="21"> Parents can at any time throw a view of the children and are void in such a way the stress with late fetching of the children from a kindergarten removed far.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Parents use therefore their work time more productively.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> No miracle that here also natural and loyale employer employee relations develops.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Arch.Design incorporated itself in such a way among the Czech companies, which offer clear Benefits, which is family friendly and encourages by such programs its personal marketing during the recruitment of new coworkers.</seg>

<seg id="1"> A bone house also still fascinates after 100 years. Look at yourselves the Interieure of Gaudi</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The roof seems like the back of a prähistorischen Echse, the stairs like the spinal column of a dinosaur and the balconies is broken fish muzzles.</seg>
<seg id="3"> That is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="4"> From the local inhabitants the house with its organic forms got the nickname " Knochenhaus."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaic, those at sheds reminding fronts and pervasive soft lines, all this are typical characteristics for art nouveau of Antonio Gaudi.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The front of the house plays with fantastic lines, tender colors and textures, which remind of nature and organism.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Only when exact looking one notices that everything of geometry, rhythm and durchdachter order is controlled.</seg>
<seg id="8"> At the night the whole front works still more vividly, dramatically and the special Anleuchtung strengthens the gloss of the colors still.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The same momentumful lines and devoured forms control also the inside of the house.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Wavelike formed wood copies the window frameworks, railing, Zierelemente of doors, even looking holes and borders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The house Batlló in the quarter of Eixample at the encouraged shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 resulted from the change of a house from the year 1877, which Emilio Sala Cortese implemented architects.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The reconstruction took two years and to 1906 up was locked.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The investor, the wealthy manufacturer Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the outline of the old and the building of a completely new building, but finally it agreed the idea Gaudís on an unusual and also cheaper change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The dwelling house Casa Batlló did not sketch Antoni Gaudí however alone.</seg>
<seg id="15"> He co-operated thereby with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Straight ones on its drawing board developed the decorations for the representative dwelling of the owner of reality and also the use of mosaics at the front were its idea.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In the organization of the front however also numerous further Bildner and artist cooperated.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The common work on the drafts for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful co-operation of Jujola and Gaudí.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Thus Jujol took part also in the building of Gaudís house Casa Milá in the park Güell, in which also further works of Antoni Gaudí are.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Already shortly after its completion the house of the local inhabitants of its organic forms got because of the nicknames " Knochenhaus."</seg>
<seg id="21"> Others again called it the special window opening mechanism because of " yawning Haus."</seg>
<seg id="22"> One says also, right at the top on the building is represented to holy George, the patron the sword by Catalonia.</seg>
<seg id="23"> In addition, further bildhauerische elements symbolize hidden religious motives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Gaudí sketched for the time at that time a singular central heating system with vent holes and typical fire-places for the house.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Somewhat more bizarre their 45-Grad-Neigung already seems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> With its work Gaudí ignored consistently all construction specifications at that time and let themselves by no means from these confuse.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Before commencement of construction it got the appropriate building permit the reconstruction, planned given by him, by the city however the data concerning was so vague that the city fathers were frightened two years later with the completion so by the result that they required remedy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The councilmen pushed among other things also to the fact that the building with its columns intervened even in the public sidewalk.</seg>
<seg id="29"> To changes it did not come however any longer, quite the reverse - Josep Batlló a request placed only fifteen days after the relevant request of the city quarter to the permission of the letting of the two high-altitude floors of the house - and she was promptly given to him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The home-owner drew into the lower floors.</seg>
<seg id="31"> In the gallery in the 2nd stick a society salon was, in the third stick was the bedrooms and private areas of the dwelling.</seg>
<seg id="32"> The ground floor was leased to a Juweliergeschäft.</seg>
<seg id="33"> The entire sechsstöckige building goes through stairs to up to the roof terrace.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> All right angles and straight lines were eliminated and replaced by the fundamental elements of the change by curved and swung walls.</seg>
<seg id="35"> In addition, Gaudí worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of areas.</seg>
<seg id="36"> The social part can be connected by opening the salon doors completely and so could a larger society comfortably plaudern, without having to do with more confidential discussions without a certain Intimität.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The house received a quite unusual roof and two further floors by Gaudís change except a new front also.</seg>
<seg id="38"> Also Gaudís play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles is impressive, with those the inner court is disguised and the halations.</seg>
<seg id="39"> The play of these two colors lends a maximum of light to all floors of the house.</seg>
<seg id="40"> It made simply the principle too uses oneself that white reflects the light better, as if dark colors, which absorb the sunlight on the contrary in addition.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="1"> The correct mattress and the correct bed rust? Women have other desires than men</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The maddest bed framework, do not separate the quality of the couch surface - thus mattress and rust constitute the good bed.</seg>
<seg id="3"> These must complement each other however harmoniously, in order to become fair the desires of the concrete user.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With the selection many things play a role - the weight, the size of, the state of health and not least also the sex of the Schläfers.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Just as importantly is also the Interieur, in which mattress and rust have to subordinate themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Typical example?</seg>
<seg id="7"> In a weekend house, in which not regularly one heats, Latexmatratzen are not well suitably, since they need much longer, over " warmly too werden."</seg>
<seg id="8"> Beyond that they are clearly heavier than usual PU mattresses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And - they should be turned regularly.</seg>
<seg id="10"> If they do not have still enough exhaust small channels in the core and in addition on a firm plate to lie, humidity dams itself up: It is thus impossible that under its mould forms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> With the choice naturally also a role plays, at which one is accustomed.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Who longer time was abroad, where very high mattresses with soft layer are usual will be able itself to accustom, heavily to a low mattress with hard surface.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> " Probably all ice hockey players, who returned from the NHL, weighted with me that they do not sleep correctly here any longer können."</seg>
<seg id="14"> " For their abgeschundenen shoulders, heels and hips they need simply a soft layer from Visco foam (MEMORY Foam - a form memory polymer). "</seg>
<seg id="15"> " These recommend I among other things also sugar-ill humans, who suffer from a disturbance of the nervous system, so that them " Informationen" from the joints and the skin badly received können" , explains Sylva Hadamcziková, which specializes in pad furniture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Therefore I have already years ago many ice hockey players, in addition, other customer these mattresses with Visco foam (MEMORY Foam) procures.</seg>
<seg id="17"> " Today is this no more problem, because such mattresses offer among other things the manufacturer Tempur, which Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico an."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And one does not have to be necessarily a famous ice hockey player, in order to learn to estimate the advantages of the Visco foam.</seg>
<seg id="19"> This " Wunder" functioned actually completely simply.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The foam optimalisiert its hardness and form according to the absorbed warmth, differently said, it schmiegt itself proper at the warm body on.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Anywhere it does not press, in the night rolls one not around as after a heavy fight.</seg>
<seg id="22"> One sleeps simply much better.</seg>
<seg id="23"> The viscoelastic foam offers beyond that also protection from Dekubitus (Wundbrand).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> With the choice of the mattress size one should include the length of the soles to the body size still, thus approx. 21 to 34 cm.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Man such as woman, which are large to the 180 cm, need such 210 to 220 cm long a bed.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Everyone should at least 90 cm couch width for the order, together thus 180 cm.</seg>
<seg id="27"> With single beds, for example with Singles, is attached 120 to 140 cm.</seg>
<seg id="28"> For the sake of the comfort and also for possible visitors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise the following rule of thumb is valid for the ideal bed width: " If one lies on the back, still enough place for the easily bended arms should sein" , engineer Helena Prokopová, the Zunftmeisterin of the Polsterer and Raumausstatter, guesses who dedicate themselves already for many years to the problem of the healthy Schlafes and the ergonomics of furniture and speak this topic also on technical schools.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> With a double bed everyone needs its own rust and its own mattress, but watches out with the purchase, so that the mattresses are also equivalent high.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise nothing else remains to install as rust in different height and that is long not with each bed framework possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Foam mattresses should be high at least 14 cm, mattresses with feather/spring skeleton 15 cm, of it should at least three centimeters to the form layer and the fine pad be allotted.</seg>
<seg id="33"> " With the hand or when putting one may do the feathers/springs in no case spüren" , Helena Prokopová warns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Each mattress makes a special type of rust necessary.</seg>
<seg id="35"> Completepadded beds with mattress and document like grown together Siamzwillinge do not have to look for anything in the bedroom.</seg>
<seg id="36"> These mattresses do not leave themselves and the purchase to air can one wash, which today is already common.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And there one at only one night between 0,2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, is clear the fact that the mattress becomes slow after five to seven years an enormous (and clogged filter).</seg>
<seg id="38"> Also therefore specialists advertising slogans reject, which promise one life span of up to 25 years, even lifelong warranty with mattresses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Each thing has it if and however.</seg>
<seg id="40"> And therefore a practical advice of the dealers: With mattresses of 120 or 140 cm broad one should not shrink from the hygiene of the washable, removable purchases, yet it is advisable to use a Matratzenschoner which one can take off and wash easily.</seg>
<seg id="41"> Even if today mattress purchases with round outlining catch are usually manufactured, so that one gets two halves after opening (immensely importantly for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, above all alone implemented, seems often like the unequal fight between David and Goliath.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> Do they have a firm plate in bed instead of a rust?</seg>
<seg id="43"> Raus thereby!</seg>
<seg id="44"> Or at the most for a bed for unloved guests and for only one night.</seg>
<seg id="45"> Also so they should rather use the plate provided with ventilation holes (if already none in it are) and mattresses with feather/spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called bag feather/spring core and fine pad.</seg>
<seg id="46"> PU mattresses do not belong on such a document.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For not adjustable slat rust with 14 to 18 multipole sockets (lamellas) Latex or sand yielding mattresses suitably (if necessary also combinations of Latex and Kokos) are, always pay off thereby rust with a larger number of slats, thus of 28 and more multipole sockets to adjust with Lordosenstütze in the Lendenwirbelbereich and the possibility, the slat hardness.</seg>
<seg id="48"> On adjustable no mattresses with feather/spring skeleton belong to lamella rust, since they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Apart from the attitude the rigid one of the multipole sockets also special flexible shoulder modules are ordered.</seg>
<seg id="50"> Here it concerns a special attachment of the multipole sockets, which it makes possible to imprint or bend the multipole sockets in such a way that they make punctual sinking for the shoulder possible of the Schläfers.</seg>
<seg id="51"> In particular for men with broad shoulders an important thing.</seg>
<seg id="52"> There are even mattress manufacturers, that began, with " Herrenmatratzen" To use soft zones for the shoulder range.</seg>
<seg id="53"> Also to the ladies is meant - one grants these soft zones to them in the Hüftgegend.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For most fastidious customers scoring reading tables are wing feather/spring systems (Lattoflex) or rust with scoring reading tables contact Pads with so-called multi-torsion suspension determines.</seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure is distributed on several points, whereby the tension is reduced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But - if one to the correct mattress and correct rust a bad (too large and fülliges) pillow used, is lost most advantages again.</seg>
<seg id="57"> Also here a rule of thumb: the pillow is to support the head, its points should only up to the shoulders reach, so that the Schultermuskeln can relax.</seg>
<seg id="58"> From there 50 x 60 cm a large cushion appears ideal, how for example the Skandinavier likes it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In the side situation the pillow (together with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should adjust the Schulterhöhe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Our modern mattresses have something in common to have with the former (with hay filled) straw bags nevertheless.</seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern manufacturers use ever more frequently natural materials or at least their admixtures.</seg>
<seg id="62"> Also with mattresses the new magic word is called " Bio."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of oil raw materials uses one for the production of PU foams ever more frequently natureal oils - for example rizinus and Sojaöl.</seg>
<seg id="64"> Soy is probably used by all well-known manufacturers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> " Bio is called with mattresses, which besteht" their core from materials of purely natural origin; , Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico plus explains.</seg>
<seg id="66"> In addition, natural substances are used with the production of mattress purchases - one first was thereby aloe Vera.</seg>
<seg id="67"> One can grant oneself in addition, micro caps, which blow forest or Lavendelduft when sleeping spread.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> One makes a difference between man and woman also here.</seg>
<seg id="69"> While with the men " kühlender" Plant extract from Birkenblättern is used, so that the mattress purchase the warmth absorb and can the body cooling, the purchases for women " wärmende" Effect.</seg>
<seg id="70"> Excerpts from red Paprikaschoten suggest the blood circulation, the weaker sex become thus wohlig warm when sleeping.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> And the today's favorites?</seg>
<seg id="72"> Mattresses from cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is from there more breathe-actively than commercial PU and also many more flexible).</seg>
<seg id="73"> From the combination the different rigid one (hardness) of cold foams and Visco foams result multi-zone mattresses, which know exactly, where head, hip and heels are.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> For a high-quality mattress one has to shell out however 7000 crowns and more.</seg>
<seg id="75"> Health mattresses are however usually burdening with smaller value added tax, since they are considered as medical aids.</seg>
<seg id="76"> As the first Czech enterprise Gumotex became this advantage assigns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> One does not see, at the mattress and at the rust to save is so easily.</seg>
<seg id="78"> Now and then there are special offers of manufacturers and dealers, that offer two mattresses for the price of one.</seg>
<seg id="79"> Thus the mark Magniflex offers the mattress Duofreeze also in the purchase to verstepptem Visco foam MEMORY for 11.990 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="80"> One gets second free of charge in addition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the material Tempur, which introduced the era of the viscoelastic foam materials with open cell structure and high density in almost cosmic speed.</seg>
<seg id="82"> A miracle, they were not developed nevertheless for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads with the starts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83"> Tempur with warmth softly, in cool environment solidifies itself it again.</seg>
<seg id="84"> Thus it adapts to the human body perfectly and distributes themselves on optimal way the body printing.</seg>
<seg id="85"> It is general from there not only ideally for the prevention of printing fire, but increased the sleep comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86"> Viscoelastic foam materials do not however only become with mattresses, but also with other health products, how uses e.g. with special foot padding, which are to provide relief for the legs and the containers.</seg>
<seg id="87"> Native manufacturers use for example the foam materials Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.</seg>

<seg id="1"> The army has so many igniter cords that one could tape completely Czech Republic you to hold however only two years</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Czech army has 445 kilometers of igniter cords to be bought, with explosive devices ignited.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In the year before the Ministry of Defense had produced already 224 kilometers of igniter cord to the army camps.</seg>
<seg id="4"> It is already reassuring to know that the armed forces out-ensured for 225 years.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The problem is only the durability of the igniter cords - two, at the most however four years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The army bought the igniter cords of the corporation STV Group, A.S. for läppische 40 million crowns.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In its reason for the purchase the general staff MF DNES, which would use soldiers annually to the 60 kilometers of igniter cord, answered this enormous quantity of igniter cord.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The searches of Armeepyrotechnikern according to, which addressed MF DNES on it, it comes out from this indication that the whole army would have to complete annually extremely intensive pyrotechnic training - from all generals and officers of the army command, up to the secretaries and charwomen.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Secretary of Defense Alexandr Vondra and army general Vlastimil Picek not exceptionally.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers igniter cords would only thus let itself justify halfway.</seg>
<seg id="11"> This length by the way corresponds to 25,000 explosions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> In addition, these army existence became in such a way for more than ten years are enough.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> If however still the old rule of experts is valid that for the training of each new career soldier two meters of igniter cord are sufficient completely, then the army created itself a reassuring supply by these new purchases - also under the criterion of the increased need of the pioneer and special-purpose forces - for the 225 years already mentioned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Soldiers of the sentence brigade weighted recently with the Secretary of Defense Vondra, it would have nearly no cartridges for hand-held weapons more, so that firing exercises of the missing means are because of strongly reduced.</seg>
<seg id="15"> To be silent from the lack of pant completely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> " Me it is not received why she kaufen." from us such enormous amounts of igniter cords;</seg>
<seg id="17"> But that is its decision, it already will finally know, to which she brauchen." her;</seg>
<seg id="18"> " For us the army is a good customer, who we come as dealers as far as possible against möchten" , the sales manager of the STV Group says January Děcký.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> January Pejšek, which justifies speakers of the Ministry of Defense the purchase hundred of kilometers of igniter cord thereby, which would have itself army so at least for ten years with this " Munition" covered up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> January Děcký of the STV Group speaks however only of a four years old life of the igniter cords and police and Armeepyrotechniker only of two years.</seg>
<seg id="21"> " With perfect storage are probably the four mentioned years möglich" , one of them does not grant, which wants to remain however anonymous, in order as a soldier to the criticism at the army to be accused.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> At expiration of the life any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and the life of the soldiers does not endanger.</seg>
<seg id="23"> These tests are however not in vain, but cost further money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> A further argument of the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers of igniter cord.</seg>
<seg id="25"> " They cost us sixty per cent less, than the last year supply of 244 Kilometern" , speaker Pejšek communicates the point of view of the buyers of the Ministry of Defense to us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Only to the comparison: The annual consumption of igniter cords of Pyrotechnikern of the police, already some years liquidate, exceed the ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet brother army long hardly 1,500 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> And the police orders in each case such quantities of this ammunition, which can use it still before expiration of the life.</seg>
<seg id="28"> Already the security of the Pyrotechniker because of, in addition one keeps oneself so the possibility open for flexible purchases of more modern and thus also reliable igniter cords.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The Ministry of Defense has anyway enormous problems with the liquidation Zehntausender tons of ammunition from times Warsaw Treaty, when the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovakian People's Army prepared for its campaign to the Rhine.</seg>
<seg id="30"> According to the Pyrotechnikern, whom MF DNES addressed, in a few years the same problem expects the Czech armed forces with the liquidation hundred of kilometers of old igniter cords, which it " in such a way today; günstig" bought.</seg>

<seg id="9"> Short time after they began to concentrate on vegetable oil presses.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Within 18 years they ascended to largest manufacturers of automatic presses in all of Central Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But only by success in the mentioned competition and its Medialisierung entered it also the consciousness of the non--specialized public.</seg>
<seg id="12"> " Not only that our customers notice the mark Farmet clearly more intensively now, also our foreign partners began the circumstance to be able to co-operate with a company which achieved greatest possible success in its country, larger value beizumessen" , Karel Žďárský says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The past year did not however only stand with Farmet in the indication of the victory euphoria.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The appreciation proceeded from the economic results of the enterprise in the year 2008 and a part of 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And straight 2009 were the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The crisis, which vibrated the citizens, but above all enterprises at that time still less, achieved straight its high point - many companies were compelling to stop their investment projects and to limit the purchase of new mechanisms and technologies.</seg>
<seg id="17"> " This situation could not we naturally also entgehen."</seg>
<seg id="18"> " The conversions decreased/went back by 40 per cent, we had production to limit and even to dismissals greifen" , Karel Žďárský explains</seg>
<seg id="19"> A capable of surviving enterprise must seize every now and then also such unpopular measures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> It succeeded however to hold the situation into the grasp too gotten and the company in the black numbers even if with smaller profits, than before the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="21"> With one the enterprise was not determined to make reductions - during the investments in the research and development.</seg>
<seg id="22"> " From the subsidy we built a research and a training center, we encouraged our presentation on international fairs and acquired main prices with domestic Ausstellungen" , Žďárský says.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Everything witnesses of the fact that we overcame the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="24"> The conversions grow again and with them also the number of new coworkers.</seg>

<seg id="2"> In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen the anti-corruption police made arrests in the last days.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. were exhausted from the detectives in handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="4"> This had allegedly tried to manipulate a straight taking place public competition in such a way for the completion of requirements for restitution that properties offered in the competition were assigned to a concrete prospective customer.</seg>
<seg id="5"> This is to have paid Luboš G. for it one half million.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> " At this time I can only confirm that the police a person verfolgt" because of the crime of fraudulent machinations with a public competition; , said Antonie Zelená, which " boss of the Pilsner public prosecutor's office of the newspaper; Právo" , it cannot grant further details regarding the current investigations.</seg>
<seg id="7"> 24 hours later the 46-jährige became an entrepreneur of the police again to dismiss.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In which way it could manipulate the public competition, upon it one can only speculate in view of the meager official information.</seg>

<seg id="15"> Obviously against a fat compensation.</seg>
<seg id="16"> That would be also a sufficient explanation for why he had a large money with its arrest such with itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Luboš G. had already in the past all too good contacts to the Pilsner ground fund.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Thus it played a role, which criminally one pursued, because it gave change in spare restitutions properties also in the Causa of the former boss of the ground fund Václav Sankota, to which already location decisions to building projects pleases were.</seg>
<seg id="19"> At that time Luboš G. acquired of ground fund for example also properties, which were intended for the building of public roads, more exactly said, in the place, where the building of the Zufahrtsmagistrale polarized Borské to the trade area was planned.</seg>

<seg id="2"> The households must count the rents starting from January not only on higher costs of all kinds of energy, but also on higher water and waste water fees and of long-distance heating and at some places grow also.</seg>

<seg id="4"> River will have to pay gas up to around 4,6 per cent more expensively, around 2 per cent and more, in some cities one up to a tenth more for water supplies and at some places will raise the price of also the long-distance heating supplies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> However the current price increase costs the housing budget annually some hundred crowns more.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The heavy current prices were lowered thereby by all main suppliers, debt are thus the clear promotion of the generation of current from renewable sources, in particular from Fotovoltaikanlagen.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Gas becomes only moderately more expensively, this however exactly if the people at most must to heat and have highest consumption.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Also here is to be counted thus on some hundred crowns more per year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> While river and gas in completely Czech Republic become expensive, the prices for long-distance heating from city are different to city.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Above all larger places plan price increases.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="16"> Enormous rent increases are to be expected for example in 140.000 flat lets for rent, with which starting from January the so-called renting adjustment is omitted.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Thus for example the housing enterprise plans CPI Byty, which possesses Labem 2500 dwellings in Ústí nad, to increase the rents starting from January equal around one hundred per cent.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Who with this rent increase does not agree, which the enterprise wants to sue judicially.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="20"> The straight missing interest of parents or their unbelievable tolerance when knocking against with the own Sprösslingen is considered as one of the main causes for the increasing alcoholism of children.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> A drunk child, who spends the night under medical supervision, is paradoxically better to, than a child, who has to fight on the next day only with an unpleasant tomcat.</seg>
<seg id="31"> , One can drive the headache out in the morning after, which is due to the Dehydration and to lack of glucose in the hospital with a liquid-donating infusion with glucose and nutrients, which are missing to the organism.</seg>

<seg id="1"> A longer index finger than Ringfinger means a lower risk to get sick with cancer</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Men, whose index finger is longer, as the Ringfinger, are obviously exposed to a smaller risk to get sick with Prostatakrebs.</seg>
<seg id="3"> That is the surprising result of a study, which was published on Wednesday by British the journal OF CAN cerium.</seg>
<seg id="4"> That is to be connected with the mirror of the male hormone Testosteron.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> " Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as simple test for the risk of Prostatakrebs and this sechzig" in particular with men to; , the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, explained Professorin at Krebsforschungsinstitut at the university in Warwick.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The finger could thus determine help, which men should absolutely undergo to a Prostatakrebs test, above all, if genetic risks or other factors of risk are present, like for example family health loads, Mrs. Eeles added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In the period of 1994-2009 she pursued than 1500 patients with Prostatakrebs with her colleagues in Britain more, at the same time in addition, 3000 healthy men.</seg>
<seg id="8"> With more as half of the participants of the study the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the Ringfinger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> For these men the same probability of Prostatakrebs, as for 19 per cent of those men, was valid whose ring and index finger were equivalent long.</seg>
<seg id="10"> With men, whose index finger was longer than the Ringfinger, this risk sank however by 33 per cent, with men to sixty by 87 per cent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The relationship of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which already form at the pränatalen age, reflects obviously the different mirrors of sex hormones, the child was exposed to which in the Gebärmutter.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Less Testosteron corresponds to a longer index finger.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Earlier research resulted in that the straight Testosteron accelerates the growth of Prostatakrebs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Václav Pačes, prominent Czech Genetiker and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK, him this study was volatilely well-known, yet do not consider it the relationship between the finger length and the cancer risk so far " completely erwiesen."</seg>

<seg id="9"> But who would like to know still more about ice, that does not come to " Gelato University" the Italian company Carpigiani past.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The ice university furnished the manufacturer of ice machines in the year 2003, so that the ice cream becomes fair from its machines everywhere the high Italian ideals.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The three-day-long basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest inlet and visitor from all over the world.</seg>

<seg id="13"> Some dreams others in the Midlife Crisis about a new career, dares itself simply times on the smooth ice of its vague longings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> This mark are there 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil over Hungary to Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow Food movement and wants in the country of the industrial Ice Cream in the future a European quality product to offer.</seg>

<seg id="18"> A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bar - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes, because its children love Italian ice cream.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Maestro Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains first the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream to the participants.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Are crucial not only good taste, but also the seidige suppleness and the good consistency.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Luciano does not forget the Sahnehäubchen of the national and at all südländischen building of over with its training in addition: " Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then still each quantity of romance is dabei."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first step for production seems completely simple.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Luciano tilts to basicadd the milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which heats up and then on four degrees cools everything down immediately with an electronic program on 85 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Then it untwists a cock at the machine, and a pasteurisierte white basis cream, basis for all milk ice sorts comes out.</seg>
<seg id="25"> The lecturer with questions is stormed immediately: Can one manufacture ice cream only with natural materials without stabilizer?</seg>
<seg id="26"> How can one leave free run to the own experimentation desire?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Luciano warns of it, from the spirit of the time in errs lead to let.</seg>
<seg id="28"> Who of ice cream " only from natural Zutaten" talks, possibly nevertheless stabilizers used - usually a natural product, about Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Naturally one can manufacture ice also without stabilizer, only it must be sold then within a daily, otherwise it sags in itself together, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Certain variations at the basic dimension are permitted.</seg>
<seg id="31"> It becomes more exciting with the flavours.</seg>
<seg id="32"> For the taste in the ice Maestro Luciano differentiates between added, which one buys in the Obst-Abteilung or with the sweets of the supermarket.</seg>
<seg id="33"> Besides gives it gives powders and pastes.</seg>
<seg id="34"> " The suppliers are anzudrehen." all to try, you dozens of aromatized additives;</seg>
<seg id="35"> " But you should simply times experimentieren."</seg>
<seg id="36"> Either with the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and blow fruits.</seg>
<seg id="37"> Or with the ice cream from the white basic dimension, those with eggs to the yellow cream becomes even and with cocoa powder the basis for all possible chocolate seductions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Now the class participants may to the ice machines.</seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano leaves it in each case four to different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, Mokka and Haselnuss ice manufactures - with or without eggs in the basic dimension, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural additives.</seg>
<seg id="40"> Also the fruit ice sorts are submitted to the same experiment.</seg>
<seg id="41"> More flavour material, more fruit Püree - geschmacklich that is not necessarily better.</seg>
<seg id="42"> Haselnuss ice does not taste more nussiger necessarily, if it contains more Haselnüsse.</seg>
<seg id="43"> The most popular Kiwi ice manufactures the working group, which uses more fruits, fewer waters and somewhat less stabilizer.</seg>
<seg id="44"> Only a balanced mixture emphasizes the taste of a Gelato correctly, says Luciano.</seg>
<seg id="45"> Ice production is an arithmetic problem: If peach Püree with much sugar is used, the sugar portion in the basic prescription must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="46"> For lemon ice an extra portion of sugar is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano pulls equipment out, with which he the sugar content of the fruit sorts certainly (winegrowers measure thereby the Oechsle in the Traubenmost).</seg>
<seg id="48"> Fortunately tables facilitate the Rechnerei.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Ice to make requires no longer as much physical employment as in former times.</seg>
<seg id="50"> Not only the equipment for the automatic production of the basic dimensions helps.</seg>
<seg id="51"> There is also equipment, in which the finished ice mixture is cremig struck at the same time and cooled on temperatures below freezing.</seg>
<seg id="52"> All automation to the defiance small breakdowns are not missing.</seg>
<seg id="53"> The Brazilian Gustavo bekleckert itself and its course colleagues from top to bottom with Fruchtpüree, when the oversize staff mixer gets to him out of control.</seg>
<seg id="54"> " In each Kurs" , Maestro Luciano means " it is only one question of the time, until passiert." such a thing;</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Before the coast of the US Federal State it will give no new drillings for oil to Florida in the gulf of Mexico in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="3"> An appropriate prohibition issued the government in Washington - and thus its earlier plans finally recall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Also before the Atlantic coast new drillings remain for the time being forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="5"> This communicated Ministers of the Interior Ken Salazar on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Cause for the strict prohibition, which is to be valid at least for the coming five years, is " the explosion of the drilling platform; Deepwater Horizon" in April.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Before the misfortune, which cost and to the largest environment disaster of the USA led eleven workers the life, president Barack Obama had signaled his readiness on pressure of the opposition and the industry to permit new drillings in the eastern part of the gulf of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The proponents want to reduce thereby the dependence of the USA von Öllieferungen from the foreign country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Who carries the responsibility for the devastating oil pollution in the gulf, is not clarified until today finally.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In the center of the criticism is located the British energy group BP, which is confronted with demands for billion.</seg>
<seg id="11"> A commission of inquiry on behalf Obamas is to submit in the course of December their results.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In October Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar had waived the drilling stop imposed after the explosion.</seg>
<seg id="13"> In the connection different oil companies had placed immediately requests for new drilling projects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> With sharper controls and stricter safety regulations Obama and Salazar want to exclude a recent disaster.</seg>
<seg id="15"> At present the responsible board of control, which was guessed/advised after numerous corruption reproaches in disrepute, is reformed fundamentally.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Parallel Obama announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas companies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The industry warns now publicly of the fact that the delivery in the gulf would fail by a stricter adjustment clearly smaller than so far.</seg>
<seg id="18"> " The plans of the government are the largest brake for the growth of the oil and Gasindustrie" , the result of a current branch inquiry reads by the advisor company BDO - still before the drilling prohibition of Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The American Energy Alliance deplores besides the uncertainty in the industry: " Nobody knows, what exactly with the adjustment change wird."</seg>

<seg id="9"> In the meantime slowly-acting flowing waters is perfectly dead.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Before five years enormous amounts crude oil poured into the enormous humid area from a burst piping.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Fischer from that close convenient small towns Bodo must now six hours rudders, in order to arrive into fischhaltige waters: The Ogoniland lain in the heart of the Nigerdeltas is considered as one of the most badly verpesteten regions of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> On the trip by the Mangrovensümpfe durchzogenen of river courses the whole extent of devastation becomes obvious.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Instead of bright water the motorboat turns up brown Brühe, who dips its hand into the water, pulls out oily fingers.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The roots of the Mangrovenbäumchen rise up like black Lakritzstangen out of the ground, leave sad isolate palms their whisks which can be found to hang.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Bird-swarm, as they are otherwise usual in humid areas, one searches in vain: As soon as Außenborder is silent, eerie peace spreads in like a gas station the smelling earlier Paradies.</seg>
<seg id="16"> " Which happens here, is ecological Kriegsführung" , Celestine Akpobari says darkly: " We live in constant danger for the Gesundheit."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The war comparison is appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The settlement area of the Ogoni is for decades a umkämpftes battleground: Here the first Explorateure from Europe penetrated, here organized itself in the 80's-years with late executed writers the Ken Saro Wiwa the first resistance, here had the Shell company 1993 its production to adjust more than 60 years ago, because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> This very day the return after Ogoniland is refused to the enterprise: While from the entire delta region of the three-way size of Switzerland over 5000 drilling sources and 7000 kilometers pipings are also pumped daily more than two million barrel of the black gold, the oil fields are appropriate for the company in the Ogoniland fallow, too unstably are the situation.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Every few hundred meters rise up steel racks like bizarre sculptures out of the water: " Christbäumchen" the heads of the boreholes are much too tenderly called.</seg>
<seg id="21"> They are years old up to 50, which corrode to most to in Marks.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> More than two billion litre according to expert estimations in 50 years into the ecological system of the Deltas flowed: Year by year the quantity oil, as it " with the accident of the supertanker; Exxon Valdez" before 21 years in the sea before Alaska penetrated - one of the largest environment disasters in the history of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Who is to be made responsible for the continuous Öko GAU, over it one argues.</seg>
<seg id="25"> While the Shell company makes sabotage and the organized oil theft responsible for more than 90 per cent of the contamination, environmentalist sees bursting drilling heads and leaking pipelines as main causers.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Shell puts on substantially lower safety standards in Nigeria than otherwise in the world usual, accused the US scientist Richard Steiner the company 2008: However the rate of defects at the lines is " around a multiple more highly than anderswo" one;.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> At a place, which looks from the distance like an abandoned, oil-smeared workshop in the open air, shapes emerge from the Mangroven: They are fragment naked and up to the neck oil-smeared.</seg>
<seg id="28"> Under one of the many barrels, which are to be constituted partly connected with tubes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the area, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery.</seg>
<seg id="29"> In the barrel the crude oil over the fire is heated up several hours long, explains Michael, the boss of the group.</seg>
<seg id="30"> First gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the catching pot, later tröpfelt at the end of the line kerosene and finally Diesels out.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Thus Michael and four coworkers produce 300 litres daily up to four barrels of Diesel à: " That brings us 34,000 Naira ein" - approximately 22 dollar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state of black Africa.</seg>
<seg id="33"> Nigeria has only one refinery.</seg>
<seg id="34"> The Diesel price ridiculously low with scarcely 40 euro-cent per litre can the illegal digesters still undercut: Because they get their raw material in vain.</seg>
<seg id="35"> It comes from " Bunkerern" , which tap the pipeline net straight through Ogoniland: In this way are lost to the country according to experts in the entire Niger delta daily at least 16 million litre crude oil.</seg>
<seg id="36"> Only a infinitesimal small part of the provisionally stored temporarily raw material is however illegaly improved: Organized criminal networks, to which also politicians and high-ranking of military are to belong, fill the lion's share into tankers and verscherbeln it on the world market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The debate, whether the environment disaster is owed rather activities of the population or the laxen production way, holds the activist Akpobari for purely academic.</seg>
<seg id="38"> " If the oil companies were not noticed as intruders and if they would not have so thoroughly destroyed the base of life Fischer, there would be neither to sabotage nor theft and illegal Raffinerien."</seg>
<seg id="39"> In the meantime the relationship of the Ogoni is particularly destroyed to Shell however so that only one departure of the company would be applicable: " Perhaps different nationalities place themselves like the Chinese than better heraus."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> More than 10,000 humans thought in New Zealand of the buried miners, who were explained after several explosions in a mine for dead.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Still the corpses could not be saved, because the security situation is further precarious in the misfortune pit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Scarcely two weeks ago it had come into the Pike River mine close of the city Greymouth to a violent explosion.</seg>
<seg id="5"> 29 miners at the age between 17 and 62 years were buried under days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> A probe had been down-let into the misfortune pit, however no trace of survivors had discovered.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Due to the high concentration poisonous gases and further following explosions could for safety reasons no rescue squad descend.</seg>
<seg id="8"> After the second violent explosion the authorities and expert had assumed it gives no more chance of survival for the buddies.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The corpses could not be saved so far.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Now member and friends with a commemoration ceremony reminded of the dead ones.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Ten thousand humans had met in radiating sunshine in Greymouth on the south island of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Two minutes long were silent it.</seg>
<seg id="13"> In honours of the buried miners 29 tables were set up to see on those helmets, lamps and the names of the buddies were.</seg>

</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Does Splatter fit the art cinema?</seg>
<seg id="3"> The producer Nicolas Winding Refn plumbs with its fighter Epos " Walhalla Rising" old category borders again out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Of which public the Danish producer Nicolas Winding Refn may have thought, when it " Walhalla Rising" turned?</seg>
<seg id="5"> A caught Wikinger warrior with only one eye (WAD Mikkelsen) frees itself from his torturers and surrounds with almost superhuman forces by the dozen its opponents - ideally bloody Action, straight because our hero sounds gladly rabiater killing methods served and its enemies already times the Gedärme from the alive body tears oneself for young male spectators in the search for, if he has bad mood.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On the other hand a eye says, as it is actually called, the whole film about no word, and also the other figures admit themselves at the most times to or two sentences or a few painful death cries to hinreißen.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Otherwise is silent and one geschwelgt in the gruselig beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, which the Wikingerwelt of before approximately thousand years the backdrop offers.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Ideally rather for adult Cineasten with interest in Existentialismus and very calm camera trips.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> , If a film has several target groups, harm beautifully only, if they are mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Producer Winding Refn is valid since its wild and gestylten Drogendealer trilogy " Pusher" as a kind Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, refuses however stoisch making accessible its works with somewhat more humor the mainstream or somewhat less brutality for the Arthouse.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Most art cinema friends might let themselves be deterred from the brain mass squirting around and the Gedärmen.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The act ion fans die at the latest before boredom if a eye for freely interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian mission acres breaks open via ship after Jerusalem and an eternity in calm air and fog feststeckt, before the crew arrives obvious at America and continues to be silent there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> No miracle thus that " Walhalla Rising" in Germany no cinema rental business found and now only on DVD appeared.</seg>
<seg id="14"> That is particularly because of the magnificent pictures a misery, in addition, because behind the prätentiösen to bluttriefenden front a sometimes exciting piece cinema hides itself, which earned something attention.</seg>
<seg id="15"> In this film it does not concern dialogues or a stringer duck action, it is all atmosphere, a film-nascent having a temperature area.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> And from there is no escaping for the spectator.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Refn hardly grants one moment of the relaxation to it and ties it with its icy pictures and the dark Trance well-behaved soundtrack completely slowly the throat too, above all however with the incomprehensible hate, which against-strikes him from the hearts of the figures.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Only a small blond boy, a eye faithfully to the side stands, retains themselves as as innocence, all different by anger is floated.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Very most the einäugige hero, whose motives are never explained, who becomes sometime however for enemies and temporarily allied one the warrior from hell, possibly as the Ambassador of the devil.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Puzzling earthwork</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The atomic energy authority IAEA has new referring to a secret nuclear program in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The country resists however to take in addition position - still it permits controls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Against midnight of 5th on 6 September 2007 attacks at least four Israeli F-15 I of combat aircraft a mysterious, würfelförmiges building in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="5"> It stands on the bank Euphrates; the next larger city, 30 kilometers far away, is Dair as-Saur.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Their name emerges in documents of the international atomic energy authority (IAEA), if it concerns the reactor, which Syria built allegedly with the help of from North Korea in the right parallelepiped, hidden in a valley, which goes off the river.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a Briefing of the US foreign secret service CIA von Ende April 2008 also the reactor common under the name of the close locality el-Kibar would have been well suitable to produce plutonium - from nuclear weapons to build let themselves.</seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes against it the technology from the 50s is hardly suited.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA led a video presentation forwards with indistinct satellite photographs.</seg>
<seg id="10"> By computer animation it faded in, where which components of the reactor before the destruction are to have been, which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the atomic center Yongbyon.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Besides it submitted, those to photos the building from the proximity to show or the interior.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor is confessed shortly before start-up, it was said, but equips not yet with fuel rods been.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more as three years after the bombardment, is hardly more well-known than at that time, the mysteries became rather larger with the time.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The former US president George W. Bush revealed recently in his memoirs the fact that the CIA before the attack was quite safe that Syria in el-Kibar built a reactor but hardly saw reference points for it that it " in the country; an active Nuklearwaffenprogramm" gave.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Some secret service agents in Europe are there rather still more careful and speak only of one " alleged Reaktor" , even if it " the CIA presentation for; plausibel" hold.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Hard proofs are missing to them, just like the IAEA.</seg>
<seg id="17"> In demand, as safe he was to have a reactor before itself a high UN-diplomat answered in the summer only lapidary, those IAEA " enough material, around questions too stellen."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The debris of the alleged " unused Militärgebäudes" the Syrians created hasty aside and planed the area thoroughly.</seg>
<seg id="19"> A IAEA team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium in June 2008, which had been manufactured by humans, found nevertheless.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Besides the IAEA kept satellite photographs of commercial offerers from the time after the attack, who might be more meaningful than of the CIA presented direct over a member state.</seg>
<seg id="21"> However these photographs on the market are not to be gotten, because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.</seg>
<seg id="22"> The IAEA cannot verify from there their authenticity independently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always to have protested, a secret nuclear programme to have never operated or a reactor build.</seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium comes from the Israeli weapons, explained Damascus.</seg>
<seg id="25"> But the IAEA rejected after analysis of the particles as improbable.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Damascus refuses since then discussing - exactly the same as the satellite photographs.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Besides it refuses a second inspection in el-Kibar and the entrance to the rubble of the zerbombten building to the testers.</seg>
<seg id="28"> In addition, Israel is silent iron.</seg>
<seg id="29"> " We are never kommentieren" that; , recently that affirmed at present the attack acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert the official position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Thus the investigation of the case drags itself since June 2008 without result and " develops increasingly to a serious reliability problem for the Behörde" , how a high western diplomat at the seat of the IAEA in Vienna grants - finally a heavy offence against the Nuclear NONPROLIFERATION Treaty is located in the area, over which the IAEA is awake.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As key to progress with the clearing-up the IAEA sees obviously three further mechanisms, which " in functional Verbindung" with the presumed reactor to stand are to still exist - and differently than these.</seg>
<seg id="32"> The inspectors revealed so far neither, which plants it concerns, still which function it to have or which lets it appear suspicious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> After information of the South German newspaper they are internally called Masyaf and Iskandariayah with the IAEA Marj as-Sultan, derived again from close convenient cities.</seg>
<seg id="34"> Independent institutes for the Science and internationally to Security in Washington (Isis) these places identified and on satellite photographs a building complex with Masyaf made, with which it acts in all probability over one of the suspicious objects.</seg>
<seg id="35"> It is possibly in or directly beside a military base - exactly with this reason Syria of the IAEA refuses the entrance to the three places.</seg>
<seg id="36"> In Vienna is called it, the Syrians was afraid one fishing expedition - that the IAEA is before-sent from the USA, in order to spy military plants.</seg>
<seg id="37"> Because the nuclear detectives had become attentive by an hint of the U.S. secret services on the mechanisms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has references, under the fact satellite photos that between the three places and the right parallelepiped at the Euphrates material and was transported.</seg>
<seg id="39"> A high western diplomat in Vienna said, at least one of the plants could " in connection with the Brennstoffproduktion" stand.</seg>
<seg id="40"> It gives however " no referring to sensitive Aktivitäten" , thus uranium enrichment or reprocessing; Processes, which are necessary for the building of nuclear weapons.</seg>
<seg id="41"> The type of reactor is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.</seg>
<seg id="42"> But where the uranium should have come and where from it the plutonium for the bomb should be separated later, to these central questions there are if necessary plausible assumptions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> Unclear it is also whether rubble, which could save valuable traces, to which three places were stored.</seg>
<seg id="44"> As if the hundreds of truck loads of the ground would have disappeared, want to have nobody information about where the debris remained.</seg>
<seg id="45"> Only the few kilometers of el-Kibar on the other side Euphrates convenient salt mine Al-Tibni, which examined Syria 1998 for its suitability than camps for radioactive waste, the IAEA than improbable is valid.</seg>
<seg id="46"> The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had it recently in an analysis of satellite photographs for the renowned magazine Jane' s Intelligence Review brought with the reactor in connection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Photographs from the orbit show however that Syria at the three suspicious places made earthwork and removed large containers, after the IAEA entrance had required.</seg>
<seg id="48"> That can be coincidence, however hardly contributed to eliminate the suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="49"> Besides it is called some months in diplomat circles, the IAEA after used to develop a plan for inspections there which should permit it to Syria, any military secrets to true - alone the expenditure shows, how large the interest of the inspectors is.</seg>
<seg id="50"> Meanwhile, Damascus ironed also this proposal off.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Still one year ago had appeased western diplomat in Vienna, who was reactor destroyed, therefore the thing does not have high urgency, for instance US Ambassador Glyn Davies brings so-called special inspections since a few months in the play, one of the sharpest means, which have the Viennese atomic energy authority, in order to implement controls.</seg>
<seg id="52"> IAEA boss Yukiya Amano, which would have to suggest these inspections, " of course of; an option, for which I in the future openly bin" spoken, still however he hesitates.</seg>
<seg id="53"> It lies a high risk in this way: On the one hand it needs for it a majority in the board of governors of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented there are everything but erpicht on an escalation.</seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other hand, as a diplomat gives to consider: " What is, if they do not find nothing at all at the end? "</seg>

<seg id="1"> Love in times of the war</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Since Angelina Jolie began in the summer with the work on her still nameless direction debut, there is annoyance.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The film script wrote it, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Much more white one over it non is however already enough for unrest.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Persistent keeps itself the rumor, the woman, Muslim, falls in love during the Yugoslavia war with their Serbian rapist.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Bosnian woman federations protested immediately, whereupon some turning days planned in Sarajevo were moved at short notice to Hungary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In the meantime the film is turned off in Hungary and in post office production, but it still protested in Bosnia.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote over the UN refugee organization UNHCR Jolie and required a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper now reported - Jolie is even ambassador of the UN refugee organization.</seg>
<seg id="9"> It is diplomatic non it to the women weeks ago already times a meeting in Hungary offered, which rejected however.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The meeting must take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Love stories in Vergewaltigungscamps it did not give, and to Jolies attitude the victims in relation to betrayal it enough over the film script.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Their organization recommended according to the UN refugee organization to dismiss Jolie as an ambassador reports the Guardian.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> What exactly however wrote Jolie for scenes?</seg>
<seg id="14"> The Bosnian cultural Ministry, which got to read their film script, gave a turning permission for Sarajevo after some back and forth - it is not completely clear, why Jolie did not come then nevertheless.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The young authoress protested, her does not pursue political intentions with her film, with much trouble into the Yugoslavia conflict trained themselves, wants the terrible consequences of the war to show and to all sides involved a voice give.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> With contents it remains however vague.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Thus still another second Synopsis circulates to the film in the net, which sounds then nevertheless rather differently: The loving already knew each other therein before outbreak of war and meet again, when them, Bosnian Muslim, are kidnapped in a Serbian Camp, in which it as a guard work.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Which nevertheless substantially differently sounds " than the variant; Rape victim slams himself in Folterknecht."</seg>
<seg id="19"> That Jolies film actually already before the war begins - as much is safe.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The pressure on it, so Jolie, is " unfairly and is based on Fehlinformationen."</seg>
<seg id="21"> Now you can provide probably only the hackers of Hollywood peace: By it the film script, as already so many place before, illegaly in the net.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1"> The demokatrische routine</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The democracy movement in Latin America becomes more strongly, as the support of private enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Crime is a larger problem than unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="4"> In many parts of the region the influence of Brazil is larger than that of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="5"> To these results came the Latinobarómetro inquiry, which was accomplished in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.</seg>
<seg id="6"> This inquiry is accomplished since 1995 regularly and points so the opinion change out in this region.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two facts particularly fall in the inquiry of this year from September and October in' s eye.</seg>
<seg id="8"> First of all the good tendency in Latin America</seg>
<seg id="9"> and secondly the increasing interest in democracy and their most important institutions.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In numerous countries at the South American Pacific coast the democratic movement increased strongly (S. table 1).</seg>
<seg id="11"> In Peru, where the economy grows annually since 2002 by approx. 6%, the number of the democracy proponents of 40% e.g. rose in the year 2005 to 61% in this year.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Also in Mexico, where the economy recovers since the strong break-down in the last year again, such a trend is to be recognized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But only half of the asked ones in Mexico and Brazil, which is most densely populated countries of the region, convinced democrats, what lowers the regional average (S. diagram 2).</seg>
<seg id="14"> Approx. 44% of the asked ones explained that it with the democratic practice of their country contently its. Those are as many as in the last year, however 25% more than in the year 2001 (diagram 3).</seg>
<seg id="15"> About 34% trust the congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of the latter yearly, show however a clear rise opposite 2003 (17% and/or 24%).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> One decade ago of Latin America undermined economic crises the efforts around more democracy.</seg>
<seg id="17"> This also during the world economic crisis persisted, is possibly because of the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a short recession phase and fast again recovered.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Beyond that arms by a stronger social net were caught.</seg>
<seg id="19">  (Sound reports of the UN-economic commission for Latin America of this week rose 2009 the poverty rate in Latin America only slightly and is in this year 32% pleases.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But from country to country there are strong tendency differences (S. diagram 4).</seg>
<seg id="21"> Of Brazil strong economy and the popularity of separating president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reflects itself in a common progress thinking.</seg>
<seg id="22"> In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more strongly noticeable and increased force crime, this is less the case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Only for the second time since beginning of inquiry many asked ones see a larger problem than in Latin America in the crime in their country unemployment (S. diagram 5).</seg>
<seg id="24"> Approx. 31% state that either they or a family member became in the last year victims of a crime. But opposite 38% in the last year sank the values and achieve thus the lowest conditions since 1995.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The rising economic performance reflects itself in the stronger support of the private and of the free-market economy: approx. 71% of the asked ones supraregional indicated that the private sector for the development is indispensable, in the year 2007 were it 56% (S. diagram 6).</seg>
<seg id="26"> Approx. 58% explained that only the free-market economy can bring progress to its country, compared to 47% in the last year.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly enough 62% of the asked ones maintained this opinion in Venezuela (and 80% are for a private sector), although its left president, nationalisation Hugo Chávez, many private business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed from the United States (9%, according to 19% of the asked ones (18% in the last year) invariably since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% in the last year).</seg>
<seg id="29"> The asked ones in Mexico and most countries of Central America however see the most influential country in the USA, whereby this role is transferred to the Dominican republic and Nicaragua von Venezuela.</seg>

<seg id="1"> An electoral defeat</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Nobody had expected that the elections would be perfect on 28 November in Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="3"> But the facts exceeded the fears of the Wahlhelfer, who hurried the shaken country to the assistance, by far.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Overfilled ballot boxes, several times delivered voices, Wahlscheine in the Rinnstein, destroyed polling stations and intimidations were only one part of the problems.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Polling stations opened with delay for hours.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Many Haitianer, of which many had become homeless by the earthquake in January, touched around in the search for an option.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Some gave up finally completely.</seg>
<seg id="8"> A dozen of presidential candidates, among them some presumed front runners, required the abolition of the election results due to an alleged fraud.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Generally speaking country came it too partial protests by force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Designated nevertheless Edmond Mulet, the director/conductor of the UN-mission in Haiti, which " choice; as quite good in many Belangen."</seg>
<seg id="11"> According to a careful statement of observers of the organization OF American States and the Caribbean Community " if these irregularities make, so seriously they also to be like, the process not necessarily ungültig."</seg>
<seg id="12"> In other words, the show goes on.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The election commission, which allegedly obligated to the unpopular separating president René Préval and its candidate, Jew Célestin is, will announce the provisional results on 7 December.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The expected ballot is fixed for January.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> There is still hope to the choice.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The two prominent opposition candidates, the RWS musician Michel Martelly and the former roofridge lady me country Manigat, withdrew their initial invalidity complaint.</seg>
<seg id="17"> If Jew Célestin, which meets only small one or no agreement with the voters, from which Wahlberhörde as the winner of the ballot explains, this could lead to problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Due to the Cholera epidemic and the fact that more still in tents live it was feared than 1 million of the earthquake victims, a small election turnout.</seg>
<seg id="19"> From the election day many Haitianer were prevented by organization lacking from the casting of votes.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Shortly before beginning of choice approx. 250,000 documents of identification, which are needed for the choice, were not yet expenditure-divided.</seg>
<seg id="21"> It stands much on the play.</seg>
<seg id="22"> The donor countries regard a legitimate, appreciative government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="23"> The Haitianer is the same opinion.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Secretly into the center</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the weeks after the sudden death of your man of Argentina experienced president, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, which drove its popularity rate upward around 20 points on over 50%. That is the highest value since its choice in the year 2007.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Whether you help this however in the next year to a re-election, depends on it, whether the obviously mourning Cristina Fernández is more ready to compromise than her deceased husband, its predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The indications of it are not clear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Néstor Kirchner, which directed the economic policy also after the choice of its wife, set up frequently budgets, those the tax revenues, which economic growth and the inflation did not consider fully.</seg>
<seg id="6"> This permitted it the pair of presidents to spend the extra incomes after own discretion.</seg>
<seg id="7"> On the paper the Fernández government lost the majority in the congress in the last year.</seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is divided and Kirchners death after a cardiac infarct on 27 October led to further discords.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Some dissidents from the numbers of the governing Peronisten placed themselves behind Cristina Fernández.</seg>
<seg id="10"> But after chaotic meetings (with those a parliamentarian another in the face struck and others the government of the bribery accused) it did not succeed to the congress to discharge the household for 2011.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> " I am not diskutieren" over it; , so the president.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The household 2010 is valid now also for the next year, whereby the president has still more opportunity to spend money after own discretion.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy runs hot: probably it will grow in this year over up to 9%.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The official inflation rate is at present with 11,1%, but numerous private estimations - and wage demands of the trade unions - drive the value on nearly 30%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner, which took over 2003 the office, when Argentina von Wirtschaftskrisen was vibrated, explained growth and fight against poverty as its principal purposes, and not the inflation lowering.</seg>
<seg id="16"> It refused co-operation with the IMF, chicaned the private sector and cleaned national Institut for statistics and census INDEC, which thereupon the official inflation statistics schönte.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Can Fernández hit a more moderate way now?</seg>
<seg id="18"> It called the private sector and the trade union leader6s to discussions.</seg>
<seg id="19"> And according to official statements wage increases are to be limited in the next year on 18%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The high world market prices for of Argentina agricultural products gave a strong lift to the economy.</seg>
<seg id="21"> But the inflation undermined the growth spurt by a large Devaluation in the year 2002.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Possibly Cristina Fernández for this reason Argentina would like to attach financialeconomically the remainder of the world.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Beginning of this yearly met the government an agreement with security owners, who had rejected the earlier conversion of debts of the country in the year 2001.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Now Fernández seems on an agreement with the backers from of Paris the club to urge, which she owes approx. $6.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="25"> The Kirchners had usually, always rejected an examination by the IMF, as in another place.</seg>
<seg id="26"> But in the last month the minister of economics Amado Boudou announced that the funds with the production new national consumer price index " technical Unterstützung" will carry out. It looks in such a way, as if this would be the first step for the cleaning of the INDEC.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not well-known whether Fernández will be politically active after completion of their term of office also without the support by their husband.</seg>
<seg id="28"> If, it needs for it the support of the middle class, those to a large extent enough has from the Kirchnerismus.</seg>
<seg id="29"> If the Argentinier returns in March from its summer vacation, the wave of the Sympatie, which you were brought, will have died down.</seg>
<seg id="30"> If it liked to win a further choice, it must decide whether it waives many political decisions of its man quietly and quietly.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Weak applause for China</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Taiwans voters approach slowly a closer connection to the mainland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> What holds Taiwan of its large brother beyond the strait?</seg>
<seg id="4"> On 27 November more than 7.5 millions voters, that made themselves are 70% of all voters, up, in order to select in the five urban districts mayors and town councillors. This is rated as broad evaluation of the president mA Ying jeou.</seg>
<seg id="5"> By the structure of innovative business relations, incl. a partial free trade agreement, mA is a symbolic figure for the relations with the mainland. Its politics changed the relationship to the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949 effectively.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> MA has the examination existed, however only scarcely.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Although its Kuomintang party (KMT) places three of the five mayors, it did not receive majority of votes.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Instead the democratic progress party (DPP) received, which a larger independence Taiwans endorses, nearly 50% of the voices, the KMT received 45%.</seg>
<seg id="9"> With a presidential election this would have meant for mA problems.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Since its choice before two years the voice portion of its party is around approx. 8% pleases.</seg>
<seg id="11"> For the first time the DPP drew even together with the KMT into the town councillors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> During the choice it came to the occurrences usual in Taiwan such as truck convoys with Krawallmachern, flag-swivelling mass removals and only meagerly dressed dancers.</seg>
<seg id="13"> There was even the mandatory, mysterious attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT gave a speech on eve of the choice a KMT candidate,</seg>
<seg id="15"> as it a man from the quantity in the face lap. Lien was wounded and a standing around spectator was killed.</seg>
<seg id="16"> It is not clear more bizarre-wisely whether the contactors Lien wanted to kill or to settle a controversy with the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Independently of it the attack has according to Tsai Ing whom, which leaders of the DPP, which impair choice and which DPP into a bad light moved, which the KMT more voices gave.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Possibly China was the largest winner of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Remarkably the relations with the mainland one did not bring up for discussion.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Instead the candidates plans to subsidized low-rent housings and the job creation debated.</seg>
<seg id="21"> The Taiwanesen loves its actual independence and rejects of China military threat.</seg>
<seg id="22"> For this reason the KMT does not place its relations with the government in Peking gladly into the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="23"> But this time also the DPP avoided to stir the anti-Chinese feelings up too much.</seg>
<seg id="24"> It reacted with it to new consciousness that Taiwans economics without China cannot survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> MA for his part would like to be able to be confirmed that the majority of the Taiwanesen endorses its China politics.</seg>
<seg id="26"> The government in Peking will pursue further its strategy to back-lure Taiwan with economic incentives into the community.</seg>
<seg id="27"> China sent immediately a negotiator after Taipeh, in order to prepare a summit to investment security and medical co-operation.</seg>
<seg id="28"> Surely it wishes also a political integration. But the most important first.</seg>
<seg id="29"> It rather waits thereby until the presidential elections 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The DPP again invented itself in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Before two years it was strongly weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui bian sat because of corruption in the prison.</seg>
<seg id="32"> During its presidency from 2000 to 2008 it entered vehemently for absolute independence.</seg>
<seg id="33"> But under Tais regency developed a new generation of moderate politicians and the DPP fights for the voices of the working persons and the youth.</seg>
<seg id="34"> Tsai met large agreement as a presidency candidate of the DPP, like CSU Tseng chang under Chen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Their party does now everything to construct in order to show that also it is able, close relations with Peking.</seg>
<seg id="36"> Tsai plans an idea ideenschmiede as edge contact between the DPP and China. This presupposes however impartial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="37"> Tsai explained publicly that its party one " trustworthy Alternative" offer to Mas of rash approach to China.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Chen seems very annoyed about this change.</seg>
<seg id="39"> Explained it, the candidates of the DPP by its cell from better would have done to insist on Taiwans independence.</seg>
<seg id="40"> He even requested the pragmatist CSU to do without the presidency candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="41"> Also without Chens interference does the DPP heavily, their possible candidates to select.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The KMT will have itself to submit of its own self analysis.</seg>
<seg id="43"> Mas of values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their election campaign without him.</seg>
<seg id="44"> The principal reasons for its unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever further shears between arm and realm.</seg>
<seg id="45"> According to statement of a KMT speaker it will transform its cabinet as well as the local mechanisms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> The strong occurrence of the DPP lets assume that Taiwan endorses a reapproach only reduced.</seg>
<seg id="47"> Most Taiwanesen sees economic co-operation with China simultaneous as inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="48"> According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, " there is already none back mehr."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The discovery of a strange type of bacteria, which can live among other things on arsenic, opens new possibilities for new ways of life on earth and elsewhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, it is in their opinion an indication for the fact that a life is possible as vitally necessary judged elements also without those so far.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> " This organism has two Möglichkeiten."</seg>
<seg id="5"> " It needs phosphorus or Arsen." for growing either;</seg>
<seg id="6"> " That makes it somewhat completely special one, although it nearly a kind ' fremde' Way of life ist" , Paul C.W explained. Davies of the Arizona State University and CO author of the report, which appears to the magazine on Thursday in the online edition Science.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> So far six main elements were vitally necessary regarded as - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> But like the scientists, continue to grow Lake found the bacterium out in the California mono also still if it replaces phosphorus by arsenic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> " There one asks oneself nevertheless, what ist" otherwise still possible; , the CO author of the report Ariel D said. Anbar of the Arizona State University.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is an important step with the search for extraterrestial life, since scientists must recognize lives and its forms, like that Anbar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study is concerned with microbes, which were found on earth.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were announced to the discovery, gave too wide-spread speculations to cause in the Internet that the report could act of the discovery of extraterrestial life.</seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery " it shows that in other planet systems organisms can set biochemical processes with the help of other elements on and that the ' Standardelemente' , which are absolutely vitally necessary according to our opinion, not necessarily firmly given sind" , explained Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and space Sciences Research of institutes of the open university the kingdom united by Milton Keynes in.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockel was not part of the research team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> " This work is a new fact, because it shows that in fundamental biochemical processes and structures an element by another are replaced kann" , Cockell added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> This discovery was not coincidental.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Felisa wolf Simon of astro+biological Institut of NASA, which led the study, selected the mono Lake due to the high arsenic content.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Since arsenic and phosphorus resemble themselves chemically, it assumed that microbes, which are exposed to both can replace possibly an element by the other one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> " The toxicity of the arsenic is based above all on the fact that it behaves chemically similarly as Phosphor."</seg>
<seg id="21"> " Thus it falls the organisms heavily, an element from the other one to unterscheiden."</seg>
<seg id="22"> " But the difference is so large that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It arrives into our biochemical system, where it verschmiert" quasi everything; , Anbar explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers exposed the bacterium to GFAJ-1 of a rising arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The microbe grows in phosphorus better, but that it can survive also in arsenic, it points that a arsenic-based way of life can naturally occur, either on earth or to another planet or moon, on the arsenic more frequently occurs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> According to Jamie S. Foster, Dozentin for microbiology at the University OF Florida, is not new the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic. But so far there was still no functioning example.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Arsenic occurred in the early earth years more frequently, says it, therefore the science assumed early ways of life used it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> " That gives reason to the acceptance that life can have developed also differently than in the early Erdzeitalter" , so Forster, which was not member in wolf Simons research team.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="28"> The research work became from NASA, which energy Ministry and the national health authorities support.</seg>

<seg id="5"> The number of employees is lowered of over 400 on approx. 320.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For MGM Chapter 11 comes into force actually only if JPMorgan Chase locked a planned loan from $500 millions to the financing of new MGM productions.</seg>
<seg id="7"> For the moment a consortium of the investment bank, which brings in even $75 millions, leads the enterprise. The financing is to stand to in the middle of December.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to the investment bank Moelis & CO, the management, which fought with interest payments at a value of $300 millions/year to help with the solution of their financial problems.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In August the managing director Harry Sloan was replaced to a former CEO by Stephen Cooper, with Enron and restructuring expert, who admits by its activity with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts became.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The efforts of Moelis & Cooper to solve and more than 140 Gläuber of the studio out-pay the financial concerns MGMs, lasted longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="11"> After months-long discussions the parties decided at the end of of 2009 to offer the enterprise for the purchase.</seg>
<seg id="12"> But the auction tightened only few bidders and none wanted the $2 billion demanded by the creditors to pay.</seg>

<seg id="5"> The ethics committee of the senate could impose however still another Disziplarstrafe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to statement of Ensigns lawyers they were informed by the Ministry of Justice about the fact that the investigations were stopped against senator Ensign and that in this affair no further accusations to be present.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The Ministry of Justice did not want to express itself to the case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The judgement was for many ethics lawyers outside of the Ministry of Justice a surprise. According to their opinion there were sufficient proofs for the fact that Ensign ignored the Lobbying prohibition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Interviews, emails and other documents, which were openly put for the first time in October 2009 in New York Times, gave cause to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, its Wahlhelfer, help one to lucrative orders, in order to buy its silence over an affair with Hamptons wife Cynthia.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Cynthia Hampton was active during an election campaign Ensigns as Schatzmeisterin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Ensign took up contact to some political friends, in order to provide Hampton work. According to the documents and Verhören he took over Hamptons lobbying as soon as the adjustment has been completed for her.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Since Hampton was recently still in Ensigns choice team, was it was allowed he one year long no lobbying for its former employer or the entire senate to take over.</seg>
<seg id="13"> According to statement of ethics experts the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, which were closely friendly before the affair, offended against the prohibition so called of the Drehtür Lobbykratie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> In accordance with the published indications " it concerns to all appearances around an arrangement and the offence against the Drehtür Statuten" , so Stanley fire, Washington a lawyer, who specialized in the defense of clients, in the visor of the government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> While the Ministry of Justice rejected it officially, admits the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case to give, Mr said. Very carefully the accusation seems to let fire and other ethics lawyers, the Ministry fall against the former senator Ted of Stevens because of failure on the part of the public prosecutor in taking up political accusations after a multiplicity of defeats, which were pursued by the media with large interest, including the decision last year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> State lawyers " are obviously schreckhaft" , said Melanie Sloan, which " chairmen of the combination; Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization, a whose goal is the fight against corruption in parliament and government circles of the USA), a group of attorneys, the different accusations against Mr. Ensign before court brought.</seg>
<seg id="17"> " That means in principle the fact that high-standing government officials can assume now the laws for it does not gelten" , it added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Paul Coggins, Hauptverteidiger von Mr. Ensign, said in an interview, he had received a telephone call of a state lawyer on Monday and a further on the next day, in which it was communicated to him that the Ministry will not raise complaints against its client.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with the state lawyers, in order to convince it of the fact that the senator, as its office in an explanation repeated again on Wednesday " in agreement with the law gehandelt" has.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr. Coggins rejected it, the legal arguments, which he had stated opposite the state lawyers to explain more exactly.</seg>
<seg id="21"> " Me not probably is about to go into the discussion details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only as much is said: We believe, the correct decision meet too haben" , it said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Last month the federal electoral committee decided to stop the investigations because of a separate complaint by the group of ethics after the one payment of $96,000 of Mr. Ensigns parents to the Hamptons offended against the Federal electoral law.</seg>
<seg id="23"> The electoral committee said, it had not given enough proofs that the money was something else as a gift.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which supported long time the senator, was one of the companies, in those Mr. Hampton owing to the assistance of Mr. Ensign Lobbyisten work found.</seg>
<seg id="25"> An email from December 2008 proves that, after the company Mr. Hampton as lobbyist helped, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a conversation with Mr. Hampton had, in which he communicated to him that he " at the ministry of the Interior because of a thing; anklopfe."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Mr. In addition Ensign was with Mr. The transport minister, a meeting in the name of the airline arranges and asked Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant air, to the lunch to agree upon, after this Mr. Hampton for lobbying had adjusted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> When last year for the first time information about this affair penetrated to the public, apologize Mr. Ensign with its voters and gave its position up in the senate, where he had confessed in the order of rank of the republicans in fourth place.</seg>
<seg id="28"> After it had been noticeable many months no longer, Mr told. Ensign two weeks ago ago reporters, which it a third term of office in the senate aim at.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> In the announcement that Mr. Ensign any longer longer the goal of police investigations its, did not explain its press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, the senator hopes that the ethics commission follows very fast the example of the Ministry of Justice and stops its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="30"> " Senator Ensign looks forward to it, its hard work in the service of humans in Nevada fortzusetzen" , it said.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Cheshire appointment makes attentive on Twitter</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A half dozen of them typed themselves in the riots in the court room away.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In the minutes pulse they sent their reports away over Twitter over grausige testimonies.</seg>
<seg id="4"> At the end, so the defense, gave it more to than 140,000 Twitter messages over the process around rape and at beds chained children in a house, which went up in flames.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Thursday the attentively pursued process of Steven J. Hayes, who were accused, three members a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to have killed an official end to find, if the court decision falls over the death sentence, which expressed the jury.</seg>
<seg id="6"> But Mr. Hayes of lawyers already submitted requests with court, which will employ reasons for an appointment to state and those the courts on years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> One of the most provoking reasons is that it " by the intensive reporting over the process - also by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - to one; Zirkusatmosphäre" and a so wide-spread, immediate penetration of aufrührerischer details came, so that the jury was affected excessively by public indignation.</seg>
<seg id="8"> This objection could arrange the Appelationsgerichte to concern itself with the question whether the new technologies new rules in the court room become necessary to let.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> " As I experienced it during this process, believe I that it is really a danger, if the introduction of the new technologies beeinflusst" into the court room the right of each particular to a fair process; , Thomas's J. Ullman, Mr said. Hayes leading defence counsel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The chairman Richter, Jon C. Blue of the highest Court of Appeal, rejected past week the requests by decision briefly and concisely, when he said that the new media " carefully kontrolliert" it would become and that there would be no proof for it that the jury had been driven by passions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But that was with security not yet the last word in this thing.</seg>
<seg id="12"> For decades court objections stated that the reporting lets arise over famous-notorious cases doubts to the Fairness of a process.</seg>
<seg id="13"> In its historical decision of 1966 the highest Court of Justice of the United States waived and said the judgement against Dr. Sam Sheppard, east eop Athens from smart country, which is to have killed its wife, in its decision that it " because of the new media one; Karnevalsatmosphäre in the Gerichtssaal" would have given.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Some one believes that the TV serial and the feature " On the Flucht" on this crime is based.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some attorneys say, court objections, which Mr. Hayes condemnation a half century later regard, could the argument follow that new rules became necessary, in order the communication ways from the court room, which at present the case Dr. Sheppard were still inconceivable, to regulate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> " There is a good reason, concerned about the influence of the new media during processes, which are pursued by a broad public, too sein" , said John J. Donohue III, professor to the Stanford Law School, which examined the death penalty in Connecticut. According to its report it is arbitrarily imposed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor Donohue said, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of immediate communication from the court room could make the processes fairer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Twitter affair is only one of many, those the attorneys of Mr. Hayes state, in order to discuss and thus a condemnation out-hesitate on years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defenders state for example also that Mr. Hayes to have been already before-condemned could, when judge had not permitted them Blue to test the reactions of potential Juroren by showing them during the Jurorenauswahl grausige scene photos.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Some the Juroren, photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke Petit, 48 years, and its Tüchter, Hayley, said 17 years and Michaela, 11 years, would have fulfilled them with abhorrence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defenders say, them also the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution in question would place, and to argue that the judge falsely exchanged a Juror, who was a critic of the public prosecutor's office, and that he would have expenditure-practiced inadmissible way pressure on the judgement, when he had made the uncommon decision to place the jury over the weekend freely.</seg>
<seg id="22"> The Juroren were not insulating.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Perhaps but the largest interest draws its arguments over the influence of the detailed reporting over the process on itself.</seg>
<seg id="24"> In a contest of judgement, which they submitted past month, they stated that the case had dominated the message in Connecticut and during election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American senate by the candidates was discussed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They argued that the new media would again have kindled continuously the flames of the emotions over the case.</seg>
<seg id="26"> " Such a daily crush of the medium bleepers, cameras and reporters outside of the Gerichtssaals" , the attorneys wrote, " one did not erlebt." before still in new Haven and perhaps even country-wide yet;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Their emphasis on the reporting by Twitter is controversial.</seg>
<seg id="28"> In interviews some journalists said that the statement, this direct messages were aufwieglerischer as reports, which are more slowly refunded a technology-hostile view were, which becomes impoverished the reporting over future processes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> But some attorneys said, Appelationsgerichte with the argument were confronted, social and technical changes would often require the adaptation by the courts.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr. Hayers of attorneys strengthen this statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In their objection they referred to the decision highest Court of Justice of 1966, in that the condemnation by Dr. Sheppard due to the reporting waived themselves and made clear that the new media require new rules.</seg>
<seg id="32"> " This Fall" , then they wrote, " represents Sheppard against Maxwell 21. Jahrhunderts."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Can politeness connect the separation?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> After a campaign at insult words and Negativität this week broke little politeness off in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Is it omen of a genuine two-party co-operation or one moment of the illusion, before one returns fast again to the fight of the parties in the capital?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The meeting on Tuesday between president Obama and points of the congress did not bring a break-through in the large questions, with which one " oneself during the so-called; lame duck session" , the meeting at the end of one government period, in which no more decisions are made, to employ had.</seg>
<seg id="5"> After all what one hears, it was to be governed neither a polite discussion between two different sides still another attention of their divided responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a party point collecting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meeting of the deficit commission of the president on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences, which exist between the members further.</seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems to be clearly that a close interaction lets a mutual respect develop during one period of months, that the ideological gap, which separates further the members, masked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> That is hardly enough, in order to state, it is started a new era of co-operation.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Both sides are now in a test phase - in that the one of the other indication of the cooperative and compromise readiness calls in, while one tries to weigh the borders of the public opinion and the patience of the voters after renewed party warfare.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Therefore the meeting limited on Tuesday and its estimate were by the participants to a minimum of demands or accusations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the republicans are too large and too deep, that one could expect a fast change of the atmosphere, which predominated in the past two years.</seg>
<seg id="12"> All the same whether it concerns taxes, donations, health or claims, which are both sides kilometres away from each other far away.</seg>
<seg id="13"> To good the latter the November choice Washington was correct at least for short time mild.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> " No question, which intonation has itself geändert" , said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, which now for " Ethics and Public Policy Center" works.</seg>
<seg id="15"> " That is inevitable after elections.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Elections arouse party passions, which die again.</seg>
<seg id="17"> And that is well so."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In some questions, particularly in those, which " on the agenda; lame duck session" stand, republicans and democrats hardly another choice, than a solution too finden."</seg>
<seg id="19"> Bush's reductions of taxes end of the yearly ends, and nobody endorses that.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way, over some or all too receive, are it now passing or permanent.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Likewise a compromise is to be expected concerning the increased unemployment pay, even if only, because the republicans it cannot afford that one believes, the favored reductions of taxes for realms, while they refuse unemployed person workers a support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting on Tuesday in the white house the optimism rose that one " oneself in these questions during; lame duck session" to unite and at the same time also the new START contract to ratify can.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But William glass clay/tone of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful co-operation in urgent questions the lame duck session" not compellingly to a permanent co-operation of the parties to lead must, if new 112. Congress is called up in January.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead, then he says, is a phase of the Nichtübereinstimmens more probably perhaps even inevitable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> " After the things, which must be done, are done, this short term psychology in confrontation is umschlagen" , it said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Wehner is also sceptical - and this skepticism is divided by many - which leads politeness to true co-operation.</seg>
<seg id="27"> " I see much that happens from today on until 2012, as Vorkampf, or shade boxes, for the main event of 2012" , it said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons for this have to do much with the presentation of the new republican majority in the white house and with the tea party voters, who were helpful to their education.</seg>
<seg id="29"> How it procures the republican leaders over the fact also be may to keep that it too highly pokern, it to know that they must try, their promises, to lower the expenditures of the government and to set the health reform repealed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> These party lines become already clear in the first reactions concerning the recommendations of the deficit commission, which a tax revision and the raising of some taxes as well as the rise of the pensionable age and lowering the public expenditures contain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The deputy chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles transferred one of the most difficult jobs to Washington and to have to set pushed in accordance with their own estimate, so much on it, the deficit question on the public agenda that these no more cannot be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need within the commission 14 of the 18 voices, in order to make their plan regarding official recommendation and them fight much, in order to come also only into the proximity of this number.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The largest resistance is in the selected representatives of the committee, since in financial questions, at least today, only little clearance or little sympathy for compromises is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Galston forecasts two phases in the fight between the white house and the republicans in the congress.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The first fight will take place next year in the form of party collisions, if the republicans Obama regarding the national budget, which provokes taxes and the health system, later then followed of a phase of larger two-party co-operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will lead to this change?</seg>
<seg id="37"> The public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="38"> It is proven that, despite the partyness of the current choice, which wishes itself majority of the Americans still that the two parties work together.</seg>
<seg id="39"> If confrontation leads into a dead end, how it happened 1995, then both parties must pay attention carefully to the public reaction.</seg>
<seg id="40"> Whoever is condemned to losing, the course will change and the compromise to look for will have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> That may be indeed an optimistic aspect.</seg>
<seg id="42"> Partyness and polarization are today larger than in the center of the 1990er years, and they seem to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and the congress republicans than at that time between president Bill Clinton and the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="43"> The activists of both parties sees 2010 simultaneous as pure plays for a choice by far more extensive at consequence 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> So seen the politeness, which is carried this week to the exhibition, may be welcomed by many Americans.</seg>
<seg id="45"> But it will require more trouble very much on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions which separate the two still.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Control of the city lies in the hands " Kleptokratie" and it passes a part on of the bribes and the protection money, which in-collect it, to the Kremlin. Thus the American message in Russia in a note reported in February.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Both police and the public security service extort high protection funds, so that they can hold their expensive standard of living in Moscow, then are called it.</seg>
<seg id="4"> They do not only collect money from legitimized business, but also of organized criminal gangs.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Each layer of the bureaucracy - which " prime minister Vladimir Putin as; The vertical Autorität" designated - takes itself his part of the money, which the ladder walks upward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The note, which was sent under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle to Washington, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on its homepage.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The note is based on sources, whose name was drawn up.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It was written, while Yuri Luzhkov still Moscow mayor was, and it accuses him of of the corruption.</seg>
<seg id="9"> It was fired in October von Präsident Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly a proof for the fact that one would have in the meantime cleared up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Luzhkov and its wife, Yelena Baturina, which possesses a well-known building firm, rejected corruption reproaches again and again over years, and it won numerous libel actions against such accusations.</seg>
<seg id="11"> In September he explained those to a Russian television station, when he was asked for a documentation, suggested, he was corrupt: " It is moved, it is dirty, it is schmutzig."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> > It believes an unbelievably large number at Russians that their society is corrupt. Inquiries resulted in that.</seg>
<seg id="13"> But it is unusual the fact that, as in the report of the Ambassador happens individual persons are called, and it is unheard that this is done via a diplomat of a foreign country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> " The direct connection of the government of Moscow with the crime led to the fact that some " it as; gestört" it designates and at the conclusion comes that the government acts rather like a Kleptokrat as a Regierung" , so the note.</seg>
<seg id="15"> " Criminal elements enjoy one " kryshna" (a term from the world of the criminal ones/the mafia, which " word by word; Dach" or protection means itself), that over the police, the public security (FSB), which service supervisory authority (MVD) extends and the office of the public prosecutor likewise as by the entire Muscovites government bureaucracy.</seg>

<seg id="20"> " This is an incompetent system, in which criminal groups within some ranges close a gap, because the city any assistance does not anbietet."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The report continues to say that the FSB money of the largest companies taken the money and that arrests the police small businessmen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> A source, then is called is " explained that Moscow business owner understand that it to best is, who protection from the MVD and FSB to get (and not of the organized crime), since it more weapons, resources and power do not only have than the criminal ones, but also because it by the law protected werden."</seg>
<seg id="23"> " For this reason the protection through criminal of course is no longer in demand as as früher."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The note notices that, while collecting of the funds is comprehensive the protection does not grant much its; even those, which pay, are sometimes arrested.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Those, which do not pay, appear their business very fast closed pre due to or other pretext.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Medvedev spoke several times to fight the corruption however at the same time marked that he made only few progress.</seg>
<seg id="27"> The note of the message contains of descriptions of men, who go also with suit-cases, which were probably full with money, into the Kremlin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> " In its fight against the corruption Medvedev must itself on the bureaucrats verlassen" , Georgy Satarov, director said of as, Muscovites an expert commission, recently in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="29"> " But it is part of these Bürokratie."</seg>
<seg id="30"> " It is not a part of the political class, because a political class in Russia no more does not existiert."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of the Gewalten, then he says, is corruption inevitably.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Country-wide, then estimates as, costs the corruption Russia more than $ 300 billion per year.</seg>
<seg id="33"> The country ranks at place 154 of a newer investigation for the global perception of the corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparence international (countries of are " to few korrupt" too " at most korrupt" specified).</seg>

<seg id="5"> Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule admits as " the Schlachter" , the commander remains popular in these remote former Khmer Rouge center in the northwest Kambodschas, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers to still live.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge in relation to the government, supporters of many years in Anlong Veng are provoked.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In April local truth and reconciliation forum permitted the public confrontation with humans, who supported once the regime to the victims.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In June the government distributed a school book, which tells for the first time the history of the Khmer Rouge to children of former soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And in July a community tribunal of the UN and Kambodschas condemned a former member of the Khmer Rouge, when it admits the former boss of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better than Duch, to 35 years prison for the first time condemned.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Belarus agrees to accumulate not far uranium capable of bearing arms</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a surprising victory for president Obamas campaign for the world-wide protection of nuclear material announced the government of Belarus on Wednesday that one will not collect any longer longer highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> That deal was announced to the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Byelorussian minister of foreign affairs Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the safety summit in a common statement after a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The US Government had for many years tried to convince Belarus to collect highly uranium any longer not enriched and seemed last spring a hurdle to have achieved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But official ones of the US Government told Washington Post that in the past two months two secret treaties were met with Belarus, in order to remove for 187 Pound uranium capable of bearing arms from a Byelorussian research institute.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the remainder of the material - according to an official coworker, who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, approximately 500 Pound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The agreement seems one of the most important results of Obamas " Nuclear safety summit of the 47 Nationen" from April to be, the Belarus had excluded.</seg>
<seg id="8"> And it was obviously well enough, in order to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> " I was really enthusiastic by the fact that she wollen." a seat in the nuclear safety summit (of 2012);</seg>
<seg id="10"> " That proves to me that it funktioniert" , Ken Luongo, president of the partnership of global security said, a group to the promotion of nuclear security.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Clinton called the agreement " a very much meaning, important Schritt" of Belarus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure within four years all precarious nuclear material.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Since then the US Government helped six countries to become loose their highly enriched uranium.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Belarus will be the seventh.</seg>
<seg id="15"> A dozen of countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At present of Obamas the Byelorussian president explained Alexander Lukashenko to nuclear safety summit that the nation will never give its uranium up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> " As keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of Kilos, which is fundamentally capable of bearing arms, and less enriched Uran" , Lukashenko said at that time.</seg>
<seg id="18"> " That is our raw material... We are not verkaufen" from it no dirty bombs to make and we it anybody;.</seg>
<seg id="19"> " We use it exclusively for research purposes, that are alles."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Belarus approached nevertheless few months ago the USA on, when it indicated interest in the meeting of an agreement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The first approach to remove the uranium of white Russia in October was particularly complicated, because the material was easily radioactively contaminated, says official ones.</seg>
<seg id="22"> It was shipped into a special course, more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, says official ones.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The second approach was decided on Monday and accomplished according to the official ones by airplane.</seg>
<seg id="24"> The US Government pays 14 million for these troubles $, whereby a majority of the money flows into the Byelorussian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> " This was extremely carefully coordinated and co-ordinated, around confidence aufzubauen" , which led to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the energy Ministry, which works on the global danger reduction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The James Martin center for Nichtweiterzugebende studies estimates that as well as Belarus had at least 88 Pound of waffenfähhigen uranium in this year hundreds of Pound at highly enriched uranium.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Belarus wants to dissolve its camp to 2012 according to the common agreement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The relations between Belarus and the USA was tensely for many years, primarily because of Lukashenkos harsh ignoring of the human rights.</seg>
<seg id="29"> But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approach.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> " Welcome being called the progress of these global security questions, the United States announce from America and Belarus that a increased respect for the democracy and the human rights in Belarus remains a central topic in the improvement of the bilateral relations and it is essentially for the progress of the country and its Bürger" , it explains.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Partido Popular won 4 seats in the congress to it and PSC lost 9</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> With the results from 28 November the PP in the cities Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona could play a crucial role</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> After the important mood and delegate increase with the last regional elections the PP directs its view already toward the parliamentary elections - preferred or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes, which obtains this party with these elections, is normally twice as high as with the elections in Catalonia.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Thus the Catalan people's party received 610,473 voices with the parliamentary elections from 2008, while this number amounted to with the regional elections in the year 2006 only 316,222.</seg>
<seg id="5"> On last Sunday the PPC obtained 384,091 voices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> If this ascending tendency - result of the bypass of the voice portion of the PSC and the connection of the constituency of the PP - should continue, the analysts of the PP that with the parliamentary elections the PPC of 8 to 12 congressional representatives could ascend, prognosticate four (it now 10) have to it-win and the PSC at least 9 delegates (of 25) during also CiU would lose.</seg>
<seg id="7"> These computations occupy the fundamental meaning of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In accordance with the analysis of the people's party the ERC would lose a delegate - at present it has three -, while ICV or to it-win one could hold its delegate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> If the choice calendar should be maintained however, the next date with the Gemeindewahlen falls into May 2011. Also then the people's party (PP) can be the tongue at the balance, in order to prepare for the socialist supremacy an end, in four province capitals and with its majority in the town councillor Barcelonas, one of the city administrations with the largest household: 661 million euros for 2011.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Both nationalist and people's party agrees will lose therein that the PSC the cities Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the socialists obtain neither a majority nor to its traditional allied ones (ERC and ICV) fall back can.</seg>
<seg id="11"> After republican debacle is it not wrong that this party their agency in the local council of Barcelona, in which it would have to obtain 5% of the voices will lose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The PP registered however an increase of its voice portion in the four province capitals and could the crucial Kraft in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona become.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the leading role in Tarragonas reversal. There they had Josep Félix Ballesteros before the present mayor, together with which PP governs.</seg>
<seg id="14"> EN Lérida is appropriate the PP for only 500 voices behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Also in other important places, as for example in Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus the people's party could register an important increase.</seg>
<seg id="16"> At present the PP is represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and aims at the formation of lists in as many places as possible.</seg>

<seg id="1"> The geriatric home affirms that the deaths not on " missing Maßnahmen" to lead back are</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The owners of the home for the elderly in Olot do not exclude that their male nurse over eleven killed older humans</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The responsible persons of the geriatric home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave yesterday a press conference, in which they put out, which damage the criminal actions Joan Vila Dilmés - which male nurse, who had killed during its work at least eleven old humans, for whom it was responsible, - had caused to the mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The director/conductor of the geriatric home, Joan Sala, arose in company of its attorney, Joan Cañada, before court and announced, " La Caritat would like the responsible person (for the deaths) anklagen" , but " the right and our adhesion obligation force us to it the process and the civil Haftung" to assume.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The mechanism must accept not only a social reputation loss, because it had not in time determined the criminal actions of the male nurse, but also a high amount of damages to pay now, which is computed by the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime decreases/goes back on August 2009 and that it gemordet since then.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The judge arranged the Exhumierung of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric home -, since he assumed that no physician had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities were completed by telephone due to their age and diseases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The leader of La Caritat answered this point in the negative round away and explained that " being missing measures no time the reason for the incidents been its könnten."</seg>
<seg id="9"> The attorney von La Caritat added that it " in the law case no indications for negligent actions of another person than the accused one of gäbe."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> That already as " Todesengel" Baptized one confessed the day before yesterday eleven murders and explained, the first crime on 29 August 2009 to have committed and one and a half months later the second old lady to have murdered.</seg>
<seg id="11"> In this case it killed insulin, in contrast to the first crime, with an overdose with which it had given a mixture from different tranquilizers.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The leader of La Caritat explained, the entrance of the personnel to the medicines was only difficult to control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The insulin syringes and tranquilizer cocktail used the male nurse with six of nine committed crimes, in order to free the patients with death from their suffering to.</seg>
<seg id="14"> But the results of the laboratory tests will put out whether Vila lies and actually selected for its first victims a less cruel death or whether it burned these out from the inside, by giving bleaching caustic solution to them, as he had done it according to confession with three women, it between that the 12. and 17 October murdered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> In La Caritat one does not give faith to the statements of the male nurse, not even which concerns the number of stood murders, which could quite be more. This attitude is justified with the fact that Vila had made very different statements before court and that it does not make a sense to suddenly change its approach after eight successful murders.</seg>
<seg id="16"> They say, them placed themselves them for this reason and to the clearing-up of the range of these incidents of the law to the order.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Threatening gestures of the European central bank (EZB) </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The investors reacted yesterday sharply to the threat of the EZB president Trichet, which warned, " the markets should not our reactivity unterschätzen."</seg>
<seg id="3"> The risk impacts of the euro Peripheriländer rose dramatically and the shares of the European banks around more than 5%.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Nevertheless we should the possibility that the EZB can be mistaken and the euro hardly did not add at points, which arranges to the concern to underestimate.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Events of yesterday are typical for illiquiden market, which in the measure, in which it breaks down itself again recovered, however due to the locking of short and highly speculative positions.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The institutional investor will still for a long time not lose his fear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Today one month ago the European central bank requested us to cancel our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen according to which the EZB must tomorrow make some marks in the future, a backdown for the fourth time in two years, and probably still.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The Federal Bank demanded the termination of the plan to the purchase of national debt, since these were ineffective, as well as the abolition of all unusual limited liquidity measures. Only an one-week unlimited access is to be maintained.</seg>
<seg id="9"> After the Ireland crisis we expect that the present liquidity measures " at least to März" to be extended and the quarterly advertisements with unlimited access at the quarter end for the guarantee of the liquidity to at least June be maintained.</seg>
<seg id="10"> We expect likewise that the program for the purchase of obligations will spend continued and a strengthening signal.</seg>
<seg id="11"> If creative expectations are not fulfilled, the excellent reaction of the markets from yesterday again are thrown back and if halstarrig in one persists to take back which we our liquidity measures, only God can help us!</seg>
<seg id="12"> Not to consider just as with the EZB meeting in May, with which the bank affirmed, the purchase of state debt papers and the markets thereupon broke down, could themselves this history tomorrow repeat.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The EZB must be reliable and persistent.</seg>
<seg id="14"> In May it showed the teeth and on Wednesday said it already much to have bought with which it provoked a new collapse of the market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Yesterday the auction of one year's state titles was rather weak in Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The national administration of an estate spent only 500 million to 5.28%, opposite 750 million to 4.81% in the preceding auction.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Nevertheless the interest rates fell in Portugal around 30 base points in the entire curve and reflected thereby a perception change of the markets after the words Trichets.</seg>
<seg id="18"> In Ireland the numbers of the debt hole of Allied and bank OF Irish country were published.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The sum becomes on approximately 10,000 million at short notice and possible further 15,000 estimated. There is time until February, around private capital to constituted or these banks is nationalisation.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Although Ireland lost its reliability completely, after it had not recognized the problem with the stress tests in July, the numbers are acceptable in the context of the rescue plan and to help to reduce the uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="21"> However the government must receive the parliamentary agreement on coming Tuesday to its new budget. Since it does not have yet the sufficient support, Ireland is also further source of the uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Angela Merkel arranged her discourse more moderate regarding the summit of the heads of state and the government on 14 December. There political unit is in demand, in order to show that we play the same score together.</seg>
<seg id="23"> The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries the ninth symphony Beethovens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The Spanish head of the provincial government presented yesterday the measure plan, which was to be adopted on Friday by the Council of Ministers.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions as with the financial establishments, dismantling of the state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and work-providing measures. Measures, which sound in the ears of the investors such as Vivaldis four seasons.</seg>
<seg id="26"> The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains, why the Spanish stock exchange added by 4,5 per cent, twice as much like the remainder of the European stock exchanges.</seg>
<seg id="27"> In the comparison to February the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincingly, and we profit from the surprise effect.</seg>
<seg id="28"> Today there is a relevant auction of a three-year government loan, which will draw use from the Trichet effect. Therefore we set on a strong demand, which will eliminate all doubts about our conversion of debts ability.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> For Spain requesting an auxiliary plan would be a self sacrifice.</seg>
<seg id="30"> We would receive liquidity, which we do not need. The Treasury has available 40 billion euros, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and the entrance to the markets were without notice closed.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Nevertheless our strategy should correspond to the slogan Cäsars woman: " Now counts not only its, but also the Schein."</seg>
<seg id="32"> Only we create courage, that!</seg>

<seg id="1"> Red Bull triumphs in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The cars are improved with a software in real time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Since Red Bull penetrated 2004 into the world of the formula 1, its history is coined/shaped in this erlesenen universe of the speed of surprises and successes.</seg>
<seg id="4"> At first nobody gave attention to the beginner and despite its steeply ascending course during the last seasons set with the final spurt in last November all on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Without wanting to lower the abilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the achievement strength of the engine of Renault, is " Geheimwaffe" , which the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into the hands, and thus created a winner team, nascently the legend.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In reality a high performance acts software to simulation of processes around, which the German brought enterprise to 2007 to purposes, which do not have to do with motorraces, on the market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This as PLM designated computer science program for the development of assembly chains in factories on the whole world, energy works and highly precise instruments was used.</seg>
<seg id="8"> A faithful reproduction and/or simulation of a product or a process is aimed at, before this is actually built, in order to avoid errors and redundant costs in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="9"> PLM has the development of the cameras of Canon, which facilitates airplanes of Sukhoi and the most famous commercial motor vehicles of Nissan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Siegfried soot worm, director/conductor of the industrial department of Siemens, explains that with the employment of this software in the formula 1 - factory Red Bull " in few hours, nearly in Echtzeit" the changes and improvements, which are determined on running and with the tests, sketch and would drive out can.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Soot worm implements that 1992 in the running stables on the average ten technicians worked, who would bring at the most three or four improvements in one season could.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In of Red Bull team today 180 highly-qualified young people are busy. With high performance EDP systems they would drive through analyses and all possible changes at the racing cars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The Siemens manager explained, the PLM software was able to analyze and improve all components of the racing cars from Red Bull to, with exception of the engine, for which excluding Renault responsible explains itself.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The materials, the fuel, which become aerodynamics and the safety members changed.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The changes can be transferred owing to progressive production plants and Hightech autoclaves within less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of the simulator into the reality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The only border, which is set to this moved technical perfectionism, are the 40 million dollar, which formula a 1 - team on its races in one season to spend may.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Red Bull developed its Hightech factory for the development and the production of its racing cars in 50 kilometers a place removed from London.</seg>
<seg id="18"> This concerns two buildings, in which visits - particularly of journalists - are strongly limited.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Everything that happens there, is Top Secret.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The staff covers 580 persons, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark of Webber.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But of Red Bull of true formula 1 - hero is doubtless the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Behind enormous technological resources, which the Energy drink manufacturer places into the services of his participation on the racing courses, hide themselves further protagonists, whose support is inestimably and their fame equal to zero.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The Technologichef of the work, Steve Nevey, stresses that one could still say before five years that the progress within the range F& E for racing cars with 50 per cent to the victory contributed and the pilots were responsible for the remainder.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Today the portion values changed. The technology constitutes 85 per cent of success, while the contribution of the pilots on 15 per cent becomes estimated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Nevey recognizes on that Vettel and Webber can be never replaced by EDP, because them " is not predictable Gladiatoren."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Sabadell wants its rival in three years millions customer ' klauen'</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The acting member of the board of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, rejects first however a new liquidity crisis and prophesies the end of the debt war.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Nevertheless he foresees a break-down of the interest margins, which the banks try to adjust with increases of the fees and the prices for loans.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Sabadell expects to catch in three years millions private customers - a subject still which can be existed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Sabadell found the way to exhaust the coming three years to survive and so in a very much complicated economic surrounding field.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The bank becomes 2011 a new three-yearly guidance plan would bring in.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The goal reads not only to survive, without taking the public assistance up from the FROB for increasing but beyond that the market share around millions private customer - will lose 700,000, if one withdraws the customers, the bank -. That is the large challenge, before which this bank stands, because up to now it to its clients more attention dedicated than their private customer.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In this year it has 250,000 private customers and 50,000 enterprises in addition-gets.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Their market share at private customers is with 3,5 per cent, while the clients constitute more than 10 per cent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> A further principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase of the productivity, speaks Austerität, cost reduction. She will present the challenges, which the bank thereby faces, together with end-of-year procedure report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Only few banks dare to specify and publish it in these difficult times of goals, since by the financial crisis world-wide all plans of the banks are in disorder guessed/advised.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Sabadell will lock their before four years specified guidance plan optima in this year. This was initially appropriate for three years, but due to the market situation he was extended by one financial year.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The customers, who will leave the savings banks, are the principal purpose of the bank.</seg>
<seg id="14"> With one of the APIE stressed Guardiola organized breakfast, 2011 was " schwieriges" Year " with large Reichweite."</seg>
<seg id="15"> The manager assumes that, Spain would come only " langsam" from the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="16"> In addition it would be " much schwierig" , in two or three years " Work too schaffen" - fundamentally for surviving the banks.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Even if it assumes the war around liabilities - which punishes the interest-rate margins - will abate, the risk impacts, which must pay banks and savings banks for their emissions to the receipt of liquidity, become, as reconciliation for shrinking profit margins already shifted upon the price for credits.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> " The topics liquidity and financing are structural kind and them pressure on the credits are ausüben."</seg>
<seg id="19"> " We did not turn the cock off, but the Zinsdifferenziale is very much hoch" , Guardiola admitted.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Banesto spent the arrangement on Thursday already to its branch network to limit the assignment of long-term loans and increase the Zinsdifferenziale (see Cinco Días of 22. and 27 November).</seg>
<seg id="21"> The manager confessed likewise, the banks pursued momentarily the Stategie, " the fees too erhöhen" , however " within a framework coined/shaped by the competition ."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Sabadells guidance plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as does not exclude always, korporative business.</seg>
<seg id="23"> It insures not in vain that in Spain " larger enterprises necessarily sind."</seg>
<seg id="24"> " In the coming year everything verändern" itself; , it insures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> It stresses that the need of capital " at present; enormously steigt" and it does not exclude that some Spanish financial establishments will slip into red numbers.</seg>
<seg id="26"> It is the opinion, the FROB can with Kaptitalaufstockungen the money market replace.</seg>
<seg id="27"> After it insures that Sabadell can survive also a temporary locking of the markets, he weakens the argument of some bankers, which already prophesy a new liquidity crisis.</seg>
<seg id="28"> It stressed, one cannot bring anything in circulation, but in contrast to the incidents in June, one can obtain short term financing over Repogeschäfte and intercept thus the crisis.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> " I believe that the largest part of the fusions is final. The inclusion of Cajasol into the group of Banca Cívica cannot be regarded as the second round, it acted rather around Anpassungen."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="8"> " The transition from 45 savings banks with on the average 28,000 million financial status to 17 with 75,500 million each is a historically incomparable process.

<p>
<seg id="9"> Olavarrieta explained, " there would be a number of unabgebrachter opinions over the tardiness of the process, the lack of seriousness and Unsinnigkeit" revealed, because " Banco de España admonishes us, within the prescribed period before end of the year abzuschließen."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="10"> The general manager of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, insured yesterday that Spain one of the most radical financing systems of Europe " and; vielleicht" the whole world it has and supplemented that those, which anzweifeltenn this " without deeper Kenntnisse" would do.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin has itself for maintains the euro decided, but at the same time for the entire European union set up conditions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tensions on the markets released a double answer of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero submitted, begun new measures of adaption with tax reductions for small and Kleinstunternehmen, the adjustment of time work enterprises or the abolition of the 426 euros support for unemployed persons, who do not refer an unemployment pay, up to the privatisation of 49 per cent of CHANGES, to the administration of the airports Barajas and El Prat as well as 30 per cent of the national lottery.</seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former head of the provincial government Felipe González the criticism at the chancellor Angela Merkel than responsible person, supports who out-swore to the present crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How are these procedures to be understood?</seg>
<seg id="7"> , The Merkels position an error of their public work is not anticipated is.</seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, this concerns a new round during the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective for the organization of our future, which collides with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of a majority of its partners.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In view of the resistances in Europe one begins in Germany over three possible ways out of the crisis too spekuliern.</seg>
<seg id="11"> First: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Second: The re-establishment of the German Marks - although at present rather after Science the Fiction sounds -, supported from a majority of the public opinion, approx. 50 per cent of the population.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Third: A transformation of the euro in accordance with German proposals. That means: more macro-economic control; housekeeping; Punishment of the countries, which cross the defaults; the möglichereweise Zahlungseinstellung of some countries as well as the expansion of the costs of potenzieller measures of adaption on the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is clear and appears already for some time. Therefore there are no excuses now.</seg>
<seg id="15"> First 2009, when both the IWF as well as incentives for deficits created the European commission and a constitutional reform drew itself the German government from the sleeve, in order to prevent this starting from 2016.</seg>
<seg id="16"> That was the first sign for drifting apart between what considered Germany necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.</seg>
<seg id="17"> The second indication set the Central European country, when Merkel postponed the decision for the rescue of Greece painfully.</seg>
<seg id="18"> At that time that was strongly criticized. But fact is that the political consent in Germany, which was absolute public and the published opinion against a rescue of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally Merkel comes out in the last October days on the new with a clear position. It demands a reform of the agreements of the European union, in order to make the rescue possible of a country and to obligate the private money lenders at the same time to carry a part of the costs.</seg>
<seg id="20"> This position was laid out as anti-European, since it advanced the Ireland crisis and all following.</seg>
<seg id="21"> But their proposal, even if something versüßt, was accepted. In the next months we become at the reform of the European union, which is to make these measures possible starting from 2013, sharings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany drew a red line, which does not intend to exceed it.</seg>
<seg id="23"> It says all that - even if now unpopular measures must be met - it starting from this date the old function mode of the euro will not any longer give.</seg>
<seg id="24"> 2013 could be forced to explain themselves the birth year of a new currency area to be, in which the infringers of countries are hard punished, insolvent and in this case the private sector a part of the costs take over must.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows us that we must hit a hard growth course, with high saving and investment rates, moderation of the consumption, improvement of the productivity and competitive ability as well as positive externaleconomical balances.</seg>
<seg id="26"> The other alternative, which on indebtedness and building industry with enormous holes in the balance of payments is based, was stated as it by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.</seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear.</seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would do badly not to understand it.</seg>
<seg id="29"> It does not only concern to down-drive the state deficit up to the year 2013 on three per cent.</seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are many harder.</seg>
<seg id="31"> And the worst, which we could do under these conditions, is us too would amount to.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the present turbulences change into more peace.</seg>
<seg id="33"> And that we will use the possibilities, which are ordered us up to the spring 2013.</seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero understood also in such a way, and its double announcement (the promised reforms after the discussion with the large-scale enterprises on past Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) points out that despite the criticism at Merkel the hypothesis prepared to create order in the own house their way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> There but the red line drawn from Germany is, and it does not look in such a way that in it somewhat would change.</seg>
<seg id="36"> Under the considered possibilities those that we would have to leave the euro area fully plugged with little respectable countries is, to exclude not.</seg>
<seg id="37"> In this case Germany could say to us still, it had warned us.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Sport and rule evasion</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Cheat as from Alonso and Ramos in the play against the Ajax show invention spirit, but not the will to go around a sanction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Allegedly the exclusion in the play from 23 November against the Ajax in Champions League, plotted by two players Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos), led to the fact that much ink was poured over whether it did not concern a unsportliche action or and whether both players should be possibly sanctioned of the UEFA.</seg>
<seg id="4"> As is common knowledge, lost the two players are a few minutes before playing (their team had already clearly won) time and played several Fouls, so that the arbitrator them showed the second yellow map.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way, and Real Madrid, would become the two players the prescribed sanction would start his group there with the next league play against the Auxerre to fulfill and without maps into the next play phase enter in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Finally the Disziplinarkommitee of the UEFA punished the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two plays and the players involved with different money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow map under such or similar circumstances is not new practice, it is rather frequently in the world of the football to be found.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It is so far common the fact that it part of the Ethos - which unwritten obeyed, but in this kind of sport rules - is.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Part the arisen debate about the represented case it decreases/goes back to the fact that a team of the football club Real Madrid (in its hymn the noble courage and honour give and at other opportunities its players for similar incidents had punished) played thereby the leading role, and on the Dramatisierung by Mourinho, which to his long history than theatrical and provoking technician added an episode more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case the debate about it, whether this contradicts the principles of the sport not expressly from the statutes forbidden behavior, turns i.e. whether these actions represent a rule evasion. This approach adheres actual to the statutes of the sport, seem to go around however its sense.</seg>
<seg id="11"> With this affair that should the sport spirit caused damage to be examined.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The sport spirit defends the physical soundness of the opponents, an aspect, which was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive play.</seg>
<seg id="13"> A further aspect of a clean play consists avoiding of the fact that the infringers players draw an unjustified use from the Gegenteam. Also did not happen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Paradoxes of the action of the players Real Madrid it is that she does not correspond, which we normally understand by wrong play or rule evasion, because the evasion of the rule became not secretly carried out, in order to avoid a sanction, but it should as possible be as remarkable, so that it is punished of the arbitrator.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The players were waiting and accepted the sanction joyfully.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is, which kind of advantage the infringers drew from the intentional Fouls.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Here it should be emphasized that the rival was brought neither into a more unfavorable layer still advantages for the played play was erheischt, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team with fewer players had to further-play.</seg>
<seg id="18"> It is also no useful strategy for the next play, because the club does not have then these players.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The advantage consists obviously of the fact that the players begin the next play phase Champions League without maps, which its participation in a future play could threaten.</seg>
<seg id="20"> But this concerns a long-term advantage uncertain up to a certain degree, since the team could also be ruled out sometime. In addition the players with this approach receive a sanction and change into the second map cycle, in which they are ruled out because of map accumulation with a map less than in the first cycle.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Thus it is not so clear whether it really concerns an advantage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Finally such approaches are not directed against the sport spirit, to which also strategic decisions belong, in order to draw from the regulations a greatest possible use.</seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case the players a sanction did not want to go around (that would actually be a clear case of rule evasion), it wanted rather to select, when they undergo of these.</seg>
<seg id="24"> They made a strategic decision, without evading to a punishment or flee before it.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Although the border between ingenuity and rule environment is smeared, I believe that it acts with this affair around a clear case of ingenuity.</seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the polemic developed due to two factors: Because it around two self exclusions went and because of the kind of the provoked rule transmission.</seg>
<seg id="27"> The damage, which was caused to the principles of the sport by these actions, is less more ethicalally than rather aesthetic art.</seg>

<seg id="5"> So that the bookkeeping becomes still a little more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on one Friday) let all orders fall into the week of 13 December, with the result of an avalanche of reservations of dinners at two Spitzentager (the 16. and 17.) and nearly no orders in the week before it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Since 2008, when the bad times began, have many enterprises the group dinners for household reasons adjusted.</seg>

<seg id="14"> The group of Soteras says, the demands for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The group adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> At another prominent group, Andilana, which maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and other one), has the peculiarness of the calendar to preferred reservations, even starting from at the beginning of November, led.</seg>
<seg id="16"> " We made the impossible possible, aufrechtzuerhalten" at the previous year prices with menus for each taste from 19,95 to 30 euros; , it explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> With AT Grup, which leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and altogether 23 restaurants, one does not lose the optimism, after for the second quarter the incomes flower again and to good, even if on few days concentrated prospects for the Christmas business one expects.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Sources of the entrepreneurial group emphasize that also the 18. an overactive day with groups of friends, which before-celebrate Christmas will be.</seg>
<seg id="19"> To the six group menus a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more than price hit was added. One has the impression that the customers are ready, 10 per cent more than in the previous year to spend and in response more details wish, as for example Cava.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Also in some companies one sees green rungs sprouting, why the employees are again invited. It obtains the impression that the group meals are again in the upswing.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21"> Vonseiten of the umbrella organization Fecasarm (with unions like the tavern, restaurant and leisure federation of Barcelona), trusts the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, to see on it the end of the tunnel and notices that the reservations altogether quite " lebhaft" are, although the customers " a maximum herausschlagen."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> Interpol spends a red warning for the pursuit and location of Assange.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Everything that is connected with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth, in which the facts can be cleared up only with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Yesterday Interpol gave one " red Warnung" to " Location and Verfolgung" from Assange.</seg>
<seg id="6"> However it does not act thereby around a traditional arrangement to the arrest.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In addition it is not new, it comes from 20 November.</seg>
<seg id="8"> She has to do also nothing with the last exposure of documents from the USA, diplomatic over four million, but with the accusations of sexual abuse, to which the Australian must place himself in Sweden.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Furthermore the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, insures Mark Stephens, " the police would know, where and how they take up contact with Mr. eating könne."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Already to 20. the international police authority with seat in Lyon (France) upon the request of Sweden the arrangement spent, but it was not announced to the power until yesterday after receipt by the Swedish authorities.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Thus the things lie. The 188 inter+polling-change are dependent to identify and find Assange, " over it provisionally to arrest and auszuliefern."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Although Interpol cannot arrange the arrest of an individual concerned by a red warning, many member countries regard the red warning according to statements of the organization as charter for a Arrestierung - which must be accomplished by the national police - in particular, if they have a bilateral extradition treaty, how it is the case of Sweden and England, where ate itself probably stops.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="21"> Obama has a high responsible person for the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, which prevention of new document exposures assigns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The attempt of the speaker of the Präsidenden Barack Obama to give to Assange less attention stands contrary to the opinions, which announce conservative politicians and commentators in these days.</seg>
<seg id="23"> The congressional representative Peter King, who will lead the presidency in the national Sicherheitskommitee of the Lower House starting from January, requested the state department to examine the possibility Wikileaks on the list of organizations of terror to set, " around their funds to seize and everyone, it supports or a contribution makes too verfolgen."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The republican leader permits a secret vote to the party over his continuing in the office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Huguet suggests a pluralistischere government and the end of the plenary assembly principle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a prescription, in order to go to the zigsten mark internal riot in the rows to the loss of 11 delegates and half of the votes directionless ERC out of the way.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The chairman of the party is conscious itself that its resignation threat the intimate one of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod Rovira is not sufficient. But it knows also that the influence of this sector is today as weakened as their Mentor and the same headache will not give to it, like other former currents.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Therefore the leader of Esquerra with a winking tries to win the new critics, which would secure its position up to the next local elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> For the beginning it announced yesterday that the councillors of ERC, regional over 200, could secretly express themselves over his remaining in the office.</seg>
<seg id="8"> With ballot papers, not with elevated hand.</seg>
<seg id="9"> If the Carodisten wanted to give a punishing note to the Präsidenen, they could do this, without having to fear Repressalien.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Actually the boss would like to avoid both the impression of splitting as well as from subjecting under his person.</seg>
<seg id="11"> In several interviews it, it affirmed to feel not confirmed with half of the voices plus one, and it added a result without indication of percentages, " in the Bulgarian Stil" would not be good also.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Carod intimate one demands more from the president, than putting only to the party its office at the disposal. An insufficient gesture, since Puigcercós controls the highest organ of the congresses.</seg>
<seg id="13"> But since they do not have a sufficient majority for forcing of resignations, they will agree upon a procedure plan from now with the executive committee to May.</seg>
<seg id="14"> But they, at the elaboration of the document over strategic reorientation expect that the line will submit to 18. the advice for vote, participate to be able.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Their intention is it to vouch for Puigcercós. In response this is to promise to before-move the congress into the autumn 2011 which already regards the party leaders as a fact.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The chairman of the party of the ERC is the view, which " Polyphonie" unfortunate stability and it aims at once and for all bringing the organization into the situation washing their dirty laundry behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="17"> In this sense the article, which the acting Conseller Josep Huguet in its blog signed, is symptomatic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In view of its, which is Puigcercós an ideologist, the owner of Innovació held it for a fact that the chairman of the party " in the exchange against different Ziele" one support.</seg>
<seg id="19"> It counted five up, from those two in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="20"> First of all, those " Umstrukturierung" the executive committee, so that this represents at least 90 per cent of the party members that is called the inclusion of new faces from Carods surrounding field.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Second could be the large piece of news.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Huguet suggests, ERC is the plenary assembly principle up as function mode to finally give.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Thus it defends a reform of the statutes, it to make possible is the congresses with selected delegated ones to hold.</seg>
<seg id="24"> From the completion of the plenary assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós' Team, which already fought on the last two congresses for it, as possessed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> On the trembling meeting of 2008 the party leadership was actually assigned the examination of the plenary assembly principle on a congress, that should be concerned with the reformation of the statutes.</seg>
<seg id="26"> This date is still pending, since the infogle internal Aufruhe of the last years was not advisable concerning this affair.</seg>

" , the authoress Luisa Valenzuela asked, those the second round of ' Loosely placeres de la lengua' to open, a cycle, that should the spanischsprachige literature celebrated and on this occasion the sub-title of its question used (on another meeting table the Sex was dedicated to the round in the language, explained it).</seg>
</p>
<p>

" brings us in Schwierigkeiten" , the Argentine spat Schriftstellein sweetly against the public, which consisted mainly of young people, who met on the international book fair in Guadalajara (FIL), in order to attend this by Marisol Shultz moderated rounds table, at whom Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Luisa Valenzuela read out a text, which she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and which Shultz marked thereafter as a great narration. Luisa told in first person and is the Protagonistin, on the search is to be experienced, what " one; Wunde" is, and from physician to physician goes, from which it receives no answer, but notes for the manual of its narration.</seg>
<seg id="6"> It leaves the Infektologen convinced: " Patience is not my strength, perhaps is that my Wunde."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In the end, after a frustrating approach to the Traumatologen, which robbed it in the middle on the course the breath, and which it however explained that wound a scientific term is not, enthült the Psychoanalytiker the secret: " the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the Narbe."</seg>
<seg id="8"> The main figure of the narration sighs relieved and closes, it " from the wound only it experienced that this was really open and does not existiere." But it is convinced that the desire at the language and their traps mix themselves.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Valenzuela, the authoress, played with both.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The Nicaraguaner Sergio Ramírez presented also a entzückende narration, which it ' Praise of the Erfindung' called, and in that the finger in the wound is not mentioned but is not discovered.</seg>
<seg id="11"> With allusions to magic realism it tells of a famous Zauberin, which returned the clouds affected, far traveled men or re-established the virtue lost by a girl. The narration made an about-face and reported of America, for the large novel, to which it was not missing from the outset at its own chroniclers, and it quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the abundance of stories told by the Eroberen.</seg>

<seg id="13"> However he emphasizes, " there is the crazy people and liars, who vorstellen" themselves the things best; , and reality and lie approach there each other on, where one does not know no more, to which side the narration belonged, where the fictitious literature reaches the summit.</seg>
<seg id="14"> It actually calls that the ' Tradition Cervantes'.</seg>
<seg id="15"> " Of him we inherited, to be which, which wird." told;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> When Mayra Montero at the row was, and praised the authoress commentated the variety of the interpretations, to those the invitation of the FIl for rounding table ' The finger in the Wunde' had contributed.</seg>
<seg id="17"> The Kubanerin and Puertorikanerin dedicated its contribution to the large wound of the social force, those their country strikes - like completely Latin America - as result of the fights for the drug trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> " I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs a tacit, deliberately not planned commitment enthalten" , it explained, after it had emphasized that literature is communication and commitment, which " themselves between the author and the readers as with one; chemical Reaktion" construct.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey with the final game face each other in addition two different styles given by their respective coaches, and of them of contrasts marked meeting reflects itself in the results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Rubén Omar Romano looks to Abs in its career on three defeats in final games back, it on and experienced, but three times he had crucial plays, and so far he kept himself good, why this opportunity of completely special importance for him is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Argentinier magnified the importance of itself with the medal to second champions, it a step behind the winners stayed and surprisingly it with the same team following each other final games delivered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The santistische strategist reached the first final game as a coach with the ' Torneo Apertura 2002' , when del Morelia had the reins in the hand, with which he experienced a large defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, with the ' Clausura 2003' reached it the crucial duel, which it lost also with 3-1 against Rayados.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Already with Santos Laguna on the ' Torneo Bicentenario 2010' , with which they played against lot Diablo, Rubén had to put again a setback in, since the play with 2-2 against lot Choriceros went out after 210 play minutes undecided, but with the eleven-meter it progressed with 3-1 and got two possibilities of putting its title in but in the long run three its player missed the eleven steps and the play turned to 4-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Rubén had lost already two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, its large rival. Therefore it would not like to be pursued again from the misfortune and free itself from the bad charm, in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although it affirms that for it the most important is the play.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> " I would like champions to become, I would like no statistics to break, which is for a club, for my affection, which I give myself, and therefore the title to me will come, but which happens before, is the Wichtigste" , the attendant commentated, when one asks him over the lost final games.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The last final game remained still strong for him in the memory, it insured, much from it to have learned: " The only teachings, which we can draw from it, are that to the arbitrators the end it does not whistle cannot we not celebrate, we at the line are preparatory, the players also, because the last mark were already preparatory we with two eleven-meters to be ruled out and I believed that teachings are not, until the play is not terminated give it a cause for the Feiern."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> To know that this series could be decided by penalty shootout, it does not worry it, because it trusts its players: " One wants to never arrive with the penalty shootout, one would like in the regular play time to lock, sometimes but there is no alternative and one must for it be preparatory, in previous tour was preparatory we, but to us the fate unfortunately prepared to sometimes regard a bad play, due to nervousness or the violent tendency, the title in the hands, left us somewhat as this final game, and we to hope that this mark to it do not come wird."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="12"> It lies in Romanso power, no longer only second champion to be and the fame cost for the first time, which the titles bring with itself.</seg>

<seg id="1"> 450 million in contracts without advertisement</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hydraulic Québec granted in mutual agreement project planning companies 450 million dollar at contracts for the water power project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In the middle in this avalanche of more than 100 contracts a consortium, consisting of the companies BPR, stands Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most important portion, i.e. that to the direction of the project, to a sum of 295 million dollar without advertisement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This consortium, mentioned " Énergie gérance" , 2004 as accompaniment of the decision of hydraulic Québec, the private sector its responsibility, this important, to surrender hydraulicelectrical project at height of a sum from 5 billion dollar to formed.</seg>
<seg id="5"> At the beginning of of 2005 ergatterte the consortium " Énergie gérance" the lucrative contract, without it would have given a public advertisement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For the Parti Québécois represents a falling back to enterprise consortia a serious ethical problem, which causes the risk of the Wettbewerbsverdrändung as well as a price increase.</seg>
<seg id="7"> " This is a new way of a preconcerted play and weakens the Konkurrenz."</seg>
<seg id="8"> " That means that one durchführt" instead of preconcerted plays instead of in secret way now in open form; , yesterday Sylvain Simard, delegate of the PQ explained, on the press conference.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the early morning Simard had raised the question before the national assembly, because it seems to him with difficulty understandably, how the interest can be served of the public in this way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Resources minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon after, by placing vehemently in agreement that it would have concerned with the present Treaty a preconcerted play.</seg>
<seg id="11"> " I remain treu" for my line; , it ranted, by encouraging, which was PQ " unredlich" proceeded and it " be missing to it at Härte."</seg>
<seg id="12"> She said, it " is the Mindeste" that the PQ apologizes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The model of the consortium is world-wide usual practice.</seg>
<seg id="14"> It concerns usually temporally such a limited alliance, which permits it to two or several enterprises to bundle their expert's assessments regarding a requirement on an advertisement for a complex project.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The project " Eastmain" a high complexity level exhibits concerning its work extent.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The building procedure is under way and should until 2012 be set up.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Nevertheless the contract was assigned, without a competition had been able to take place; it had already given negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Besides the model of the consortium in the Quebec does not represent an exception with relatively simple projects by any means more.</seg>
<seg id="19"> As the newspaper " Le Devoir" last week noted, is the model of the consortium article of government investigations, used within the range of the civil engineer and consulting nature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Short flying over of the Quebecer of enterprise register makes it possible to designate more than 200 consortia from which some from steady duration to seem to be.</seg>
<seg id="21"> In this way for example the company Dessau in partnership with the majority of their nuclear competitors, among whom CIMA+, Génivar, SNC Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult rank, co-operates.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Any linkage, and of it gives it several dozen, attributes to the same legal entity, i.e. to Dessau.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Which the consortium " Énergie gérance" it concerns then minister Normandeau stressed that " the territory of the Baie James of special worker dynamics is subjected and that hydraulic Québec this fact zollt" for the 70's in special way calculation;.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Réal Laporte, the large employer of the Société d' énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), made a declaration, which let the nose turn up the fact that the contract was granted over the direction of the project according to agreement.</seg>
<seg id="25"> " If you an advertisement makes and it only few applicants gives, your prices are schnellen." up;</seg>
<seg id="26"> " You have thus two possibilities: either you take the people, on this Mart are and say yourself: one is aushandeln." a satisfying agreement at a good price;</seg>
<seg id="27"> " The thought is however that not the price is crucial, but the expert knowledge of the Personen" , Laporte affirmed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> This the consortium " Énergie gérance" granted contract is part of a long list dollar received from contracts over more than 50.000 of the Parti Québécois.</seg>
<seg id="29"> The contracts were approved either of the hydraulic Québec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> After examination the newspaper counted " Le Devoir" more than 100 engineer and consultant contracts, who were granted companies or their branches, under it in particular to resources laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.</seg>
<seg id="31"> SNC Lavalin had gerafft 22 contracts, to Génivar 16 had actually received, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without here their participation had " on; Énergie gérance" to take into account.</seg>
<seg id="32"> All the present Treaties were negotiated.</seg>
<seg id="33"> They amount included in the entire to 449,783,344 $, in it the contract with " Énergie gérance" over 295,131,564 $.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Sylvain Simard to mention that the four companies, which form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) had " Parti libéral you Québec probably bekannt" are.</seg>
<seg id="35"> Minister Normandeau had let the PQ be reminiscent, is equally connected with the companies, which she " finanzierten" , before it specified that it concerns rather their high-level personnel.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The Green, but plainly sceptically.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The Quebecer consumer has little confidence in the main participants of lasting growth, however just as little in the characterized marks or the Öko markings, which are to steer its choice.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Harms, although it bathes in an medium-effective universe, where it teems only in such a way from information in favor of a more reliable consumption: the barometer of reliable consumption has to deplore a lack of reliable information, an inadequacy, which marks itself as brake of its commitment, how the first reading showed, which was held yesterday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Although they advanced the consumption of the socially compatible products so called in the year 2010, the Quebecer seems to zollen nevertheless those, which try to sell these, little credit.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Two thirds of the Quebecer population admits, indeed the environmental commitment of the companies likewise little faith to give like the green enterprise advertisement, then betrays the measuring instrument thought out of the responsible person consumer center of the University of Sherbrooke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Another findings: half of the consumers doubts so the barometer the trustworthiness of the official certificates, in addition, the reliability of the products and marks, added to the allegedly fair products, which define themselves as environmentally conscious.</seg>
<seg id="8"> After same sample the discourse of the politicians is seriously taken to this topic of only 14.6% the Quebecer population.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The information regarding responsible consumption seems nevertheless important for the stimulation of this consumer segment, which is encouraged at present by approximately only one third of the Quebecer consumers.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Indeed absorbed emptiness and a doubtful character of the information the eagerness of 46% of the consumers.</seg>
<seg id="11"> This is after the higher price of the products the second, on the part of the barometer identified brake.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition a third of the Quebecer of the indicated efficiency of the green products and services, which one is endeavored them to the hand to put, faces distrustfully.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to another report over half of the consumers in the year 2010 and had predominantly changed the mark one had already changed its habits or several products, in order to give its conviction expression.</seg>
<seg id="14"> According to barometer they had preferred purchases also to 61% with dealers of their city quarter and had favoured the purchase of food cultivated in their region.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Green and more reliably - the index of the environmentally conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 in this year - the Homo consumus the Quebec loves it to present itself than king recycling that tried, to reduce its traces left in the environment by worrying about the animal protection.</seg>
<seg id="16"> But social and ecological consciousness seems to make nevertheless before its car stop, so the barometer: straight times 28% the Quebecer have to have indicated, in the year 2010 public means of transport to have used or the agency for arranged lifts prefer, in order to demonstrate their ecological interest.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Government loan for the assumption of eXcentris</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Quebecer government, that was requested of the Société Angus as well as the enterprise Parallèle to take part financially in the assumption of the cinema complex eXcentris explains itself in agreement with a co-operation, however only in form of a competitive loan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The developer company Angus as well as the enterprise Parallèle, which had expected a donation at a value of seven million dollar of the ministry for education and cultural for the assumption of the Daniel Langlois of belonging cinema complex eXcentris on the boulevard Saint Laurent, in order to surrender these again to its actual cineastischen function, obviously do not receive, which they required.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The government accepted to involve itself in this thing however on its own conditions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Instead of the expected donation the Quebecer government offers rather a loan in smaller than the initially expected height, which could bring an able to exist solution on favourable conditions into being, at least according to opinion of the sources entnehmbaren from the national rumor-mongers.</seg>
<seg id="6"> A first plan of action as well as an inquiry after 12.8 million were rejected already last spring of the Quebec, that request for asking since that were again hum-moderately downward corrected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> A proposal as well as a plan of action of the president were already " Société de développement the entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, at minister St-Pierre transmission, who leads the document eXcentris.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Several days ago it had given to her a last special report.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The counter proposal of the cabinet was conveyed the SODEC however on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Parallèle and Angus have now by 31 December time to answer to these.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Anyhow the premise of the state donation seems to have been really pushed to the side.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> We call ourselves in memory that the Quebecer owner community of the cinemas and cinema complexes had revolted itself against a direct state investment for the support of the assumption of eXcentris, by stating the argument, to carry out the Secretary of cultural affairs has no financial assistance for real estate projects there which he had given not also different cinema halls.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Several other market players of the segment complained however in contrast to it substantial, economic assistance.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Cinema boss Daniel Langlois had presented the author cinema in the premises of his cinema complex after the self-financed construction of the cinema over ten years long under large difficulties, which could justify the exception position on the part of the treasury.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The lack of cinema halls, which show independent films, is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris its clientele knew to hold with the bar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The Société Angus as well as the enterprise Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the point, heads for their part a privately financed Campagne, from which they expect a sum 700,000 $, in order to set the acquisition in motion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> For the spring 2009 only one canvas continues showing films in eXcentris i.e. Le Parallèle.</seg>
<seg id="18"> A goal of the future Erwerber is " it, the three cinema halls on 27 February next yearly with the demonstration of the film very much succeeded of Xavier Beauvois; The hommes et dieux" again to open.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Secret complex-vibrated Canada ventilated</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new, American diplomat lines, which were spread by WikiLeaks, air the secret over what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of the Canadians judge opposite the Americans; they reveal however with the same impact the superiority feeling latter opposite Canada.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Therefore the American diplomats are surprised at the fact that the Canadian voter does not have the Canadian-American relations in the sense with the ballot, and they believe that the visit of president would have Obama the conservative government helped to implement their budget of 2009!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The four new reports between the American message in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly spread yesterday, offer still more spicy details than bare substantial contents, at which one has to nibble.</seg>
<seg id="5"> From 22 September 2008 dating a connection, i.e. in the period, in which the federal choice coming PAGE was present in the full course, reports on it, starting from which point the United Nations do not take part no more in the employments discussed by their political bosses.</seg>
<seg id="6"> To the large astonishment of David Wilkins, the American Ambassador used in Ottawa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Mr. Wilkins offers different explanation possibilities of this situation.</seg>
<seg id="8"> " The Canadians an almost inherent inferiority complex conditionally compelled possibly the Canadian to push over political high-level personnel much rather to speak about internal points of issue of the everyday life as the United States Peter black with this choice (like 1988 with the campaign over the free trade) " , then he describes.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The United Nations, then he concludes, is thus " the proverbial Goliath of this choice: omnipräsent, but sprechen" potentially too threateningly, over from it to;.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The Ambassador understands these " deafening Stille" the less, since the two countries preserve intensive political and economic relations.</seg>
<seg id="11"> " Logischerweise" , then he evaluates, " it should be the ability of a candidate, a party still much and more a party chief for leading such a essential relationship, which the voter hat." with the going to the polls as key factor in the sense;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The other expression of this feeling of importance reads itself in on 22 January 2009 report sent by Terry Breese, representative in Ottawa, the president Barack Obama for its first visit in Ottawa to prepare is.</seg>
<seg id="13"> " Their journey to help to ensure a continuing of the government with the confidence vote over the Federal Budget at the beginning of of February at which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than one decade, due to a stimulation program at a value of 30 to 40 billion dollar developed ist" , Breese describes.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Anywhere he had not mentioned that the government had had to postpone the sitting of parliament before Christmas, in order to prevent that the parliament was fallen by the coalition and in such a way caused continuing of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the suggested stimulation program.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And on the part of Ambassador Wilkins written report Washington informs, from January 2008 dating further from the ever more negatively becoming picture that, the dramatic series of the United States, radiated over CBC, spread.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The Ambassador is concerned about transmissions such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one little subtle allusions at Maher Arar, which " NO-Fly-List" or also to removals for the purpose of through muscle-show off the CIA of accomplished hearings to observe can.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Again another report reports in detail how Hillary Clinten asked with its French colleagues Berne pool of broadcasting corporations Kouchner with their first bilateral meeting for it, whether Europe is ready, certain prisoners from Guantanamo to take up.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Mr. Kouchner is to have answered the question with, however on the basis of an individual " Case to Fall" - Decision.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Àm end of the meeting, then descriptive, " he handed a paper to the state secretary out in puncto Omar Khadr, a 15-jährigen Muslims Canadian Ursprungs."</seg>
<seg id="20"> " The Secretary of State assured, the document again durchzusehen."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> We finally still mark that the mind heats up regarding the web page WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Tom Flanagan, an older and Stephen Harper very closely standing advisor, had explained over CBC that for this solid leakage the responsible persons " umgebracht" will should.</seg>
<seg id="23"> It had reported here on Mike Huckabee from the United States.</seg>

<seg id="1"> World-wide plan for the renewal of the lighting</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The UN yesterday suggested trade and industry in 100 countries in Cancun a plan for the renewal of the lighting of households, regarding the achievement of a decrease of the greenhouse gas (FCKW), to which almost to a third to the additional reduction corresponds, which must be realized, in order to stabilize the earth climate until 2020.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This ambitious plan takes its position in the step of the concrete large-scale projects, which the UN in Cancun hopes to convert, in order to compensate the absence of compelling reduction obligations of the industrialized countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> After the plan brought forward yesterday that would be avoided main problem in form of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of the FCKWs delivered due to the lighting on earth, if the white-hot pears, which represent so far still another monopoly from 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better still, by light emitting diodes (LED).</seg>
<seg id="5"> The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world-wide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="6"> This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the world-wide vehicle park.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In Copenhagen last year the large exhaust memo ducks like the United States, China, and others, under what also Canada counted, had committed themselves Europe to voluntary reduction plans, which should down-screw the global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.</seg>
<seg id="8"> From this balance one would have to take however still 5 Gt off, in order to stabilize today up to the year 2020 the climatic rise around 2 degrees Celsius, in order to prevent that this gets out of control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the white-hot pears 95% of the energy escape in the form of warmth, and the remaining 5% produce the light.</seg>
<seg id="10"> With the compact phosphor pears the energy consumption reduces by 75%, with the new LED bulbs reduces one this power requirement again by the double.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The compact phosphor pears hold on average between 6000 to 10.000 hours.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The new LED bulbs, as for example those, which the manufacturer Philips brought this week on the market - this society by the way participated in the UN study - to have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and use 80% less energy than a white-hot pear, which obtain a suggestion of the saving possibilities of the replacing plan, which is to be used in 100 countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Apart from the fact that iese completely new bulbs deliver only very little warmth, it can function it also with an adjustable resistor.</seg>
<seg id="14"> And they do not contain any mercury.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Several specialists pointed out that compact phosphor pears exhibit reserves, since them mercury to contain and that one must dispose of it therefore as special refuse, which is not always possible in the developing countries except the producers makes available an assumption place.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The main source at mercury emissions on the planet does not represent the compact phosphor pear according to the report however, but rather the coal-fired power stations, which discharge substantially more mercury, in order to produce the electricity wasted by the white-hot pears.</seg>
<seg id="17"> However in the United States these coal-fired power stations discharge 25.000 tons mercury annually.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The report states details the profits, which would gain each country owing to this international program.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Indonesia would save so for example a billion dollar annually with the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that means an equivalent of 3,5 coal-fired power stations, whose building Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.</seg>

<seg id="3"> All of this under attentive views of the diplomats of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Of WikiLeaks the received and from the newspaper " Le Monde" examined American documents give some background to this crisis price.</seg>
<seg id="5"> They describe, how the Elysée had explained to the Americans its strategy, who went so far, this pieces of advice as handling their own crisis of " Geiselnahmen" to give in Iran (a small group of ramblers).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> They point out, like the French responsible persons tried to convince Washington of the fact that the freeing of the young Frenchwoman does not have the release of Majid Kakavand, in France an imprisoned held and of the American law due to trade with material Iranian looked for in favor of the Iranian nuclear program to the Gegeleistung.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Finally they set the way, with which the French presidency tried to manipulate the media for the purpose to make for these the idea convincing the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad have a central role with the freeing from Clotilde tear played, into a sharp light.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In truth he had done nothing in this regard.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> On 12 August 2009 into of Paris drawn up diplomat telegram carries the title " Iran: French comments on the way of handling Geiselnahmen."</seg>
<seg id="10"> François Richier, Elysée advisor in strategy questions, conversed accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director Quai of the d' Orsay for North Africa and the middle Orient with the American Diplomatin Kathleen Allegrone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> They explained the French method to her.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Those guessed/advised the Americans to set everything in order to reconduct their own citizens, who were held by force in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="13"> " Power Lärm" , they said, " articulated loud and clearly and without Unterlass" the words " Grundmenschenrechte" , " Unschuld" , " immediate Freilassung" in the media.</seg>
<seg id="14"> This is necessary, in order to bring the Iranian regime in embarrassment, which pays attention very sensitively to its image.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> " This does not operate all the more, particularly since the Iranians ask you, that too tun."</seg>
<seg id="16"> Because " Silence solves nichts" , past the discussion attempts over on inconspicuous way, which is Iranians " Master in Ausweichmanövern."</seg>
<seg id="17"> Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners one " common, Iranian Taktik" is: " Taking of hostages for the purpose of political Erpressung."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> He announces, the release of Clotilde tears from the prison (on 16 August to come should, on the day, to it into the French message takes refuge) " require the payment of a large sum of money to the Iraner" (230.000 euros bail).</seg>
<seg id="19"> And it lets the Elysée antizipiere further takings of hostages, a phenomenon, which " announce; are intensified wird."</seg>
<seg id="20"> The Iranians could " arrest in the near future another that approximately 1.800 French citizens, who leben" in Iran; , then he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> 28. August 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Clotilde tear is twelve days ago from the prison dismisses, however further in Iran one holds.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Information was in circulation brought: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose distribution the united states demand due to illegal trade with sensitive electronics material to Iran, is after decision of a judge in Paris from the detention dismisses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The American message places itself, like numerous other observers, questions over this disturbing coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="25"> For Washington, which pursues the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of for the nuclear program planned material, the release of Majid Khakavand represents a bad piece of news.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Did France accept an horse trade?</seg>
<seg id="27"> The freeing of the Iranian against that the Frenchwoman?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> On the occasion of a renewed conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September insures François Richier that this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="29"> The Elysée, then he says, was not " only; completely surprises from the resolution of the Richters" , but also tried to revolt itself against it.</seg>
<seg id="30"> " It gegeben" one to move exchange between the French presidency and the French Minister of Justice; (at present Michèle Alliot Marie), but " the French government does not know the judicial decision ändern" , it explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Mr. Richier would like to also point out that Majid Kakavand " further under; strenger" Supervision of the French secret service stands.</seg>
<seg id="32"> The Elysée advisor selects a telephone number, puts, informed then the American Diplomatin, which " Iranians; would be at present in the buildings led by the Iranian message in Paris."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> During the safekeeping of Clotilde do not tear in Iran preserves the Elysée his efforts, by means of announcements and from the media more organized " Fluchtversuche" believe to make, the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad plays one " wichtige" and " influential Mittlerrolle."</seg>
<seg id="34"> The Americans observe this activity not without irony and state that the manipulation carries fruits, since several press articles reflect the official French version.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> From 25 August 2009 dating telegram swears to " medium lightning of the French Behörden" up.</seg>
<seg id="36"> On which so much is based " Dankesbezeugung" opposite Mr. Assad, those asks itself Paris message.</seg>
<seg id="37"> " Despite its explanations full praise price the French authorities admit secretly that they have only a vague notion of it, which haben" the Syrier actually done;.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The document is concerned then with the reasons, which brought the Elysée to it, this fiction to purge.</seg>
<seg id="39"> The intensive communication efforts " at it off, Sarkozys politics of the opening aims opposite Syria too bestätigen" , it analyzes.</seg>
<seg id="40"> 2008 launched politics, which " at that time; from numerous critic voices in France as well as abroad as premature and undeservedly perception wurde."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> " The Syrian role aufbauschend" Paris tries " To lead Syria before eyes, which commendation one can obtain, by spielt" a constructional role in the region;.</seg>
<seg id="42"> A goal is " it in addition; Discord between Syria and Iran too säen."</seg>
<seg id="43"> The American message knows this on good authority.</seg>
<seg id="44"> On 11 August François Richier had entrusted it: " of course we do not know whether the Syrier whatever made haben."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In bright excitement due to corruption suspicion the executive committee of the FIFA appoints the sponsor countries of the world championships on Thursday 2018 and 2022, a most political choice, with which the Rangeln around influence as well as the Lobbying the technical criteria threaten into the background to urge.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A thing is however safe: the expenditure 2018 of the king discipline of the FIFA becomes in Europe, their traditional center, takes place (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain Portugal, Netherlands Belgium).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The edition 2022 will then exotically fail somewhat; the international football federation hopes to be able to win after the premiere on the African continent in the year 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) for itself or its address in the United States or in the Far East (Japan to pursue South Korea) further.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The list of the personalities, those to the delegation associated (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Netherlands head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political employment of a world championship.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The machinations behind the scenes threaten to continue thus up to the last minute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> With difficulty otherwise to set up a hierarchy of the candidates.</seg>
<seg id="8"> According to the evaluation report of the FIFA, English, Spanish Portuguese offer (2018) and American (2022) document bessseren arguments as those of their competitors.</seg>
<seg id="9"> But these considerations will not be so weighty for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees for the hour of the choice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The Sunday Times, which stood with causing suspending two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the exposures, could have ruined just as well the chances for its own country, cradle of the football, which was allowed to deliver only once the world championship, i.e. 1966.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The BBC had on Monday again the fertile soil given, by having document-workarranged radiated one, the three influential members of the Kommitees, i.e. Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under bombardment takes.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Reason of enough to annoy the FIFA and to bring the English responsible persons in embarrassment, who had operated an intensive Lobbying primarily with David Cameron in these last weeks.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Would this intensive employment be sufficient, in order to revalue the image of England before the committee again?</seg>

<p>
<seg id="15"> Nothing is less safe, because it is not missing to the duo Spain Portugal at Trümpfen with its already finished stages, its expert's assessment (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.</seg>
<seg id="16"> But the economic and financial negative sides of the two countries could absorb their ambitions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The possible Repressalien against the Englishmen as well as the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal let the chances of Russia, which became despite its gaps in the dossier (stages, hotel, transport) the weighty outsider, rise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Prime minister Vladimir Putin decided however, the unumwundenen suggestion on the accusing of the English press " an unfair competition in the preparation of the Abstimmung" denounced on the part of the Kommiteemitglieder.</seg>

</p>

<seg id="20"> For 2022 the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994 seem to be the logical favorites.</seg>
<seg id="21"> First economic world power, seat of the FIFA Hauptsponsoren, the country seems to exhibit a long list of advantages opposite Japan and South Korea, which set up a very beautiful project separately.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> But these new candidacies seem premature for two countries, which had along-organized the matches in the year 2002.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Another threat: of the FIFA hot desired grant of the WM 2026 for China, which the Asian chances on 2022 become void to let.</seg>

<seg id="1"> The government Berlusconi goes into Italy into covering</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> After a week beginning worrying for Italy the situation relaxed yesterday with the decrease of the hitting a corner interest on 10 years a little.</seg>
<seg id="3"> A return to deceitful satisfying.</seg>
<seg id="4"> At the end of the meeting with the minister of economics the region chairmen Giulio Tremonti the situation had " as; unentzifferbar" qualify and it with one " unvorhersagbaren" Heard weekend count, what the concerning however immediately disclaimed.</seg>
<seg id="5"> On Tuesday the shears with the German interest rates would anyhow have reached its record of 210 base points, and the prices of the contracts for the covering of the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain Kopflosigkeit in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council of Ministers that the discrepancy of Spain is to the German interest rates about 400 base points.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Its right hand, Gianni Letta, had " itself however as; heavily besorgt" of " Marktturbulenzen" and a possible infection danger from direction Ireland expressed.</seg>
<seg id="8"> " The good message is that Italy, which ist." third national economy of the Eurozone, not like Greece or Ireland;</seg>
<seg id="9"> " The bad piece of news is that Italy ist" such as Portugal; , Irwin Stelzer, political economist at the Hudson of institutes explains.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In the plain language is called that, its problem is the absence of economic growth and control inlets exerted by it and the shrink-addicted, which bring the state in danger not to be able to cover its financing need any longer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The last Brussels prognoses were a cold shower for the government.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In the future an Italian growth of 1,1% in the year 2011 and of 1,4% in the year 2012 expected... although the household budget available with the senate for examination on 1,3% and/or 2% counts.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Under these conditions, then the European Commission calculates, the budgetary deficit in the next year still 4.3% of the Gross Domestic Product will constitute (against of the governments predicted 3.9%) and 3.5% in the year 2012 (instead of 2,7%).</seg>
<seg id="14"> From there also the riot around a new household collective, which could be used after the holidays to a sum of 7 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="15"> " If necessary, new economy measures must moved werden" , chartered accoutant Olli Rehn means.</seg>
<seg id="16"> To the hour Italy receives the support of international institutions.</seg>
<seg id="17"> " The foundation of of Italy economics are correct and its accounts are regular, that already repeat we since long Zeit" , insures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, which is entrusted with Italy with the IWF.</seg>
<seg id="18"> " At this moment there are no problems, neither on short term, nor on long-term view, there of Italy despite its high indebtedness (119.2% of the Gross Domestic Product in the year 2011, A.D. R.) smaller Stabilisationsfortschritte to be demanded than of other Ländern" , jetty observes Carlo Padoan, chief political economist of the OECD.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The question about the political unsteadiness remains.</seg>
<seg id="20"> On 14 December Silvio Berlusconi a motion of no confidence of the chamber of deputies to be faced with, due to those preferred the elections at the end of March be already organized could.</seg>
<seg id="21"> It is approaching thus a little favorable period for an adoption of resolutions regarding a heavy crisis.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Europeans think about the development of the anti-crisis measures</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Christine Lagarde had expressly emphasized it still yesterday in the context of a press conference in Paris: " I believe, one it still on Sunday afternoon as well as on evening proved: The Europeans hold clearly, are ready and committedly, their currency as well as their currency area together too verteidigen."</seg>
<seg id="3"> Although perfectly relative - the departure with the interest rates of the European state obligations, registered yesterday, was water on the mills of the governments as well as the EZB.</seg>
<seg id="4"> From a beginning of normalization however yet the speech cannot be.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Rating agency standard & Poor' s had announced, she knew the debt note of Portugal, which probably most effective target of the speculators nowadays, to lower.</seg>
<seg id="6"> " As in May exists a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which particularly lastet" on the bank systems; , so the opinion of the political economists of the Exane BNP Paribas.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Above all, particularly " the political time many more slowly passes than those the Märkte."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The European countries, which are probably conscious both to this gap and the danger, which hide themselves therein, intensify the discussions for the reinforcement of the already existing anti-crisis measures.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The informal consultation between the Ministers of Finance most directly concerned and in the broader sense with their Gegenübern of the G20 precedes well.</seg>
<seg id="10"> And this also in view to the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The EZB meets today.</seg>
<seg id="12"> On the plan the lot of the unorthodox measures stands for the back stabilization of the countries of the Eurozone in the hair cross of the markets (see below).</seg>
<seg id="13"> Which concerns the European Union stability funds, then their Executive Director Klaus Regling already began his Asia route on Tuesday in Singapour, in order to inform the investors in the Far East about the developments regarding the crisis in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="14"> If a goal of its visit is not express Fundraising, then it surely prepares to it the terrain for this.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The first expenditures for who paper on the part of the European Union stability fund are intended for next month.</seg>

<seg id="17"> Portugal and Spain, the countries in first row, get ready to for their part, structural reforms, to transfer in particular in the range of the job market organization.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Reforms, which are added to the economy measures, however effects in more near future to show are.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Lisbon and Madrid another way follow, than this Greece and Ireland did.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Both is to the one, and the other one at each price to avoid to have to request international assistance before they set up and over inevitable structural reforms decided their own budget-corrective, which to them in the long term the confidence returns.</seg>
<seg id="21"> The European financial sources again converse about the options the available, in order to accelerate the normalization process of the markets from government loans to.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Axel Weber, which was on 24 November on the through journey in Paris, as the first the idea out had brought that if the 750 did not mobilize billions euros by Europe and the International Monetary Fund enough would be, then the union would not hesitate to reach again into the own bag.</seg>
<seg id="23"> The political economists of Barclays Capital, regarding the market of the European national indebtedness completely in the foreground standing participant, judge, an extension of around the 100 billion euros to be sufficient, were " vorzugsweise" in form of a direct liquidity syringe.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Since the debate is around the modernization of the traffic economy on the Ile-de-France in full course, it rains billions.</seg>
<seg id="3"> At least in the discussions.</seg>
<seg id="4"> One calls oneself here in particular the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris in memory, which by the Société you Grand Paris to be built is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In order to initiate the commencement of construction of the SGP, the state proclaimed a capital donation of 4 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In the theoretical pattern this is the sum, which the SGP would then make possible to lend on the markets a part the financial sum to their double one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Today it finally came to first computer forecasts.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The additional budget examined of 2010, this morning of the finance committee of the national assembly, contains the intended measures, in order to apply the first part of these funds.</seg>
<seg id="9"> It concerns here two different measures: the creation of a special tax to Erschließund and a higher taxation of the offices on Ile de France.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> First, then one takes article 15 of the bill, goes " in favor of the public institute Société you Grand Paris."</seg>
<seg id="11"> This is numbered: " The product of this tax amounts on 117 million euros per Jahr."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Zweitere is a re-organization of the enterprise taxation already existing: " in order to modernize these to increase by from its product and this increase of the Société you Grand Paris too überantworten" itself;. </seg>
<seg id="13"> How much would that bring in?</seg>
<seg id="14"> A mystery.</seg>
<seg id="15"> This sum is not numbered in the text.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Of the 4 billion one is far.</seg>
<seg id="17"> " It is implemented that fiscal resources are included to the 4 billion euros of the capital donation, by the state are applied and the Société you the Grand Paris gradually for the project performed werden" , then is to be taken from the explaining statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> With the SGP finds one this system not at all anstößig.</seg>
<seg id="19"> " Since the instant, in which one books incomes (the two taxes, D.), One can cover project engineering for R. over three years long and then only from the 4 billion schöpfen" , then one explains.</seg>
<seg id="20"> " This is noted in the budget and abgezogen" gradually;.</seg>
<seg id="21"> The SGP estimates that 2013 will be begun to note the 4 billion for the budget 2014.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> This measure, whose 4 promised billions one will be able to look for still for a long time, runs the risk, a quite induced to cause parliamentary discussion.</seg>
<seg id="23"> The first public meeting takes place on 7 December.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Rachsüchtige hacker and emsige spies</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The affair WikiLeaks has a double meaning.</seg>
<seg id="3"> On a side it emerged as obvious scandal, a scandal, which is only a scandal in the Sinner hypocrisy, those the Beziehunge between the states, which citizen and the press govern.</seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other side she announces profound changes on international level, and gives a foretaste on the future dominated by involution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But we proceed in sequence.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that everyone of a secret service consists provided document (an x-arbitrary nation) exclusively of newspaper cuttings.</seg>
<seg id="7"> " außerordentlichen" , American exposures over the sexual habits Berlusconis throw nothing else off as what one got to anyway read over months in each x-arbitrary journal (except those, whose owner is Berlusconi), and that frightening karikaturierte profile Gaddafis offered Kabarettkünstlern already since long time material for their Sketche.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule, according to which the secret dossiers may consist only of already well-known pieces of news, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.</seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go into a library, which dedicates itself to esotherischen publications, you will recognize that each work (over the Gral, which Mysterium of Rennes le Chateau, those Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) accurately repeats, what in previous works were already written.</seg>
<seg id="10"> That comes along not alone that the author of okkulter texts does not want to publish searches (still from there that he would not know, where pieces of news would be over the non--existing thing to be found), but because those, which dedicate themselves to the Okkultismus, believe in nothing differently than, what they already know and confirm, what they already learned.</seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Likewise the secret documents.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The informant is lazy, and putridly (or limited spirit) also the boss of the secret service (otherwise it could whatever be, for example editor with Libération) is, which judges only as true, which he recognizes.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The Top Secret information about Berlusconi, which had sent the American message in Rome to the state department, was the same as those, which Newsweek had already published the week before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Was such why thus made waiving around the exposures of these dossiers?</seg>
<seg id="16"> On a side these that already knows each educated person, mean that the messages - at least since end of the Second World War and since then also the heads of government mutually to call to be able themselves or an airplane to take be able, in order to meet with dinner - their diplomatic function to have lost and, with exception of some small tasks of representation, in espionage centers to have transformed.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Any spectator of investigation films knows this very exactly, and it does not happen from hypocrisy that one does in such a way, this to ignore.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Nevertheless: the fact to repeat it publicly injures the task of the hypocrisy and serves to set the American diplomacy into a bad light.</seg>
<seg id="19"> In second place: The idea that an x-arbitrary hacker can tap the secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world, saves the substantial impact against the prestige of the state department.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Besides the scandal brings the victims less, than rather " Scharfrichter" in distress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we dedicate ourselves its that happened to deep nature.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Formerly, to Orwells times, one could bundle all power bread ago like a Big, for each gesture of its subjects controlled.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwells prophecy could itself have put since then as perfectly correctly, where one can control each movement owing to the telephone, each transacted transaction, the visited hotel out, the selected motorway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.</seg>
<seg id="24"> If one leads oneself however before eyes, which runs off today that even the secret crypts of power cannot escape from no more control of a hacker, then the Kontrollgang stops being on one side arranged and becomes zirkelförmig.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Power controls each citizen, but each citizen, or at least the hacker - chooses as Rächer of the citizen -, can get to know the secrets to power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> How however can a power hold itself, which is not any more able, their own secrets to protect?</seg>
<seg id="27"> It is correct, George Simmel said already that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can be never revealed); it is likewise true that jedwede knowledge of the character Berlusconis or Merkels is free in the reason a secret from Geheimis, since it surrenders the public sphere; but in styles of WikiLeaks to reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means, to rob she of any power.</seg>
<seg id="28"> WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel injustice, however on the other hand to Clinton and Obama.</seg>
<seg id="29"> What will the consequences of this offense be, which was caused to a so enormous power?</seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the states will place in the future no reserved information more on-line ones - that would equal a notice glued to at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is just as obvious that it is with the current technologies in vain to hope to be able to keep confidential reports secret over telephone.</seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is being found out more simply than whether and when a head of state in an airplane moved and contacted one of its colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="33"> How in the future could private and only relations intended for certain ears be maintained?</seg>
<seg id="34"> I very probably know that my forecast sounds novelful for the moment after Science Fiction and, but I do not see myself forced to present to me the government agents in secret way emsig on uncontrollable routes of march moving, their reports anywhere differently than beyond that in the bare memory with carrying, and the few written information, which got her, in the shoe paragraph hiding.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The information would be stored in only copy in locked drawers: in the reason the espionage attempt of Watergate less success had to register, than WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity to write that the technology progresses nowadays like a cancer, i.e. backwards.</seg>
<seg id="37"> One century after the wireless Telegraf communication had revolutionized, reconstructs the Internet a Telegrafen with (telephone) wire.</seg>
<seg id="38">  (Similar) the video cassettes for the film researchers had made possible to explore a film volume for volume by reeling from the rear forward and all secrets of the assembly air knew, while (numeric) the CD make nowadays nothing else possible to jump as from chapter to chapter thus in macro portions.</seg>
<seg id="39"> With the high-speed courses one drives within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this requires three and a half hours by airplane including transferring.</seg>
<seg id="40"> It is not unusual from there that politics and communications technology return to car and horse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> A last observation.</seg>
<seg id="42"> In earlier times the press tried to understand, what for secrets between the messages were forged.</seg>
<seg id="43"> There is present the messages, which demand confidential information of the press.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Climate: as France its financial promises beautiful-talks</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> One year after the Kopenhagener contract is it time, the adherence to the fast solved financing promises (also " Nearly Start" or came prematurely financings mentioned) to examine, which were realized by the developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="3"> And the rough French Schönredereien is uncovered already.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With the Kopenhagener the developing countries committed themselves to contract to make available 30 billion dollar between 2010 and 2012.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The European Union promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On the occasion of the opening of the COP16 the European Union drew all registers, in order to convince their partners of the fact of their commitment concerning the nearly starting financings: detailfaithful procedure report of its member states, press conference, large Nebenevents, brochure distribution.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The operation transparency is remarkable and degrees for their actual value estimated: the developing countries and the civil society would see it gladly, if all developed countries made the same on the same precision level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Announced the European Union in the year 2010 2.2 billion euros to have set free which brings it on the correct way to the Respektbezollung of its commitment of 7.2 billion in the year 2012.</seg>
<seg id="9"> If one looks however in the detail, the things lie a little more complicated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should according to the Kopenhagener contract " again and zusätzlich" its to do in order to ensure that an additional employment was brought in, without for the disadvantage of public development assistance.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately there is no consent over it, which " again and zusätzlich" meant.</seg>
<seg id="12"> While the European Commission had suggested a harmonization, certain member states, under it France, have which blocks procedures.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Today everyone selects the appoximate value, which it judges as best.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The European Commission has itself for example as appoximate value for that of the yearly 2009 chosen: the international financings are maintained, and give in the context of the financing " Nearly Start" over three years long 150 million in addition.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries selected similar appoximate values, either regarding year or concerning conditions on level of public development assistance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In response to it was France of the opinion, which " financings; all new Projekte" the yearly 2010 are " again and zusätzlich."</seg>
<seg id="17"> Differently expressed: There are no appoximate values with the expenditures of the preceeding yearly or on global level of public development assistance.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Concretely said the sum total of the French support of the developing countries can remain stable (or to also decrease) - France gives, its obligation regarding " new and zusätzlichen" To keep financings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another, crucial element is the classification in donations and loans.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Over it still no rule prevails, and everyone selects its computing mode.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, as for example France, find 1 borrowed € as equivalent with 1 donated €.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Obviously this is only with difficulty justifiable: the trouble is not comparable.</seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often to the emission containment bound projects, which are based on most effective technology) to be justified can, it is deceitful to present the euros one as equivalent for a donated euro taken in... Besides only the costs of the loan of the financial source country should be taken into account as commitment (i.e. the equivalent of a interest rate).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France does not have anything differently in the sense than the following consideration: it " respektiert" its obligation of 420 million euro, by taking up 91.5% loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donates) 36.1 million euros) - see also the European Union document, in order to convince itself of it.</seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only country of the European Union that loan begins in large measure.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany demands 46%, during Denmark, which follow to the Netherlands or the Slovakia (among other things) their obligations to 100% with donations.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Differently said, if the predominant majority of the European union spends 1€ for the fulfillment of its obligations, France gives straight once 10 to cent and understands by it a comparable employment.</seg>
<seg id="28"> Beautiful Hokuspokus!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> All in all France operates in its nearly starting financing with a double swindle: to a part with a Weiterentwicklkung of the action over the time and on the other hand part with the reality of the financial employment.</seg>
<seg id="30"> France succeeds it, believes to leave that it " 420 million; more again and zusätzlicher" Millions in agreement with his promises spent and saves thereby 36.1 million euro.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the Treasury (it probably seems there that it was Bercy, which accomplished the arbitrage) could pull one doubly negative effect; once European Union-internally (why the other member states continue with donating, if it is sufficient nevertheless to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries do not let be deceptive completely...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter of the financings only a small question on relatively short time compared with the whole of discussions over the climate, come prematurely.</seg>
<seg id="33"> But it could be too much the drop in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.</seg>
<seg id="34"> We hope that this will not be the case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As also always is, it is indispensable to learn its lesson from this first year of premature financings.</seg>
<seg id="36"> Primarily France could announce a change in its kind of posting for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of the respect for its obligations and the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European union.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Above all however France could bring the discussions forward over the contention of the long-term financings (another, crucial and momentarily discussed topic): one escapes from the question " Verrechenbarkeit" or the kind of posting of its loans not.</seg>
<seg id="38"> France could change its position, in order to be just as progressive regarding the points of issue, as it is with other things.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Hope is based thus on the new Secretary of the Environment Kosciusko Morizet, which will arrive next week in Cancun.</seg>
<seg id="40"> A surprising announcement over the nearly start of France and its vision " Verrechenbarkeit" as well as the use of loans by nature the international confidence basis would raise, which is necessary for resuming discussions.</seg>
