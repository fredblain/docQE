<seg id="1"> What it should do, that? The Czech social democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort, yet the "Konditorei." </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new aldermen of the capital out of the rows of that will have to overcome obviously certain language barriers in order to be able to understand its old new colleagues out of the ODS in the citizen of Prague advice and in the city representation generally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The newspaper has "raped" members of the new advice out of that once a few how they control the notorious slang, that became established in the last years, in which the current coalition partners in Prague were at the oar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The codified vocabulary, that was introduced in the past era by mayor Pavel Bém of the citizen of Prague of political elite, is some of the best known participants, situations and Causae borrows. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Surprisingly appeared that the new Räte grope these new concepts with regard to that something in the dark. </seg>
<seg id="6"> They maintain that at least. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Who is Voldemort"? </seg>
<seg id="8"> "No idea." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am sooner a novice in the citizen of Prague politics," reacted Luká Kaucký, the new alderman for culture, on the test of the "godfather vocabulary." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But also the alderman Karel - a political veteran - reacted in similar manner. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example on the concept "gulf hole." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "That is the single expression of which that you produce me here, that I there and again would use." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Otherwise I do not hold much of slang." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Out of the vocabulary, that the daily paper in this year's June had published before the choice congress of the ODS, pickte the editorship six concepts out, above all such, that are connected notorious with the citizen of Prague magistrate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The social democrats should define the concepts "Voldemort," "largest citizen of Prague gulf hole," "into the Konditorei go," "bull nape," "treason of the capital" and "verblechen." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Three citizens of Prague alderman agreed the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future boss of the citizen of Prague of school system - promised participate to be sure first his in the conversation, took then however not even the listener off. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The fifth alderman, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the start. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "These things are equal and like itself the middle class democrats among one another maintained me, judge about that I not." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "For me is important, like we us in the frame of our programs understand," countered it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> How already indicated, Luká Kaucký in the headline mentioned above not nominally would have recognized that by the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém, novel is Janoušek the speech. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The concept "Voldemort" says Kaucky purely nothing at all and the single concept, that it correctly guessed in the test, "the largest citizen of Prague was gulf hole." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "That is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, joined to the security however yet thereto: I know "but that sooner out of the newspaper." </seg>
<seg id="23"> And joking: "I will have to cover" probably a language course. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The "gulf hole" will separate decoded then not only of matador Karel also of the alderman for environment questions Luká Plachý correctly as a tunnel Blanka. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Both social democrats know however also, for whom the term Voldemort stands and even suspects Luká Plachý, where this figure is to be found and through it also, what is named it, "into the Konditorei to go." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "I believe, that is, into any citizen of Prague gastronomy business to go," is Plachý rather nearly at it at the riddle solution if one knows, that it concerns herewith the seat of Janoušeks firms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Concurring with it assures however to have taken these knowledge sooner out of the newspaper, than that this vocabulary would be own of it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> To judge the test participants after, it seems to give no similarly naturalized slang under the social democrat actually. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I asked also my colleagues, but there obviously is not so something here really." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "We would call us in the name, there and again use we also shorthand symbol or nickname," says the chairperson of the citizens of Prague Petr Hulínský - of its party comrades careless "Hulda" named. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "In the school became I (birch) named, but I knows not, whether me also my colleagues so name," betrays us Karel its nickname. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The newspaper Deník tried the name and see there - it functions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Alderman Weinert the "grandpa" or fewer is would thump for the party comrades friendlily friendlily the "old," the representative Miroslav, is named, that made before the choices through wheelings and dealings in the party sponsorship aware of itself, of many colleagues (well known Czech Lego figure). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Nicknames are so the only that the social democrats in the innerparteilichen usage allow. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Hulínský does not like it nominally if one names it "Hulda," but Deník registered another other nickname of the citizen of Prague of chairperson. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Its nickname "doctor of the nightsticks rights" nominally therewith has to do that Petr Hulínský acquired its title Doctor juris at the Bratislaver police academy. </seg>

<seg id="12"> After New Year this deregulation will be forthcoming most rent dwellings in the Czech Republic, whose tenants pay previously no market-driven rent. </seg>

<seg id="21"> Most people are here, to solve around the usual problems - repair proposals, insurance matters and similar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> From in the middle of November, the envelopes with the new leases flutter in the region Ostrava most tenants of the altogether 44,000 dwellings of the portfolio the RPG into the mailboxs. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The deregulation and Bakalas former miner dwellings are a disruptive subject. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before the choices, the parliament vice president coming out of Ostrava Lubomír Zaorálek by that had taken up this subject rather lauthals, no wonder that the newspapers are full therefrom today. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> I want "twenty years of them a new floor." </seg>
<seg id="29"> "Not even ne besch. They were able to exchange WC glasses," makes itself the from the outset mentioned man air. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Until now stand the colleagues according to above all pensioner at the switch in order to convince itself whether they really receive the promised rent reduction, that promises them RPG, if they sign the special offer on time. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="34"> RPG offers at the same time both on its web pages and blackboards necessarily appears individual rent agreements, where it. </seg>
<seg id="35"> If the rent parties should not agree however on the new rent, it would be determined of an independent court. </seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The regulated rent ends in the largest part of the Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty is the rent increase an economical necessity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> "The existing height of the rents passes not even to the maintenance of the accustomed fund out of," argues Pavel climatesš, the director of the dwelling portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - straight the neglect criticized by the raised tenants of the dwelling fund is in the opinion of the home owner the main reason for the rent increase. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> While RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010 was able to invest out of the taken in rents four billions into the dwellings, in the four years of 2011to 2014,5.2 billions should be it. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="46"> "The rent increases in 2011 around 15% and fewer concern 31,200 dwellings, that is more than 90% of the dwellings of RPG." </seg>
<seg id="47"> "Always means this at most 7.50 CZK per square meter and month," is to be read on the LCD monitor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> Only in 400 dwellings out of the portfolio of RPG, the rent raises itself by 38 percent. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "In these cases concerns it the increase of extremely slight rent prices of 19.66 CZK per square meter," argues RPG. </seg>
<seg id="50"> In 2600 dwellings, the rent in the next year remains on same height. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not drive the rents jerky into the height, but rather results gradually within four and eight years. </seg>
<seg id="52"> What more - the business a further obligation imposes itself: The business wants to stick all revenue out of the rent increase (see chart) again into the dwellings, above all in warmth savings - into new windows and into the thermal insulation. </seg>

<seg id="3"> That is the Casa Batlló of the catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Of the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms got the nickname "bone house." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile gravel and mosaic, the facade remembering at barn and omnipresent soft lines, all this typical features are for art nouveau by Antonio Gaudi. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The facade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colors and textures, that remind one of nature and living thing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> First in more exact looking, one notes that all is controlled by geometry, rhythm and thought out order. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In the night, the entire facade causes yet plastic, more dramatic and the special Anleuchtung reinforces the brightness of the colors yet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The same spirited lines and verschlungenen forms control also that in the house. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wood -like formed wavescopies the window frames, railing, ornament elements by doors, even look holes and strips. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The house Batlló in the quarter Eixample at the animated purchase street Passeig de Grácia no. 43 was caused by the reconstruction of a house from the year 1877, that architects Emilio Sala Cortese carried out. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reconstruction used two years and was locked 1906. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, insisted originally on the abstract of the old and the building of a building new totally, but in the end it agreed the idea Gaudís on an unusual and also cheap reconstruction to. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The rent house Casa Batlló sketched Antoni Gaudí however not alone. </seg>
<seg id="15"> It collaborated at the same time with the architect Josep Maria Jujol. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Just on its tear board, the decoration for the representative dwelling of the reality owner and also the use of mosaics emerged was at the facade its idea. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> At the formation of the facade, also numerous further Bildner and artist cooperated however. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The joint work at the designs for the Casa Batlló was the start of a fruitful collaboration of Jujola and Gaudí. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So Jujol was involved also in the building of Gaudís house Casa Milá in the park Güell, in which also further works of Antoni Gaudí are. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Already shortly after its completion, the house got of because of the local inhabitants of its organic forms the nickname "bone house." </seg>
<seg id="21"> Other again named it the special window opening mechanism because of the "yawning house." </seg>
<seg id="22"> One says would be represented also, very above on the building the sword of the holy Georg, the patron of Katalonien. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But also further sculptural elements symbolize concealed religious subjects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Gaudí sketched a headquarters heating system unique for the at that time time with ventilation canals and typical fireplaces for the house. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Somewhat bizarre seems its 45-Grad-Neigung 45-Grad-Neigung degrees of 45-Grad-Neigung inclination already. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Gaudí ignored in its creating consistently all at that time building directions and let itself shake in no way by this. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before building start, it overtook were to be sure of the city the corresponding building permit however the details made by it about the planned reconstruction so vaguely that the city fathers were two years later in the completion so appalled of the result, that they demanded remedy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The aldermen knocked themselves among other things also that the building with its pillars interfered even in the public sidewalk. </seg>
<seg id="29"> To changes, it came to be sure no longer, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the request of relating to this the quarter placed Josep Batlló a proposal to the permission of the rental both highly lain floors of the house - and it became it promptly given. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The home owner herself took in into the lower floors. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In the gallery on the 2nd floor a company drawing-room was found, on the third floor itself the bedrooms and private room of the dwelling. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The ground floor was leased at a jeweler business. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The entire sechsstöckige building passes through a stairway until up to the roof terrace. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Through the basic elements of the reconstruction, all right angles and straight lines were removed and were replaced by bent and swung walls. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Gaudí worked however also with a modern draft to the mutual connection of rooms. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The social part can be connected through the opening of the drawing-room doors totally and so a larger company comfortably was able to chat without having to forgo in more confidential conversations a certain intimacy. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="1"> The correct mattress and the bed rust correct? Women have other wishes as men </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Not the craziest bed frame, but rather the quality of the couch area - therefore mattress and rust settle the good bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> These harmoniously must supplement itself to be sure in order to become the wishing of the concrete user just. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In the selection, many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and not finally also the sex of the sleeper. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Also the interior, in which mattress and rust have to subordinate themselves, is just as important. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a chateau, in which regularly heated becomes not, latex mattresses are not suited well because they more long need much in order to become" "warm. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition they are clearly heavier than an usual polyurethane mattress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And - it regularly should be turned. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If they have namely not enough ventilation tubule in the kernel and lie yet in addition on a firm disk, staut itself moisture on: It is not excluded therefore that under its mold forms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the choice, naturally also a roll plays at which one is accustomed. </seg>
<seg id="12"> He who longer time was abroad where very high mattresses with soft layer are usual, will be able to become accustomed heavily to a low mattress with hard surface. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "Probably all ice hockey players who returned out of the NHL burdened themselves with me that they can" correctly sleep here no longer. </seg>
<seg id="14"> "For its worked very hard shoulders, heel and hips need it simply a soft layer out of Visco foam (memory Foam - a Formgedächtnis-Polymer)." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Recommend I "this among other things also diabetic person, who suffer from an interference of the nervous system, so that it the" information" out of the joints and the skin badly receive can," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, that specializes in cushion furniture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Therefore I provided already years ago many ice hockey players, but also other customer this mattress with Visco foam (memory Foam). </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Today this is no more problem, for such mattress the manufacturers offer among other things Tempur, the Italian firm Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico at." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And one doesn't have to be unconditional a famous ice hockey player in order to learn appreciate the advantages of the Visco foam. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" functions actually very simply. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The foam optimalisiert its hardness and corresponding to form that absorbed said warmth, differently, it schmiegt itself regular at the warm body on. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Nowhere it does not press rolls itself, in which night one around like after a heavy battle. </seg>
<seg id="22"> One sleeps simply much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The viskoelastische foam offers in addition also protection from Dekubitus (wound fire). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In the choice of the mattress size, one should add to the height still the length of the sole, therefore ca. 21 to 34 cm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Man such as woman, who are large at the 180 cm, need such a 210 bed long until 220 cm. </seg>
<seg id="26"> At least 90 cm of couch width should be available everyone the sleepers, together therefore 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In single beds, for example with singles, are mounted 120 to 140 cm. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Because of the comfort and also for possible visitors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If one on the back lies, should yet enough place for the easy angewinkelten arms be," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the guild master of the upholsterers and room outfitter, that already for years the problematic nature of the healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture dedicates itself and lectures this subject also on vocational schools. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> In a double bed needs pay attention are also high every one own rust and its own mattress, but in the purchase, therewith the mattress. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise does nothing remain other when the rust to mount in different height and that is by far possible in every bed frame. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Foam mattresses should be high at least 14 cm, should fall mattress with feather skeleton 15 cm, therefrom at least three centimeters to the form layer and the fine cushion. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "By hand or in the sitting may one the cushioning under no circumstances sense," warns Helena Prokopová. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Each mattress makes a special rust type required. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Entire cushions beds with mattress and document such as grown together Siamzwillinge have nothing to seek in the bedroom. </seg>
<seg id="36"> These mattresses cannot be ventilated and cannot wash the reference one, what is today already perfectly acceptable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And there one in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, is clear that the mattress becomes after five to seven years slowly a gigantic (and clogged sieve). </seg>
<seg id="38"> Also therefore specialists reject advertising slogans, that promise a service life of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee in mattress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Each thing has its if and however. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And therefore a practical advice of the dealers: In mattress of 120 or 140 cm widths one should not shun the hygiene of the washable, deductible references, nevertheless it recommends itself to use a mattress cover, that one easily can draw-off and wash. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Also if today as a rule mattress references with all around zipper are produced, so that one gets two halves after the opening (immensely important to the wash process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, above all alone carried out, requests often like the unequal battle between David and Goliath on. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> Do they have a firm disk in bed instead of a rust? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Out therewith! </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Also so they should equip the disk rather with ventilation holes (as far as already no inside are) and mattress with feather skeleton and 15 cm least height with so-called. Use pocket feather kernel and fine cushion. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such one document. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For not adjustable slat rust with 14 to 18 feather strips (Lamellen), latex mattress or sandwich mattresses are suited (where appropriate also combinations of latex and Kokos), always pay itself at the same time rust with a larger slat amount, therefore by 28 and more feather strips from to regulate with Lordosenstütze in the lumbar vertebra area and the possibility, the slat hardness. </seg>
<seg id="48"> On adjustable Lamellenroste, no mattresses with feather skeleton belong because they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Next to the attitude the stiff of the feather strips also special flexible shoulder modules are offered. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Herewith it concerns a special reinforcement of the feather strips, that enables it to imprint the feather strips or quite so to verwinkeln that they enable that at particular points sinking of the shoulder of the sleeper. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Nominally for men with wide shoulders an important thing. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There is even mattress manufacturer who began to use mattress" soft zones with "gentleman for the shoulder area. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Also at the ladies is thought - them grants one these soft zones in the Hüftgegend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For most demanding customers, point elastic wing feather systems (Lattoflex) or rust with point elastic contact Pads are with so-called. Multitorsionsfederung determines. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure is distributed among several points by what means the tension diminishes itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But - if one uses a bad (too large and portly) pillow to the correct mattress and correct rust, most advantages get lost again. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Also here a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, should pass its tip only to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Ideally a 50 x appears therefore 60 cm of large pillow how it for example the scandinavian like. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In the side situation, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Our modern mattresses have have something with the former (with hay of filled) straw sacks yet meanly. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern manufacturers use always more frequently natural materials or at least its additions. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Also in mattress, the new magic word is named "organic." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of petroleum raw materials, one uses to the manufacture of polyurethane foams of always frequent naturelle oils - for example castor bean oil and soya bean oil. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soya bean is used probably of all well known manufacturers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> "Organic is named in mattress, the origin purely natural its kernel out of materials exists," explains Petr by the firm Tropico plus. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Nature materials are used however also in the manufacture of mattress references - one of the first was there Aloe Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> One can grant himself however also Mikrokapseln, that spread fresh forest aroma or lavender aroma in the sleep. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Also here one makes a difference between man and woman. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While at the men a "cooling" plant extract is used out of birch leaf, so that the mattress reference can absorb the warmth and can cool off the body, have the references for women "warming" effect. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Extract out of red peppers of lively the blood circulation on, that weaker sex becomes in the sleep therefore comfortable warm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> And the current favorites? </seg>
<seg id="72"> Mattress out of cold foam (it has larger pore with destroyed cell structure and is therefore respiration more active than a standard practice polyurethane and also much more flexibly). </seg>
<seg id="73"> Through the combination the different stiff (hardness) of cold foams and Visco foams more emerge-zones-mattress that exactly know, where head, hip and heel are. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> For a high-value mattress, one has to shell out to be sure 7000 crowns and more. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Health mattresses are burdened however usually with slighter value-added tax because they count than medical remedies. </seg>
<seg id="76"> First Czech business became Gumotex this advantage given. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> One does not see is, to save at the mattress and at the rust so easy. </seg>
<seg id="78"> There and again there is special offer of manufacturers and dealers that offer two mattresses for the price of one. </seg>
<seg id="79"> So the brand Magniflex the mattress Duofreeze offers with in the reference verstepptem Visco foam memory for 11,990 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="80"> One gets the second free in addition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of the viskoelastischen foam materials with open cell structure and higher density in almost cosmic speed. </seg>
<seg id="82"> No wonder, were developed it yet for the NASA, for the astronauts are stopped in the starts enormous overburdenings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83"> Tempur is hardened itself in warmth soft, in cool milieu it again. </seg>
<seg id="84"> So it adapts itself the human body perfectly and distributes in optimal manner the body pressure. </seg>
<seg id="85"> It is therefore not only ideal to the prevention of pressure fire, but rather increases generally the sleep comfort. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86"> Viskoelastische foam materials become however not only in mattress, but rather also in other health products how for example in special foot cushions uses, that should provide the legs and the containers relief. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Domestic manufacturers use for example the foam materials Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The army has wrap up could hold so many ignition cords, that one entirely the Czech Republic you however only two years </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Czech army shopped become 445 kilometers of ignition cords, ignited become with explosive charges. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the previous year the defense ministry had delivered already 224 kilometers of ignition cord at the army warehouses. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is to be known already calming that the military forces provided from for 225 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The problem is only the durability of the ignition cords - two, at most however four years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The army bought the ignition cords of the corporation STV Group, a. s. for läppische 40 million crowns. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In its establishment for the purchase of this powerful quantity ignition cord the general staff MF DNES, the soldiers answered would consume annually ignition cord at the 60 kilometers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The investigations of Armeepyrotechnikern according to, the MF DNES on that addressed, goes out of this statement forth that the entire army would have to graduate annually an extremely intensive pyrotechnische education - of all generals and officers of the army command, up to the secretaries and cleaner. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Ministers of Defense Alexandr Vondra and army general Vlastimil Picek not excluded. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Only so the notable annual consumption of sixty kilometers ignition string could be justified half-way. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This length corresponds by the way 25,000 detonations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> But also so these army supply would pass for more than ten years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> If however yet the old rule counts of experts, that to the training of each new occupation soldier two meters of ignition cord suffice totally, the army created itself through these new purchases - also under the viewpoint of the increased requirement of the pioneer units and special units - a calming supply for the already mentioned 225 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> At the same time soldiers of the fast use brigade burdened himself recently at the Minister of Defense Vondra, they would have almost no patrons for hand firearms more so that shoot practices are restricted because of the missing means strongly. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the defense ministry establishes the purchase Hunderter kilometer of ignition cord therewith, the army would have stocked up so at least for ten years with this "ammunition." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Jan of the STV Group speaks however only about a four-year-old use duration of the ignition cords and police and Armeepyrotechniker quite only of two years. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "In perfect storage are well also the four mentioned years possible," clears one of them, that however anonymous remain wants in order to not to be accused as a soldier the criticism of the army. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> At the end of the use duration, each ammunition thoroughly must be tested whether it yet dependably is and does not endanger life of the soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="23"> These tests are however not for nothing, but rather cost further money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> A further argument of the defense ministry is the bulk discount for the 445 kilometers ignition cord. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "You cost us sixty percent fewer, than the last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," divides us speaker Pejšek the standpoint of the buyer of the defense ministry with. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Only to the comparison: The annual consumption of ignition string of Pyrotechnikern of the police, that ammunitions liquidate out of the second world war or the Soviet brother army, exceeds already some years long hardly 1,500 meters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> And the police orders always only such quantities of this ammunition that it can consume before flow of the use duration. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Already the security because of the Pyrotechniker, moreover one holds himself so the possibility to flexible purchases more modern and therefore also more dependably ignition cords openly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The defense ministry has anyway gigantic problems in the liquidation ten cable transmitter tons of ammunition out of times of the Resident of Warsaw of contract when the two hundred thousand headed Czechoslovakian people army prepared itself for its expedition to the Rhine. </seg>
<seg id="30"> According to the Pyrotechnikern, the MF DNES addressed, expected the Czech military forces into a couple of years of ignition cords older the same problem in the liquidation Hunderter kilometer, that has so "favorably" shopped it today. </seg>

<seg id="6"> "I can say, that this assessment not only me even, but rather also all my colleagues encourages and our self-confidence in the battle with the competition strengthened has," says the preceding year winner. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At the beginning of the company history of Farmet, the effort stood to do something useful. </seg>

<seg id="17"> We not naturally also were able to escape" "this situation. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "The revenues concerned 40 percent back, we must the production restrict and even to releases grasp," explains Karel </seg>
<seg id="19"> A viable business must seize sometimes also such unpopular measures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> It succeeded however to get the situation into the handle and to hold the firm in the black numbers, also if with slighter profits, than before the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="21"> With one, the business was not willing to make cuts - in the investments into the research and development. </seg>

<seg id="6"> The Gelatiere, in German somewhat ancient the ice confectioner, produces the cream after all rules of the Italian ice maker art. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Gelataio gets the ice cream with a Spachtel out of the cool counter, paints it into the waffle and sells it then. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In order to know that, one doesn't have to go to Anzola Dell' Emilia in the province Bologna. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But who yet more over ice do not know would like to come, that at the "Gelato University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani past. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 arranged the ice university so that the ice cream becomes that out of its machines everywhere high Italian ideal just. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The three-day mean course for future Gelatieri has the largest demand and visitor out of all world. </seg>
<seg id="12"> There are however also multi-day special courses all around the chocolate ice and practical courses in the company-internal ice hall. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Somebody dream in the Midlife Crisis of a new career, others venture themselves simply once on the smooth ice of its vague longings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> It are this time 40 participants out of 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Jacky, art teacher from California, the Slow-Food-movement loves and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial Ice Cream in the future. </seg>

<seg id="18"> A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in its bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because its children love Italian ice cream. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Maestro Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains first of all the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream to the participants. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Decisively not only good taste is, but rather also the silky pliability and the good consistency. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Luciano does not forget the creme hood of the national and generally southern superstructure in its training however also: "Italian Gelato is simple the best - and then is yet a lot of romanticism there." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first step to the manufacture seems very simply. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Luciano tips over the reason ingredients milk, creme, dried milk, sugar and stabilizers into a large mix device, that heats with an electronic program of all on 85 degrees and cools off then immediately on four degrees. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Then it loosens a rooster at the machine, and out a pasteurized white basis cream, base comes for all milk ice sorts. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Immediately the instructor with questions is stormed: Can one produce ice cream only with natural materials without stabilizer? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How can one let the own experiment desire free course? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Luciano warns before that let lead be mistaken of the zeitgeist in that. </seg>
<seg id="28"> He, who would speak of ice cream "only out of natural ingredients," used if possible nevertheless stabilizers - usually a nature product, about Guarkernmehl out of the Guarbohne. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Naturally one can produce ice also without stabilizer, only must sell become it then within one day, otherwise sackt it in itself together, and the customer bites on pure ice grain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Certain variations at the standards are permitted. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It becomes more exciting with the aromas. </seg>
<seg id="32"> For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano between the ingredients, that one buys in the fruit department or in the candies of the supermarket, distinguishes. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Moreover there are gives powder and paste. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "The suppliers will try everyone to turn on" you dozens of additions aromatized. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "But you should experiment" simply once. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Either in the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruits. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Or just in the ice cream out of the white standards, that becomes with eggs the yellow cream, and with cocoa powder to the base for all possible chocolates seductions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Now the course participants may at the ice machines. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano lets produce it respectively four different types of vanilla, chocolate produce, mocha produce and produce hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the standards, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additions. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Also the fruit ice sorts are subjected to the same experiment. </seg>
<seg id="41"> More aroma material, more fruit Püree - taste laughed is that not unconditionally better. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Hazelnut ice does not taste unconditionally nussiger if it contains more hazelnuts. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The most popular Kiwi ice produces the team, that uses more fruits, less water and somewhat less stabilizer. </seg>
<seg id="44"> First a well-balanced mixture lifts the taste of a Gelato really forth, says Luciano. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Ice manufacture is a math problem: If peach Püree with much sugar is used, the sugar share in the reason prescription must be diminished. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For lemon ice, an extra portion sugar is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano pulls a device forth, with that it the sugar content of the fruit sorts certainly (wine-grower measure therewith the Oechsle in the grape cider). </seg>
<seg id="48"> Luckily tables ease the calculate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> To make ice required no longer so much physical use such as earlier. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Not only the device for the automatic manufacture of the standards helps. </seg>
<seg id="51"> There simultaneously creamy is struck also a device, in that the finished ice mixture and cooled becomes on temperatures below freezing. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Small breakdowns do not stay away all automation to the defiance. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The Brazilian Gustavo bekleckert itself and its course colleagues from above until below with Fruchtpüree when it the oversized hand blender except inspection runs. </seg>
<seg id="54"> "In every course," means Maestro Luciano, "is it only a matter of time, until so something happens." </seg>

<seg id="8"> Let the Efsa directions be paragraph by paragraph word same with position paper the Ilsi and deceive therewith the handwriting of the industry that is supposed to be controlled actually by the authority in the Italian Parma. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Let it be already the second time that test biotech would criticize an interest collision. </seg>
<seg id="10"> So let a high-ranking Efsa manager be most young without levies or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and would have therewith the sides changed. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also the central german broadcast (MDR) had revealed recently personnel connections between controlling EU authority and industry lobby, what clairaudient made the environment federal bureau just as as EU parliamentarian. </seg>

<seg id="13"> Fall back on all serious data, also on such of the industry as long as they would be of high professional quality, is named it in an attitude. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Of the experts, who work for Efsa do not demand that they have no contacts to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="15"> They would have to disclose this however. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Kuiper clears its work for that internationally Life Sciences institutes (Ilsi) in the USA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This designates itself as a neutral forum for experts out of science, industry and politics - among other things to the risk estimation for biotechnology without lobby order. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In the thing, independent experts such as Then criticize that genetically changed plants are allowed presently with no feeding attempt with animals and the reaction would not be tested by gene plants on environment influences. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We want to know, what for example genetically changed corn on the field makes," says Then. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Let it be the present practice to not to test solely isolated proteins, but the entire gene plant, what would deliver no reliable results. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Does "if one not seek the risks, how one should find" it then?, asks Then accusing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> That sees also Angelika Hilbeck so. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The scientist has searched since 1994 in genetic engineering and is presently at the technical university Zurich active. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The industry tries on this zone such as in the USA also in Europe now more and more to influence or to discredit critical scientists. </seg>
<seg id="25"> There is therefore hardly yet researcher who would not be entangled with groups. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Studies critical for business not as a rule would be published. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "The industry controls the security research," maintains Hilbeck. </seg>

<seg id="5"> Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced this on Wednesday. </seg>

<seg id="12"> On the trip through the mangrove swamps gotten through by river courses, the entire size of the devastation becomes obvious. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Broth brown instead of bright water wühlt the motorboat up, who immerses its hand into the water, extracts oily fingers. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The roots of the mangrove trees jut like black licorice poles out of the ground, sadly let hang isolated palms trees to be found its fronds. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Bird swarm how they are usual otherwise in wetlands, seeks forgive one: As soon as the Außenborder is quiet, ghostly quiet spreads out in the paradise smelling earlier like a gas station. </seg>
<seg id="16"> "What here happens, is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari darkly: "We live in permanent danger for the health." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The war comparisons is mounted. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The settlement zone of the Ogoni is a battlefield fought over since decades: Here the first Explorateure screwed in had to adjust themselves before more from Europe, here than 60 years organized in the 80er-Jahren with the later executed author Ken Saro Wiwa the first resistance, here the Shell groups 1993 its production because it became for its oil worker too dangerous. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Yet today the return is forbidden the business after Ogoniland: While out of the entire delta region by the triple size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling sources and 7000 kilometer pipings are pumped daily more than two million casks of the black gold, the oil fields in the Ogoniland lie broke, is too unstabile the group the situation. </seg>
<seg id="20"> All couples of hundred meter jut steel stands such as bizarre sculptures out of the water: "Christmas tree" are named the heads of the drilling holes much too tender. </seg>
<seg id="21"> They are corroded up to 50 years old, that to the quick. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Again and again would break such a drilling head apart, means Akpobari, then groove a constant current crude oil into the water. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> More than two billion liters flowed after expert estimations in 50 years into the ecosystem of the delta: Year for year the quantity of oil, like it in the loss by sea of the super tanker "Exxon Valdez" into the sea before Alaska 21 years ago penetrated - one of the largest environment catastrophes in the story of humanity. </seg>

<seg id="25"> While the Shell group responsibly makes sabotage and the organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the soiling, conservationists see bursting drilling heads and would lick pipelines as a head cause. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Shell puts lower security standards in Nigeria substantially at than otherwise in the world usually, threw the US scientist Richard Steiner the group 2008 before: Alone let the rate of defects at the directions be "around a multiple higher than elsewhere." </seg>

<seg id="27"> At a place, that looks from a distance like a left, oil smeared workshop under free sky, shapes emerge out of the mangroves: They are stark naked and to the neck oil smeared. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Under one of the many casks, that connected partly with tubes to settle partly arbitrarily scattered on the terrain are, flickers a fire: an illegal small refinery. </seg>
<seg id="29"> In the cask, the crude oil is heated over the fire several hours long, explained Michael, the boss of the group. </seg>
<seg id="30"> First gasoline penetrates drips through the pipes into the catch pot, later at the end of the direction kerosene and in the end diesel out. </seg>
<seg id="31"> So Michael and four colleagues produce daily 300 liters up to four casks diesel à: "That brings us 34,000 Naira a" - approximately 22 dollar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel scarcity in the largest petroleum country of black Africa. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Nigeria controls only a single refinery. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The illegal cooks yet can underbid the diesel price laughably low with nearly 40 Euro cents per liter: They get for its raw material for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It comes of "Bunkerern," that tap the pipeline network diagonally through Ogoniland: In this manner at least 16 million liters get lost the country according to experts in the entire Niger delta daily crude oil. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Only a disappearing small part of the provisionally between stored raw material illegally will refine to be sure: Organized criminal networks, to which also politician and high-ranking military should belong, fill the lion's share, in tanker and sell it on the world market. </seg>

<seg id="37"> The debate, whether the environment catastrophe sooner that worried owed is the population or the lax production manner, considers the activist Akpobari to be purely academically. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Before almost two weeks, it had come in the Pike River mine near the city Greymouth to a violent explosion. </seg>
<seg id="5"> 29 miners in the age between 17 and 62 years were spilled under days. </seg>

<seg id="7"> On the basis of the high concentration of poisonous gases and more further following explosions, no rescue powers were able to climb down for safety reasons. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Does Splatter to the art movie theater fit? </seg>
<seg id="3"> The director Nicolas Winding Refn plumbs old genre boundaries with its fighter epic "Walhalla Rising" newly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At which audience may the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought when he turned "Walhalla Rising"? </seg>
<seg id="5"> A caught Viking warrior with only an eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself of its tormentors and puts its opponents with almost superhuman powers in rows around - sounds ideally for young masculine spectators in search of bloody Action just because our hero makes use of gladly furious killing methods and tears its enemies already once the Gedärme out of the living body if he has bad mood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On the other hand on eye says how it actually is named, the entire film over no word, and also the other figures let themselves at most once too on or two sentences or a couple of death scream agonizing carry away. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Otherwise is been quiet and indulged in the creepy beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, that offers the Viking world of about thousand years ago the scenery. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Ideally sooner for adult Cineasten with interest for existentialism and very quiet camera trips. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Beautifully, if a film has several target groups, damage only if they mutually exclude itself. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Director Winding Refn counts since its wild and gestylten Drogendealer trilogy "Pusher" as a type Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, refuses however stoic to make its works with somewhat more humor the Mainstream or somewhat less brutality the Arthouse accessibly. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Most art movie theaters friends would be allowed to deter let themselves of the brain mass injecting around and the Gedärmen. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Action fans die at the latest then before boredom if on eye breaks open out of freely interpretierbaren reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and festival sticks an eternity in recession and fog before the team arrives evidently in America and is quiet there further. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> No wonder therefore that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany found no movie theater distribution and appeared now only on DVD. </seg>
<seg id="14"> That is especially because of the grand pictures a lamentation, but also because behind the prätentiösen until bloody facades an at times exciting piece of movie theater hides itself, that earned something attention. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In this film, it does not concern is dialogues or a compelling action, it all atmosphere, a film become fever dream. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> And out of that, there is no escaping for the spectator. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Refn grants it hardly a moment of the relaxation and ties it with its icy pictures and the dark trance good Soundtrack very slowly the throats to, above all however with the inconceivable hate, that strikes it out of the hearts of the figures. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Only a small blond boy, who stands faithfully to the side to on eye, preserved be driven himself something akin to innocence, everyone others of wrath. </seg>
<seg id="19"> At the very most the one-eyed hero whose subjects never are explained, who becomes however for enemies and temporary ally sometime the warrior out of the hell, if possible to the ambassador of the devil himself. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The atom energy authority IAEA has new references to a secret nuclear program in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The country defends to take itself however, in addition position - yet lets it inspections to. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Against midnight of that 5th on the 6th of September 2007 at least four Israeli F attack-15 I military aircraft a mysterious, cubic building in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It stands at the bank of the Euphrates; the next larger city, 30 kilometer away, is Dair ace Saur. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Your name emerges in documents of the international atom energy authority (IAEA) if it concerns the reactor, that Syria nominally with aid from North Korea in the rectangular solid constructed has, hidden in a valley, that walks of the current. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a Briefing of the US foreign secret service CIA of the end of April 2008 the reactor familiar also under the name the near village el Kibar would have been well suitable, to produce plutonium - out of that construct let itself nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes on the other hand the technology is useful out of the fifties hardly. </seg>
<seg id="9"> A video presentation led the CIAS before with fuzzy satellite pictures. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Per computer animation, it faded in where which components of the reactor are supposed to have been before the destruction, that a reduced copy of the North Korean model would be out of the atom center Yongbyon. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Moreover it produced photos, that show the building out of the vicinity, or quite the inner rooms. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor would be stood shortly before the starting, was named it, but not yet with fuel rods equips been. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombardment, is became hardly more well known as at that time, yes the riddles gradually rather larger. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The earlier US President George W. Bush revealed most young in its memoirs that the CIAS quite certainly was themselves before the attack to be sure, that Syria in el Kibar constructed a reactor, but saw hardly criteria that there was in the country "an active nuclear weapon program." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Many secret-service agents in Europe are there rather yet more carefully and speak only about one "alleged reactor," also if they consider the CIA presentation to be "plausible." </seg>
<seg id="16"> Hard proofs are missing you, just as as the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Asked how certain it would be, to have a reactor before itself, answered a high UN diplomat in the summer only succinctly, the IAEA would have "enough material in order to ask" questions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Syrians created the debris of the alleged "unused military building" to be sure hurriedly aside and flattened the terrain thoroughly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Nevertheless an IAEA team found in June 2008 under the earlier chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el Kibar traces of uranium, that had been produced of people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Moreover the IAEA received be might over a member state of satellite pictures of supplier commercial out of the time directly after the attack, that statement strong as that of the CIA of presented. </seg>
<seg id="21"> To be sure these receptions not to are got on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - exclusively bought it. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The IAEA cannot verify therefore its authenticity independently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria always assured, operated never a secret atom program or to have constructed a reactor. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium comes of the Israeli weapons, explained Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Yet that rejected the IAEA after analysis of the particle as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then Damascus refuses to discuss about that - just as over the satellite pictures. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Moreover it forbids the inspectors a second inspection in el Kibar and the access to the ruins of the bombed building. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But also Israel is quiet iron. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We become that never comment on," strengthened most young the premier officiating at present the attack Ehud Olmert the official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> So the investigation drags the if since June 2008 futilely there and, like a high western diplomat at the seat of the IAEA in Vienna have accrued to "develops increasingly to a serious credibility problem for the authority" - in the end stands a heavy offence against the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in the room, over that the IAEA is awake itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As a key to progress in the clarification, the IAEA sees stand should evidently three further arrangements, that "in functional connection" with the presumed reactor - and unlike these yet exist. </seg>
<seg id="32"> At the same time the inspectors neither disclosed until now, still have around which plants it acts itself, which function it or what lets appear it suspicious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> After information of the southern German newspaper, they are designated in the IAEA internal as a Marj ace sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, diverted again by nearly lain cities. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent institute for Science and internationally Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and foundly made a building complex on satellite pictures in Masyaf, suspect concerns in that it most likely one of that objects. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It is possibly in or directly next to a military base - exactly with this establishment forbids Syria of the IAEA the access to the three places. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In Vienna, it is named feared, that Syrians a fishing sending - that the IAEA of the USA before adept would become, around military plants auszuspähen. </seg>
<seg id="37"> For the nuclear detectives had become through a tip of the US secret services on the arrangements attentive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has references, under that satellite photos that between the three places and the rectangular solid at the Euphrates material was transported here there and. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A high western diplomat in Vienna said, could stand at least one of the plants "in context with the fuel production." </seg>
<seg id="40"> There is however "no references to sensitive activities," therefore uranium enrichment or again reconditioning; processes that are necessary to the building of nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The reactor type is operated to be sure with uranium, that is not enriched. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Yet where the uranium should have come and detached become should where from that later the plutonium for the bomb, gives to these central questions it in any case plausible suppositions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> Unclearly is also whether ruins that could rescue valuable traces, at which three places stored became. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As the hundreds of lorry-loads of the ground would have disappeared, wants to have no one information about that where the debris remained. </seg>
<seg id="45"> That only a salt mine lain few kilometer by el Kibar on the other side the Euphrates al Tibni, that examined Syria 1998 on its fitness as a warehouse for radioactive rubbish, the IAEA counts as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The earlier IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had connected it most young an analysis of satellite pictures for the renowned magazine Jane's it Intelligence Review with the reactor in. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Receptions out of the orbit show suspect undertook however, that Syria at the three places earth works and removed large containers after the IAEA accesses had demanded. </seg>
<seg id="48"> That can be chance, contributed however hardly in addition to clear the suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Moreover it is named in diplomat circle, had used the IAEA some months on that to develop a plan for inspections there, that it should permit Syria to preserve contingent military secrets - alone the expense shows how large the interest of the inspectors is. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Meanwhile, Damascus ironed also this suggestion off. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> If western diplomats in Vienna had soothed yet a year ago, would be destroyed the reactor yes, would have therefore the thing no high urgency, brings about US ambassador special inspections so-called Glyn Davies since a couple months into the game, one of the sharpest means that the Viennese has atom authority in order to put through inspections. </seg>
<seg id="52"> IAEA boss Yukiya Amano that these inspections would have to propose has openly am" spoken to be sure already about "an option, for that I in the future, hesitates yet however he. </seg>
<seg id="53"> A high risk in this way lies: To the one, it needs for that a majority in the governor advice of the IAEA, and some of the countries represented 35 there are anything but eager on an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> To the other like a diplomat to consider gives: "What is if they find" at the end nothing at all? </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Since Angelina Jolie in the summer with the work began at its yet nameless administration debut, there is annoyance. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The script wrote it itself, a love story between a woman out of Bosnia and a Serbian man. </seg>
<seg id="4"> One does not know much more about that - however already that passes for unrest. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Stubbornly the rumor, the woman, a Moslem holds itself, would fall in love during the Yugoslavia war in its Serbian rapist. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Bosnian woman associations protested immediately whereupon some days of shooting planned in Sarajevo were transferred short-termed to Hungary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In the meantime the film in Hungary is turned off and in the postal service production, but it still is protested in Bosnia. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Bakira Hasecic of the organization of feminine war victims wrote over the UN fugitive relief agency UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, reported a Bosnian newspaper now - Jolie is even ambassador of the UN fugitive relief agency. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Diplomatically it is not - it offered weeks ago already once a meeting in Hungary, what that rejected however to the women. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic. </seg>
<seg id="11"> There had not been would betray love stories in rape camps, and Jolies bearing vis-à-vis the victims its enough over the script. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Your organization recommended according to the UN fugitive relief agency to released Jolie as an ambassador, reports the Guardian. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> What did exactly however Jolie write for scenes? </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Bosnian culture ministry that got to read its script gave after some back and forth a trick permission for Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come then nevertheless. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The boy author herself assures, she pursues no political intentions with its film, had gotten used to the work with much effort into the Yugoslavia conflict, wanted show the terrible consequences of the war and give all involved sides a voice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In the contents, it remains to be sure vague. </seg>
<seg id="17"> So another second Synopsis to the film in the network that sounds then yet rather differently circulates: The loving knew themselves therein already before outbreak of war and meet again when it, a Bosnian Moslem is displaced, into a Serbian camp, in which it works as a watch. </seg>
<seg id="18"> What yet considerably differently "rape victim verknallt sounds itself as the variant in torture servant." </seg>
<seg id="19"> That Jolies film begins actually already before the war - so much is certain. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Let the pressure on it, so Jolie, be "unfair and is based on misinformation." </seg>
<seg id="21"> Now can provide its probably only the hackers of Hollywood peace: In that they place the script, how already so many before, illegally into the network. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The demokatrische routine </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The democracy movement in Latin America becomes stronger, so like the support of private businesses. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Crime is a larger problem than unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is larger than that of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="5"> To these results, the Latinobarómetro survey, that was carried out in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist, came. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This survey regularly is carried out since 1995 and shows so the opinion change in this region up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two facts fall in this year's survey of the September and October especially in it eye. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First the good mood in Latin America </seg>
<seg id="9"> And secondly the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In numerous countries at the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement strongly increased (s. table 1). </seg>
<seg id="11"> In Peru for example where the economy since 2002 annually around ca. 6% are awake, climbed the number of the democracy advocates of 40% in 2005 on 61% this year. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Also in Mexico where the economy recovers since the strong break-in in the last year again, is to be recognized such a trend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Yet only the half of the questioned in Mexico and Brazil, the population richest countries of the region, are convinced democrats, what the regional average sinks (s. charts 2). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Ca. 44% of the questioned explained that they are satisfied with the democratic practice of its country. Those are soviele such as in the last year, however 25% more than in 2001 (charts 3). </seg>
<seg id="15"> About 34% trust to the congress of its country and 45% of its government. Both values correspond which the last year, show however a clear climb vis-à-vis 2003, (17% and/or 24%). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> A decade ago economic crises undermined Latin America the efforts toward more democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> That this also during the world economic crisis lasted, lies possibly that the countries of Latin America recovered only a short recession phase of experienced and quickly again. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition the arms were caught through a stronger social network. </seg>
<seg id="19">  (According to reports of the UN economy commission for Latin America of this week climbed 2009 the poverty rate in Latin America only negligibly on and is this year again around 32% please). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Yet of country by land there are strong mood differences (s. charts 4). </seg>
<seg id="21"> Economy strong Brazil and the popularity of the separating Präsidenten Luiz Inácio Lula there Silva is reflected in a common Fortschrittsdenken. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In Mexico and Central America where the recession more strongly noticeably was and increased violent crime, is this fewer the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> First for the second time since survey start, many questioned in Latin America in the crime in its country see a larger problem than in unemployment (s. charts 5). </seg>
<seg id="24"> Ca. 31% state that either it itself or a member of the family in the last year became victim of a crime. Yet vis-à-vis 38% in the last year, the values sank and have reached therefore the lowest state for 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The increasing economic performance reflects itself in the stronger support of that privately and the market economy against: ca. 71% of the questioned nationally gave on that the private economy is inevitable for the development, in 2007 were it 56% (s. charts 6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> Ca. 58% explained that only the market economy can bring its country progress, compared to 47% in the last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly enough this view retained 62% of the questioned in Venezuela (and 80% are for a private economy) although its left president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private businesses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil has had according to 19% of the questioned (18% in the last year) the largest weight in the region, followed of the United States (9%, unchanged for last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% in the last year). </seg>
<seg id="29"> The questioned in Mexico and most countries Central Americas on the other hand see the most influential country in the USA whereby this roll in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua is received by Venezuela. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Secretly into the middle </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the weeks after the sudden death of your man, president, Cristina Fernández, learned Argentina a wave of sympathy that drove its popularity rate around 20 points on more than 50% towards the top. That is the highest value since its choice in the year 2007. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Whether it this helps however in the next year to a re-election, depends therefrom whether the evidently mourning Cristina Fernández willing to compromise is than its deceased husband, its predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The signs for that are not unambiguous. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Néstor Kirchner, that also after the choice of its wife the economic policy directed, set up frequently budgets, that the tax collections that did not consider economic growth and the inflation fully. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This permitted it the president couple to issue the extra revenue after own discretion. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On the paper, the Fernández government in the last year lost the majority in the congress. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Yet the opposition is divided and led Kirchners death after a heart attack on the 27th of October to further disputes. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some regime critics out of the rows of the reigning Peronisten stood behind Cristina Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Yet after chaotic sessions (with which a parliamentarian one of other into the face struck and other the government of the bribery accused), it did not succeed the congress to dismiss the household for 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I about that will not discuss," so the president. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The households 2010 applies now also to the next year by what means the president still has more opportunity to issue money after own discretion. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy runs be named: it probably becomes this year around up to 9% grow. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official inflation rate is z. Z. about 11.1%, but numerous private estimations - and wage demands of the labor unions - drive the value on almost 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner that 2003 received the office when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, explained growth and poverty fight to its main goal, and not the inflation decline. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It denied the collaboration with the IMF, tormented the private sector and cleaned the national institute for statistics and census INDEC, that thereupon the official inflation statistics schönte. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Can Fernández hit now a bulkier way? </seg>
<seg id="18"> It called the private economy and the labor union leaders to conversations. </seg>
<seg id="19"> According to and official statements raises in the next year are supposed to be limited to 18%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The high world market prices for Argentina agricultural products gave the economy a strong buoyancy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Yet the inflation undermined the growth spurt through a large Devaluation in the year 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Possibly Cristina Fernández would like to connect for this reason Argentina finance economic again to the remainder of the world. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The government encountered beginning of this year an agreement with security proprietors that had rejected the earlier debt funding of the country in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Now Fernández seems to press club on an agreement with the financiers out of the Paris, which it ca. $6.7 billion owes. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Kirchners had an examination through the IMF how other plotted rejected usually, always. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Yet in the last month, the Secretary of Commerce Amado Boudou announced that the fund will perform "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index. It looks so, as would be this the first step to the cleansing of the INDEC. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not well known whether Fernández will be politically active after termination of its tenure also without the support through its husband. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If yes, it requires in addition the support of the means layer that has chiefly enough of the Kirchnerismus. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the Argentinians return in March out of its summer vacation, becomes the wave of the Sympatie, that was offered it, faded away be. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If she would like to win a further choice, she must decide whether she quietly cancels many political decisions of its man still and. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> What does Taiwan of its large brother hold on the far side of the strait? </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the 27th of November, those opened are themselves more than 7.5 Mio voters, 70% of all entitled to vote, in order to select in the five city districts mayor and Stadträte. This is appraised as a wide estimation of the Präsidenten Ma Ying jeou. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Through the construction of pioneering business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, is Ma itself a symbol figure for the relations to the mainland. Its politics persistently changed the relation to the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Ma existed the test, however only tightly. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Although its Kuomintang party (KMT) places three of the five mayors, it received no majority of votes. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Instead received the democratic progress party (DPP), the one larger independence of Taiwan advocates, almost 50% of the voices, the KMT received 45%. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In a presidential election, this would have meant for Ma problems. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Since its choice two years ago the percentage of votes of its party is around ca. Please 8%. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For the first time, the DPP took in even together with the KMT into the Stadträte. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> During the choice, it came to the incidents usual in Taiwan such as truck convoy with Krawallmachern, flags swinging measure moves and only sparse clothed dancers. </seg>
<seg id="13"> There was even the obligatory, mysterious murder attempt. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Sean Lien, that son of Lien Chan and honor chairperson of the KMT a speech held at the eve of the choice on a KMT candidate </seg>
<seg id="15"> As it a man out of the quantity into the face shot. Lien was wounded and a next spectator killed. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Bizarre manner is not clear whether the protection Lien wanted to kill or wanted to enclose a dispute with the candidate. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Independently therefrom the attack has according to Tsai Ing whom, whom leader of the DPP, who impairs choice and the DPP moved into a bad light, what gave the KMT more voices. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Possibly China was the largest winner of the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Remarkable manner was not brought up for discussion the relations to the mainland. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Instead the candidates debated social dwellings and the creation of jobs over plans to. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The Taiwanese of dear its factual independence and reject China military threat. </seg>
<seg id="22"> For this reason the KMT places its relations to the government in Beijing not gladly into the foreground. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Yet this time also the DPP avoided to stir up the anti Chinese feelings to very. </seg>
<seg id="24"> It reacted therewith to the new consciousness that Taiwan economy cannot survive without China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Ma for its part would like to be confirmed let that the majority of the Taiwanese advocates its China politics. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The government in Beijing will pursue further its strategy, Taiwan with economic stimuli into the partnership back attractive. </seg>
<seg id="27"> China sent immediately a negotiator after Taipeh in order to prepare a summit meeting to investment security and medical collaboration. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Certainly it wishes also a political integration. But the most important first. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It waits therewith rather until after the presidential elections 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The DPP newly invented itself in the meantime. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Two years ago it strongly was weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui bian sat because of corruption in the prison. </seg>
<seg id="32"> During its presidency of 2000 to 2008, it entered vehemently for the absolute independence. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Yet under Tais regency, a new generation of moderated politicians and the DPP developed fights around the voices of the employed and the youth. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Tsai found large approval as a presidency candidate of the DPP, like Su Tseng chang under Chen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Your party does now all in order to show that also it is in a position to construct narrow relations to Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Tsai plans an idea smith as a contact point between the DPP and China. This prefaces however unprejudiced discussions. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Tsai explained publicly that its party would offer a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas of hasty approach at China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Chen seems annoys over this change very. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Of its cell out of it, that candidates of the DPP done would have better on that, explained to insist on Taiwan independence. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It requested the pragmatist Su even to forgo the presidency candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Also without Chens interference, the DPP has trouble to select its possible candidate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The KMT will have to subject itself an own even analysis. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Mas values are bad, in spite of the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead its campaign without it. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The main reasons for its unpopular-ness seem to be unemployment and the always further scissors between arm and empire. </seg>
<seg id="45"> According to statements of a KMT speaker, he will be reshape cabinet as well as the local arrangements. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> In view of the fact that Spalding is since its album "Esperanza" 2008 in the jazz scene already a celebrated star, appears the nomination a few unusually.

<seg id="5"> Your ambitious album from the year 2010, "Chamber Music Society," is certainly a step forwards.

<seg id="1"> Arsen resistant microbe could new life forms on the earth or elsewhere enable </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The discovery of a strange bacterium type that can live among other things of Arsen opens new possibilities for new life forms on the earth and elsewhere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on the earth, it is in its opinion a sign, that a life also without that previously as absolutely essential considered elements possible is. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "This organism has two possibilities." </seg>
<seg id="5"> "It requires for growth either phosphorus or Arsen." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "That makes it to somewhat entirely special, although it almost a type 'strange' life form is," explained Paul C. W. Davies of the Arizonas State University and co-author of the report who will appear on Thursday in the online edition of the periodical to Science. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Previously six head elements became as absolutely essential observed - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Yet like the scientists found out, are awake the bacterium in the Californian Mono sheet also then yet further if it replaces phosphorus by Arsen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "There asks one itself yet, what otherwise is yet possible," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar of the Arizonas State University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestial life because scientists must recognize life and its forms, so Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study concerns itself with microbe, that were found on the earth. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were announced to the discovery, gave occasion to far common speculations on the Internet that the report could act life of extraterrestial by the discoveries. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "shows, that in other planet systems organisms by means of other elements biochemical processes in gear set can and that the 'standard elements', that according to our opinion absolutely absolutely essential are, not unconditionally firmly purported are," explained Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research institute of the open university of Milton Keynes in the united kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockel was not part of the research team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "This work is a novelty, for it shows, that in basic biochemical processes and structures an element through another replaced will can," joined Cockell thereto. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> This discovery was not accidental. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Felisa wolfs Simon of the Astrobiologischen institute of the NASA that led the study selected the Mono sheets based on the high Arsengehalts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Because Arsen and phosphorus chemically are similar themselves, it supposed that microbes that are stopped both can replace, possibly an element by the other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "The toxicity of the Arsens rests above all on that that it chemically similarly behaves like phosphorus." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "Through it it falls the organisms heavily to distinguish" an element from the other. </seg>
<seg id="22"> "But the difference is so large that Arsen functions differently as a phosphorus. It arrives smears into our biochemical system, where it more or less everything," explains Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers stopped the bacterium GFAJ-1 of an increasing Arsenkonzentration. It adapted itself and grew. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The microbe are awake to be sure in phosphorus better, but that it can survive also in Arsen, shows that an Arsen been based life form naturally can occur, either on the earth or on one of other planet or moon, on which Arsen more frequently occurs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> According to Jamie S. Foster, instructor for microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by Arsen, not newly. But previously there was yet no functioning example. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Arsen occurred in the early earth years more frequently, says it, therefore assumed the science that early life forms used it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> "That gives reason to the acceptance, that life itself also differently develops have can as in the early earth age," so forest that was not member in wolfs Simons research team. </seg>

<seg id="3"> A bankruptcy judge New York offiziel sanctioned "prepare" on Thursday that Gläuberplan in order to delete the guilt in height of $5 Mrd and to smooth the 86-year-old support business the way for new films and tv show. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In accordance with the statements of the Thursday, the plan fulfills the requests of the US bankruptcy law so that the new start of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, that founders of Spyglass Entertainment, does nothing stand more in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will project that something studio lost weight as a principal director. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The colleague number becomes of more than 400 on ca. 320 sunk. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For MGM, Chapter 11 steps actually not until power if JPMorgan Chase locked a planned loan of $500 Mio to the financing of the new MGM productions. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In the moment, a consortium of the investment bank that brings in itself $75 Mio leads, the business. The financing should stand until in the middle of December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order at the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management, that fought with interest payments in height of $300 Mio/years, to help in the solution of its financial problems. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In August the manager Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO with Enron and restructuring expert, that became by its activity in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts well known. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The efforts of Moelis & Cooper to solve the finance worries MGMs and to pay out the more than 140 Gläuber of the studio, lasted more long than expected. </seg>
<seg id="11"> After month-long discussions, the parties concluded end 2009 to offer the business to the purchase. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Yet the auction dressed only a few bidder and none wanted that of the creditors of demanded $2 Mrd pay. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In the spring these years all of ahead began when the MGM team began with the restructuring plan, that became signs after month-long debates and internal disputes the end of October finally of the creditors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> If MGM in the next weeks officially overcame the bankruptcy, Moelis and Cooper receive a bonus in height of several millions for its work dollar. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The share for Moelis & Co. that received already $1.2 Mio, amounts to itself on $9.5 million </seg>
<seg id="16"> Cooper, which for the direction of the business monthly $375,000 was paid, receive a "success bonus" of $4 millions </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Barber and Birnbaum plan to receive the production in MGM again. This year the studio brought out only a film and generated a year plan with seven or eight films that should come beginning 2012 into the movie theaters. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Furthermore they plan according to two films "the elevated bit" small in Co production with Warner Bros. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The studio requires in addition a separate loan between $265 Mio until $275 Mio for its financial share in both films that should emerge under the administration of Peter Jackson. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The investor Carl Icahn, that ca. 18% of the MGM loan financed has, tried a fusion of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment whose largest stockholder he is. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> This year's favorite under the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed of a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both player eggs can tear a considerable hole into your gift budget. </seg>
<seg id="3"> An iPad costs so much like five BMX wheels for $99, during the price for a Kinect game of about 10 classic jump rope or ca. 48 doses Play Doh corresponds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> But you can protect your gift budget. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Recently visited I in search of three electronics toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's IT Wholesale club. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Became immediately clear to me that bog law had stepped effective. This year the technology toys are more efficiently and cost simultaneously something less than in the last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> And although less new toys appear with own web page, Penguin, a wider offer is found on the best known of this type, Webkinz and club. </seg>
<seg id="8"> More and more button cells operated toys come on the market, and many contain again chargeable rechargeable batteries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Here some recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="10">  (If not differently indicated, are all prices of Toys "R" Us). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Sing-a-ma-hunt are (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) plush figures, so largely like guinea pig, that sing a note, if one presses on its belly. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Once press corresponds can play a note, through multiple pressing one a song. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Several Sing-a-ma-hunt sing in harmony. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Attention: If you began with the pressing once, you can stop no longer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> For a combination out of Gesand and dance, the Dance star Mickey (Fisher Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice. </seg>
<seg id="16"> On base that in the last year developed offers Elmo live technology the animatronische doll change game such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the novel hinge feet with wheel blockage controls it the Moon Walk. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. Your parents complained however about the missing volume control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> If you are a child of the 80, remember certainly Alphie, one of the first computerized trained toys. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Now it is again there (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with an entire pile question cards, with which a car trip can become a period, with a know-it-all with car correction function as a teacher. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> If you would not like to entrust your Smartphone gladly to your child, are here three independent alternative. </seg>
<seg id="21"> MobiGo of VTech ($60 for children of 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. The games contained on that are equipped is however not as instructive as that on the Leapster explorer ($70, for children by 3 to 12), that of revision first large after Leapfrogs of the Leapster row with a new, brighter screen. </seg>
<seg id="22"> None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> IXL of Fisher Price ($90 for children of 3 to 7) uses a system for the games and eBOOKS similarly iTunes, and thanks to the SD card drive, also family photos can be looked at on that. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In the end there is yet Scrabble Flash ($30 of Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not more largely than a match box and control an own LED screen. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In the game, it goes therefore to put together the blocks to words before the time expires. It is suitable magnificently for an improvised spell competition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> More and more toys have a type Online connection. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If one goes alone to the offer in the toy stores, Webkinz and club are Penguin the most important. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In order to give your child an Online animal in the club Penguin, you can buy for example a Disney club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match figure package ($5 for children of 6 to 12), contain the one coin with a secret code. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If you input the code Online, your child in the club Penguin Store sufficient Credits receives for two further parts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Roller-skate or a Puffle material animal can be that. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The newest head cell operated Mikroroboter, Hexbug nano ($10 for children from 5) is not larger than the head of your toothbrush. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The bug moves quickly on 12 vibrierenden silicone legs into each any direction. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> How senator announced Ensigns office, he was "highly delighted" over the judgment after the one-year investigation. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The ethics committee of the senate could impose however another Disziplarstrafe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> After statements of Ensigns lawyers, they were informed of the justice ministry about the fact that the investigations were adjusted against senator Ensign and that in this matter no further accusation exist. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The justice ministry did not want to express itself to the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The judgment was for many ethics lawyers outside of the justice ministry a surprise. According to your opinion there were sufficient proofs that Ensign neglected the Lobbying ban. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Interviews, e-mails and other documents, that openly were put for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times, gave occasion to the supposition that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of its choice helpers helped, to lucrative orders in order to buy its being quiet over an affaire with Hamptons wife Cynthia. </seg>

<seg id="11"> Ensign received to unite contact political friends in order to provide Hampton work. It received loudly the documents and interrogations for it after the attitude Hamptons lobby work. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Because Hampton was recently yet in Ensigns choice team, it was was allowed to receive it a year long no lobby work for its former employer or the entire senate. </seg>
<seg id="13"> According to statements of ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, that were closely friendly before the affaire, violated, the so-called ban of the revolving door Lobbykratie. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="14"> In accordance with the published indication ions "concerns it to all appearances an arrangement and around the offence against the revolving doors regulations," so Stanley fire, a Washington lawyer, who specialized in the defense of client, that stand in the visor of the government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> While the justice ministry officially rejected it, to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, said Mr. Fire and other ethics lawyers, the ministry would seem pursues became, including the decision in the past year, fall very carefully in the receiving of political accusations after a multitude of defeats, that of the media with large interest the accusation against the earlier senator Ted Stevens because of false behavior on the part of the district attorney to let. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> District attorneys "are obviously fearful," said Melanie Sloan, the chairperson of the union "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization, whose goal the fight of corruption in parliament circle and government circle of the USA is), a group of lawyers, the different accusation against Mr. Ensign before court brought has. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "That means basically, that superior government officials now therefrom go out can, that the laws for it do not count," joined it thereto. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Paul Coggins, head defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview, it had received on Monday a phone call of a district attorney and a further at the next day, in which it announced became, that the ministry would bring no charges against its client. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with the district attorneys in order to convince it that the senator repeated, how its office in an explanation on Wednesday again, "in agreement with the law acted" would have. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr. Coggins rejected it, the legal arguments, that it had proposed vis-à-vis the district attorneys, to explain more exact. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "Is not me well there to go into the conversation details between the justice ministry and me. Only so much would be said: We believe to have made the correct decision," said it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The federal choice commission concluded last month to adjust the ascertainments because of a separate complaint through the ethics group, after the payment one of $96,000 of Mr. Ensigns parents at the Hamptons against the federal choice law offended would have. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The choice commission said, there had not been enough proofs that the money had been something else as a gift. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> NV Energy, a large firm in Nevada that supported long time the senator was one of the firms, in whom Mr. Hampton thanks to the aid of Mr. Ensign lobbyist work found. </seg>
<seg id="25"> An e-mail from December 2008 covers that, after the firm Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist helped has, Mr. Ensings rod boss, John Lopez, a conference with Mr. Hampton had, in which it announced it, that it "would knock" at the Ministry of the Interior because of a thing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Mr. Ensign was moreover with Mr. Hampton and one of other customer out of Nevada, Allegiant Air, to the lunch arranges and asked the transportation minister to arrange a meeting in the name of the airline after these Mr. Hampton for the purpose of lobby work adjusted had. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="1"> Cheshire calling makes aware of Twitter </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A half dozen of them typed itself in the Krawallen in the courtoom away. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the minute tact, they sent over Twitter its reports on ghastly testimony. </seg>
<seg id="4"> At the end, so the defense,, there was more than 140,000 Twitter messages over the process around rape and at beds chained children in a house who rose in flames. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Thursday the process pursued attentively will become by Steven J. Hayes that was accused, three members a family out of Cheshire, Connecticut to have killed, an official end find if the sentence falls over the death sentence, that expressed the jury. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Yet Mr. Hayes lawyers submitted already proposals in court, that will represent reasons for a calling and that will busy the courts on years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Reasons provoking is one of that that that it so far spread through the intensive reporting over the process - also through the extensive use of Twitter through average reporter - to a "circus atmosphere" and one, immediate penetration of rebellious details come would be so that the jury in more inadmissibly manner had been influenced through the public indignation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This objection could cause the Appelationsgerichte to be concerned with the question whether the new technologies let become new rules in the courtoom necessary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "So like I it during this process experiences would be right, believe I, that it actual a danger is, if the entrance of the new technologies into the courtoom the of each single on a fair process influences," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes head defender. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the colonel supreme court, showed past week the proposals per decree shortly and conclusively back when he said, that the new media would become "carefully controlled," and that there would be no proof, that the jury had been driven of passions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Yet that was not with security yet the last word in this thing. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For decades court objections assessed that the reporting lets arise over famously notorious cases doubt about the fairness of a process. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In its historic decision of 1966, the colonel court of the United States canceled the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an Osteopathen out of Cleveland, that his wife should have killed, and said in its decision that there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtoom" because of the new media. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Many one believes that the TV series and the feature film is based "on the flight" on this crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some lawyers say, court objections, which Mr. Later observe Hayes convictions a half century, could follow the argument that new rules became necessary, around the communication ways out of the courtoom, that at present the if Dr. Sheppard yet unimaginable were, to regulate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "It gives a good reason, over the influence of the new media in processes, that of a wide public pursues become, disturbed to be," said John J. Donohue III, professor at the Stanford Law School, that the death penalty in Connecticut examined. According to its report it arbitrarily is imposed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor Donohue said, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea, more fairly could make that the restriction of an immediate communication out of the courtoom the processes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Twitter matter is only one of many, that the lawyers of Mr. Hayes represent in order to discuss on years and therefore a conviction out hesitant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defenders maintain for example also that Mr. Hayes already before convicted been be could when judge Blue had not permitted them to test the reactions of potential Juroren in that one showed them during the Jurorenauswahl ghastly crime scene photos. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some of the Juroren said, photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke Petit, 48 years, and its Tüchter, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, would have fulfilled it with abhorrence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defenders say, they would question argue also the constitution temperance of the death penalty constitution, and that the judge had exchanged falsely a Juror, that a critic of the district attorney's office had been, and that he would have exerted more inadmissibly manner pressure on the judgment, than he the unorthodox decision encountered had to place the jury over the weekend freely. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The Juroren were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Yet its arguments over the influence of the detailed reporting over the process the largest interest stretches perhaps on. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In a judgment attack, that submitted it past month, they assessed that the case had dominated the messages in Connecticut and was discussed during the campaign for the office of the governor and for the American senate of the candidates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They argued that the new media would have newly kindles continuously the flames of the emotions over the case. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "One every day press of the Medienpiepser, cameras and reporter outside of the courtoom," wrote the lawyers, "still has one previously in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide not yet experiences." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Your focal point on the reporting through Twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In interviews said some journalists, that the statement, these direct messages would be aufwieglerischer as reports, that are returned slower, a technology hostile view would be, that would become impoverished the reporting over future processes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Yet some lawyers said, Appelationsgerichte would be confronted often with the argument, social and technical variations needed the Adaptation through the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr. Hayers lawyers reinforce this statement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In its objection, they had references to the decision of the colonel court of 1966, in which the conviction was canceled by Dr. Sheppard based on the reporting, and made clearly that the new media require new rules. </seg>
<seg id="32"> "These cases," wrote it, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century." </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> After a campaign at insult words and negativity, this week broke out little courtesy in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Is it that grandmas of a real bipartisan cooperation or a moment of the illusion before one returns quickly again to the battle of the parties in the capital? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The meeting on Tuesday between president Obama and tip of the congress brought itself no breakthrough in the large questions, with that one during that so-called. "Lame duck session," that session had to busy at the end of a government period, in which no more decisions are encountered. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After all that, what one hears, was to be reigned it neither a polite discussion between two different sides another notice of its divided responsibility, but rather sooner an empty episode one Punktesammelns party laughed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meeting of the deficit commission of the president on Wednesday likewise was civilized, in spite of which political differences that exist between the members further. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems to be clearly that a narrow interaction lets emerge over a period of months a mutual respect, that disguises the ideological crevice, that further the members separates from one another. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> That is hardly enough in order to maintain, would be opened a new era of the cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Both sides are now in a test phase - in that the one of the other sign of the cooperations and willingness to compromise calls for while one himself tries to weigh the boundaries of the public opinion and the patience of the voters after a renewed party warfare. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Therefore the meeting on Tuesday itself and its estimation were limited through the participants to a minimum at demands or accusation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the republicans are too large and too deep when that one could expect a fast change of the atmosphere, that prevailed in the past two years. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Equal whether it concerns taxes, contributions, health or Anwartschaften, both sides are removed for miles and miles from one another. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In the end the November choice agreed Washington at least for short time mild. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "No question, the intonation has itself changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government who works now for the "Ethics and Public Policy center." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "That is unavoidable after choices. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Choices awake party would laugh passions that die out again. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And that is well so." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In some questions, especially in which, that on the order of the day of the "lame session" duck stand, have republican and democrats hardly another choice to find when a solution." </seg>
<seg id="19"> Bushs tax declines end end of the year, and no one advocates that. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way, would receive around some or quite everyone too, would be it now temporary or durable. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Just as a compromise is to be expected regarding the increased unemployment compensations if also only, because the republicans cannot afford it, that one believes, the favored tax declines for the empires while they deny unemployed workers a support. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting on Tuesday in the white house the optimism climbed, duck ratify can himself that one in these questions during the "lame session" of some and simultaneously also the new START contract. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Yet William glass tone of the Brookings Insitution warns, duck lead must that a successful collaboration in urgent questions of the lame session" not compelling to a durable collaboration of the parties if the new 112th congress is convened in January. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead, so says it, is a phase of the disagreeing more probable, perhaps even indispensably. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "After the things, that done will must, done are, becomes this short-term psychology in confrontation turn over," said it. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="27"> "I see much, what of today at until 2012 happens, when before battle, or shadow-boxing, for the head event of 2012," said it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons for this have much with the presentation of the new republican majority in the white house to do and with the tea parties voters, who were serviceable its development. </seg>
<seg id="29"> How concerned the republican leaders like to be also about that, that they must know to highly poker, it, that they must try, its promises to sink the editions of the government and to set, to keep the health reform except power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> These party lines become already in the first reactions regarding the recommendations of the deficit commission clear, which include a tax reform and the raising of some taxes as well as the raising of the retirement age and the sinking of the country editions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> One of the most difficult jobs received the deputy chairpeople Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles in Washington and have, pressed in accordance with its own estimation, so very on that to set the deficit question on the public order of the day that these can be ignored no longer. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need within the commission of 14 the 18 voices in order to make its plan to the recommendation official and it fight very in order to come also only into the vicinity of this number. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The largest resistance is found in the selected representatives of the group because in finance questions, at least today, only little latitude or little sympathy is for compromises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the white house and the republicans in the congress. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The first battle will take place next year in the form of party collisions if the republicans Obama followed with respect to the country household, that demand taxes and the health system, later then of a phase of larger zweiparteilicher cooperation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What lead becomes to this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> The public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It is proved that, in spite of the bias of the current choice, that majority of the Americans yet always wishes for, that both parties together work. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If confrontation leads into a dead end, how it happened to 1995, both parties must pay attention painstakingly to the public reaction. </seg>
<seg id="40"> He, who is convicted also always for losing, will must change the course and seek the compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> That likes to be in the deed an optimistic visibility manner. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Bias and polarization are today larger than in the middle of the '1990's, and they seem a larger ideological crevice between Obama and the congresses republicans to its as at that time between President Bill Clinton and the republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Simultaneously the activists of both parties 2010 see as a pure prologue for a choice by far more long-range at consequence 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> So seen likes the courtesy, that is displayed this week, of many Americans welcomes become. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> "Every here loves Ta Mok." </seg>
<seg id="4"> "He was a good leader and he has herself around its people worried," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Because of its brutality during the Khmer rouge domination well known as "the butcher," remains the commander in this remote former Khmer rouge stronghold in the northwest Kambodschas popularly where he constructed hospitals and bridges, that infrastructure developed and yet always live where thousands of former soldiers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Yet this year, 12 years after the capitulation of the Khmer rouges vis-à-vis the government, long-time followers in Anlong Veng are demanded. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In April a local truth forum and reconciliation forum permitted the victims the public confrontation with the people that supported once the regime. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In June the government distributed a school book that for the first time children former soldiers tells the story of the Khmer rouges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And in July a partnership tribunal of the UN and Kambodschas convicted for the first time a former member of the Khmer rouges when it convicted the former boss of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better well known as a Duch, to 35 years prison. </seg>
<seg id="10"> With every of these developments, the anxiety grew under the Khmer rouge veteran Alnlong Vengs, impeded its efforts toward reconciliation and Reintegration into the company Kambodschas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "It gives yet always rejection and anxiety in the former Khmer rouges, but it have no power, anything to do," said Chhang Youk, leader of the documentation center of Kambodschas, an independent organization that investigates the regime. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "For it, life was glorious under the Khmer rouges, but the regime became" a symbol of the squall. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "It splits even families." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> During the Khmer rouge domination in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, 1.7 million people were executed approximately or died it at illnesses, revision or before hunger. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When the Vietnamese occurred and 1979 fell the poles Pot Ied government, the remnants of the regime implored and be military at the boundary Kambodschas to Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Here they spread until December 1998 when the last movement capitulated, unrest. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="17"> As a pole Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary the guerilla war of its basis in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia led, pulled Ta Mok the next generation in Anlong Veng up to. </seg>
<seg id="18"> But middle of the '1990's when a peace agreement 1993 promoted by the UN led to the first democratic choices of the country to overflow began large groups of Khmer rouge fighters, to the government, what led to the capitulations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998. </seg>

<seg id="20"> It died 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh where it waited for its process. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> When its patrons more long protected it no longer, most former Khmer rouges fighters fled retained the movement in nostalgic memory into the wearing down poverty of the rural Kambodschas and many. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Also if some retained few elitist officials of the Khmer rouges its local government posts, because they laid down its weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> "These people have only very few of the capitulation profits," said Sok Leang of the center for justice and reconciliation, that holds throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng, public forums </seg>
<seg id="24"> "You are anchored into the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime." </seg>
<seg id="25"> "You grew without each occupation white to." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> So Lim, 55 years, that 1974 had joined as a teenager of the Rhmer rouges, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he established himself 1998 in order to lead a life as a poor rice farmer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> "Life under the Khmer rouges was good," said it. </seg>
<seg id="28"> "Ta Mok gave" everyone something to eat. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "But now life is heavy because we must" attend to us even. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The running Khmer rouge tribunal roused also here worries. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Beginning next year will try the court, Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife as well as Ieng Thirith, another earlier Khmer rouge minister to place before court. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The order of the court is not is said it that to convict old leader and that, that are responsible main for the horror deeds,, but it whether it will pursue over these four cases out further deeds. </seg>
<seg id="33"> That contributed few in addition to soften the anxieties in Anlong Veng. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Current medium speculations have on in the Chaem, 64 years, concentrated was, were was that during the Khmer rouge domination in the late '1970's district boss in the province Manteay Meanchey. </seg>

<seg id="37"> Shadow long as the sun on the withered grass threw off leaned it in the Chaem to discuss its past in the Khmer rouges. </seg>
<seg id="38"> If the court should summon it, she would refuse to go, said it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> "Cambodia lives in peace and in stability," said it. </seg>
<seg id="40"> There "were no more pursuits, war" would be here. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> Prime minister Hun Sen, that 1878 of the Khmer rouges is implored, warned moreover repeatedly before that that the situation would become unsteady, would accuse the court more suspect although experts and historian discuss this. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> "Cambodia must a hole dig and the past bury," said it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> But the confrontation with the past is that what must do Cambodia in order to be able to go forwards, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center. </seg>
<seg id="44"> "Reconciliation with the Khmer times means gathering of the broken pieces," said it. </seg>
<seg id="45"> "It is our duty to set these broken parts together so that how everything can" understand. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> The center created the first school book approved by the government over the Khmer rouges, the 75seitige "story of the democratic Cambodia." </seg>
<seg id="47"> It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as a supplement to the history book for the High School of the development ministry, that contains less than four sides over the Khmer rouges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> How often in Cambodia the young people in Anlong Veng know only few over the Khmer rouges, in spite of the connections of the city to the regime. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Touch Valeak, 19 years, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps the student to understand an important part of its story. </seg>

<seg id="1"> White Russia is therewith agreed, not further weapon capable uranium to collect </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a surprising victory for president Obamas campaign to the worldwide security of nuclear material, the government of White Russia announced on Wednesday that one will gather no longer more long highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The deal was announced in a joint Statement after a meeting of the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the white Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the security summit. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The US government had tried for years to convince White Russia, to gather no longer highly enriched uranium and seemed reached last spring a hurdle to have. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Yet official of the US government of told the washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreement with White Russia encountered became in order to remove from 187 pounds uranium weapon capable a white Russian research institute. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the remainder of the material - according to an official colleague, who remains based on the sensitivity of the subject anonymous, approximately 500 pounds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obamas, that had excluded White Russia to "nuclear security summit of the 47 nations" of the April. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And it was obvious good enough in order to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I really was enthused of the fact that they want" a seat in the nuclear security summit (of 2012). </seg>
<seg id="10"> "That proves me, that it functions," said Ken Luongo, president of the partnership of global security, a group to the support of the nuclear security. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Clinton named the agreement "a very important, important step" of White Russia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since then the US government helped six countries to become its highly enriched uranium loose. </seg>
<seg id="14"> White Russia will be the seventh. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A dozen of countries did it under the government of George W. Bush. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Präsident Alexander Lukashenko explained the white Russian to security summit nuclear at present by Obamas that the nation never will abandon its uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "How retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, what basic weapon capable is, and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko at that time. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "That is our raw material... We will make from that no dirty bombs and will sell we it no one." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We use is it exclusively for research purposes, that all." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> White Russia approached nevertheless a few months ago the USA on when it indicated interest in the meeting of an agreement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The first start to remove the uranium of White Russia in October, especially was complicated because the material easily had contaminated, say official. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It became loading, the more into a special train than 1,300 miles a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say official. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The second start was concluded on Monday and was carried out loudly the official per airplane. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The US government pays for these striving $ 14 million whereby a large part of the money flows into the white Russian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "This was extremely carefully coordinates and voted, around confidence to construct" that led to the agreement, which became signs of Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the energy ministry who works at the global danger reduction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The James Martin center for Nichtweiterzugebende studies appreciates that White Russia had this year at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen of uranium as well as hundreds of pound at highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="27"> White Russia wants to be dissolve according to the joint agreement warehouse until 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The relations between White Russia and the USA were for years tense, primarily because of Lukashenkos harsh disregards of the human rights. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But the Statement of the Wednesday suggests a possible approach. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> "The progress of these global matters of security welcome being named, announce the United States of America and White Russia, that an increased respect before the democracy and the human rights in White Russia a central subject in the improvement of the bilateral relations remains and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," explains it. </seg>

<seg id="3"> The responsibles of the old nursing home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave yesterday a press conference in which they laid out, which damage had added the criminal actions Joan Vila Dilmés - the caretaker, the person at least eleven old during its work, for which he was responsible, killed had - to the arrangement. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The leader of the old nursing home, Joan Sala, appeared in accompaniment of its lawyer, Joan Cañada, before court and announced, "La Caritat would like the responsible (for the deaths) accuse," but "the right and our liability duty force to suppose us in addition the process and the civil law liability." </seg>
<seg id="5"> The arrangement must accept not only a social loss of face because it had assessed the criminal actions of the caretaker not on time, but rather pay now also a high compensation sum, that is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime is due to August 2009 and that it had murdered since then further. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The judge arranged the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the old nursing home - because he assumed, that no physician personally had examined the deceased, but rather the formalities by telephone were completed based on its age and illnesses. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The investors of reacted yesterday sharply on the threat of the EZB Präsidenten Trichet, that warned, "the markets should our reaction fortune do not underestimate." </seg>
<seg id="3"> The risk impacts of the Euro Peripheriländer dramatically climbed and the shares of the European banks around more than 5%. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nevertheless we should not the possibility that the EZB can be mistaken and the Euro gained hardly at points, what causes to the worry, underestimate. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The events of yesterday are collapses recovered typically for an illiquiden market, that in the mass, in that it again, to be sure as a result of the closing shorter and highly speculative positions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The institutional investor will not lose yet long its anxiety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Today a month ago the European central bank requested us to make our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen annulled according to what the EZB must make tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably yet some times in the future, a backing down. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The German Federal Bank demanded the Beendung of the plan to the purchase of country guilt because these would be ineffectual, as well as the lifting of all extraordinary temporary liquidity measures. Only an one-week unlimited access should be retained it. </seg>
<seg id="9"> After the Ireland crisis, we expect that the present liquidity measures are extended "at least until March" and the quarterly announcements with unlimited access are retained at the end-of-quarter to the guarantee of the liquidity until at least June. </seg>
<seg id="10"> We expect also that the program is continued to the purchase of bond and a strengthening signal will issue. </seg>
<seg id="11"> If the created expectations are not fulfilled, are thrown back the excellent reaction of the markets of yesterday again and if halstarrig is persisted on that to turn back that we our liquidity measures, can help us only God! </seg>
<seg id="12"> Just as as in the EZB session in May, with which the bank strengthened to not to take the purchase of country guilt paper into consideration and the markets thereupon collapsed, could repeat itself this story tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The EZB must be trustworthy and persistent. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="15"> Yesterday the auction of one-year country title in Portugal was rather weak. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The national fortune administration issued only 500 million to 5.28%, vis-à-vis 750 million to 4.81% in the preceding auction. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Nevertheless the interests rates in Portugal fell around 30 basis points in the entire curve and reflected therewith a perception variation of the markets after the words Trichets against. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In Ireland, the numbers of the guilt hole were published of Allied and bank of Ireland. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The sum becomes on approximately 10 000 million short-termed and possible further 15,000 appreciated. There is time until February in order to procure private capital or these banks be nationalized. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Although Ireland lost its credibility totally, after it had not recognized the problem with the stress tests in July, the numbers in the frame of the rescue plan are acceptable and help to diminish the uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="21"> To be sure the government must receive the parliamentary approval to its new budget at the coming Tuesday. Because it does not control yet always the sufficient support, Ireland is also further a source of the uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Angela Merkel more moderately formed its discourse with regard to the summit of the heads of state and the government on the 14th of December. There political unit is asked in order to show that we play jointly that the same score. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries the ninth symphony Beethovens. </seg>

<seg id="25"> Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as in the financial institutions, dismantling of the country deficit, liberalization, denationalization and work procurement measures. Measures that sound in the ears of the investors such as Vivaldis four seasons. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange gained around 4.5 percent, twice as much like the remainder of the European stock exchanges. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In comparison with the February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincing, and we profit from the surprise effect. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Today there is an authoritative auction of a three-year government bond that will pull utility out of the Trichet effect. Therefore we set on a strong demand, that will remove all doubts about our debt funding capacity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> For Spain, the application of an auxiliary plan would be an even sacrifice. </seg>
<seg id="30"> We would receive liquidity, that we do not need. The treasury has 40 billions of Euro to the decree, three times so much like in March. The interests rates are extremely expensive and the access to the markets would become without notice closed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Nevertheless our strategy should correspond Cäsars woman to the motto: "Now not only that counts be, but rather also the certificate." </seg>

<seg id="2"> The general director of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility that it could come to a fusion wave of the savings banks and emphasized the speed with which the industry would be restructured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks existed not to participate on that in the first phase. They reserved themselves the second round. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand the general director of the Spanish savings bank association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round did not assure would take place. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "I believe that the largest part of the fusions is locked. The inclusion of Cajasol into the group Banca Cívica cannot be regarded as a second round, it concerned rather adaptations." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "The largest part is locked. It can be that we have in place of of siebzehen thirteen or fourteen, but all important processes already are completed. They were controlled of Banco de España that strongly supported all processes,." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In one of the association of the managers and manager breakfast of organized Aragoniens (ADEA) Olavarrieta carried out that the concentration process "as quickly as possible performed became and that we be satisfied must with the timely flow, that in earlier times, not now, in the frame of the business plans with Banco de España determined became," emphasized he. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> "The transition of 45 savings banks with 000 million fortune existence average 28 on 17 with ever 75 500 million a historically incomparable process is. The amount of the financial institutions was reduced around 62 percent and are have it now very much larger, wherewith we that Baseler come off fulfilled," lifted it forth. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Olavarrieta explained, "it would give a row unabgebrachter opinions over the slowness of the process, that Unseriösität and absurdity" revealed, for "Banco de España admonishes us to lock" within the specified time end of the year ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The general director of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain would have and supplemented one of the rigorousest financing systems of Europe and "perhaps" the entire world, that that that would do the anzweifeltenn this "without deeper knowledge." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Zapatero and the red line of Germany </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin decided on the Beibehalt of the Euros, but set up simultaneously conditions for the entire European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tensions on the markets released a double answer of the government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero produced new adaptations measures, begun in tax reductions for small business and small business, the regulation of temporary work business or the lifting of the 426 Euro support for the unemployed, that relate no unemployment compensation, up to the denationalization of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of the airports Barajas and el Prat as well as 30 percent of the national lottery. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand the deputy head of the government, Elena Salgado, supported swears to out would have the criticism of the chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible, that by means of the former district president Felipe González the present crisis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How are these processes to be understood? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It would be anticipated, is the Merkels position no mistake of its public work. </seg>
<seg id="8"> To the contrary, it concerns a new round in the difficult process of the new definition of the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> At the same time Germany takes in a basically new perspective to the formation of our future, that collides with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of a large part its partners. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In view of the resistances in Europe, one begins in Germany over three possible exits out of the crisis to spekuliern. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first: A strong Euro with Germany, Austria, that Netherlands and other countries while the south the Euro areas leave must. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The second: The reintroduction of the Germans mark - although that currently sooner after Science Fiction sounds -, supported of a large part of the public opinion, ca. 50 percent of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The third: A change of the Euros in accordance with German suggestions. That means: more macroeconomic inspection; household leadership would exert; punishment of the countries that infringe the specification; more possible wise the payment attitude of some countries as well as the expansion of the costs of potential adaptations measures on the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is unambiguous and has been outlined already for some time. Therefore there are now no excuses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First 2009 when both the IMF such as the European commission of stimuli created for deficits and the German government stretched a constitution reform out of the sleeve in order to prevent this from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> That was the first indication of the Auseinanderdriften between that, what held Germany essential (severe tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second sign set the Central European country when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to the rescue of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="18"> At that time that strongly was criticized. But fact is that the political consent in Germany that were public and the published opinion absolute against a rescue of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In the end Merkel comes out into the last October day on the new with an unambiguous position. It demands a reform of the come off of the European Union in order to enable the rescue of a country and to obligate simultaneously the private loan givers, to carry a part of the costs. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position was displayed as an antieuropäisch because it pushed the Ireland crisis and all following. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But its suggestion if also somewhat sweetens, was supposed. In the next months, we will participate at the reform of the European Union, that should enable these measures from 2013. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany pulled a red line, that thought to not to exceed it. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It says all that - also if now unpopular measures encountered will must - there will be the old functional method of the Euros from this appointment no longer. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The year of birth of a new currency room will be 2013, forced will can receive must, in which the counteracting countries hard are punished, in addition to explain itself insolvent and in this case the private sector a part of the costs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows hit must, with high Spar- and investment rates, moderation of the consumption, us, that we a hard growth rate improvement of the productivity and competitiveness as well as positive outside economic balances. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The other alternative, that is based upon indebtedness and building being with gigantic holes in the balance of payments, so how it was cited by Spain in Boomzeiten, simply will not be accepted. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would not do badly on that to understand it. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It goes not only therefore to drive down the country deficit to the year 2013 to three percent. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much harder. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the worst, what we could do under these conditions, is to be deceived us even. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the present turbulences pass over in more quiet. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And that we will use the possibilities that are offered to us, to the spring 2013. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero understood that also so, and its double announcement (the promised reforms after the discussion with the large firms at the past Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) shows on that there that in spite of the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis to create, order in the own house, its way prepared has itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But the line pulled red by Germany is there, and it does not look so that on that something would change. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Under the possibilities pulled in consideration, that is that we would have to leave the Euro areas fully plugged with little serious countries not to exclude. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In this case, Germany still could say us, it had warned us. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Sport and rule evasion </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Trick such as that of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax do not show invention spirit, but the will to go around a sanction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> That supposedly of two players the actually Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) instigated from end in the game of the 23rd of November against the Ajax in the champions League led in addition that much ink was spilt about that, whether it did not concern an unsportsmanlike action or and whether possibly both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA. </seg>
<seg id="4"> How generally well known is, a couple of minutes lost both player before playing (its team already unambiguously had won) time and played several fouls so that the arbitrator showed them the second yellow card. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this manner, and because that actually Madrid its group would cite, the prescribed sanction will fulfill both player in the next league game against the Auxerre and will get into so without cards into the next game phase. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the end the Disziplinarkommitee of the UEFA punished the trainer of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the involved players with different cash amounts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is no new practice, it is to be found sooner frequently in the world of the soccer. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It so far is spread that it is part of the ethic - the unwritten, but in this sport followed rules -. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of the arisen debate around the represented case is due on that that a team of the soccer club played actually Madrid (that in its hymns noble courage and honor purports and on other occasion its players for similar occurrences punished had) at the same time the leading role, and to the dramatization through Mourinho, that an episode added to its long story than a theatrical and provoking technician to more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case the debate revolves therefore whether this manner forbidden not specifically by the regulations contradicts the principles of the sport, that is, whether these actions represent a rule evasion. Actually this procedure complies with the regulations of the sport, seem to go around however its sense. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this matter, the damage caused the sport spirit should be examined. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sport spirit defended was the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect, that was not endangerd by these actions, for it no aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="13"> A further aspect of a clean game exists to avoid therein that the counteracting players pull an unjustified utility out of the against team. Also that did not happen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradoxical of the action of the player the actually Madrid is not that it does not correspond to that, what we understand normally under incorrect game or rule evasion, for the evasion of the rule secretly was performed in order to avoid a sanction, but rather it as noticeable as possible should be so that it is punished by the arbitrator. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players awaited and supposed the sanction joyful. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is, which type of advantage pulled the counteracting out of the intentional fouls. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Here should be emphasized, brought became became was that the rivals neither into a more unfavorable situation yet advantages for the played game erheischt, for the obvious result of this action that the own team must further play with less players. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is also no useful strategy for the next game, for the club does not control then these players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The advantage exists obviously therein that the players begin the next game phase of the champions League without cards, that could participate threaten hers in a future game. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it concerns a long-term advantage uncertain to a certain degree because the team could eliminate sometime also. Moreover the players with this procedure receive a sanction and go eliminating in the second card cycle over, in that it because of card accumulation with a card less than in the first cycle. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Therewith it is not so clear whether it concerns really an advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> In the end are not directed such procedures at the sport spirit, to which also strategic decisions belong in order to pull an utmost utility out of the directions. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case, the players wanted to go around wanted to select no sanction (that would be actual an unambiguous case of rule evasion), it sooner when they subject itself to this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They made a strategic decision without avoiding a punishment or to flee from its. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Although the boundary is smudged between creativity and rule environment, I believe that it concerns in this matter a clear case of creativity. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the polemics emerged as a result of of two factors: Because it concerned two same obstruction ends, and because of the type of the provoked rule transmission. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The damage, that was added by these actions to the principles of the sport, is less ethicaler than a rather aesthetic type. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> Interpol issues a red warning to the pursuit and up establishment of Assange. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> All, what holds together with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange,, forms a complicated maze, in whom the circumstances can be enlightened only hard. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Yesterday Interpol abandoned a "red warning" to that "establishment and pursuit" of Assange from. </seg>
<seg id="6"> To be sure it does not concern at the same time a traditional arrangement to the arrest. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Moreover it is not comes new, it of the 20th of November. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It has also nothing with the last uncovering of more than four million diplomatic documents out of the USA to do, but rather with the accusations of sexual abuse, which the Australian must stand in Sweden. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Furthermore the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, mark Stephens, assures would know "the police where and like it contact with Mr. Assange could" receive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Already on that 20th the international police authority with seat in Lyon (France) issued the arrangement on proposal of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday upon receipt of the authority through the Swedish authorities. </seg>
<seg id="11"> So the things lie. The 188 Interpol countries are directed to identify and to discover Assange, "around it provisionally to arrest and to deliver." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Although Interpol cannot arrange the arrest of an individual concerned by a red warning, many member nations regard after statements of the organization the red warning as a license for an Arrestierung - that of the national police carried out will must - especially if they control a bilateral extradition agreement, how it is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange probably stays. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The action outraged Assanges lawyers who published gestures a letter, in which they informed about the fact, that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer per video conference the questions of the Swedish authorities. </seg>
<seg id="14"> They remember also that Assange is compared the departure from Sweden applied for and by the district attorney, that to the legend enveloped Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security boss by Stalin,, the corresponding permission received. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "That is like a hunt, not like a legal pursuit," is accused in the letter. </seg>

<seg id="20"> "I am certain me not, why we value on the opinion of a type with a website put should," explained it CNN to the transmitter. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Obama itself has a high responsible for the anti-terrorism battle, Rusell Travers, with which prevention of new document uncovering delegates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The attempt of the speaker of the Präsidenden Barack Obama to give Assange less attention, stands in contrast to the opinions, that conservative politicians and commentators in these days announce. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The congresswoman Peter King, that will lead as of January the chair in the national Sicherheitskommitee of the house of representatives, requested the country department to examine the possibility, to set Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "around its moneys to seize and every, that it supported or a contribution performs to pursue." </seg>

<seg id="2"> Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final game, it experienced on that and Abs in its career, but three times it played decisive games. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final game, two different stand itself moreover, of its respective trainers given styles vis-à-vis, and its encounter marked by contrasts reflects itself in the results against. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final game, he experienced on that and Abs in its career, but three times he had decisive games, and previously he held himself well why this opportunity of entirely special importance is for it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Argentinian has high played himself with the medal to the second champion, he remained a step behind the victors and amazingly he expedited with the same team successive final games. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The santistische strategist reached the first final game as a trainer in that 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when del Morelia had the bridles in the hand, with which he learned a large defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, in that' Clausura 2003' reached he the decisive duel that he lost also with 3-1 against Rayados. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Already with Santos Laguna on that 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', with which they played against lot Diablos, had to put away Rubén again a setback because the game with 2-2 against lot Choriceros went out after 210 game minutes undecided, but in the eleven meter, it came with 3-1 forwards and got missed turned two possibilities to put its title away, but last of all three of its players the eleven steps and the game to a 4-3. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Rubén had already two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, its large rival, lost. Therefore it would not like to be pursued once again by the misfortune and free itself by the evil magic in order to be able to celebrate for the first time a title although it strengthens, that for it the most important is the game itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I would like champion become, I would like no statistics break, that is for a club, for my affection, that I me would give away, and therefore becomes the title me come, but what previously happens, is the most important," commented on the helmsman when one questions it over the lost final games. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The last final game remained it yet strong in the memory to have learned it assured, much from that: "The single apprenticeship that we can pull from that, is that until the arbitrator the end does not whistle, cannot celebrate we, are prepared we at the line, were prepared the players also, for the last time we with two eleven meters already on that, to eliminate believe, and I that the one apprenticeship is, until the game is not concluded, gives it no occasion for celebrating." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> To know that this series could be decided by eleven meter ski meal, disturbs it not, for it trusts its players: "One wants never in the eleven meter ski meal depend, one would like in the regular game time lock, but sometimes gives it no alternative and one must prepare be, were prepares in the prior tour we, but unfortunately prepared us the fate a bad game, sometimes as a result of of nervousness or the violent endeavoring, that title to hold already in the hands, that left behind us something for this final game, and we hope that it this time not In addition come becomes." </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Quebecer broadcast moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian supervisory board for broadcast standards (CCNR) because of its controversial remarks over social care and Haitianer just as as because of its abusive speech manner over radio. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The CCNR represents the opinion, M. Dupont and its CHOI 98.1 FM teams would be right to be sure the on own statement of opinion, to be sure would have certain remarks "inexact information about the social care and unauthorized negative representations of the Haitianer as well as also one so ungehobelte speech manner contain, is" that the during the day radiated shipments not appropriate. </seg>

<seg id="4"> The supervisory board had concluded also that a discussion over suicide, that includes the distribution of the names of these people, that suicides committed, against which code of the broadcast offends. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The CCNR had received several troubles regarding that during that in the period of 2008 and 2010 radiated shipments made commentary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The first decree became sun per inserted commun as a result of a trouble of the "front the assistées sociales you Québec." </seg>
<seg id="7"> The activist organization had burdened itself that the sums named in the shipment would be inexact. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The moderators should give rather solidly as misleading information. </seg>
<seg id="9"> With respect to the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had represented the opinion, would be the suicide an expression of cowardice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The majority of the supervision councilors had pulled the conclusion, let the mediated message be herewith that suicide might not be looked at as a solution by life crises. </seg>

<seg id="1"> 450 Million in contracts without announcement </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hydro Québec allowed project planning firms in mutual agreement 450 million dollars at contracts for the water power project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Middle in this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium stands, consisting of the firms BPR, the sow, Groupe SM and Axor that received the most important share, namely that of the project direction, to a sum of 295 million dollars without announcement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This consortium, named "Énergie gérance," was formed 2004 as an accompaniment of the decision of Hydro Québec, that private sector to entrust its responsibility, this important, hydroelektrische project in height of a sum of 5 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Beginning 2005 managed to grab the consortium "Énergie gérance" the lucrative contract, without that there would have been a public announcement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For the Parti Québécois, that represents fall back on business consortia a serious ethical problem, that conjures up the risk of the Wettbewerbsverdrändung as well as a price increase. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "This is a new type and manner of a rigged game and weakens the competition." </seg>
<seg id="8"> "That means, that one instead of rigged games instead of on secret type and manner now in open form carries out," explained yesterday Sylvain Simard, delegate of the PQ, on the press conference. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> At the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the national assembly, for it seems heavily intelligibly to it how the interest of the public can be served on this type and manner. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Resource minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon on that in that she placed vehemently in agreement, that it would have concerned in this contract a rigged game. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "I remain my line faithful," it cursed in that it strengthened, the PQ would be "dishonest" advanced and it "false its at hardness." </seg>
<seg id="12"> It said, it "would be the least" that the PQ would apologize. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The model of the consortium is worldwide current practice. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It concerns usually a temporally so temporary alliance, that permits it two or several business, to bundle its expertise with respect to a commandment on an announcement for a complex project. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The project "Eastmain" shows a high complexity level regarding its work size. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The building procedure is in the gear and is supposed to be set up until 2012. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Nevertheless the contract was forgiven, without that a competition had been able to take place; there had been already negotiations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Moreover the model of the consortium in the Quebec itself represents more in relatively simple projects in no way an exception. </seg>
<seg id="19"> How the newspaper "Le Devoir" last week noted, that in the area of the Bauingenieur- and consultation being is model of used the consortium object of government ascertainments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> A short flying over of the Quebecer of business index permits it to name more than 200 consortia, of which some of steady duration seem to be. </seg>
<seg id="21"> On this type and manner, the firm collaborates for example the sow in partnership with the majority of its kernel competitors, to which CIMA count +, Génivar, SNC Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult,. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Each connection, and therefrom there are several dozens, attributes to one and the same juristic person, namely on the sow. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> What concerns the consortium "Énergie gérance," emphasized minister Normandeau, constructed subjected is that "the territory of that James of a special labor force dynamics and that Hydro Québec accords" this fact since the '70's in special type and manner calculation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Réal Laporte, the large employer of the Société d' énergie de la James (SEBJ) constructed, delivered an explanation, has let that the nose over the fact hulls that the contract was allowed over the project direction after agreement. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "If you make an announcement and there is only a few applicant, your prices become into the height of fast." </seg>
<seg id="26"> "You have therefore two possibilities: either you take be the people, that on this Mart and say will negotiate": one a satisfying agreement to a good price to you. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "The thought is however, that not the price decisively is, but rather the special intellect of the people," strengthened Laporte. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> This contract allowed the consortium "Énergie gérance" is part dollar preserved a long list by contracts over more than 50,000 by the Parti Québécois. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The contracts became either approves of the Hydro Québec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> After examination, the newspaper counted "Le Devoir" more than 100 engineer contracts and adviser contracts, that firms or its branch were allowed, under that especially resource laboratory, between 2002 and March 2010. </seg>
<seg id="31"> SNC Lavalin had snatched up 22 contracts at itself, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and the sow 10 without including herewith its participation in "Énergie gérance." </seg>
<seg id="32"> All these contracts were negotiated. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They amount to included themselves in that entirely on 449,783,344 $, therein the contract with "Énergie gérance" over 295,131,564 $. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Sylvain Simard had be reported let, form would be that the four firms, that the consortium (BPR, the sow, Groupe SM and Axor) the "Parti libéral you Québec well well known." </seg>
<seg id="35"> Minister Normandeau had be discernable let, the PQ would be likewise connected with the firms, that it "financed" before she specified, that it would concern rather its managements. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Greener, but frank sceptically. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The Quebecer consumer has little confidence to the head participants of the persistent growth, however just as few to the marked brands or the organically markings, that should drive its choice. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Damage although it bathes in a medium effective universe, where it swarms with information for the benefit of a more responsible consumption only so: the barometer consumption responsible has a lack of trustworthy information to lament, an insufficiency, that makes itself than a brake of its engagement recognizable, how the first reading showed, that was held off yesterday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Although they pushed the consumption of the so named socially compatible products in 2010, the Quebecer seem nevertheless that that try to sell this to accord little credit. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Two-thirds of the Quebecer population gives to give in the deed the environment engagement of the firms just as little belief like the green business advertising, betrays the gauge contrived by the responsible consumer center the university Sherbrooke. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Another condition: the half of the consumer doubts the confidence worthiness of the official certificate joined at the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves as environmentally aware, so the barometer. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After same pattern, the discourse of the politicians seriously is taken to this subject of solely 14.6% of the Quebecer population. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The information with respect to responsible consumption seems nevertheless importantly to the Stimulation of this consumption segment, that is animated currently by approximately only of one-third the Quebecer consumer. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In the deed, void and doubtful character of the information softened the zeal of 46% of the consumer. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is after the higher price of the products the second brake identified on the part of the barometer. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover one-third of the Quebecer of the indicated efficiency stands the green products and services, that one is to be put striven them at the hand, distrustfully vis-à-vis. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="13"> According to another communication had changed its habits already over the half of the consumer in 2010 and changed predominantly the brand one or several products in order to give its conviction expression. </seg>
<seg id="14"> According to barometer, they had preferred also to 61% purchase with dealers of its quarter and had favored the purchase of groceries cultivated in its region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Greener and more responsibly - the index of the environmentally aware consumption had this year a 64 the maximal value of 100 reaches - the homo consumus of the Quebec loves it to present himself as a king of the recycling, who tries to reduce its traces left behind in the environment in that he attends to the animal protection. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Yet the social and ecological consciousness seems indicated to make nevertheless before its car simply, so the barometer: just once 28% of the Quebecer, used into 2010 public transportation or to have preferred the agency for shared rides, in order to demonstrate its ecological interest. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The developer company Angus as well as the business Parallèle, that had hoped for itself a contribution in height of seven million dollars of the ministry of education and cultural affairs to the acceptance of the Daniel Langlois of belonging movie theater complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint Laurent, in order to entrust this again of its actual cineastischen function, receive evidently not, what they demanded. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Secret of the complex shaken Canada ventilated </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new, American diplomat directions that were spread by WikiLeaks ventilate the secret over that, what the United Nations consider under the inferiority complex of the Canadians vis-à-vis the Americans; they put however the superiority feeling with the same blow last-nameder vis-à-vis Canada openly. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Consequently the American diplomats are astonished about the fact that the Canadian voter has not in the ballot the Canadian American relations in the sense, and believe it, that the visit of president Obama would have the conservative government at the same time helped to put through its budget of 2009! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The four new communications between the American message in Ottawa and Washington that publicly were spread yesterday offer yet more spicy details as the bare substantial contents, at which one has to nibble. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A connection dating by the 22nd of September 2008, i.e. in the period, in which the federal Wahlkampage in the full gear was present, reports about that, from which point the United Nations are involved no longer in the uses discussed by its political bosses. </seg>
<seg id="6"> For large astonishment of David Wilkins, the ambassador used, American in Ottawa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Mr. Wilkins offers different explanation possibilities of this situation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "An inferiority complex almost characterizing the Canadians contingently causes possibly the Canadian, political managements much sooner in addition, over internal issue of the everyday life to speak, when the United States in this choice the black Peter to impute (like 1988 in the campaign over the free trade) ," describes he. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The United Nations, concludes it, are therefore "the proverbial Goliath of this choice: omnipräsent, but potentially too threateningly in order to speak" about it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The ambassador understands this "deafening quiet" the fewer because both countries intensive political and economic relations cultivate. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Logical manner," values it, "should it the capacity of a candidate, a party and yet much more of a party chief for leading a such essential relation be, that of the voters in the going to the polls than a key factor in the sense has." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The other expression of this feeling of importance reads in that at the 22nd of January 2009 of Terry Breese, business carrier in Ottawa, sent communication that should prepare Präsident Barack Obama for its first visit in Ottawa. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Your trip at the same time will help, the further existence of the government in the confidence vote over the federal budget beginning of February to guarantee, with which Canada its first deficit after more than a decade well known give becomes, that based on an animation program in the height of 30 to 40 billion dollars emerged is," describes Breese. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Nowhere it had mentioned that the government had had to adjourn the parliament session before Christmas in order to prevent that the parliament would be fallen by the coalition and would affect the so contingent further existence of the opposition parties the quality of the proposed animation program. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> A further, from January 2008 dating and on the part of the ambassador Wilkins communication composed notifies Washington of the always more negatively becoming picture that the series radiated, dramatic over CBC spread by the United States. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The ambassador is disturbed over shipments such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one little subtle allusion at Maher Arar, that can observe "No-Fly-List" or also Abführungen to the purpose of through muscle swanks of the CIA of carried out interrogation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Again another communication reports in detail about how Hillary Clinten in its French office colleagues Bernard Kouchner had asked in its first bilateral meeting after that, whether Europe would be ready to receive certain prisoners out of Guantanamo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Mr. Kouchner should the question with yes answered have, to be sure on the basis of an individual "case to case" -decision. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Àm end of the meeting, described, "has it the country secretary a paper as regards Omar Khadr issued, a 15-year-old Moslem of Canadian origin." </seg>
<seg id="20"> "The Secretary of State accepted to look through" the document again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Let's notice in in the end yet that the minds get hot with respect to the web page WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper of very closely standing advisers, had explained over CBC that that should "killed" become for this massive leak of responsible. </seg>

<seg id="2"> The UN proposed yesterday a plan in Cancun to the renewal of the illumination of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with regard to the realization of a reduction of the greenhouse gas (CFC), corresponds that to almost one-third of the additional reduction, that must be realized in order to stabilize the earth climate until 2020. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This ambitious plan takes in hopes its position in the step of the concrete large projects to transfer that the UN in Cancun in order to compensate the absence of compelling reduction obligations of the industrialized countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> After the plan proposed yesterday, the main problem in form would be avoided the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of the CFC delivered based on the illumination on the earth if the incandescent pears, that represent previously another monopoly by 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced, by fluorescing or better yet, by light-emitting diodes (LED). </seg>
<seg id="5"> The illumination is responsible for 8% of the worldwide emissions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This corresponds one equivalently of 70% of the exhaust fumes of the worldwide Fuhrparks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In Copenhagen, the large Abgasemittenten such as the United States, China, Europe and other had last year whereby also Canada counted, to voluntary reduction plans promised, that should screw down the global CFCS emissions of 53 Gt on 49 Gt. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Of this balance, one would have to draw-off however yet 5 Gt in order to stabilize of today to the year 2020 the climate climb around 2 degrees centigrade, in order to prevent that this runs except inspection. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the incandescent pears, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of warmth, and the remaining 5% produce the light. </seg>
<seg id="10"> With the compact lamp material pears, the energy consumption decreases reduces around 75%, with the new LED light bulbs one this energy demand once again around the dual. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The compact lamp material pears hold on average between 6000 to 10,000 hours. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The new LED light bulbs, like for example that, that the manufacturers Philips this week on the market brought has - this company has by the way at the UN study participated - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent pear, what mediates a hint of the save possibilities of the substitution plan, that is supposed to be used in 100 countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Next to the fact that iese deliver totally novel light bulbs only very little warmth, can function it also with a rule resistance. </seg>
<seg id="14"> And they contain no mercury at all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Several specialists showed that compact lamp material pears reserves show, because it must contain mercury and that one must dispose of it therefore as a special rubbish, what is not always possible in the developing countries, except the makers make available an acceptance place. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The main source at mercury emissions on the planet does not represent the compact lamp material pear according to the report however, but rather rather the coal power plants that eject substantially more mercury in order to produce the electricity wasted by the incandescent pears. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Alone in the United States, these coal power plants 25,000 eject tons of mercury annually. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The report represents detailed the profits, that each country would gain thanks to this international program. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Indonesia would save so for example a billion of dollar annually in the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that means an equivalently of 3.5 coal power plants, whose building would cost Indonesias 2.5 billions. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Within more than six months, of July 2009 until May 2010, held the fate of Clotilde of rice, a young French researcher, that was held in the Iran because of "espionage," the French public in breath, transferred the diplomacy in alarm readiness and accented the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Teheran. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This all under the attentive views of the diplomats of the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> That of WikiLeaks of preserved and of the newspaper "Le moons" documents of looked through American give some backgrounds of this crisis price. </seg>
<seg id="5"> They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, that went so far to give these pieces of advice to the contact with its own crisis of "takings of hostages" in the Iran (a small group of hikers). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> They show how the French responsibles tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman the release of Majid Kakavand not, one in France caught held and of the American justice on the basis of trade with material for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program of sought Iranian to the Gegeleistung would have. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In the end they set had played the type and manner, with which the French presidency has to manipulate tried the media to the purpose, to make this the idea plausible, the Syrian president Bachar al Assad a central role in the release of Clotilde of rice, into a harsh light. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In truth, it had done nothing in this regard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> A diplomat telegram revised at the 12th of August 2009 in Paris carries the title "Iran: French commentaries to the type and manner of the contact with takings of hostages." </seg>
<seg id="10"> François Richier, Elysée adviser in strategy questions, conversed in accompaniment of Patrice Paoli, director of the dock d' Orsay for North Africa and the mediator orient with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> They explained its the French method. </seg>
<seg id="12"> That advised bring back to set all on that, around its own citizens, that would be held violent in the Iran, to the Americans. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Power noise," said it, "articulates loudly and clearly and without intermission" the words "reason human rights," "innocence," "immediate release" in the media. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is necessary in order to bring the Iranian regime in embarrassment, that pays attention very sensitively to its image. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> This "does not operate the more especially since you the Iranians ask to do" that. </seg>
<seg id="16"> For "silence solves nothing," past the discussion attempts over on inconspicuous way, the Iranians "masters in evasive maneuvers" are. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners would be a "familiar, Iranian tactic": "Taking of hostages to the purpose of political extortion." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> It gives "would demand notice on, the release of Clotilde of rice out of the prison (that at the 16th of August into being come should, at the day, at that it itself into the French message flees) the payment of a large sum of money at the Iranians" (230,000 Euro bond). </seg>

<seg id="25"> For Washington, that pursues the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material planned for the nuclear program, the release by Majid Khakavand represents a bad novelty. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Did France take a cow trade in purchase? </seg>
<seg id="27"> The release of the Iranian against that one of the Frenchwoman? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> On the occasion of a renewed conference with Kathleen Allegrone on the 4th of September, François Richier assures that this would not be the case. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The Elysée, says it, was not only "totally surprises of the decision of the judge," but rather would have also tries to resist itself on the other hand. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "There was" a lively exchange between the French presidency and the French attorney general (presently Michèle Alliot Marie), but "the French government can the judicial decision do not change," explains he. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Mr. Richier would like to refer also on that that Majid Kakavand stands further under "severe" supervision of the French secret service. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> During the safe-keeping of Clotilde of rice in the Iran, the Elysée does not protect its efforts to make believe attempt" by means of announcements and of the media of organized "flight, the Syrian president Bachar al Assad would play an "important" and "influential mediator roll." </seg>
<seg id="34"> The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and establish that the manipulations fruits carries, because several press articles reflect the official French version. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> A telegram dating by the 25th of August 2009 conjures up "the medium flash of the French authorities." </seg>
<seg id="36"> Whereon so much is based "Dankesbezeugung" vis-à-vis Mr. Assad, asks itself the Parisians message. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The French authorities admit praise price full "in spite of its explanations secretly that they have only one vaguely premonition therefrom, what the Syrier have" actually done. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The document concerns itself then with the reasons, that brought the Elysée in addition to decay this fiction. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The intensive communication efforts "aims on that off, Sarkozys politics of the opening vis-à-vis Syria to confirm," analyzes it. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A 2008 launched politics, that "of numerous critic voices in France as well as abroad at that time as premature and undeservedly perceived became." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Vindictive hackers and busy spies </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The affaire WikiLeaks has a dual meaning. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On a side, she turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal, that is solely a scandal in the Sinner sanctimony, that the relation between the countries that reigns citizens and the press. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other side, notice gives gives it far-reaching changes on international level on, and a foretaste on the future dominated by regression. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But let's advance according to the row. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each document generated by a secret service (a x any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper cut. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary," American uncovering over the sexual habits Berlusconis throw nothing further from as that, what one got to read for months anyway in every x any journal, (except which, whose owner Berlusconi is), and that frightening karikaturierte profile Gaddafis offered already for some time time material for its sketches to cabaret artists. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule, after which the secret dossiers may consist only of already well known novelties, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and that not not until this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go into a library, that dedicates itself esotherischen publication, you will recognize that each work (over the Gral, the Mysterium of race-le-Chateau, that Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) repeats exactly that, what was written already in prior works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> That does not come alone therefore that the author of occult texts wants to publish no investigation (yet therefore, that he would not know, where novelties over the not existing to find would be), but rather because that that dedicate themselves occultism believe, in nothing unlike that, what it already know and confirms, what they already learned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the success mechanism of served Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Just as the secret acts. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informant is is rotten, and rotten (or restricted spirit) also the boss of the secret service (otherwise could he what also always be, for example editor in Libération), that only as true considered, what he acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Top Secret information about Berlusconi, that had sent the American message in Rome the Staatsdezernat, were that like that, that had published Newsweek already the week before. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Why was therefore such a canceling made around the uncovering of these dossiers? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On a side, these purport what each formed person already knows, and to be sure that the messages - at least since the end of the second world war and since then also the heads of the government itself mutually call can or an airplane take can, around itself to the supper to encounter - lost its diplomatic function and changed themselves, with exception of some small representation task, in espionage centers. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Every any spectator of ascertainment film knows this very exactly, and it does not happen out of sanctimony that one does so to ignore this. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Nevertheless: the fact to repeat it publicly, the task of the sanctimony injures and serves in addition to set the American diplomacy into a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> At second place: The idea that a x any hacker can tap the most secret secrets of the most powerful country of the world, rescues the considerable blow against the prestige of the Staatsdezernats. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Moreover the scandal brings fewer the victims, than rather the "executioners" in oppression. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But let's dedicate the profound nature its, what happened to us. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Formerly, to Orwells times, one was able to bundle all power such as a Big Brother, that each gesture of its subjects controlled. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwells prophecy would have since then as perfectly correct turn out can where one can control each movement thanks to the telephone, each handled transaction, the visited hotel, the selected freeway and so further; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of the power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> If one went himself however before eyes, what expires today that even the secret crypts of the power can escape no longer the inspection of a hacker to be arranged hears the control gear up, unilaterally and becomes circle-shaped. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - selects as an avenger of the citizen -, can bring the secrets of the power in experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> How can a power hold itself however, that is no longer in a position, to preserve its own secrets? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It agrees, Georg Simmel said already that an actual secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret never revealed can become); it is also aware that jedwede knowledge of is the character Berlusconis or Merkels in the reason a secret free of Geheimis, there it the public sphere exposes; but in the style of WikiLeaks to disclose that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to rob it each power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, on the other hand however Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What will the consequences of this insult be, that such a powerful power was added? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the countries in the future will place no reserved information more Online - that would become a notice glued on at the street corner match. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is just as obvious that it to hope forgiven is with the current technologies secretly to be able to hold confidential reports on telephone. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Is nothing more simply than to find out whether and when a head of state moves away himself in an airplane and contacted one its colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could private and only for certain ears certain relations be maintained in the future? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know very probably that my prediction in the moment sounds Rome fastened after Science Fiction and, but I see compelled myself in addition to imagine the government agents, myself on secret type and manner busily on uncontrollable march routes moving, its communications nowhere unlike in the bare memory with itself carrying, and in addition the few written information that got it, in the shoe paragraph concealing. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information would be stored had in only copy in locked drawers: in the reason the espionage attempts of Watergate less success to indicate, than a WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity to write that the technology yelled at before nowadays like a cancer, namely backwards. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Climate: like France its finance promises beautiful speaks </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It is a year after the resident of Copenhagen contract time to examine the compliance of the quickly solved financing promises (also "almost start" or premature financings named), realizes became that by the developing countries. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And already the coarse French Schönredereien are uncovered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With the resident of Copenhagen contract, the developing countries promised in addition to allocate 30 billions of dollar between 2010 and 2012. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The EU promised 7.2 billions of Euro over three years away, France 1.26 billions of Euro (i.e. 420 million per year). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On the occasion of the opening of the COP16, the EU pulled all indices to convince around its partners of the fact of its engagement regarding the almost-starts-financings: detail loyal action report of its members states, press conference, large Nebenevents, pamphlet distribution. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The operation transparency is remarkably and just for its actual value appreciated: the self-developing countries and the civil company would see developed made it gladly, if everyone countries that on the same precision level. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The EU announces to have released in 2010,2.2 billions Euro, what brings it on the correct way to the Respektbezollung of its engagement of 7.2 billions per years 2012. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If one looks however into the detail, the things lie a little complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should be according to the resident of Copenhagen contract "new and additional" in order to guarantee that an additional use was brought in, without to the disadvantage of the public economic aid to passed. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately there is no consent about that, what means "newly and in addition." </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the EU commission had proposed a harmonization, have certain member countries, under that France that blocks procedure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today every selects the guideline that it considers as best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The EU commission chose itself for example as a guideline for that of the year 2009: the international financings are retained, and "almost start" gives in the frame of the financing over for three years 150 million in addition. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries selected similar guidelines, either with respect to year or regarding conditions on plain of the public economic aid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In return in addition France of the opinion, the financings of "all new projects" of the year 2010 was would be "new and additional." </seg>
<seg id="17"> Differently expressed: There are no guidelines in the editions of the preceded year or on more globally plain of the public economic aid. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Concretely said can the entire sum the French support the developing countries stably remain (or also decrease) - France gives before to keep its obligation with respect to the "new and additional" financings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another, decisive element is the breakdown in contributions and loan. </seg>
<seg id="20"> About that yet no rule rules, and everyone selects its rake mode. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, like for example France, find 1 lent€as equivalent with 1 contributed€. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This is obvious only heavily justifiable: the effort is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loan can be justified for certain profitable investments (often at the emission checking bound projects, that on most effective technology be based), to present is it deceitfully, the Euro, that one as equivalent for a contributed Euro collects... Moreover only the costs of the loan should be credited for the investor country as an engagement (i.e. that equivalent an interest rate). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France has nothing differently in the sense as the following consideration: it "respects" its obligation of 420 million Euro in that it receives 91.5% loan (389.8 millions Euro) and 8.5% contributes) 36.1 million Euro) - see also the EU document in order to convince itself. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the single country of the EU that loan uses in large mass. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany demands 46% while Denmark that investigate Netherlands or the Slovakia (among other things) its obligations to 100% with contributions. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Differently said if the predominant majority of the European Union 1 issues€to the fulfillment of its obligations, gives France just once 10 cents and understands under that a comparable use. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Beautiful Hokuspokus! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> All in everything operates France in its almost-start-financing with a double vertigo: to a part with a Weiterentwicklkung of the action over the time away and to the other part with reality of the financial use. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France succeeds issued has and saves it let believe, that it 420 million "more newly and in addition" millions in agreement with its promises at the same time 36.1 million Euro. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Does the manipulation of the treasury (there it probably seem, that it Bercy was, that the arbitrage carried out has) could stretch a doubly negative effect after; once EU internally (why go the other member countries with the contributing away, if it yet sufficed to lend)? and then in the negotiations, there the self-developing countries not completely deceive let... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter of the premature financings only a small question on relatively short time in comparison with the entirety at discussions over the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Let's hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> How that also always would be, to learn it is inevitable, its lesson from this first year of premature financings. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Primarily France could announce a change in its booking type for the years 2011 and 2012, and to be sure in the spirit of the respect for its obligations and the balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Above all however France could bring the discussions over the dispute object of the long-term financings forwards (another, decisive and momentarily discussed subject): one does not escape the question of the "Verrechenbarkeit" or the booking type of its loans. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could change its position in order to be just as progressive with respect to the issue how it is that in other things. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The hope is based therefore upon the new environment minister Kosciusko Morizet, who will arrive next week in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A surprising announcement over the almost of start France and its vision of the "Verrechenbarkeit" as well as the utilization of loan would raise inherently the international confidence basis, that is necessary for continuing discussions. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A child of 10 years takes in published 81 different chemical substances over the day, so one this Wednesday of the union Générations future (former movement to the protection of the rights and the respect of coming generations) study. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The union that explains that its results "in view of the slight amount at analyzed samples no statistically significant value represent, but rather illustration character of the treated problematic nature represent," had bought between July and September that usually within four, of an approximately ten-year-old child to the meals consumed groceries plus a between meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> These typical meals - inclusive of the official recommendations of five fresh fruit part and fruit part, three milk products and 1.5 liters of water per day - became just as as examines Naschereien of laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The plate balances is shattering: 81 chemical substances, under that 42 as possibly or probably carcinogenically classified and five as karziogen certain classified, just as as 37 substances with Endokrinin disruptive influence, according to studies of several institutions such as for example the international cancer research center. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "Even if in the approximate entirety of the cases the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken in substance not exceeded become, takes one this elevation yet very good, that reality, in which the consumer possibly carcinogenic materials or substances with Endokrinin disruptive influence stopped becomes, apprehension exciting is," notes the union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Already in the breakfast, alone the butter and the tea with milk contain already more than ten of the possibly carcinogenic residues and three certainly as carcinogenically proved, just as as more than twenty residues, that can impair the hormone system. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="8"> The apple imported from Brazil when between meal planned for the study, shows traces by six chemical substances, under that a fungicide forbidden in France. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, in the lunch included, with which the study traces of an insecticide exertally forbidden in the EU assessed. </seg>

<seg id="11"> In the tap water, the analyses brought the presence of nitrate and chloroform at the light. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> In the supper, the salmon steak with 34 was determined, was chemical residues at the "abundantest," and itself the plastic plate related for warming up the meal in the microwave not unencumbered. </seg>
<seg id="13"> That in conclusion risk of this "pollutant cocktails" for the consumer "probably will undervalue," so the study. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The "Alliance Europes Ecologie harvest Verts" (I / O LV) proposed on their part "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium over the use of pesticides, in order to stop the "increase at diseases of civilization." </seg>
</p>
<p>
