</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new Office gentlemen of capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously some language barriers to overcome their old-new colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and in the city of representation to understand at all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The newspaper Aktuálně.cz members of the new Council from the ČSSD a little "abgeklopft ', as they dominate the notorious Slang that has become popular in recent years, in which the current coalition partners in Prague at the helm. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Surprisingly, the new councils in relation to these new notions something in the dark. </seg>
<seg id="6"> That, At least, they say. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Who is Voldemort?" </seg>
<seg id="8"> "No idea." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am more of a newcomer in the Prague policy", Lukáš responded Kaucký, the new Office Mr for culture, to the test "godfather of vocabulary." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But the Council Mr Březina - a political veteran, reacted in a similar way. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example, on the concept of 'Golfloch'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "This is the only expression of which you are submitting me, which I use now and again." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "otherwise, I think that not much of slang." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> From the days before the leaf Aktuálně.cz in this year's June election vocabulary, the Congress of the ODS had published pickte editorial six words, especially those notoriously associated with the Prague magistrate. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="15"> The Social Democrats should the concepts' Voldemort ',' biggest Prague golf hole, "" Konditorei go in ',' bull necks "," betrayal of the capital "and" verblechen ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Three Prague Council agreed to the test, the fourth - Mr Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - first his participation in the talks, but then not even the headphones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The fifth-in-Office, Mr, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "These are things I don't care and how the Civic Democrats themselves talking about - I do not." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "For me, it is how we understand our programmes," he countered. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="20"> As already indicated, would have Lukáš Kaucký mentioned in the above headline allegedly not recognised by the influential entrepreneurs and friend of the ex-mayor who Bém, Roman Janoušek. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The term "Voldemort" says Kaucky absolutely nothing and the only concept, he erriet correctly in the test, was "the greatest Prague golf hole." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, added to security but added: "But I know this from the newspaper". </seg>
<seg id="23"> And jokingly: "I will probably have to show a language course." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> "The Gulf hole" will not only matador Karel Březina, but also by the Council on the Environment Lukáš Plachý right as tunnel Blanka entziffert. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Both Social Democrats also know, however, for whom the term Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý senses even where this figure is and what it means to go "in the Konditorei </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "I believe that that is, in some kind of Prague to go Gastronomiebetrieb ', is Plachý quite close to the solution to the problem, when we know that it is the seat of Janoušeks firms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> In line with Březina, but he claimed that this knowledge to have drawn from the newspapers, rather than him this vocabulary would own. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Judging from The test participants, there seems to be no similar naturalisations Slang 'repatriations' under the Social Democrats. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I asked my colleagues too, but there is obviously something we really not." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "We call upon us, and we also use acronym or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - from his party colloquially called "Hulda." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "in school I was Bříza (Birke), but I do not know whether to call my colleagues," tells us Karel Březina his nickname. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried and behold - it works. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The right mattress and the proper beds rust Women have other wishes than men? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Not the tollste bed framework, but the quality of the deck area - mattress and rust make the good bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> These are, however, ways to meet the wishes of the specific user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In selecting many things play a role - the weight, size, health and, last but not least, the sex of the Schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Equally important is the Interieur where mattress and rust. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a Wochenendhaus, not regularly heated, are not well suited to Latexmatratzen because they are much longer, "warm". </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition, they are much more serious than usual polyurethane foams mattresses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And, it should be changed regularly. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If it is not enough Entlüftungskanälchen essentially have and still have a strong record, snarled moisture in, so it is not ruled out that the tape. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Of course, also plays a role in the election, accustomed to what one. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Anyone who has been a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with soft class, will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with hard surface. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "All you get from the NHL have returned, have complained to me that they can no longer sleep right here." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "For their abgeschundenen shoulders, and Hüften they simply need a soft layer from Visco-foam (memory Foam - a form of memory-Polymer)." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "This I recommend including sugar people under a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the" information "from the ligaments and the skin is bad," says Sylva Hadamcziková, specialising in Polstermöbel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> I therefore have many years ago Eishockeyspielern, but also other customers this mattresses with Visco-sparkling (memory Foam) concerned. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "today, it is no longer a problem, because such mattresses provide among manufacturers Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico. ' </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And one need not necessarily be a famous you learn to appreciate the benefits of foam Visco-. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" actually works quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The foam optimalisiert his toughness and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, he schmiegt downright warm body. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Nowhere is there in the night, rolling around as after a serious fight. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It is simply sleeping much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The viskoelastische sparkling also offers protection against Dekubitus (gangrene). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In the election of the Matratzengröße should be to body size is still the length of the Fußsohlen add some 21 to 34 inches. </seg>
<seg id="25"> As Mrs Mann on the 180 cm are large need as a 210 to 220 cm bed. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Each of the Schläfer should at least 90 cm is widely available, is 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In Einzelbetten, for example in singles, 120 to 140 cm. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The comfort and also for the visitors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise the following applies rule of thumb for the ideal bed broad: "If you on the back, should have enough room for the easy angewinkelten arms," advises mine. Polsterer Helena Prokopová, Zunftmeisterin and Raumausstatter for years the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and this discussion at a university. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> In a double bed everyone needs a own rust and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are too high. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise there is nothing different amounts than the Roste assembling and this is not possible in every bed framework. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with the skeleton 15 cm, should be at least three centimetres in the form of class and the fine cushion. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "With the hand or the Hinsetzen the feathers on no account should we felt", warns Helen Prokopová. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Each mattress makes a specific Rosttyp. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and under position as evolved Siamzwillinge have no place in the bedroom. </seg>
<seg id="36"> These mattresses cannot drop and you cannot wash, which is already commonplace today. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And since we are in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years slowly to a huge (and sieve). </seg>
<seg id="38"> Also therefore reject specialists advertising slogans in mattresses a life span of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Every cause has its ifs and buts. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And so a practical Council by dealers: Mattresses of 120 or 140 cm diameter the hygiene of waschbaren abziehbaren salaries should not be afraid, however, it is recommended to use a Matratzenschoner you can easily leave and wash. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even if today usually Matratzenbezüge with Rundumreißverschluss manufactured so that you get after the opening two halves (immensely important for the Waschvorgang and washing machines size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, often alone, especially as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> They have in bed instead of a Rostes firm record? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Get out of it. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> So should they prefer the record with ventilation holes (if not content) and mattresses with pen skeleton and 15 cm minimum height so pockets with pen core and finely cushion. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethane foams mattresses belong on such a basis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For not verstellbare Lattenroste with 14 to 18 (Lamellen) are Latex- or Sandwichmatratzen suited (possibly also combinations of Latex and Kokos), always afford it with a larger Lattenanzahl Roste from 28 and more pen with Lordosenstütze in Lendenwirbelbereich and the ability to regulate the Lattenhärte. </seg>
<seg id="48"> On verstellbare Lamellenroste does not include mattresses with Federskelett, since they do not belong to the ergonomische hardly react. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Alongside the attitudes of stiff the pen will make special flexible shoulder modules. </seg>
<seg id="50"> This is a special strengthen the pen, which allows the pen makes einzudrücken or even to verwinkeln that they allow the individual Einsinken the shoulder of the Schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Especially important for men with broad shoulders. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There is even Matratzenhersteller which have started to use "soft Herrenmatratzen" zones for the shoulder area. </seg>
<seg id="53"> In The ladies is thought - them fighting these soft zones in the Hüftgegend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For most demanding customers are punktelastische wing stroke systems (Lattoflex) or Roste burden with points of contact-Pads with so Multitorsionsfederung. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure will be distributed on several points, thus reducing the tension. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But, if the right mattress and right rust a bad (too big and fülliges), most are used Kopfkissen benefits lost. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Here too, a rule of thumb: The to the head, his top should only up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles relax. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Ideal is therefore a 50 x 60 cm big cushion, as for example the Scandinavians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In the side should Kopfkissen (along with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or soft zone in the bed) offset the shoulder height. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Have our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (fat) Strohsäcken but with hay. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern manufacturers use natural materials, or at least their mixtures. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Also In the new magic formula "organic". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of oil raw materials used to manufacture of Polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturelle oils - for example, Rizinus- and soya oil. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soya is well used by all known manufacturers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> "Organic mattresses, which means their nuclear materials from purely natural origin is," said Petr Vašíček by the company Tropico Plus. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Natural materials, but also in the production of Matratzenbezügen - one of the first was Aloe Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> But one can also micro-capsules grant in sleep, Mr President fresh woodland or Lavendelduft spread. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Here too there is a difference between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While the men a "kühlender" Pflanzenextrakt from Birkenblättern used so that the Matratzenbezug absorb heat and cool the body can have the salary for women "wärmende" effect. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Extracts from red Paprikaschoten stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex will sleep, Mr President wohlig warm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> And The current favourites? </seg>
<seg id="72"> Foam mattresses from cold (he has greater Poren with devastated Zellstruktur and is therefore breathing trade more active than usual Polyurethan) and also a lot more flexible. </seg>
<seg id="73"> The combination of the various Kaltschäumen stiff (severity) and Visco-foaming does occur create More zones mattresses, know exactly where capita, hip and closely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> For a quality mattress, though, has to fork out 7,000 kronor and more. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Gesundheitsmatratzen but are usually with lower VAT burden, because they are considered medical device. </seg>
<seg id="76"> The first Czech companies were Gumotex this advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> You see, in the bed and the pair to save is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="78"> And there are special offers of manufacturers and distributors, the two mattresses for the price of one. </seg>
<seg id="79"> So the brand Magniflex offers the mattress Duofreeze with in relation verstepptem Visco-foam memory for 11.990 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="80"> The second will get free to do so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the Tempur material which the era of viskoelastischen sparkling substances with open Zellstruktur and high density in almost kosmischem pace. </seg>
<seg id="82"> No surprise, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are involved in the launch enormous excessive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83"> Tempur will heat soft, cool milieu entrenched it again. </seg>
<seg id="84"> So it is to the human body is perfect and distributed in the best possible way, the body pressure. </seg>
<seg id="85"> It is therefore not only on the prevention of Druckbrand, but generally the sleep of comfort. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86"> Viskoelastische sparkling substances will not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as for specific Fußpolstern used the legs and the Gefäßen provide relief. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Domestic producers use the example of sparkling substances Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="8"> "I admit that it cannot abuse of such devices, for example, if you know someone in the pocket, without it, but so far we have had no such case." </seg>

<seg id="1"> The army has so many Zündschnüre quite the Czech Republic that umwickeln could you but only two years </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Czech army has 445 kilometres Zündschnüre purchased with explosives bomb. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The year before, the Ministry of Defence has 224 miles powder to the army camp. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is reassuring to know that the armed forces for 225 years ausgesorgt. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The only problem is the durability of the Zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The army bought the Zündschnüre by the Company STV Group, including For paltry 40 million kronor. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In his explanatory statement for the procurement of this huge amount of powder said the General Staff MF DNES, the soldiers would annually to consume 60 kilometres powder. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to The research from Armeepyrotechnikern, MF DNES point raised is clear from this data that the whole army of an intensive year pyrotechnic training - all the generals and officers of the army commandos, up to the secretaries and cleaners. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek is no exception. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Only then could the substantial annual consumption of 60 kilometres Zündschnüren reasonably justified. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This length to 25,000 Detonationen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> But would this army enough stocks for more than ten years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But if the old rule of experts is that the training each new professional soldiers two metres powder is quite sufficient, then the army by this Neueinkäufe - also from the point of view of the increased needs of the pioneering special units - a reassuring supply for the already mentioned, 225 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> It complained soldiers quickly use Brigade recently, in the Defence Minister Vondra, they have almost no more cartridges for hand guns, so register are severely restricted because of lack of resources. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Not to mention The Unterhosenmangel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "Me is not why they are such huge Zündschnüre buy." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Department of Defence justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of powder, the army had so for at least ten years with this "ammunition" heckle him. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Jan Děcký use of the STV Group but talks only of a four-year duration of the Zündschnüre and police and Armeepyrotechniker only two years. </seg>

<seg id="23"> But These tests are not for nothing, but cost more money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the amount rebate for 445 kilometres powder. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "They cost us 60% less than last year supply of 244 miles," spokesman Pejšek tells us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Only by way of comparison, the annual consumption of Zündschnüren of Pyrotechnikern police, the munitions from the second world war or the Soviet brother army liquidate exceeds some years has barely 1,500 metres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> And ordered the police always just such quantities of ammunition it before the end of the long-term use can consume. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At the beginning of the history of Farmet was the effort to do something useful. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And when the state his father Karel Žďárský as compensation for confiscated property by the communists as a small workshop offered to lease, did he not long left his career in his father's company, and in the ditch by then he was founded with a few comrades a company to manufacture their own Plastikwannen. </seg>

<seg id="11"> The three-day Grundkurs for future Gelatieri has the largest feeder and visitors from around the world. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But there are also more day Spezialkurse around the Schokoladeneis and internships in the House own Eisdiele. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Some in the mid-life crisis dreams of a new career, other cars simply let the treacherous ice of vague aspirations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow-food movement and the country's industrial Ice-cream will provide a European quality product. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari declared the participants first the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is not only good taste, but also the seidige fluidity and good consistency. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Luciano forgets his training but also not the icing on the cake of national and südländischen excess construction: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and there is still plenty of romanticism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first step to manufacturing seems very simple. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Luciano dump the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a major Mixgerät with an electronic programme everything to 85 degrees heated and then immediately to four degrees. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Then he turns to a tap on the machine, and is a white pasteurised Basiscreme basis for all Milcheissorten. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The teacher immediately with questions: Can ice cream only with natural substances without stabiliser? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How can one of their own Experimentierlust free rein? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Luciano warns, the spirit of the age to be fooled. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Who of ice cream "only from natural ingredients", has probably still stabilisers - usually a natural product, such as Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Of course you can ice without stabiliser, only it must then be sold within a day, otherwise sackt it, and bite the customer to Eiskörnchen louder. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Certain variations in the mass are allowed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> There will be more Exciting with flavourings. </seg>
<seg id="32"> For the ice taste different Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients in the fruit-department or the sweets of supermarket buying. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, there are powder and Pasten. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "The suppliers are all trying to foist onto dozens aromatic additives you." </seg>
<seg id="35"> "But you should simply experiment." </seg>
<seg id="36"> Either the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruit. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Or in the ice cream from the white reason mass with eggs to the yellow cream and cocoa powder into the basis for all kinds of chocolate temptations offered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Now the course participants in the Eismaschinen. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano will they each four different types of Vanille-, Schokolade-, Mokka- and produce Haselnuss-Eis - with or without eggs in the mass with more or less Vanillearoma or other natural supplements. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The same experiment will also Fruchteissorten. </seg>
<seg id="41"> More flavourings, more fruit-Püree - geschmacklich is not necessarily better. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Haselnuss-ice tastes not necessarily nut, when it contains more hazelnuts. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The most popular Kiwi-ice, the working group, the more fruit, using less water and less stabiliser. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Only a balanced combination would highlight the taste of a gelato clear says Luciano. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: Will peach-Püree used with a lot of sugar, the sugar in the recipe must be reduced. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For Zitroneneis an extra dose of sugar is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano a device, with which he prefers the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winemakers to measure the Oechsle in grape musts). </seg>
<seg id="48"> Fortunately, facilitate tables the calculation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Ice to make requires not so much physical use as before. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Not only the equipment for the automatic restoration of basic mass helps. </seg>
<seg id="51"> There is also a device in the ready-made ice-mix at the same time cremig beaten and freezing temperatures refrigerators. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Despite all the automated remain accidents. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The Brazilian Gustavo acquitted him and his colleagues from top to bottom with Fruchtpüree than the colossal hand blenders spiral out of control. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Splatter fits the art of cinema? </seg>
<seg id="3"> The director Nicolas winding Refn testing with his fighters-epic "Walhalla Rising" old genre-borders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In what may the Danish director Nicolas winding Refn have thought, as he "Walhalla Rising" has? </seg>
<seg id="5"> A captured Vikings-warriors with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) freed themselves from his Peinigern and places with almost superhuman powers rushed his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody Action, precisely because our hero like rough killing methods and its enemies to Gedärme leap from the vibrant limb when he has bad-tempered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On the other hand, says Einauge, as it is called, the whole film about a word, and the other characters can at most be to one or two sentences or a few painful death shouting. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Otherwise, kept silence and in the gruselig fine Hügellandschaft Scotland geschwelgt, the Wikingerwelt offers of around a thousand years ago the scene. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Ideal more for adult Cineasten with interest for Existentialismus and very calm camera journeys. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Well, if a film has several target groups, it is a pity if they are mutually exclusive. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Orchestrator winding Refn applies since his wild and gestylten drug dealer trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but refuses stoically, his works with a little more mainstream humour or a little less brutality the Arthouse accessible. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Most art cinema-friends are around the spritzenden brain mass and the Gedärmen deterred. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Action-fans will die from boredom, if Einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship after Jerusalem arousing popular and is an eternity in the doldrums and fog before the team arrives in America and there remains silent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany has found no cinema-distribution and now only on DVD. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is particularly the magnificent pictures a shame, but also because, behind the prätentiösen until bluttriefenden facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In This film is not about dialogues or a stringent action, it is all atmosphere, a film a fever dream. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> And there is no escape for the spectators. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Refn takes him barely a moment of détente and drawn him with his icy images and the dark drift-like sound track very slowly cut the throats, but above all with the incredible hatred of him from the heart of the characters. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Only a small blonder boy, the Einauge faithful, retains a presumption that all others are driven by anger. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The vast majority of the one-eyed man hero whose motives are never explained, but may be ambassador for enemies and temporary allies will eventually warriors from the hell of the devil himself. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It means destruction, but perhaps only for the Verdorbenen anyway. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="1"> Mysterious Erdarbeiten </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Atomic Energy authority IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But the country refuses to comment - nor is it controls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> About midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 fighter planes, a mysteriöses würfelförmiges building in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is on the banks of the Euphrates, the next major city 30 miles away, is Dair as-Saur. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Her name appears in the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) documents, when it comes to the reactor, Syria allegedly built with help from North Korea in the Quader has hidden in a valley by the electricity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing of the US-Auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA by the end of April 2008 would also under the name of the nearby town of el-Kibar normal reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium - to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes against the technology from the fifties. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA ran a video presentation with blurred satellite images. </seg>
<seg id="10"> By Computeranimation ignored it, where the components of the reactor before the destruction, a verkleinerte copy of North Korea model from the Yongbyon nuclear center. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Moreover, it presented photographs that show the buildings from near or even interior space. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor was briefly stood before the operation, it said, but not yet with pellets peppers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more than it was then known, the mystery with time rather bigger. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Former US President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack was fairly sure that Syria in al-Kibar a reactor built, but hardly saw evidence that it was in the country, "an active nuclear weapons programme '. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some intelligence officers in Europe are even more cautious and only talk of a 'alleged reactor, "even if the CIA presentation for" plausible ". </seg>
<seg id="16"> You lack of hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Asked how confident he was to have a reactor, said a senior UN diplomat in summer only flat, the IAEA "has enough material to ask questions". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The ruins of the alleged "unused military building" surpassed the Syrians eager aside and planierten thoroughly premises. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, in June 2008 a IAEA-Team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Moreover, the IAEA on a Member State satellite images of commercial providers the period immediately after the attack, which might be more powerful than the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, these recordings on the market, not because of the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - it has bought exclusive. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The IAEA can therefore not independently verify its authenticity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always claimed that never operated a secret nuclear program or to have built a reactor. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But the IAEA to analyse the particles as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss - as well as on the satellite images. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Inspectors also denied a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the rubble of bombed-out building. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But Israel says pugnaciously. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We will never comment on," said recently at the time of the attack acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Dragging the investigation of the case since June 2008 and fruitless "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority, as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna gives - after all, is a grave violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area, about IAEA watchdog. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As a key to progress in the investigation to the IAEA apparently sees three more bodies, "functional link" with the alleged reactor And this still exist. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The inspectors have not disclosed what plants are, or what they are or what they seem suspicious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung they are in the IAEA internally as Marj as-Sultan Masyaf and Iskandariayah described, in turn, derived from nearby towns. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and on a complex in Masyaf, in which it is most probably one of the suspicious objects. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It is probably in or directly next to a military base - precisely with this justification denied Syria IAEA access to the three locations. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In Vienna, the Syrians feared a rather than fishing expedition - that the IAEA by the United States will vorgeschickt auszuspähen military installations. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Because the nuclear detectives were the result of a tip of the US intelligence services on the institutions closely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the Euphrates Quader material was moved back and forth. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could "in connection with the fuel production". </seg>
<seg id="40"> But there were "no evidence of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes that are necessary to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The type of reactor will not enriched uranium, which is. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But where the uranium could have come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated on these central issues there are plausible conjecture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> It is also unclear whether other debris that could bring valuable traces stored at the three locations. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As if the hundreds of lorry loads of disappeared, nobody wants information about where the rubble. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Only a few kilometers from al-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, salt mine al-Tibni Syria 1998 to investigate its suitability as a camp for radioactive waste, the IAEA as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had it in a recent analysis of satellite images for the venerable magazine Jane's Intelligence Review associated with the reactor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Footage from the orbiting but show that Syria to the three suspect sites Erdarbeiten and large container, after the IAEA access had requested. </seg>
<seg id="48"> That cannot be coincidence, but has hardly helped dispel the suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> It is also stated In diplomatic circles, have spent many months to develop a plan for inspections of the IAEA, which should allow Syria to safeguard any military secrets - alone shows how much interest the inspectors is the effort. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte this proposal too. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Western diplomats in Vienna had a year ago assuaged, the reactor was destroyed, therefore, have no high urgency, brings the matter around US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months called special inspections into the game, one of the harshest means the Vienna nuclear authority to enforce controls. </seg>
<seg id="52"> IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, these inspections should propose, has already spoken of a "option, for which I am open in the future", but even he is hesitant. </seg>
<seg id="53"> It is a high risk in this way: It needs for a majority On the board of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented are anything other than eager for an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other hand, as a diplomat recalled: "What if they end up nothing? </seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The movement for democracy in Latin America will be stronger, such as the support of private companies. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="5"> These results came the Latinobarómetro survey carried out in 18 countries and exclusively was published in The Economist. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This survey is being carried out regularly since 1995 and shows that the change in this region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two facts in this year's survey in September and October, particularly in's eye. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First, the good mood in Latin America </seg>
<seg id="9"> And secondly the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In many countries of the South American Pacific coast has greatly increased the democratic movement (so table 1). </seg>
<seg id="11"> In Peru, for example, where the economy is growing at approximately 6% year since 2002, the number of democracy advocates of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In Mexico, where the economy since the onset last year recovered, is such a trend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries of the region, are what the regional average cuts (so Diagram 2). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Approximately 44% of respondents said that they are satisfied with their country's democratic practice. The same as last year, 25% more than in 2001 (diagram 3). </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values are those of last year, but show a sharp increase from 2003 (17% and 24%). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> A decade ago undermined efforts to Latin America's economic crisis, more democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Also during the global economic crisis lasted perhaps is that the countries of Latin America experienced only a brief recession and a speedy recovery. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Moreover, the poor absorbed by a stronger social network. </seg>
<seg id="19"> (According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America only slightly and is again this year fell by 32%.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But there is strong mood from country to country differences (so diagram 4). </seg>
<seg id="21"> Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread Fortschrittsdenken. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In Mexico and Central America, where the recession mount and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Only the second time since the poll began many respondents in Latin America in a bigger problem than crime in their country in the unemployment (5). </seg>
<seg id="24"> Some 31% say that either they or a family member last year were victims of a crime. But declined the values and 38% last year, reaching the lowest level since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The rising economic performance is reflected in the greater support from the private and the market economy: around 71% of respondents on regional said that the private sector is essential for the development, in 2007 there were 56% (6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> Approximately 58% said that only the market economy their country can bring progress, compared with 47% last year. </seg>

<seg id="2"> In the weeks after the sudden death of your man told Argentina's President Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, their popularity rate by 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest level since her election in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But whether its a re-election next year, it depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández is further compromises as her late husband, Néstor Kirchner, her predecessor and political partner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The signs are not clear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Néstor Kirchner, even after the election, his wife economic policy, was often budget plans, the tax revenue, economic growth and inflation not fully into account. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This allowed the couple to spend the extra revenue as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On paper, the Fernández-government lost the majority in Congress last year. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is divided and Kirchners death after a heart attack on 27 October, leading to further Zerwürfnissen. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But after chaotic meetings (where a Member of Parliament another in the face, and other proposed the government policy of corruption), the Congress, the budget for 2011. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="11"> "I will not discuss," the President. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The 2010 budget applies now for the next year, which the President has more opportunity to spend money as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy is hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official inflation rate is z.Z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - up to almost 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner took office in 2003, when Argentina was beset by economic crisis, said growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not reduce inflation. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He refused to cooperate with the IMF, has singled out for bullying as the private sector and säuberte the National Institute for Statistics and census INDEC, prompting the official inflation statistics schönte. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="20"> The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have a strong boost to the economy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But inflation undermined the growth spurt by a large devaluation in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Perhaps to Cristina Fernández why Argentina financial economically back to the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Earlier this year, the government had rejected a previous refinancing agreement with shareholders of the country in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Fernández Now appears on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which it owes about $6.7 billion. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Kirchners have had a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere, always rejected. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But last month, the economy minister, Amado Boudou, announced that the Fund in the drafting of a new national consumer price index "technical assistance". It looks as if this is the first step to clean up the INDEC. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not known whether Fernández after leaving office without the support of her husband politically active. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If so, it needs to get the support of the middle class, which largely enough by Kirchnerism. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the Argentinians will return from their summer holidays, in March the wave of Sympatie she was shown abgeebbt. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The discovery of an alien variety, including arsenic can live opens new opportunities for new forms of life on earth, and elsewhere </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Although scientists this unusual bacterium here on earth, it is their view, a sign that a life without the hitherto considered vital elements is possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "This organism has two options." </seg>
<seg id="5"> "He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "That makes it a very particular reason, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' way of life is," said Paul C.W. Davies of the Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears in the online edition of the journal Science on Thursday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> So far, six main elements were regarded as vital - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> But as the scientists figured out, there is a growing bacterium in the Californian mono Lake even further if it phosphorus replaced by arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "One wonders what else is possible," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is an important step in the search for außerirdischem life, as scientists and his life forms must recognise Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study deals microbes have been found on Earth. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The announcement of a press conference in which no details were given to the discovery, led to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report by the discovery Außerirdischen life could act. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "shows that organisms in other planet systems, with the help of other elements biochemical processes can set in motion and that the 'standard', which we believe are absolutely vital, not necessarily elements are imposed," according Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute held University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockel was not part of the research teams. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "This work is a first, because it shows that in fundamental biochemical processes and structures element can be replaced by another," added Cockell. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> This discovery was not accidental. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Felisa Wolfe-Simon from Astrobiologischen NASA Institute, who chaired the study, chose the mono Lake because of the high arsenic levels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Since arsenic and phosphorus chemically identical, that microbes that both are exposed, perhaps they can replace an element from the other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "The toxicity of the Arsens is based mainly on the fact that it is chemically similar as organaphosphorous." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "By the organisms find it hard to distinguish, an element from the other." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "But the difference is so great that arsenic different than phosphorus. it in our biochemisches system, where it covered almost everything," says Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers used the bacterium GFAJ-1 rising arsenic concentration from It suited to and grew. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The microbe is growing phosphorus better, but that they also can survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based life form can happen, of course, either on the ground or another planet or moon on the arsenic occurs more frequently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> According to Jamie S. Foster, Dozentin for microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorous can be replaced by arsenic, not new, But so far there has been no functioning example. </seg>

<seg id="9"> In August, the manager Harry Sloan replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, through his work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts became known. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The efforts of Moelis & Cooper, the financial worries to solve MGMs and more than 140 Gläuber of studios auszubezahlen, lasted longer than expected. </seg>

<seg id="8"> There are more and more button-cell-powered toys on the market, and many of them contain wiederaufladbare batteries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Here are a few suggestions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> (Unless otherwise indicated, are all prices of toys "R" Us.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for children from the age of 3 years) are Plüschfiguren, as big as sea pig that if you sing a note on its belly. </seg>

<seg id="22"> The versions not compatible with older cassettes. </seg>

<seg id="7"> The Justice Ministry did not comment on the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The judgment was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In its opinion, there was sufficient evidence that the lobbying Ensign prohibition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Interviews, e-mails and other documents, for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times were made public, gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of its election agents to lucrative contracts, in order to buy his silence over an affair with Hamptons wife Cynthia. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> While the Justice Department officially rejected it, the reasons for the decision in the Ensign-known case, said Mr. fire and other ethics lawyers, the ministry seems very cautious in rather political charges after a lot of defeat by the media with great interest, including the decision last year that the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens because of misconduct by the prosecutor to drop. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Prosecutors "are obviously scared detention," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the association, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington "(an organisation whose aim is to combat corruption in parliamentary and government circles in the United States), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr. Ensign has brought to court. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "That basically means that a high government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Paul Coggins, main defenders of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call on Monday, a prosecutor and a further the next day, in which he was told that the Ministry will raise no complaints against his clients. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr. Coggins refused to explain the legal arguments it had made with prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "I am not well in the conversation details between me and the Ministry of Justice. Just say this much: we believe the right decision," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop the investigation for a separate complaint with the ethics group, after a payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensigns parents to the Hamptons against the federal election law. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and one other customers from Nevada, Allegiant Air, agreed to lunch and asked the transport Minister, a meeting on behalf of the airline to agree after Mr. Hampton to lobby had stopped. </seg>

<seg id="15"> Some lawyers say, court judgments, which Mr. Hayes condemnation half a century later, could follow the lead of the argument that new rules are necessary for the communication from the courtroom at the time of the fall Dr Sheppard were unimaginable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "There is a good reason to be worried about the impact of new media in processes that will be followed by a broader public," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School, who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut. according to his report, they arbitrarily imposed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor Donohue said, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that restricting a prompt communication from inside the courtroom could make the process fair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Twitter issue is just one of many, the lawyers of Mr. Hayes explain to discuss years and thus delaying a condemnation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defenders claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes has already been explanation as judge Blue could not allow them to test the reaction of potential judges giving them during the Jurorenauswahl grey cent scene photos showed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some of the judges said that photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-petit, 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years, they would have met with disgust. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defenders say that they are also called into question the constitutionality of the death penalty, and argue that the judge mistakenly a jury have exchanged views, a critic of the department, and that he was improperly exerted pressure on the ruling, as he had taken the unusual decision, the jury over the weekend. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The judges were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But their arguments about the impact of the extensive reporting on the process is perhaps the greatest interest. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In a judgment appeals they have submitted last month, they made that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American Senate candidate was discussed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They argued that the new media continually re-igniting the flames of emotion on the case. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "Such a daily crush of Medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," wrote lawyers' has previously in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide has not yet seen. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Their focus on reporting by Twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are rabble-rousing but slower than the reports will be reimbursed, a technology hostile view is reporting on future processes verarme. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> However, some lawyers said, Appelationsgerichte would often faced with the argument that social and technological changes requires the Adaptation through the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr. Hayers lawyers reinforce this assertion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In their appeal to the Supreme Court of 1966, in the condemnation of Dr Sheppard due to the coverage has been lifted and made it clear that the new media, new rules require. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> After a campaign to Schimpfwörtern and negativity is little courtesy erupted in Washington this week. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It is the sign of a genuine two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion, before we quickly back to fight the parties in the capital returns? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress produced no breakthrough on the big issues, while the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a period of government in which no decisions to be taken. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After all, what we hear, it has not been a polite discussion between two sides an account of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of partisan collection points. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meeting of the deficit of the President's on Wednesday was also civilised, despite the political differences between the members to continue. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months a mutual respect, of the ideological divide that separates them, the members. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> That is hardly enough to claim that it is a new era of cooperation here. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Both sides are now in a test phase - one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise, while tried the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters weigh after a new party warfare. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants at a minimum requirements or accusations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep for rapid change the atmosphere in the past two years </seg>
<seg id="12"> Whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or benefits, the two sides are miles apart. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Finally, the November election Washington at least for a short time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, now working for "the Ethics and Public Policy Center '. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "It is inevitable after elections. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elections may appear partisan passions. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And that is a good thing. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the "lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution." </seg>
<seg id="19"> Bush's tax cuts, at the end of the year, and no one in the end. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, either temporarily or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Similarly, a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that believing that favors tax cuts for the rich, while unemployed workers support. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House is the increased optimism that, in these issues during the "lame duck session" and also the new START treaty can ratify. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation in pressing issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation the parties must, if the new 112. Congress will convene in January. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead, he says, is a period of not once immensely more likely, perhaps even inevitable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "After the things that need to be done, are done, this short-term psychology in turn confrontation," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - courtesy of genuine cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "I see a lot of what is happening from today until 2012, when Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event in 2012," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Teeparty-voters who were instrumental in their education. </seg>
<seg id="29"> How concerned the Republican leaders also may be that they vie too high, they know that they must try to their promise to reduce government spending and healthcare reform. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> This party lines are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the deficit Commission clearly what a tax reform and raising some taxes and raising the retirement age and reduce government spending. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, insisted that the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission, in order to make its plan to official recommendation and they are very close to this number. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The greatest resistance in the elected representatives of the body, since in financial issues, today at least, little room or little sympathy for compromises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Galston says two stages in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The first battle next year in the form of party clashes, if the Republicans in the state budget, taxes and the health system, later followed by a period of major zweiparteilicher cooperation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> Public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It has been proved that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties work together. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If confrontation is a blind alley, as happened in 1995, then both parties must carefully to ensure the public reaction. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Whoever is doomed to lose, will change tack and seek the compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> This may indeed be an optimistic view. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Partisanship and polarization is greater now than in the mid-1990's, and they seem a more ideological divide between Obama and the Congress to Republicans than that between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At the same time activists on both parties 2010 as a mere prelude to a far broader election in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> So it may be the courtesy to display this week will be welcomed by many Americans. </seg>
<seg id="45"> But it will require much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the issues that the two still separated. </seg>

<seg id="10"> With each of these developments grew fear among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs hindered their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organisation, the regime. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "For them, life under the Khmer Rouge is impressive, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials, the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The deal was in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov Security Summit announced an additional article. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The US government has for years tried to convince Belarus, not collect more highly enriched uranium and seemed to have achieved a hurdle last spring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But officials of the US government told the Washington Post that in the last two months, two secret agreements with Belarus have been taken to remove Belarus 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a research center. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The agreement on Wednesday, setting the stage for the rest of the material to be removed, according to an official staff because of the sensitivity of the subject, anonymous, approximately 500 pounds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear security summit in April, the White ruled Russia. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And it was obvious good enough, at the invitation of the former Soviet republic to secure the next summit in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I was really thrilled about the fact that they want a nuclear security summit (2012) seat." </seg>
<seg id="10"> "It shows me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the partnership Global security, a group promoting nuclear safety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Clinton called the agreement "a very significant step" of Belarus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, within four years to secure all vulnerable nuclear material. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since then, the US government six countries helped her to get rid of highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Belarus will be the seventh. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus has declared that the nation will never abandon their uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "How retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos of what fundamentally weapons is capable of, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said then. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "This is our commodity... </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We use it only for research purposes, this dirty bombs and we will not sell." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Belarus still approached a few months ago the US meeting on an agreement anzeigte than interest. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The first attempt to remove the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material easily contaminated by radiation, say officials. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It was in a Spezialzug load, the more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The US government pays $14 million for this effort, with a large part of the money in the Belarusian research with depleted uranium, which can be used for nuclear weapons. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The caretaker board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but first rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, he sees a collapse in interest rate spreads, the banks are trying to offset with increases of fees and prices for loans. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Sabadell expected in three years million private customers - a consensus still exists. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="5"> Sabadell has found the way to the next three years, and so in a very difficult economic environment. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The Bank will introduce a new Dreijahresleitplan 2011. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The objective is not only to survive without public aid from the FROB to take market share, but also a million private customers - 700 000 if the customers, the bank will lose - to increase. This is the great challenge facing this Bank, because until now it has their business customers more attention than their retail customers. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This year it has 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Its market share in retail is 3.5 per cent, while the business customers more than 10 per cent. </seg>

<seg id="12"> Sabadell will complete its master plan Optima set four years ago this year. This was initially interpreted to three years, but due to the market situation he was extended for a year. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The Customers who leave the savings banks, are the main objective of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="14"> At a breakfast organised by the APIE stressed Guardiola, 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with a longer range." </seg>
<seg id="15"> The manager expects Spain would only "slow" out of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Moreover, it would be "very difficult", in two or three years' work crucial to the survival of the banks. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Even if he assumes that the war for liabilities - the interest margins punished - will abate, will the risk premia, banks and building societies must pay for their emissions to maintaining liquidity as compensation for sagging profit margins already shifted onto the price of loans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "The issues liquidity and funding are of a structural nature, and they will put pressure on the loans." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We have not tap off the tap, but the Zinsdifferenziale are very high," Guardiola said. </seg>
<seg id="20"> BANESTO Thursday were already ordering their Filialnetz from restricting the granting of long-term loans, and to increase the Zinsdifferenziale (cf. Cinco Díaz on 22 and 27 November). </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility that it could come to a wave of mergers of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry will be restructured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> As the concentration of Spanish savings banks began, there were several savings banks in the first phase. They retained the second round. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand, assured the Director-General of the Spanish savings banks Federation (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round would not take place. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "I believe that the majority of the merger is completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the group Banca Cívica cannot be considered a second round, it was rather adjustments." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="8"> "The transition from 45 savings with an average of 28 000 million of assets at 17 with 75 500 million is a historically unvergleichbarer process.

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin has opted for keeping the euro, but at the same time, conditions for the whole of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tensions in the markets have a dual response from the government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has submitted new adaptation measures, starting with tax reliefs for small and micro-enterprises, regulating temporary work agencies or the lifting of the 426 euro support for the unemployed, no unemployment benefit related to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of airports Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former Prime Minister Felipe González, the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis presents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How are these transactions to understand? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their public relations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is Germany a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future to maintain ancient traditions clash of much of its partners. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Given the resistance in Europe begins one in Germany to spekuliern on three possible ways out of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first: A strong euro Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south to leave the euro area. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Second: The reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - although it is more science fiction sounds - supported by a large part of public opinion, approximately 50% of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The Third: A transformation of the euro under German proposals. This means: More macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; penalise the countries, broken; möglichereweise the default of certain countries, and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures on the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is clear and has been for some time. So there are no excuses now. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission for deficits, and the German Government constitutional reform, in order to prevent it from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It was the first signs of the polarisation between what Germany was thought necessary (strict fiscal plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second sign the Central European country than Merkel postponed the decision to save Greece painful,. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Then it was strongly criticised. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published absolutely against a rescue of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally, Merkel in the last October days again with a clear position, It calls for a reform of the European Union agreements, to enable the rescue of one country while private lenders to commit a part of the cost. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position was interpreted as anti-European, since they propelled Ireland crisis and everything. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But her proposal, if a little sweetened, was approved in the coming months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which these measures from 2013. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has drawn a red line that it intends not to exceed. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It says all that - even if unpopular measures must be taken, from that date there will no longer be the old ways of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="24"> 2013 will be the birth of a new currency area, in which the countries to ban be severely punished, be forced to declare themselves bankrupt and in this case, the private sector must play a part of the cost. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows us that we need a strong growth path, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as was mentioned by Spain in boom times, will simply not be tolerated. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would badly do not understand it. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not just about the deficit to 3% by the year 2013 runterzufahren. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much harder. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Under these conditions, And the worst thing we could do is to cheat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the current turbulence in more calm. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And that we will use the opportunities offered to us by early 2013. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero has taken this so well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel hypothesis, in order to make their way. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Sport and usually bypass </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tricks as Alonso and Ramos in the match against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the desire to bypass a sanction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The supposedly from two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) has instigated exclusion in the game on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League led to much ink has been shed about, whether it was a unsportliche act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA. </seg>
<seg id="4"> As is well known, lost two players a few minutes before game end (their team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls, now the second yellow card by referee showed. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way, and since the Real Madrid his group, the two players would meet the prescribed sanction the next league game against Auxerre and without maps in the next game phase. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Finally, the Disziplinarkommitee of UEFA, the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different sums of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow card in this or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed in the sport's rules. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of the debate that have arisen outlined the case goes back to that a team of football clubs, Real Madrid (his anthem Edelmut claims and honour and on other occasions his players for similar incidents had punished) played the key role, and the drama by Mourinho, the episode has added to its long history, more than theatralischer and provocative technicians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case, the debate about whether this is not explicitly prohibited by the statutes behaviour contradicts the principles of the sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a rule circumvention. indeed, this approach to the statutes of the sport, but its meaning. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The damage caused to the sporting spirit should be examined in this matter. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that was not compromised by these actions, because there was no aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that to ban players an unjustified. Also benefits from the team that has not been done. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradox of the action of Real Madrid's players is that they do not correspond to what we normally under wrong game or rule bypass understand, because the circumvention of the rule has not been secretly, in order to avoid a penalty, but it should be as conspicuous as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players waited and took the sanction happily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is what kind of advantage the offender from the deliberate fouls. </seg>
<seg id="17"> It should be emphasised that the rival either in a disadvantageous position was still benefits for the feigned game were erheischt because the obvious result of this action was that the team with fewer players had to play. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because then the club does not have these players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Obviously The advantage is that the players the next phase of the Champions League game without tickets, their participation in a future game could begin. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a long-term, up to a certain point uncertain advantage because the team could eventually retire. With this approach, players also receive a sanction and go in the second cycle on cards, because card accumulation with a card less than in the first cycle of departures. </seg>
<seg id="21"> So it is not clear whether it is really an advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the sporting spirit, also include strategic decisions from the rules a maximum benefit. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case the players wanted to avoid any penalty (that would actually be a clear case of rule bypass), they wanted more when they undergo this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They took a strategic decision, without a sentence or to flee before her. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Although the border between imagination and Regelumgebung is, I believe, that this is a clear case of inventiveness. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: Because two exclusions and because of the way the provoking Regelübertragung. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The damage done to the principles of the sport by these acts is less ethical than aesthetic. </seg>

<seg id="5"> At the beginning of 2005 ergatterte the consortium "Énergie gérance" the lucrative contract without a public tender. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For the Parti Québécois is resorting to companies consortia a serious ethical problem that the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung and a price increase. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "This is a new way of conspiracy and refuted the competition." </seg>

<seg id="24"> Réal Laporte, the major employers of Société d 'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement the nose on the fact that the Treaty on the project management after agreement was approved. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "If you make a tender and there are few candidate will your prices soar." </seg>
<seg id="26"> "You have two options: Either you do the people who see in this Mart and say: We will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The consortium "Énergie gérance" amount appropriated is one of a long list of contracts on more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The UN yesterday in Cancun a plan to regenerate the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (CFC) suggested that almost a third of the additional reduction, which must be implemented in order to stabilise the earth's climate by 2020. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This ambitious plan adopted its position in the concrete steps to implement large projects in Cancun, the UN hopes to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by developed countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> After yesterday's plan would the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the lighting on the Earth's CFCs be avoided if the white glowing pears, which has a monopoly of 50% to 70% of the market, be replaced by fluoreszierende or, better still, by Leuchtdioden (led). </seg>
<seg id="5"> The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is the equivalent of 70% of emissions of global vehicle fleets. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In Copenhagen last year, the big Abgasemittenten as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans, the global CFC emissions of 53 Gt to 49 Gt downsized. </seg>
<seg id="8"> By This account but we should still withdraw 5 Gt, from now until 2020 to stabilise the climate increase to 2 degrees Celsius, in order to prevent this spiral out of control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the White glowing pears hole 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light. </seg>
<seg id="10"> With the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, with the new LED bulbs reduced these energy needs two fold again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen keep on average between 6,000 and 10,000 hours. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The new LED bulbs, such as those of manufacturers Philips has put on the market this week - incidentally, this society has attended the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a fervent pear, know what gives a hint of the savings of the Auswechselungsplanes, should be applied in 100 countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> In addition to the fact that iese completely new light bulbs very little heat, they can also make a rule resistance work. </seg>
<seg id="14"> And they do not contain any mercury. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Several experts have shown that Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves, because they contain mercury and therefore as hazardous waste dump, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except the producers must provide an adoption agency. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, not the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal plants that emit far more mercury to produce the White fervent pears wasted electricity. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the United States alone that coal plants 25,000 tons of mercury annually. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The report sets out in detail the profits, which each country thanks to this international programme would generate. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Indonesia would such a billion dollars a year in buying electricity and save eight million tonnes of CO2, which means the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose spiritual Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The affair WikiLeaks has a twofold significance. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On one hand, it proved to be an obvious scandal dictator, a scandal, only a scandal in Sinner hypocrisy is the Beziehunge between states, the public and the press. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other side announces it profound changes at international level, and is dominated by regression a foretaste of the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But we are going in the right order. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every Act (prepared by a secret service any nation) exclusively from newspaper cuttings. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi's throw anything further than what for months as each anyway to read any Journal (except those whose owners Berlusconi), and the frightening karikaturierte profile Gaddafi's offered Kabarettkünstlern had fuel for a long time for their Sketche. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The principle of the secret dossier should only be already known news is essential for the dynamism of the secret services, and not just in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go to a library, esotherischen publications, you will see that every plant (on the grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) repeatedly exactly what has been written already in previous works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is not, therefore, that the author occult texts alone (still so that he does not know where news about the non-exist to find), but because those who devote to Okkultismus in nothing other than what they already know and confirmed what they have learned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Also the secret files. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informant is lazy and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (for example, it could otherwise be whatever editor in Libération), the only true considers what he acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Top Secret information on Berlusconi, the American Embassy in Rome sent the Staatsdezernat were the same as those who already Newsweek published the week before. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> So why was such a fuss about the revelations of this dossier? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On one side suggests that any educated person already know and that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the Government can call each other or a plane, in order to make dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of a couple of small have changed. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Any Ermittlungsfilmen viewers know this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that acting to ignore it. </seg>
<seg id="18"> However, the fact to repeat it publicly, violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to American diplomacy in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In second place: The idea that an x-random hacker intelligence secrets can tap into the most powerful country in the world, is the most significant blow to the prestige of the Staatsdezernats. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, rather than victims, the scandal the "Executioner" in trouble. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we are the profound nature of what happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Previously, Orwell's time, all controlled power as a Big Brother pool, every gesture of his subjects. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwell's prophecy could have proved quite right since then where one can control thanks to the phone every movement, every transaction, visited the hotel, the elected motorway and so on; the citizens would total victims the eye of power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But if we see what is happening today, even the secret Krypten power can no longer control of a Hackers escape, to be directed Kontrollgang listening to unilaterally and will circle shaped. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - chosen as avenger by the citizen - the secrets of power in experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> How can a power that is no longer able to protect their own secrets? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is a hollow secret (and an empty secret can never be unveiled); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's essentially a secret is free of Geheimis, because it exposes the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty secrets were meant to deprive it of any power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> WikiLeaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wronged but Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What will be the consequences of this injury, which has caused a big power? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the states in future no longer online information - that would be a reserved in the street corner angeklebten form. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is also clear that with the current technology in vain hope is confidential reports on telephone secret. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is easier than finding out whether and when a Head of state in a plane and one of his colleagues contacted. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could in future private and only for certain ears certain relations? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know very well that my prediction at the moment for science fiction and Roman prison sounds, but I am forced to imagine the government agents in secret way preoccupied on uncontrollable march routes shattering, their communications anywhere else than the mere memory of order and, moreover, the few written information they received in the footwear (verbergend. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information would be stored in single copy in closed drawers: Basically the Spionageversuch of Watergate had less success, as WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity to write that the technology as a cancer progresses, namely backwards. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A century after the wireless telecommunications Count revolutionised communications had reconstructed the Internet a Telegrafen with (telephone) line. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The (analogue) video had the film allows them a film band for broadband auszukundschaften by forward from behind spulen and all could reveal mysteries of the assembly, while the (digital) CDs, today nothing other than from chapter to chapter to jump in macro-portions. </seg>

<seg id="4"> With the Copenhagen treaty the developing countries have committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The EU has EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> At the opening of the COP16, the EU has pulled out all the stops in order to convince its partners from the fact their commitment regarding the fast-start financing: Detailgetreuer report their Member States, press conference, big-events, brochures distribution. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The operation is remarkable and transparency engenders around appreciated for their intrinsic value: The developing countries and the society would like to see all developed countries, the same thing at the same level of precision. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The EU announced EUR 2.2 billion in 2010 to have released what they on the right path to Respektbezollung commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But if you look in detail, things are a little more complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should be according to the Copenhagen treaty "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional deployment, without detriment of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what the "new and additional" means. </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the Commission had proposed a harmonisation, certain Member states, including France, to block the procedure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today everyone chooses The benchmark, which he considers the best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The EU Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those of 2009: The international funding are maintained, and 150 million in "fast start-up financing framework" over three years. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries have similar standards, either on year or about conditions at the level of public development aid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In return, France was of the opinion that the funding of all new projects "of the year 2010 are" new and additional ". </seg>
<seg id="17"> In other words, there is no guidelines on the spending of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Specifically, the sum total of French support for developing countries remain stable (or decline) - France, his commitment to the "new and additional funding." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is still no rule, and everyone chooses his Rechenmodus. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, such as France, 1 borrowed €as being equivalent to €1 donated. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Obviously this is not acceptable that the effort is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loans for certain profitable investment (often linked to the emission reduction projects based on the most effective technology) cannot be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro, as equivalent to a donated euro captured... should also be included only the cost of the loan for the capital donor country than commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France has nothing else in terms than the following consideration: it "respected" its commitment of EUR 420 million by 91.5% loan (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% donates) 36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to convince themselves. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only land the EU that loans to a great extent. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among other things) their commitments to 100% with donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €to fulfil their obligations, France just 10 cents and understands including a comparable efforts. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Fine Hokuspokus! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> All in all, operates France in its fast-start financing with a double fraud: To part with a Weiterentwicklkung of action over the period and partly with the reality of financial support. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France manage to believe that 420 million "new and additional" has spent millions in accordance with its promise and saves EUR 36.1 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the Treasury (as it appears that it was Bercy has implemented the arbitrage) could entail a double negative impact; even EU internally (why the other Member states, with the donations, if there is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries is not completely deceived... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter of premature funding only a small issue on relatively short time compared to the discussions on the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it could be too much in the massive machinery of the UNFCCC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> We hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As always, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year of early funding. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In the first instance France could be a change in its accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, and in a spirit of respect for his commitments and the counterbalancing justice with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> But especially France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of long-term financing dispute (another key topic) and at the moment: You can escape the question of "Verrechenbarkeit" or the recording its loans. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could change its position as progressive in terms of the issues to be as it is for other things. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The hope is based on the new environment minister Kosciusko-Morizet next week in Cancun will arrive. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A surprising announcement on the fast-start France and his vision of "Verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loans would increase the international confidence by nature, which is necessary for further discussions. </seg>
