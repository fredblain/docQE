<seg id="1"> What they should do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort, or the "Konditorei." </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new Office of Capital gentlemen from the ranks of the ČSSD apparently certain must overcome language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and in the town of representation at all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has members of the new Council of ČSSD times a little abgeklopft ', " as they dominate the notorious slang, the custom has in recent years in which the current coalition partners in Prague at the helm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The codierte vocabulary, which was introduced in the mattered era of Mayor Pavel Bém of the Prague political elite, some of the best-known actors, borrowed situations and Causae. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Surprisingly, showed that the new councils in relation to these new concepts of something in the dark. </seg>
<seg id="6"> They claim that at least. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Who is Voldemort?" </seg>
<seg id="8"> "No idea." </seg>
<seg id="9"> " I am more of a newcomer in the Prague policy, " Lukáš Kaucký responded that the new Council Mr for culture, to the test of the ' Godfather ' vocabulary. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But the Council Mr Karel Březina, a political veteran, responded in a similar way. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example, to the concept of ' golf hole. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "That is the only expression of which you are presenting me, which I occasionally use." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Otherwise, I do not think much of slang." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> From the vocabulary that the days of leaf Aktuálně.cz in this year's June prior to the election of the ODS congress was published, the editors pickte six terms, especially those that are notoriously associated with the Prague government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Social Democrats should go the concepts of "Voldemort," "greatest Prague golf hole," "into the Konditorei," "bull neck," "betrayal of the capital," and "verblechen define." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Three Council Prague gentlemen agreed to the test, the fourth, Mr Weinert, the future head of the Prague education, first promised his participation in the conversation, but then not even the listeners. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The fifth council, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "These are things I don't care, and how the Civic Democrats talking among themselves, I shall not." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "It is important for me, as we understand in the context of our programmes," he konterte. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> As has been suggested, would have Lukáš Kaucký supposedly in the above-mentioned headline not recognized by the influential businessman and friend of the ex-Oberbürgermeisters Bém, Roman Janoušek. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The term "Voldemort" says Kaucky nothing and the only word he correctly in the test erriet, was "the greatest Prague golf hole." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "It is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, added to the security but added: "but what I know from the newspaper." </seg>
<seg id="23"> And jokingly: "I will have to take a language course." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> "The golf hole" will not only of matador Karel Březina, but also by the Council on the Environment Lukáš Plachý right as entziffert Blanka tunnel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Both Social Democrats also know, however, for whom the concept of Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find this character is, and also what it means to go "in the Konditorei." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "I believe, that is, in a Prague restaurant operation," Plachý is pretty close to the solution to the problem, if you know that this is the headquarters of Janoušeks firms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> He is in line with Březina asserts, however, this knowledge is more likely to have drawn from the newspaper that he would be this vocabulary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> After the test participants, it seems, indeed, under the Social Democrats to be no similar naturalisations slang. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I have asked my colleagues, but there is obviously something that we really do not." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "We call upon us, and we also use acronym or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - from his party colloquially called "Hulda." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "I was in school Bříza (Birke), but I do not know whether to call my colleagues," tells us, Karel Březina his nickname. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried out the name and behold - he works. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Council Mr Weinert is less friendly to the party-friendly " one's grandfather " or the " old, " the representative Miroslav Poche, the well-known Czech Lego-figure before the elections by machinations at the party's sponsorship vocal, some colleagues ' Igráček " (). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Nicknames are the only one that the Social Democrats in the intra-Party parlance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Hulínský may not, if it is called ' Hulda ', but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> His colorful name "doctor of rubber truncheons-rights" allegedly related to the fact that Hulínský Petr his title Doctor legal has acquired in the Bratislaver Police Academy. </seg>

<seg id="50"> In 2600 homes remains the rent next year at the same level. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not rent leaps, but gradually within four and eight years ago. </seg>
<seg id="52"> What is more, the company imposed a further commitment: all revenue from the rent increase (see diagram) wants to put the company back into their homes, especially in heat savings - in new windows and insulation. </seg>

<seg id="6"> The facade of the house is playing with a dream of lines, zärtlichen paints and Texturen in nature and living creatures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Only on closer inspection, we noticed that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful planning. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the night the whole facade is still plastic, dramatic and the special Anleuchtung reinforced the luster of the paint. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The same dynamic lines and tortuous forms also dominate the interior of the House. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Waves geformtes wood copied the window frames, support, Zierelemente of doors, even Gucklöcher and trade. </seg>

<seg id="12"> The reconstruction took two years and was completed 1906. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The investor, the wealthy industrialists Josep Batlló was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a new building, but ultimately, he agreed to the idea Gaudís on an unusual and cheaper renovation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The Miets house Casa Batlló devised, Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone. </seg>
<seg id="15"> He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol together. </seg>
<seg id="16"> On the drawing board is the Dekorationen for representative apartment realities of the owner and the use of Mosaiken the facade was his idea. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In the design of the facade, however, also worked with many other Bildner and artists. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The joint work on the drafts of the Casa Batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation Jujola and Gaudí. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudís house Casa Milá in Güell Park, where the other works by Antoni Gaudí. </seg>

<seg id="22"> It also says that at the top of the building is the sword of Saint George, the barons of Catalonia. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But other bildhauerische elements symbolize hidden religious motives. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Gaudí devised for the house of a unique for the time Zentralheizungssystem with Entlüftungs channels and typical Kaminen. </seg>
<seg id="25"> There is something bizarre in its 45-degree inclination. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> In his creation consistently ignored Gaudí all then building codes and in no way diminished by this. </seg>
<seg id="27"> He lifted before construction of the city the appropriate a construction permit but the claims made by him on the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers two years later with the completion were so appalled by the outcome that they demanded. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The council met with gentlemen, among other things, too, that the building, with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk. </seg>
<seg id="29"> There were changes, however, not more, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call from the urban community, Josep Batlló granted an application for approval of the renting of the two highly situated floors of the House, and he was promptly. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="35"> Gaudí but also worked with a modern approach to mutual combination of spaces. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The social part can be completely by the opening of the showroom doors and a larger society could comfortably chatting and in vertraulicheren talks to a certain degree of intimacy. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1"> The right mattress and rust right beds? Women have different desires than men </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Not the tollste bed, but the quality of the deck surface, so mattress and rust from good bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Although this must complement each other in harmony, in order to respond to the wishes of the actual user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Many things in the selection of a role, the weight, the size of the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the Schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Just as important is the Interieur in mattress and rust. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a weekend house in which does not regularly heated, Latexmatratzen are not well suited, since they need much longer to be "hot." </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethane mattresses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And they should be changed regularly. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If they do not have enough Entlüftungskanälchen in the core and are on a solid record, snarled in humidity, so it is not excluded that among her tape. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the election, of course, also plays a role in what one is accustomed to. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Who is a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with soft class, will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with hard surface. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "All ice hockey players who have come back from the NHL, have complained to me that they can no longer sleep properly." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "For their abgeschundenen shoulders, and Hüften they simply need a soft layer of Visco-foam (Memory Foam, a form of memory-Polymer)." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I would recommend, among other things, the health of people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the" information "from the ligaments and skin badly," said Sylva Hadamcziková to cushion furniture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> That is why I have many years ago ice hockey players, but also other customers with these mattresses Visco-foam (Memory Foam). </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses and others, offer the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And it does not necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey players in order to learn the benefits of the Visco-foam. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" actually works quite simply. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The optimalisiert sparkling in accordance with his toughness and form of the absorbierten heat, in other words, he is usually right schmiegt on warm body. </seg>
<seg id="21"> No, it is passing in the night, it is not as after a major battle. </seg>
<seg id="22"> You simply sleep much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The viskoelastische foam also offers protection against Dekubitus (gangrene). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In the election of the mattresses size should be to body size still add the length of the Fußsohlen, around 21 to 34 cm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Man as a woman, to the 180 cm wide, need a 210-220 cm-long bed. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Each of the Schläfer should at least 90 cm wide deck available, so 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In separate beds, for example, in singles, 120-140 cm are appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="28"> For the sake of comfort and also for any visitors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise, the rule of thumb for the broad ideal bed: "if it is on the back, should be enough room for the easy angewinkelten," advises mine. Prokopová Helena, the guild of Polsterer and Raumausstatter, for years the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture, devoted to this subject in colleges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> In a double bed everyone needs its own rust and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are also high. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise, there is nothing to install the Roste different amounts and that is not possible for each bed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with pen skeleton 15 cm, should at least three centimetres in the form of class and the fine cushion. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "With the hand or the Hinsetzen must feel the feathers under any circumstances," Helena Prokopová warns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Every mattress makes a special Rosttyp required. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document how together evolved Siam twins in the bedroom. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The mattresses are not reveal and we cannot wash, which today is already commonplace. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And since you are in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years, becoming a huge (and congested sieve). </seg>
<seg id="38"> That is why also reject experts advertising slogans in mattresses a lifespan of up to 25 years, or even promise lifetime guarantee. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Each has their ifs and buts. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And that is why a practical advice from dealers: mattresses of 120 or 140 cm range should be the hygiene of the waschbaren, not shy away from abziehbaren salary, but it is to use a Matratzenschoner, you can easily withdraw and washing. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even if today usually mattresses references are made with Rundumreißverschluss, so after the opening two halves gets (immensely important for the washing process and washing machines size!), is the manipulation with larger mattresses, mainly carried out alone, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> They are in bed instead of a Rostes a firm record? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Get out! </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or, at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> So they should use the record to ventilation holes (if not included) and mattresses with pen skeleton and 15 cm minimum level with so-called Taschenfederkern and fine cushion. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethane mattresses are on such a document. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Not for verstellbare Lattenroste with 14 to 18 pen (Lamellen) Latex or sandwich placed mattresses (possibly including combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay in Roste with a larger number Latten, 28, and more responsible, with the Lordosenstütze Lendenwirbelbereich and the ability to regulate the Latten severity. </seg>
<seg id="48"> At verstellbare Lamellenroste no mattresses with pen skeleton, because they do not respond to the ergonomische farce. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> In addition to the suspension of the Steife pen will also offer special flexible shoulder modules. </seg>
<seg id="50"> This is a special Befestigung the pen, which allows the pen einzudrücken or even verwinkeln so that they will allow the specific Einsinken the shoulder of the Schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Especially for men with broad shoulders an important matter. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There are even mattresses manufacturers have started to use in "gentlemen mattresses" soft zones for the shoulder area. </seg>
<seg id="53"> They also remember the ladies is intended - it takes these soft zones in the Hüftgegend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For the most demanding customers are to stretch the point Flügelfedersysteme (Lattoflex) or Roste with elastic point of contact-Pads with so-called Multitorsionsfederung. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure will be distributed on several points, and thereby reduce the tension. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> However, if the right mattress and right rust a bad (too much and fülliges) head cushion used most of the gains are lost. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Here is a rule of thumb: the head cushion to ease the head restraints, its top should only up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The ideal situation is therefore a 50 x 60 cm big cushion, as it may, for example, the Scandinavians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In the pages of the head should cushion (along with the Schulterentlastungszone in rust or the soft zone in the bed) to compensate for the shoulder. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Some of our modern mattresses have in common with the former (with hay filled) straw bags. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Using modern manufacturers increasingly natural materials, or at least their mixtures. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Also in mattresses that means new magic word "organic." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of oil, raw materials used to produce increasingly polyurethane foams naturelle oils, for example, Rizinus and soya oil. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soya is used by all the well-known manufacturers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> "Organic means in mattresses, their core of purely material of natural origin," Petr Vašíček said from the company's Tropico Plus. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Natural substances but also be used in the manufacture of mattresses salary, was one of the first in Aloe Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> But one can also allow micro-capsules, which spread in the bed of fresh forest or Lavendelduft. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Here too there is a difference between a man and a woman. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While the men a "kühlender" used plant extracts from birch forest leaves, so that the mattresses absorb the heat and cool the body can have on the salary for women "wärmende" effect. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Extracts from red Paprikaschoten encourages wohlig warm blood circulation to the weaker sex in the bed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> And today's favorite? </seg>
<seg id="72"> Mattresses from cold sparkling (he has more Poren with destroyed cell structure and, therefore, is breathing more active than usual trade polyurethane and much more flexible). </seg>
<seg id="73"> The combination of the various Steife (toughness) of cold foams and Visco-foams added zones mattresses, know exactly where head, hip and heels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> For a high-quality mattress has, however, 7000 to berappen kroner and more. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Health mattresses but are usually with lower value-added tax, because they are considered medical device. </seg>
<seg id="76"> The first was Czech companies Gumotex this advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> It is to save money in the mattress and the rust is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Occasionally there are special offers from manufacturers and retailers, which offer two mattresses for the price of one. </seg>
<seg id="79"> So the brand offers the Magniflex mattress Duofreeze with Visco-sparkling Memory in relation to verstepptem 11990 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="80"> The second you get for free. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the Tempur material that launched the era of viskoelastischen sparkling substances with open cell structure and high density in almost kosmischem pace. </seg>
<seg id="82"> No wonder they have been developed for NASA, because the astronauts are enormous in the launch of excessive impositions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83"> Tempur in soft heat, cool milieu, it will be confirmed once again. </seg>
<seg id="84"> So it fits perfectly in the human body and distributed in an optimal manner the body. </seg>
<seg id="85"> It is therefore not only ideal to prevent pressure fire but generally increases the sleep comfort. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86"> Viskoelastische sparkling substances but not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special Fußpolstern used the legs and the Gefäßen relief. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Using local manufacturers, for example, the sparkling substances Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The army has so many Zündschnüre that the Czech Republic could umwickeln but you only have two years </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Czech army has bought Zündschnüre 445 kilometers, setting off explosives. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Earlier in the year, the Ministry of Defence had powder 224 km string delivered to the army camp. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have ausgesorgt for 225 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The only problem is the durability of the Zündschnüre - two of them, but no more than four years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The army bought the Zündschnüre by the Company STV Group a.s., for a mere 40 million kroner. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In his justification for the purchase of this huge amount of ammunition string said the General Staff MF DNES, the soldiers would be a year of a powder 60 kilometres consume string. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to the research of Armeepyrotechnikern MF DNES raised on shows from this indication that the whole army should each year, a very intensive pyrotechnic training course, from all the generals and officers of the army commandos, to the secretaries and cleaners. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Defence minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Only then could the remarkable annual consumption of spirits 60 kilometres put together reasonably justified. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The length is, incidentally, 25000 Detonationen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> But even so this army would be enough stocks for more than ten years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But if the old rule of experts is that each new professional training soldiers ammunition two metres string is quite sufficient, then the army has also this Neueinkäufe, from the point of view of the increased needs of a pioneering special units, soothing supply for 225 years already mentioned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> It complained of the soldiers Schnelleinsatzbrigade recently when Defence Minister Vondra, they had almost no cartridges for more small arms, so that register the lack of resources are severely restricted. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The lack of wearing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "I am not a why they are such huge Zündschnüre buy from us." </seg>
<seg id="17"> But it is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need it. " </seg>
<seg id="18"> "For us, the army is a good customer, we would like as dealers as far as possible," says marketing manager of STV Group Děcký Jan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Jan Pejšek, Department of Defense spokesman justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of powder string so that the army would have been so for at least 10 years with this "ammunition." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Jan Děcký of STV Group, however, is only a four-year use of the term Zündschnüre and police and Armeepyrotechniker only two years. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "With perfect storage are probably also mentioned four years possible," one of them, but wants to remain nameless, not as a soldier accused of criticism of the army. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The utility long after any ammunition must be tested thoroughly, whether it is reliable and not endanger the lives of the soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="23"> These tests are not in vain, but cost more money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Another argument of the Defense Department is the volume discount for a powder 445 kilometres of string. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "They cost 60 percent less than last year's supply of 244 miles," says spokesman Pejšek the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Only by way of comparison, the annual consumption of spirits from the Pyrotechnikern police, the shells from World War II or the Soviet liquidate brother army, already exceeds some years barely 1500 metres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> And the police only such quantities of the ammunition they use before the end of the use of the long term. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The security because of the Pyrotechniker, also considers the possibility of more modern flexible purchases and therefore more reliable Zündschnüre open. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The Ministry of Defence has already huge problems with the winding-up of tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the 222-member thousand Czechoslovak People's army was preparing its campaign on the Rhine. </seg>
<seg id="30"> According to the Pyrotechnikern, which has bought MF DNES raised the Czech armed forces in a few years ago, the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old Zündschnüre today as "favourable." </seg>

<seg id="7"> Thanks to the opinion poll, this has changed. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "The Czech social security administration will in future be in control of social insurance payers no more extracts from the commercial register demand," the spokeswoman of ČSSZ Jana Buraňová. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The purpose of the opinion poll ' absurdity of the year, ' it is, all the rules and orders under the microscope, to meet the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and lift the nonsensical. </seg>

<seg id="11"> If last year to the three thousand people involved in the vote, there were four in this millennium. </seg>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The efforts to create nonsensical orders from the world, show effect. </seg>
<seg id="29"> In 2007 the rankled people most of the entrepreneurs imposed duty to notify the Gewerbeamt at the place of its permanent factory three days in advance, the notion of an exhibition to an exhibition or Kirmes. </seg>
<seg id="30"> This requirement has been lifted by a series of commercial law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The duty of 2007, the second largest number of votes received, the obligation to notify the state missions by workers in up to 30 days - has been abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> And all good things come in threes. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The absurdity of 2009 was elected to the regulation, which it imposed physiotherapists, speaking a bedroom mirror, a refrigerator and two people to have scales. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year, the refrigerator duty fell away. </seg>

<seg id="4"> There is perhaps political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic diplomatic. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Wikileaks founder Assange is supposedly in England. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The investigative platform Wikileaks is becoming more and more in the United States under fire. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now seeking an Internet home in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The prominent Senator Joe Lieberman, however, called on other countries and companies to boycott of Wikileaks. </seg>
<seg id="9"> And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the wanted lists of Interpol, to stop after a newspaper report in Britain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> "Wikileaks from Amazon's server." </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Free speech in the land of the Free," the investigative activists shared by short-messaging service Twitter on Wednesday (local time). </seg>
<seg id="12"> Shortly before the Internet company had the Wikileaks documents Amazon banished from its servers. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The Internet activists had used in the publication of the secret diplomatic diplomatic on Amazon's Web service (AWS), so that it can cope with the high level of access numbers on the documents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Via Twitter Wikileaks said the step further: "fine, our dollars are spent to employ people in Europe." </seg>
<seg id="15"> If Amazon have such problems with freedom of speech, "they should stop to sell books." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Amazon have halted the use of its servers by Wikileaks after staff of Senator Joe Lieberman investigation, told the CNN television, citing the Liebermans office. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security was Amazon's threatened a boycott, told the British Guardian newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "I would have liked that Amazon is taking this measure previously classified information in light of the previous publications by Wikileaks," the senator said. </seg>

<seg id="28"> The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to keep hidden. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Hrafnsson apparently reacted to comments from North America. </seg>
<seg id="30"> In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations for treason and executed. </seg>

<seg id="10"> The ice-University, the manufacturer of Eismaschinen set up in 2003, so that the ice cream everywhere from its machines will meet the high Italian ideals. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the biggest feeder and visitors from around the world. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But there are also more day special courses around the Schokoladeneis and internships in the Eisdiele home. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Some dreams in the Midlife Crisis-of a new career, others venture just their vague aspirations on the treacherous ice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil via Hungary to Saudi Arabia. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Jacky, art teachers from California, loves the Slow-food movement and wants to offer the country's industrial Ice-Cream in future, a European quality product. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Maestro-invited animals Luciano Ferrari declared the first participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice cream. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is crucial not only of good taste, but also the seidige fluidity and good consistency. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Luciano forgets his training but not the icing on the cake of national and even Latin Überbaus: "Italian Gelato is simply the best, and then there is still plenty of romanticism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first step towards the production seems quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Luciano dump the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a big Mixgerät, all of this with an electronic program heated to 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Then he turns to the machine to a tap, and comes out a pasteurised white base cream, basis for all Milcheissorten. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Immediately, the bestürmt lecturer with questions: you can only ice cream with natural substances without stabiliser? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How can one's own free experimental mood? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Luciano warns, the spirit of the time mislead. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Anyone who has ice cream "only from natural ingredients," may nonetheless used stabilizers, usually a product of nature, such as Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Of course, it can be frozen without stabiliser, only to then be sold within a day, otherwise it sackt bite, and the customer on Eiskörnchen louder. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Some are variations on the basic mass. </seg>
<seg id="31"> There will be more exciting with the flavourings. </seg>
<seg id="32"> For the taste in ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients in the fruit-department or to buy the sweets of the supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Moreover, there is powder and Pasten. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "The suppliers will all try to foist onto you dozens of aromatic additions." </seg>
<seg id="35"> "But you should just experimenting." </seg>
<seg id="36"> Either in the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruit. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Or the ice cream from the basic white mass with eggs to yellow cream and cocoa powder to the basis for all kinds of chocolate temptations offered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Now the course participants in the Eismaschinen. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano they each of four different types of vanilla, chocolate, Mokka and produce hazelnut-ice, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural supplements. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The same experiment will be subjected to the Fruchteissorten. </seg>
<seg id="41"> More flavourings, more fruit-geschmacklich Püree, that is not necessarily better. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Hazelnut taste-ice does not necessarily nussiger if it contains more hazelnuts. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The most popular Kiwi-ice, the working group, which used more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Only a balanced mix of the taste of a true Gelato, Luciano says. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Eisherstellung is a computing task: peach-Püree used with a lot of sugar, sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For Zitroneneis needed an extra dose of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano is a device, with which he determined the sugar content of the Fruchts places (winemakers measure so that the Oechsle in grape must). </seg>
<seg id="48"> Fortunately, facilitate tables the calculation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> To make ice does not require as much physical as before. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Not only the device helps for the automatic restoration of basic mass. </seg>
<seg id="51"> There is also a device in which the ready-made ice-mix at the same time cremig beaten and kept cool to minus temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Of all the automation, not small mishaps. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The Brazilians Gustavo acquitted itself and its rate colleagues from top to bottom with fruit Püree than the colossal hand blenders spiral out of control. </seg>

<seg id="19"> In many industries, the companies can no longer their employees choose from a large crowd of applicants. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But they have to advertise, and particularly balzen for highly skilled workers. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Above all, graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the next few years. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Such a ban, the government has enacted in Washington, and finally their previous plans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Stay off the Atlantic coast for new drilling. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It said Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The trigger for the strict ban, which is at least for the next five years, the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Before the accident, which had 11 workers claimed the lives and the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama under pressure from the opposition and the industry signaled its willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The supporters want to reduce the dependence of the United States of oil supplies from abroad. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf is not finally resolved until today. </seg>
<seg id="10"> There is at the heart of the criticism of the British energy company BP, which is faced with billions of demands. </seg>
<seg id="11"> A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama in the course of December 2008 to present their results. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban imposed after the explosion. </seg>
<seg id="13"> After several oil companies had immediately made requests for new drilling projects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> With tighter controls and more stringent safety rules Obama and Salazar want to rule out a further disaster. </seg>
<seg id="15"> At present, the relevant supervisory authority, which has radically reformed after numerous corruption charges will be brought into disrepute. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In parallel, Obama has announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and Gaskonzerne. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The industry warns now publicly that the level of production in the Gulf by a much tighter regulation would be smaller than in the past. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a recent industry survey by consultant BDO, even before the drilling ban on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The American Energy Alliance also complained about the uncertainty in the industry: "nobody knows what exactly will change with the regulation." </seg>
<seg id="20"> Investment in new projects would be postponed until further notice, at the expense of growth. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Mysterious Erdarbeiten </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But the country refuses to comment, still leaves it controls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> About midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 1 fighter aircraft, a mysteriöses, cube shaped building in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is on the banks of the Euphrates, the next major city, 30 miles away, Dair el-Saur. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Her name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, which Syria allegedly built with help from North Korea in the Quader, hidden in a valley, the lack of electricity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing by the US secret overseas CIA service by the end of April 2008, which would also be under the name of the nearby town of el-normal Kibar reactor have been well-suited to produce plutonium, from which to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For others, it uses the technique is hardly out of the fifties. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA conducted a video presentation with blurred satellite images. </seg>
<seg id="10"> They ignored by Computeranimation, where the components of the reactor should be before the destruction of a verkleinerte copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyong nuclear center. </seg>
<seg id="11"> They also presented photographs, which show the building from the vicinity, or even the interior space. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor was briefly stood before the operation, it said, but has not yet been drawn up with fuel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more than at the time, the mystery has been rather larger over time. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Former US President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack was quite sure that Syria in el-Kibar was a nuclear reactor built, but little evidence that it was in the country, "an active nuclear weapons program." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some intelligence officers in Europe are rather more cautious and only speak of a ' alleged reactor, " even if the CIA's presentation of " plausible ." </seg>
<seg id="16"> They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Asked how he was certain to have a nuclear reactor, said a senior UN diplomat only flat in the summer, the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The rubble of the alleged "unused military building" the Syrians eager to one side and the terrain planierten thoroughly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium had been produced by people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, the IAEA was likely to be a Member State satellite images of commercial providers from the period immediately after the attack, the more meaningful than those presented by the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, these recordings are not on the market, because of the unknown client, perhaps Israel, it has bought exclusively. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always claimed that never pursued a secret nuclear program or to build a reactor. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, Damascus said. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But the IAEA has after analysis of the particles back as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss it, as well as on the satellite images. </seg>
<seg id="27"> It also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the wreckage of the bombed-out building. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But Israel also stony silence. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We never comment on that," recently reaffirmed the incumbent at the time of the attack, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> It has been dragging on the investigation of the case in vain since June 2008 and "increasingly is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority," a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, admits there is, after all, a serious breach of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the IAEA. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As a key to progress in the investigation, the IAEA appears to be three other facilities "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor still exist, and other than this. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The inspectors have not revealed what plants are, or what they are or what they appear to be suspicious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, they will be called the IAEA internally as Marj el-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn, are derived from nearby towns. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and on satellite images of a building complex located in Masyaf, which is most likely to be one of the suspicious objects. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It is probably in or next to a military base, this is precisely what justification, Syria denied the IAEA access to the three places. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In Vienna, it is feared the Syrians a fishing expedition, the IAEA vorgeschickt by the United States will auszuspähen military installations. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Because of the nuclear detectives were carefully through a tip of the US intelligence services to the facilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the Quader on Euphrates material and was moved. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "in connection with the fuel production." </seg>
<seg id="40"> There is, however, "no evidence of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes that are necessary to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The type of reactor is enriched with uranium, which is not. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But where the uranium could have come from and where it later separated the plutonium for the bomb should be on these key issues, there are plausible assumptions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> It is also unclear whether the debris that could pose a valuable clues to the three places were stored. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As if the hundreds of truck loads of disappeared, no one wants to have information about where the debris. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Only a few kilometers from el-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates located al-Tibni salt mine, which has looked into Syria in 1998 on their suitability as storage for radioactive waste, the IAEA is regarded as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had it in a recent analysis of satellite images for the venerable magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Recordings from the orbit, however, that Syria had requested the three suspicious places Erdarbeiten carried and large containers, after the IAEA access. </seg>
<seg id="48"> This may be coincidence, but it has hardly helped to dispel the suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Moreover, they say in diplomatic circles, the IAEA have spent many months, a plan to develop for inspections there, it should allow Syria to maintain any military secrets alone, the tape shows how great is the interest of the inspectors. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Meanwhile, Damascus also bügelte this proposal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Had reassured Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, therefore there is no high urgency, for instance, US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a couple of months ago, so-called special inspections into the game, one of the harshest means the Vienna nuclear authority to impose controls. </seg>
<seg id="52"> IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, would have to propose these inspections, has been "an option for which I am open in the future," but he hesitates. </seg>
<seg id="53"> It is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it needs for a majority of the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented are anything but eager for an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other hand, as a diplomat to bear in mind: "what if they find in the end nothing?" </seg>

<seg id="7"> Meanwhile, the film is marginalised in Hungary and in the post-production, but it is still protested in Bosnia. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Bakira Hasecic, from the organisation wrote female victims of war, the UN refugee agency UNHCR of Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, now has a Bosnian newspaper reported, Jolie is ambassador to the UN refugee agency. </seg>

<seg id="15"> Even the young author claimed that they had no political intentions with their film, with a great deal of trouble incorporated into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and all the parties involved to give a voice. </seg>

<seg id="19"> That Jolie's film actually begins before the war, so much is safe. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The demokatrische routine </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The democracy movement in Latin America will be stronger, as the support of private companies. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil's larger than that of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="5"> These results came Latinobarómetro-poll published in 18 countries and is exclusively in The Economist. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This survey will be carried out on a regular basis since 1995 and shows the exchange of views in the region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two facts in this year's survey of September and October, particularly in's eye. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First, the good mood in Latin America </seg>
<seg id="9"> And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In many countries in the South American Pacific coast has increased considerably, the democratic movement (S. Table 1). </seg>
<seg id="11"> In Peru, for example, where the economy every year since 2002, is growing by about 6%, the number of democracy advocates by 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In Mexico, where the economy since the sharp drop in the last year, is to see such a trend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the world's two most populous countries in the region, are staunch Democrats, reducing the regional average (S. graph 2). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Around 44 percent of the respondents said that they are satisfied with the democratic practice in their country, as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3). </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some 34% trust Congress of their country and 45% of their government, both of which correspond to the values of the past year, however, show a significant increase over 2003 (17% and 24%). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> A decade ago, Latin America's economic crisis undermined the efforts for more democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Also during the world economic crisis lasted perhaps is that the countries of Latin America's only experienced a brief recession and quickly recover. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, the poor have been absorbed by a stronger social network. </seg>
<seg id="19">  (According to reports by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in 2009 only slightly to Latin America and has fallen again this year by 32%.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> From country to country, but there is strong sentiment differences (S. graph 4). </seg>
<seg id="21"> Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread progress. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, it is less the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> It is only the second time since the beginning of poll see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country a greater problem than unemployment (S. graph 5). </seg>
<seg id="24"> Some 31% say that either they or a family member in the last year have been the victim of a crime, but compared to 38 percent last year, the values have fallen and thus achieve the lowest level since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The increase in economic performance is reflected in the increased support of the private and the market economy: approximately 71% at cross-regional level of those surveyed said that the private sector is essential for the development, in 2007, there were 56% (S. graph 6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> Some 58 percent said that only the market economy can bring their country progress, compared with 47% last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly, 62 percent of respondents in Venezuela maintained this view (and 80 percent are in favour of a private sector), even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, many private companies nationalized. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil has, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year). </seg>
<seg id="29"> The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries will see in the United States, the most influential country, and this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua from Venezuela. </seg>

<seg id="2"> In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband told Argentina's President Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy that pushed their raise by 20 points to more than 50%. This is the highest value since its election in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Whether it is, however, next year to a re-election, depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández further compromises as her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The signs are not clear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Néstor Kirchner, even after the election of his wife drew the economic policy, often at the budget plans, which take into account the tax revenues, economic growth and inflation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra revenue as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On paper the Fernández-government lost last year, the majority in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further Zerwürfnissen. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some critics of the regime were from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten behind Cristina Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But after chaotic meetings (in which accused a parliamentarian, another in the face, and others, the government of bribery) managed to Congress not to approve the budget for 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I am not going to discuss it," the President. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The 2010 budget now goes for the next year, which the President has more opportunity to spend money as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy is overheating: it is likely this year to grow up to 9%. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the unions, the value to almost 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner, who took over in 2003, the office, when Argentina was beset by economic crises, said growth and poverty reduction to its key objectives, and not the inflation reduction. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He refused to cooperate with the IMF, the private sector has singled out for bullying and säuberte the National Institute for Statistics and census INDEC, which then schönte official inflation statistics. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Fernández can now take a more modest way? </seg>
<seg id="18"> It has called on the private sector and the trade union leaders for talks. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And, according to official statements should be limited wage increases next year to 18%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the inflation undermined the growth spurt by a large devaluation in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Perhaps would join Cristina Fernández why Argentina financial economically back to the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="23"> At the beginning of this year, the government of an agreement with shareholders, who had rejected an earlier restructuring of the country in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Now it seems Fernández on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club to push those around $6.7 billion owed to it. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Kirchners had rejected a review by the IMF, as elsewhere, normal. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But last month, the national consumer price index "technical support economic Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund in drawing up a new will." It looks as if this is the first step to clean up the INDEC. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not known whether Fernández after leaving office without the support of her husband will be politically active. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which is largely fed by Kirchnerism. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the Argentines in March to return from their summer holidays, will be the wave of Sympatie, which was abgeebbt. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If they want to win another election, they must decide whether to lift many political decisions her husband quietly. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Taiwan's voters slowly approaching a closer link to the mainland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> What does Taiwan from his big brother across the Straits? </seg>
<seg id="4"> On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70 percent of all eligible voters, in the five city districts to elect mayors and city councils, which will be seen as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou. </seg>
<seg id="5"> By building cutting-edge business relations, einschl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland, and its policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mainland for the first time since 1949. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Ma has passed the exam, but only barely. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Although his Kuomintang party (KMT), three of the five mayors, they did not receive a majority of votes. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates a greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In a presidential election that would have meant for Ma problems. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Since his election two years ago, is his party's vote share has fallen by about 8%. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For the first time the DPP even drew together with the KMT in the city councils. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as convoys of lorries with Krawall makers, flag-schwenkende mass parades and only scantily clad dancers. </seg>
<seg id="13"> There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT held on the eve of the election, a speech at a KMT candidate </seg>
<seg id="15"> When he was a man from the crowd in the face. Lien wounded and killed a umstehender viewers. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Bizarrer wise, it is not clear whether the shooter kill Lien or wanted to settle a dispute with the candidate. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Regardless of the attack, according to Tsai mine-whom, the leader of the DPP, the election and put the DPP in a bad light, which has brought the KMT more votes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Remarkably, the relationship has not been to the mainland. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Instead, the candidates debated plans to social housing and the creation of jobs. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and oppose China's military threat. </seg>
<seg id="22"> For this reason, the KMT is its relations with the government in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But this time avoided the DPP to stir up anti-Chinese feelings. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Ma, for its part, would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese supports his China policy. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy to attract Taiwan with economic incentives in the community. </seg>
<seg id="27"> China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a summit on investment security and medical cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Certainly, it wants a political integration, but the most important thing first. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It would rather wait until after the 2012 presidential elections. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The DPP has now reinvented. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Two years ago, she was severely weakened: the former party leader, Chen Shui-bian was convicted of corruption in the prison. </seg>
<seg id="32"> During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently for complete independence. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But under Tais reign has developed a new generation gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the professionals and young people. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Tsai took place as the DPP presidential candidate much support, as Su Tseng-chang under Chen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Her party now is doing everything it can to show that they, too, is in a position to develop close relations with Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Tsai is planning a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this is open-minded discussion. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Tsai said publicly that her party would offer a "trustworthy alternative" to vorschneller Ma's overtures to China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Chen seems very angry about this change. </seg>
<seg id="39"> From his cell, he said, the candidate of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence. </seg>
<seg id="40"> He called for the pragmatists Su even to abandon the presidential candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even without the interference of the DPP is difficult to choose their possible candidates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The KMT will have its own self-analysis. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Ma's values are poor, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidate wanted to lead their campaign without him. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The main reasons for his unpopularity seem unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="45"> According to a KMT spokesman said he will transform his cabinet and the local facilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> The strong action by the DPP suggests that Taiwan is in favour of a rapprochement only restricted. </seg>
<seg id="47"> At the same time, the majority of the Taiwanese economic cooperation with China as inevitable. </seg>

<seg id="8"> But as the researchers found that the bacterium is growing in the Californian mono Lake even further when it replaced phosphorus by arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "One wonders what else is possible," said the co-author of the report, Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is an important step in the search for außerirdischem lives, since scientists must recognize life and forms, Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study deals with microbes that have been found on Earth. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The announcement of a press conference in which no details were made known to the discovery, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report of the discovery could no irdischen life. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "shows that in other planet systems organisms with the help of other elements of biochemical processes can set in motion, and that the ' standard ' elements that we think are absolutely vital, not necessarily," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute held University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockel was not part of the research teams. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "This work is a first, because it shows that in fundamental biochemical processes and structures an element can be replaced by another," added Cockell. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> This discovery was not accidental. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA Astrobiologischen Institute, who led the study, chose the mono Lake because of high arsenic content. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Because arsenic and phosphorus chemically identical, they thought that microbes are exposed to both, might be able to replace an element from the other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "The toxicity of the Arsens is based largely on the fact that it is chemically similar to phosphorus." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "It is difficult for the organisms to distinguish one element from the other." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It in our biochemisches system, where almost everything covered," said Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers, the bacterium GFAJ-1 rising from arsenic concentration; it fit in and grew up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The microbe is growing more phosphorus, but it can also survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based life form can happen, of course, either on the Earth or another planet or moon, on the arsenic occurs more frequently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> According to Jamie S. Foster, Dozentin for micro-biology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new, but so far there was no functioning example. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Arsenic was more common in the early Erdjahren, she says, is why science is the assumption that early life forms have been used. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> "It is reason to believe that life may have developed differently than in the early geologically important period," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National health authorities. </seg>

<seg id="7"> At the moment is leading a consortium of the investment bank, to $75 million, the company and the financing by mid-December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The restructuring of the studios began in May 2009, with the mandate to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the company's management, which fought with interest payments of $300 million per year to help solve their financial problems. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In August, the chief executive Harry Sloan replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, became known for his work with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The efforts of Moelis & Cooper, the financial MGMs and resolve the more than 140 of the studios Gläuber auszubezahlen, lasted longer than expected. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> This year's favourite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console and both games can be a considerable hole in your budget gifts. </seg>
<seg id="3"> A iPad costing as much as five BMX-wheels for $99, while the price of a Kinect game about 10 classic rush Springs, or about play-Doh 48 cans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> But you can protect your gifts. </seg>
<seg id="5"> I recently went in search of three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, Toys "R" us and a BJ's Wholesale Club. </seg>
<seg id="6"> I was immediately clear that Moore's law was in force this year, the technology toys more efficient and cost slightly less than last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> And while fewer new toys with its own Web site, will take place on the best-known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, a wider range. </seg>
<seg id="8"> There are always more button-cell-powered toys on the market, and many contain again aufladbare batteries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Here are a few recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="10">  (If not otherwise specified, all prices are Toys "R" us.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for children 3 years) are Plüschfiguren, as big as guinea pig who sing a note, if one puts pressure on its belly. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Even push corresponds to a note by mehrmaliges flick you can play a song. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Warning: if you have started with the flick, you can no longer stop. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> For a combination of Gesand and dancing is the Dance star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60 for children from 2) is the best choice. </seg>
<seg id="16"> On the basis of animatronische doll last year developed Elmo Live technology offers the recantations as ' Simon says, and thanks to the new hinge feet with Radblockierung dominated the Moon Walk. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Children who use the device testeten, Mickey as a dance teacher, and their parents, however, complained about the lack of Lautstärke scheme. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> If you are a child of the 1980s, you must remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Now he is back (Hasbro/play Kool, $40 for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards, a car can be an hour's training with a preached with auto-correction function as a teacher. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> If your child, you would not want to entrust your Smartphone, here are three independent alternatives. </seg>
<seg id="21"> MobiGo of VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty-keyboard. The games contained, however, are not as instructive as the first major revision in the Leapster Explorer ($70 for children 3-12) after Leapfrogs the Leapster-series is equipped with a new, brighter screen. </seg>
<seg id="22"> None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> IXL from Fisher-Price ($90 for children 3-7) used for the Games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD-Kartenlaufwerks family photographs to be seen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Last but not least, there is still a Scrabble Flash ($30 by Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In the game, it is a question of the blocks together words, before the time is running out and it is great for an improvised Buchstabierwettbewerb. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> More and more toys have a kind of online connection. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If you alone after the supply in the toy shops, Webkinz and Club Penguin, the most important. </seg>
<seg id="28"> So your child an online animal to the Club Penguin, you can buy, for example, a Disney Club Penguin 2 " mix ' n match figures package ($5 for children 6-12), which contains a coin with a secret code. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If you receive the code online keying in your child enough Club Penguin ten bill for a further two parts. </seg>

<seg id="17"> "In principle, this means that high-profile government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Paul Coggins, the main defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had on Monday received a telephone call to a prosecutor and another the next day, where he has been informed that the ministry will be no complaints against his clients. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with prosecutors in order to convince them that the senator, as his office in a statement on Wednesday once again repeated, "acted in accordance with the law." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr. Coggins refused, the legal arguments that he had made with prosecutors to explain in greater detail. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "I am not likely to go into the details between the Ministry of Justice and me; it is only so much must be said: we believe the right decision," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to discontinue the investigation because of a separate complaint with the ethics group, after the payment of $96.58000 of Mr. Ensigns parents to the Hamptons have violated federal election law. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The Election Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A half-dozen of them tippten in the riots in the courtroom. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the minutes verschickten stroke their reports on Twitter on grausige witness statements. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the end, the defense, there were more than 140000 Twitter messages about the process for rape and gekettete beds children in a house, the flare. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Thursday, the closely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was indicted, three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, have been killed, an official at the end, if the ruling on the death sentence, the jury has ruled. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already filed in court, explain the reasons for an appeal and the courts for years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> One of the provozierendsten reasons is that the intense coverage of the trial - also through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporter - to a "circus atmosphere" and such a widespread, swift penetration was a rebel details, so that the jury improperly influenced by the public outrage. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This objection could prompt the Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules are necessary in the courtroom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "As I have seen during this process, I think that it really is a danger, if the arrival of new technologies in the courtroom every individual's right to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes main defender. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue by the supreme court court last week rejected the applications by ruling succinct and, when he said that the new media "will be carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But it was certainly not the last word on this matter. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For decades, have established legal objections that the reporting on notorious cases to doubts about the fairness of the process. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In its historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States, the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, is said to have killed his wife, and said in his ruling that there had been due to the New Media, "a carnival atmosphere in the courtroom." </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some people believe that the television series and the movie "on the run" is based on this crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some lawyers say court appeals, which Mr. Hayes condemnation of half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary in order to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom at the time of the case, Dr. Sheppard still were unimaginable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "There is a good reason to be concerned about the impact of the new media in trials by the general public are persecuted," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who has investigated the death penalty in Connecticut, his report states that they will be imposed arbitrarily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor Donohue said, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction a prompt communication out of the courtroom could make the process fairer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Twitter matter is only one of many that the lawyers for Mr. Hayes to discuss for years and thus delaying a condemnation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defenders claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes had already explanation might have been as judge Blue not to allow them to test the reactions of potential judges, giving them during the grausige judges selected scene photos showed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some of the judges said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years, they would have met with disgust. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defenders say that they were also the constitutionality of the death penalty, constitution, and argue that the judge wrongly have exchanged a jury, which has been a critic of the public prosecutor's office, and that he improperly put pressure on the ruling, as he had made the unusual decision, the panel released over the weekend. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The judges were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But their arguments about the impact of the extensive coverage of the process, perhaps the greatest interest. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In a judgment challenge they have submitted last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American Senate, was discussed by the candidates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They argued that the new media constantly the flames of emotions would have reopened the case. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "Such a day-to-day crush of media Piepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "has been previously in New Haven, and perhaps even across the country have not yet seen." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Its focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In interviews, said a number of journalists that the claim that these are direct news rabble-rousing but the reports, which are slower, an anti-technology is a view that the coverage of future trials verarme. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> But some lawyers said, would Appelationsgerichte often faced with the argument that need social and technical changes to the Adaptation through the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr. Hayers lawyers step up this claim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In their appeal, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, in which the conviction of Dr. Sheppard was lifted because of the reporting and made it clear that the new media require new rules. </seg>
<seg id="32"> "This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21 century." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Can combine courtesy that which divides us? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> After a campaign of dirty words and negativity is little courtesy this week in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It is the sign of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion, before quickly returning to the battle of the parties in the capital return? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress produced no breakthrough in the big issues to deal with during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a period of government in which no decisions will be taken. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After all, what we hear, it was neither a polite debate between two different sides to govern an account of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partisan points collection. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meeting of the deficit, the President's Commission on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences that still exist between the members. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months to create a mutual respect, of the ideological divide that still separates members. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> This is hardly enough to claim that it is entered a new era of cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Both sides are now in a testing phase - in which one of the demands of other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise, while it tried to weigh up the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters, according to a new party warfare. </seg>
<seg id="10"> So were the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants to a minimum of demands or accusations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep for a quick change in the atmosphere, which has in the past two years, could be expected. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Regardless of whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or benefits, the two sides are miles apart. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Last but not least, the November election Washington at least mild for a short time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, which is now for "the Ethics and Public Policy Center is working." </seg>
<seg id="15"> " It is inevitable after elections. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elections give partisan passions that die. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And that is a good thing. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> On some issues, especially those who are on the agenda of the ' lame duck session, "Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution." </seg>
<seg id="19"> Bush's tax cuts end up at the end of the year, and no one supports this. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way to make some or even all receive, whether it is temporarily or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits to be expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that it believes that the favored tax cuts for the rich, while unemployed workers refuse to support. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House has increased the optimism that we can in these matters during the "lame duck session" and at the same time the New START treaty ratified. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation on pressing issues of the lame duck session " does not necessarily lead to a long-term cooperation of the parties must, if the new 112. Congress will convene in January. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead, he says, is a period of Nichtübereinstimmens more likely, perhaps even inevitable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "After the things that need to be done, this will be short-term psychology into confrontation," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Wehner is also sceptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - the politeness leads to real cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "I see a lot of what happens from today until 2012, when Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event in 2012," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority to do in the White House and with the Teeparty-voters, who were their education. </seg>
<seg id="29"> As the worried Republican leaders also may be that they vie too high, they know that they must try to their promise to reduce the expenditure of the government and the health-care reform, must be adhered to. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> This party lines are already in the initial reactions on the recommendations of the deficit Commission clearly what a tax reform and raising some taxes and raising the retirement age and reduce government spending. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, insisted that the deficit issue on the public agenda, that they can no longer be ignored. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes in order to make their plan for the official recommendation and they fight to come even close to this figure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The biggest opposition in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial issues, at least today, little room, or there is little sympathy for compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Galston says two stages of the battle between the White House and Republicans in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The first fight will be followed next year in the form of party clashes take place, if the Republicans Obama in terms of the national budget, taxes and the health system, then two more from a period parteilicher cooperation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> The public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It is proved that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties to work together. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If confrontation is a blind alley, as happened in 1995, then both parties need to carefully look at the public reaction. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Whoever is sentenced to lose, will change tack and seek a compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> This may indeed be an optimistic view. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Partisanship and polarization today are greater than in the mid-1990's, and they seem to be a major ideological divide between Obama and the Congress as a Republican at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At the same time, activists see 2010 of both parties as a mere prelude to a much wider choice of consequence of 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> So may the courtesy to display this week, will be welcomed by many Americans. </seg>
<seg id="45"> But it will be very much on both sides will require more effort to find a common denominator in the issues that the two still separated. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Both police and the state security service blackmail high protection money, so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says. </seg>
<seg id="4"> They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also by organized criminal gangs. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Each layer of the bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as a "vertical has described the authority" - takes its part of the money managers to the top. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The memo, which under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was sent to Washington, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on its website. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The memo is based on sources, whose names were edited. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It was written, while Yuri Luzhkov even Moscow's mayor, and it accused him of corruption. </seg>
<seg id="9"> He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is little evidence that in the meantime, would have been cleared up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who has a well-known construction company, have rejected for years of corruption charges again and again, and he has won a number of libel complaints against such accusations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In September, he told a Russian television station, when he was asked for a documentary, which suggests that he is corrupt, "it is crazy, it is dreckig, it is dirty." </seg>

<seg id="22"> A source, it is, "said that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get the protection of the MVD and FSB (and not by organised crime), because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law." </seg>
<seg id="23"> "That is why the protection by criminal gangs are no longer needed as they used to." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The memo noted that, while the collection is full of money, even a very modest protection not; even those who pay are sometimes arrested. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="32"> Nationwide, estimates by the corruption is costing Russia more than $300 billion per year. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The country ranks in seat 154 a recent study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparence International (countries lists of "most corrupt" to "most corrupt"). </seg>

<seg id="12"> "It was the glorious life under the Khmer Rouge, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "It even divides families." </seg>
</p>

<seg id="14"> During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people executed or died of disease, overwork or starvation. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When the Vietnamese invaded in 1979 and the Pol Pot-Ied government, fled the remnants of the regime and its military to the Cambodian border with Thailand. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Belarus agrees to accumulate weapons-grade uranium </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to global nuclear material security, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it no longer will gather highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The US government had for years sought to convince Belarus, not to collect more highly enriched uranium and last spring seemed to have achieved a hurdle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But officials of the US government told the Washington Post that in the last two months, two secret agreements were made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This was the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material, according to an official staff, because of the sensitivity of the matter remains anonymous, approximately 500 pounds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear security summit of 47 nations" from April to be ruled out of Belarus. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic for the next summit in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I was really excited by the fact that they want a seat on the Nuklearen security summit (in 2012)." </seg>
<seg id="10"> "This is proof that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the partnership Globaler security, a group promoting nuclear safety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Clinton called the agreement "a very significant and important step" of Belarus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Obama promised in Prague in April 2009, within four years, everything possible to secure vulnerable nuclear material. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since then, the US government has helped six countries going on its highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Belarus will be the seventh. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At the time of Obama's Nuklearem Security Summit, the White Russian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up their uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons capable, and less-enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "That is our commodity... We will not make dirty bombs and we will sell it to anyone." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We use it solely for research purposes, that is all." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Belarus, however, a few months ago in the United States, as it anzeigte interest in meeting an agreement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The first attempt to remove the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was easy verstrahlt, officials say. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It was loaded into a Spezialzug, more than 1300 miles at a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the officials by plane. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The US government will pay for this effort $14 million, with a large part of the money in the Belarussian research with low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "This has been extremely cautious in a coordinated and agreed to build confidence" to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, which operates the Global risk reduction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende study estimates that Belarus had this year, at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Belarus wants to dissolve under the joint agreement camp until 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Relations between Belarus and the United States were long tense years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh suppression of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But the statement Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> "The progress of this global security issues to heißend, the United States of America and Belarus announced that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said. </seg>

<seg id="13"> At a lunch in March 2007, in which the ambassadors of the United States and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, commenting on the latter, "although the incredibly strong Spanish judges are protective of their independence and would do what they think is appropriate," he gave his staff instructions, bloated "rhetorical comments in order to avoid the tension abate." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The ambassador also expressed his concern about the approach of the PP in this matter. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "Despite the generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will no doubt, a sign that the government of the United States Zapateros acts that could be interpreted as a possible human rights violations, tolerated or deliberately ignored, capital, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the government of the United States," he stresses. </seg>

<seg id="6"> The institutional investors will not lose its fear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> A month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to make our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen reversed, according to the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably still a number of times in the future, we must pull back. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The Bundesbank called for the lifting of the plan to buy government debt, because they are ineffective, and the lifting of all the extraordinary short-term liquidity measures, it should be retained only a einwöchiger permanent access. </seg>
<seg id="9"> After the Ireland-crisis, we expect that the current liquidity measures "until at least March" extended and the quarterly contracts with unlimited access to broadcasting in the quarter to ensure the liquidity will be maintained until at least June. </seg>
<seg id="10"> We also expect that the programme for the purchase of bonds will continue to spend and a stärkendes signal. </seg>
<seg id="11"> If the expectations are not met, the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday thrown back and if halstarrig insisted that we take back our liquidity measures, can only God help us! </seg>
<seg id="12"> Just as with the ECB meeting in May, the bank confirmed that the purchase of state debt securities to take into account and then the markets collapsed, this story could repeat tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The ECB must be credible and tenaciously. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In May, it showed the teeth and said on Wednesday that they have bought, it provoked a new collapse of the market. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Yesterday was the auction of one-year fairly weak state titles in Portugal. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The state asset management was only 500 million from 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Nevertheless, interest rates fell by 30 basis points in Portugal across the curve, and reflected a perceptual changes in the markets after Trichet's words. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In Ireland have been published the figures from the debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The sum is estimated at around 10000 million short-term and possible further 15000; there is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Although Ireland lost all its credibility, after the problem with the stress tests had not detected in July, the figures are acceptable in the context of the rescue plan and help to reduce the uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, the government must next Tuesday received parliamentary approval for his new budget, as it still does not have the sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Angela Merkel has asked its discourse on the summit of heads of state and government on 14 December moderate. There is political unity in order to show that, together, we play the same score. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries of the Beethoven's ninth symphony. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The Spanish government President yesterday's action plan to be adopted on Friday by the Council of Ministers. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reducing the public deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures and actions in the ears of investors such as four-year Vivaldis era. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Compared to February was the reaction of the government and the Bank of Spain quickly and convincingly, and we benefit from the surprise result. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Today, there is a major auction of a three-year bond, which will benefit from the Trichet effect will be, so we are counting on a strong demand, remove all doubts about our debt-restructuring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> For Spain, which would be getting an aid plan, a self-sacrifice. </seg>
<seg id="30"> We would get liquidity, we would not need the Treasury has 40 billion euros, three times as much as in March, and the interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets closed without notice. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Nevertheless, our strategy should be the motto of Caesar's wife: "now is not only the existence, but also of bogus." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In fact, is a powerful software to simulate processes, which the German company in 2007 for purposes that do not have to do with motor racing, on the market. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This referred to as the PLM computer program was used for the development of assembling chains in factories around the world, energy plants and highly precise instruments. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The goal is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before this will actually be built so as to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs. </seg>
<seg id="9"> PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the aircraft Sukhoi and the most famous commercial vehicles from Nissan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Victory Fried Russwurm, head of the industrial department of Siemens, said that with the use of these software in the factory formula 1 - Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes and improvements to the race and are found in the tests, and can carry out. </seg>

<seg id="14"> The materials, fuel, aerodynamics, and the security elements will be changed. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The changes can be transferred, thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech Autoklaven in less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of Simulators. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The only limit imposed on this crazy technical perfect is the $40 million, which is a Formula 1 team - must spend on his race in a season. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its Rennwagen in a 50 kilometres from London distant place. </seg>
<seg id="18"> There are two buildings where visits - particularly of journalists - are severely limited. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Everything that is happening there is Top Secret. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The staff includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The caretaker board member of Banco Saba Dell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers, he believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but first rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war debts. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Nevertheless, he sees a drop in interest margins, which the banks are trying to increase the fees and prices for loans. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Saba expects Dell, in three years, a million private customers - a still-standing. </seg>

<seg id="6"> In 2011, the bank will introduce a new three-yearly master plan. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The goal is not only to survive without increasing the public aid from the FROB to use, but also the market share of about a million private customers - 700000 when the customers, the bank will lose - and that is the great challenge facing the bank, because until now it has its business customers more attention than their retail customers. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This year it has received 250000 private customers and 50000 businesses. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Their market share in retail is 3.5 percent, while the business customers account for more than 10 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Another principle of 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, austerity, reducing costs and the challenges facing the bank, they will be together with year-end report. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Only a few cars banks find themselves in these difficult times, targets and to publish, as a result of the financial crisis worldwide, all the plans for the banks. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Saba Dell will complete this year its four years ago established guiding plan Optima. This was initially interpreted to three years, but as a result of the market, it has been extended by a year of business. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The customers who will leave the savings banks, are the main objective of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="14"> At a breakfast organized by the APIE Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with a longer range." </seg>
<seg id="15"> The manager believes that Spain would only "slowly" out of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In addition, it would be "very difficult" to create in two or three years ' work ' - essential for the survival of the banks. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Even if he assumes that the war for the liabilities - punished the interest rate margins will abate - the risk premia, banks and savings banks for their emissions will have to pay for the maintenance of liquidity, as compensation for the sagging profit margins already passed on to the price of loans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "The liquidity and funding issues are of a structural nature and they will put pressure on the loans." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We do not have the tap tap off, but the Zinsdifferenziale are very high," admitted Guardiola. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Banesto was already on Thursday the orders from their Filialnetz to restrict the granting of long-term loans and to increase the Zinsdifferenziale (cf. Cinco Díaz on 22 and 27 November). </seg>
<seg id="21"> The manager also acknowledged that the banks are currently pursuing the Stategie, "to increase the fees," but "within a competitive framework." </seg>
</p>

<seg id="22"> Saba Dells master plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not rule out corporate transactions. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Not for nothing that he assured us that in Spain, "bigger companies are necessary." </seg>
<seg id="24"> "In the coming year will change everything," he assured. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility that it might be a wave of mergers of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry will be restructured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> As the concentration process of Spanish savings banks began, there were several savings banks in the first phase not to participate. They retained the second round. </seg>
<seg id="4"> However, he assured the Director-General of the Spanish savings banks ' association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round would take place. </seg>

<seg id="6"> "The biggest part is completed, it may be that we instead of seventeen cloves three or four have 10, but all the important processes are already completed and they were supported by Banco de España, all transactions overmonitored." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In one of the association of business leaders and managers Aragoniens (ADEA) organized breakfast Olavarrieta said that the concentration process "as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied just with the deadline, which was established in the past, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España," he said. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="8"> "The transition from 45 savings banks, with an average of 28000 million assets to 17 with ever 75500 million is a historic unvergleichbarer process, and the number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and now they are much bigger, so we have complied with the Basel Convention," he stressed. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin has opted for keeping the euro, but at the same time set up conditions for the whole of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tension on the markets have triggered a dual response from the government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero presented new adaptation measures, starting with the tax reductions for small- and micro-enterprises, regulation of the firms or the lifting of the 426 euro assistance for the unemployed, no unemployment benefits, to the privatisation of 49 percent from AENA, the management of the Barajas airport and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez was the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible, the current crisis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As these events are to understand? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their public relations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In Germany, is a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future with the maintenance of the ancient traditions of most of its partners. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Given the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis spekuliern. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The second: the re-introduction of the German mark - although that is currently more sounds like science fiction, supported by a large section of public opinion, around 50 percent of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The third: a review of the euro in accordance with German proposals, which means: more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries that are invading the targets; möglichereweise the default of some countries, as well as the extension of the potential costs of adaptation measures in the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is clear and it is been going on for some time, so now there are no excuses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Start by 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government is a constitutional reform drew from the English in order to prevent this from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It was the first signs of the drifting between what Germany is necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second sign of the Central European country, as Merkel postponed the decision to save Greece's painful. </seg>
<seg id="18"> At the time was heavily criticised, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely opposed to a rescue of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally, Merkel in the last few days of October anew with a clear position, it calls for a reform of the European Union's agreement to allow for the rescue of a country and at the same time, private lenders to commit to a share of the costs. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as the Irish crisis and following. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But their proposal, if a little sweetened, was adopted in the next few months we will be in the reform of the European Union, which should allow these measures from 2013. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It says all that - even if unpopular measures must now be taken, there will be as of that date, the old workings of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In 2013, will be the birth year of a new monetary area, in which the offending countries will be severely punished, can be forced to declare default and in this case, the private sector must shoulder some of the costs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows us that we need to take a hard path of growth, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improve productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it was led by Spain in boom times, simply will not be tolerated. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would do a bad thing, not to understand it. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not just a question of the government deficit to three percent by the year 2013 runterzufahren. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much harder. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the worst thing we could do under these circumstances, is to cheat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the current turbulence in more calm. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And that we take advantage of the opportunities offered by the spring of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero has taken this so well, and its dual announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that, despite the criticism of Merkel's idea to build his own house in order in the their way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not seem that it would change anything. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Among the gestopften euro area left contemplating possibilities is that we are with little serious countries should not be ruled out. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In this case, Germany could still tell us, we have been warned. </seg>

<seg id="9"> Part of that have arisen debate is about the described case due to the fact that a team from the football club Real Madrid (in his anthem Edelmut claims and honour and on other occasions, his players had punished for similar incidents) played the main role, and to the drama by Mourinho, the more an episode on his long history as a theatralischer and provocative technician has added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case, the debate is a question of whether this is not explicitly banned by the statutes behavior contradicts the principle of sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a rule circumvention; in fact, this approach will abide by the statutes of the sport, but it would seem to make sense. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this matter should be investigated to the sporting spirit damage caused. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that has not been compromised by this action, because it was not an aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid offending players an unjustified will benefit from the opposing team, which did not happen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradox of the plot of the players of Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally do deceit or rule circumvention, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly, in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as striking as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players waited and taking the penalty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another question is what kind of advantage the offender from the deliberate Fouls. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Here, it should be stressed that the rival was either in a disadvantageous position still benefits for the erheischt feigned game, because the obvious result of this action was that their team had to continue to play with fewer players. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is not a useful strategy for the next game, because then the club does not have these players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The advantage is obvious, is that the players the game next phase of the Champions League without cards, which could threaten their participation in a future game. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree of uncertain advantage, because at some point, the team could also leave; it gives the players with this approach, a sanction and go in the second on cards cycle, in which they retire because of card accumulation with a card less than in the first round. </seg>
<seg id="21"> So it is not clear whether it is really an advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> In the end these are directed not against the spirit of sport, which also include strategic decisions in order to derive maximum benefit from the legislation. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this case, the players wanted to avoid any sanction (which actually would be a clear case of rule circumvention), they wanted to elect more when they go through this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They took a strategic decision to avoid without a penalty or to flee before her. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Although the line is blurred between inventiveness and environment, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the way the rule provoked transmission. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The damage inflicted on the principles of the sport by these actions is less ethical than aesthetic Article </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Everything that has to do with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated maze in which the only difficult situations. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Yesterday, Interpol was a "red alert" to "locate and persecution" of Assange. </seg>
<seg id="6"> However, it is not a traditional order on the arrest. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In addition, it is not new, it comes from the 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="8"> They must also has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse, which the Australians in Sweden. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The lawyer also assured of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they make contact with Mr Assange." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Already on the 20th, the international police agency based in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden in the order, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the authority by the Swedish authorities. </seg>

<seg id="13"> The action Assanges outraged lawyers who gesten published a letter in which they were informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is prepared by video conference to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> To know that this series decided by a penalty shoot-out could be concerned about him, because he trusts his players: "you never want to shoot, we would like to finish in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is no alternative, and we must be prepared in the previous Tour we were prepared, but unfortunately we were the fate of a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the intense desire to keep title already in the hands of the left us something for this final, and we hope that this time it will not happen." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Greener, but openly sceptical. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The Quebecer consumer has little confidence the main actors of sustainable growth, however, nor to the brand or the eco-labels, which are supposed to manage his campaign. </seg>
<seg id="4"> A pity, even though it is swimming in a media universe, where there is information in favor of a more responsible consumption swarm over: the scoreboard responsible consumption has to complain about a lack of credible information, a shortcoming that brake sorts out his commitment, as was the first reading, which yesterday was held. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="5"> Even though they have the use of the so-called socially responsible products in 2010, the Quebecer seem yet to those who try to sell them, too little credit. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Two-thirds of the Quebecer population, in fact, the environmental commitment of the companies to pay as little as the green corporate advertising, it betrays the responsible consumer Centre of the University of Sherbrooke sophisticated measuring tool. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="7"> Other findings: half of consumers is casting doubt on the trustworthiness of the official, attached to the supposedly fair products certificates, but also the credibility of the products and brands that are labelled as environmentally-friendly way, so the scoreboard. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Following the same pattern of discourse of the politicians on this issue from only 14.6% of the population seriously Quebecer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The information appears on responsible consumption, however, important to stimulate the consumer segment, which is currently only around one-third of Quebecer consumers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In fact, dämpften void and dubious nature of the information the zeal of 46% of users. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is after the higher price of the products the second, identified by the barometer brake. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Bond for the takeover of eXcentris </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Quebecer government, which has been invited by the Société Angus, as well as the company Parallèle to contribute financially to the takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris, explains with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive bond. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The developers society Angus, as well as the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture for the adoption of the Daniel Langlois covered cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent this back to his normal cineastischen function, apparently did not receive what they have requested. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The government has agreed to get involved in this matter, but on their own terms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Instead of the expected donation the Quebecer government offers a bond in less than initially expected, which could be a viable solution to advantageous conditions, at least according to the opinion from the state entnehmbaren rumour mill sources. </seg>
<seg id="6"> An initial action plan and a request for a 12.8 million had already been last spring by the Quebec rejected the Bittgesuch since again overall, revised downwards. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> A proposal together with an action plan has already been the President of the "Société de développement of entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, Minister sent St-Pierre, who chairs the acts eXcentris. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Several days ago he had provided her with a final report. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The counter-proposal to the cabinet was sent to the SODEC, however, on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Parallèle and Angus have until 31 December time to respond to this. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In any event seems to be the premise of public donation really pushed aside. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Let us remember that the Quebecer owners of cinema community and cinema complex against a direct government investment to support the takeover of eXcentris had revolted by made the argument that the Culture Minister have no financial support for real estate projects, which he does not have other cinemas. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Several of the other participants in the market segment called, however, in contrast, substantial economic assistance. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Cinema chief Daniel Langlois had reported after the self-financed construction of the cinema over ten years, with great difficulty, the authors of cinema in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exception from the treasury. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The lack of cinemas showing independent films, in Montreal, more than obvious, and eXcentris knew his client on board. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Société Angus, as well as the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, for its part, a privately financed Campagne, of which it is a total 700000 $ hope to boost the acquisition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Since the spring of 2009, only a single canvas continues to show films in eXcentris, Le Parallèle. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The aim is to future purchasers, the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the demonstration of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois of "hommes et des dieux" to re-open. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new American diplomats pipes, which have been disseminated by WikiLeaks, strip away the mystery about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of Canadians feel towards the Americans; but with the same blow the genres the latter open to Canada. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Consequently, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters to the ballot is not the Canadian-American relations in the spirit, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government to enforce their budget by 2009. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington were yesterday publicly disseminated, still offer more juicy details than the mere substantive content, which has been a very bad outcome. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A link datierende 22 September 2008, in other words, in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage are claimed in full swing, was reported, the point at which the United Nations is no longer in the operations of their political leaders. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The great surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador in Ottawa,. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Mr Wilkins offers various channels of explanation of this situation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "The Canadians almost economic inferiority complex caused possibly led the Canadian political leaders far more likely to talk about internal issues of everyday life, as the United States in this election pass the buck to (as in the 1988 campaign on free trade)," he describes. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The United Nations, it concludes, are "the proverbial Goliath this election: omnipresent, but potentially threatening to talk about him." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The ambassador understands these "deafening silence" especially since the two countries have intensive political and economic relations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Logically," he assessed, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leaders to drive such a crucial relationship, the voters at the polls as a key factor in the way." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The other expression of this sense of importance is to prepare in the 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business sources in Ottawa, sent communication, which President Barack Obama on his first visit in Ottawa. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Their visit will help the continuation of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade ago, the result of an expansion program of $30 to $40 billion," Breese describes. </seg>
<seg id="14"> He had no mention of the government's parliamentary session before Christmas had to be postponed in order to prevent that Parliament would be toppled by the coalition and the continuation of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed expansion programme. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Another datierende from January 2008, and on the part of the communication wrote Ambassador Wilkins agreed Washington from the increasingly growing negative image that the broadcast on CBC, dramatic series spread from the United States. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts as Border, little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which can be little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" or contributions for the purpose of Muskelprotze the CIA conducted interrogations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Another communication reported at length about how Hillary Clinton remarked with her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner in their first bilateral meeting was asked whether Europe is ready to accept some detainees from Guantanamo Bay. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Mr Kouchner should have answered the question, however, on the basis of an individual "case-by-case" decision. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Àm end of the meeting, described as "he has given the state Secretary of a paper in terms of Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslim origin." </seg>
<seg id="20"> "The Secretary of State has promised that the acts by once again watch." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> We can see finally that the sensibilities on the Web site WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Tom Flanagan, an old and very closely Stephen Harper of advisers, had declared on CBC that the people responsible for this massive leak killed "should be." </seg>

<seg id="5"> The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the world's vehicle fleet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In Copenhagen, had last year, the big exhaust gas emitters like the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans should the global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt downsized. </seg>

<seg id="16"> The main source of mercury emissions on the planet does not, however, according to the report, the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal-fired power plants that emit far more mercury in wasted by the white glowing pears to generate electricity. </seg>

<seg id="13"> " Make noise, " she said, expressing " loud and clear and constantly, " the words ' fundamental human rights, " " innocence, " " immediate release " in the media. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is necessary in order to bring the Iranian regime in a predicament that respects very sensitive to its image. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> "This is pursuing all the more so, since you ask, the Iranians not to do that." </seg>
<seg id="16"> Because "silence solves nothing," over the discussion about attempts to unauffälligem routes, the Iranians are "master in time-wasting tactics." </seg>
<seg id="17"> Mr Richier adds that the arrest of a foreigners ' expression: " hostage taking for Iranian tactic of " political blackmail. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss, from prison (on 16 August, on the day when she sneaks into the French Embassy) "demand the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230000 euro bail). </seg>
<seg id="19"> And he can say that the antizipiere Elysée further hostage-taking, a phenomenon which "will worsen." </seg>
<seg id="20"> The Iranians could arrest "in the near future, another of the approximately 1800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> 28 August 2009. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Clotilde Reiss is 12 days ago has been released from prison, but will continue to be detained in Iran. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The American Embassy, as many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence. </seg>
<seg id="25"> For Washington, which the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material provided for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid is a Khakavand bad news. </seg>
<seg id="26"> France has taken a horse-trading? </seg>

<seg id="37"> "Despite their full statements give Lobpreis secretly to the French authorities that they have only a vague idea what the Syrians have actually done." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The document also deals with the reasons which have led the Elysée, this fiction. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The intensive communication efforts "aims to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria," he analysed. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A 2008 launched policy, which was then "by many critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserved perceived." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="41"> "The Syrian role aufbauschend trying" Paris "to Syria, which laud can be achieved by plays a constructive role in the region." </seg>
<seg id="42"> The aim is also to "to sow discord between Syria and Iran." </seg>
<seg id="43"> The American Embassy knows this from a good source. </seg>
<seg id="44"> On 11 August François Richier had entrusted to her: "of course we do not know whether the Syrians whatever." </seg>
<seg id="45"> "But we have, despite everything, thanks to them." </seg>
<seg id="46"> "This should at least confusion on the part of the Iranians." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> One thing is certain, however: the edition of the 2018 FIFA King discipline in Europe, its traditional stronghold, to take place (the four candidates: England, Russia, Spain and Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The edition 2022 will then be a little exotic; the International Football Association hopes to win after the first on the African continent by 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia), or its branch in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to continue. </seg>
</p>
<p>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Since the debate about the modernization of transport to the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it is raining billion. </seg>
<seg id="3"> At least in the discussions. </seg>
<seg id="4"> You call this, in particular the 23 billion for the metro Grand Paris in memory, to be built by the Société du Grand Paris. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> At the start of construction of the SGP MEPs to launch, has declared the state a capital $4 billion. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the theoretical scheme that is the sum that would allow the SGP MEPs then to give the markets a portion of the financial sum on her two-fold. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Today it is finally come to first projections. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The supplementary budget by 2010, looked through this morning by the Finance Commission of the National Assembly, which includes measures to raise the first part of this money. </seg>
<seg id="9"> There is two ways: the creation of a special tax to Erschließund and higher taxation of the offices on the Ile de France. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The former, one person's Article 15 of the draft law, "to the benefit of the public-service channel Société du Grand Paris." </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is a figure: "the product of this tax amounting to 117 million euros per year." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Zweitere is an overhaul of the existing corporate tax: "in order to upgrade them, in order to increase its resulting product and to entrust this increase of Société du Grand Paris." </seg>
<seg id="13"> How much that would bring? </seg>
<seg id="14"> A mystery. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This amount is not in the text. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Of the 4 billion is far away. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "It is said that the fiscal resources to the 4 billion euros of capital allocation, which will be paid by the state and the Société du Grand to Paris and to be done on the project," according to the explanatory statement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The SGP MEPs will take place this system not offensive. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "Since the moment in which it recorded revenue (the two taxes, d.R.), we can design over three years, and only then will draw from the 4 billion," will said. </seg>
<seg id="20"> "This will be noted in the budget and gradually withdrawn." </seg>
<seg id="21"> The SGP MEPs to note that 2013 started will be 4 billion for the budget in 2014. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> This measure, the 4 billion promised they will be looking for a long time yet, runs the risk of a very troubled, parliamentary debate. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The first public meeting will take place on 7 December. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The dossier, WikiLeaks has a double meaning. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On one hand, it is turning out to be as obvious scandal, a scandal which is just a scandal in the Sinner hypocrisy, which ruled Beziehunge between states, the public and the press. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand, it announces radical changes at international level, and there is a foretaste of the future dominated by regression. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But we go to the next series. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any of the secret service produced acts (of any nation) exclusively from newspaper cuttings. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary" to read American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi's throw no more than what you for months anyway in any any Journal (except those whose owners Berlusconi is), and the profile of Gaddafi's terrifying karikaturierte offered Kabarettkünstlern already for a long time, fuel for their Sketche. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule that only the secret dossiers consist of already well-known news, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go into a library, esotherischen publications, you will see that each station (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, Templer, or the Rosenkreuzler) accurately repeats what has already been written in previous works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is not alone, therefore, that the author occult texts do not want to publish research (nor, therefore, that he did not know where news of the failure to find exist), but because those who pay the Okkultismus, nothing other than to believe what they already know and confirmed what they already have learned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Similarly, the secret files. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informant is lazy, lazy (or limited mental) is also the head of the secret service (he could otherwise whatever, for example, editor of Libération), the only true considers what he acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Top Secret information on Berlusconi, the American Embassy in Rome had sent the Staatsdezernat, were the same as those that Newsweek before the week was published. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> So why such a fuss was made about the revelations of these files? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On one side of this state, what every educated person already knows, and that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the government can call each other or take a plane in order to make dinner, have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small entertainment functions, have turned into espionage centres. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Any old viewers of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy, that they are doing so to ignore it. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Still, the fact that it publicly to repeat the task of the hypocrisy and serves to American diplomacy in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In second place: the idea that a n any hackers geheimsten secrets can tap into the most powerful country in the world, there is the significant blow to the prestige of the Staatsdezernats. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Moreover, the scandal is less the victims rather than the "executioner" in trouble. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we have the profound nature of what happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Formerly, Orwell's time, it was all power as a Big Brother pool of controlled every gesture of his subjects. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwell's prophecy had since then as absolutely right, where you can monitor every movement, thanks to the telephone, each made transaction, visited the hotel, the motorway and so on; the total victims of citizens would be the eye of power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But if you look at, what is happening now that even the secret Krypten power can no longer escape the control of a Hackers, control motion ceases to be one-sided and will circle shaped. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The controlled power every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers, chosen as an avenger of the citizen, the secrets of power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> But how can a power that is no longer in a position to protect their own secrets? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is true, Georg Simmel said that a real secret is an open secret (and an empty mystery may never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's basically a secret is free of Geheimis, because there is the public sphere price; but in the style of WikiLeaks disclose that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to deprive them of any power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> WikiLeaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel done wrong, but Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What will be the consequences of this violation, which has been inflicted on such a huge power? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the states will face in the future no reserved information online, that would be a angeklebten posting on the street corner. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is also clear that it is in vain with the current technology is to be hoped, confidential reports on secret telephone. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state in a moving aircraft and has contacted one of his colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could in future be private and only for certain ears certain relationships? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know very well that my prediction for the moment, according to science fiction and the novel sounds, but I am compelled to imagine the government agents, digging away at secret way in moving to uncontrollable march routes, their communications anywhere else than with the mere memory manifested itself, and beyond the few written information they have, in the verbergend shoe sales. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information would be stored in single copy in locked drawers: in fact, the espionage attempt by Watergate less success than WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity to write that the technology nowadays as a cancer progresses, backwards. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A century after the wireless telecommunications Graf had revolutionized communications, the Internet reconstructed a tele-Mr Graf with (telephone) wire. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The (analog) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers, a film auszukundschaften band to band, by spulen from behind forward and all could reveal secrets of the assembly, while the (digital) CDs now allow nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter in macro-Portionen. </seg>
<seg id="39"> With the high-speed trains it within three hours from Rome to Milan, while that by air, including the switching three-and-a-half hours. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Therefore, it is not extraordinary, policy and communications technology in cars and horse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> A final observation. </seg>
<seg id="42"> In earlier times, the press has tried to understand what kind of secrets were forged between the messages. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Currently, there are the messages, which are demanding confidential information from the press. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Climate: how France talking his financial promises </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A year after the Copenhagen treaty, it is time to examine the compliance with the quickly resolved financing promises ("almost start" or premature financing called), which were carried out by the developing countries. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And they are already exposed the rough French blandishments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With the Copenhagen treaty have developing countries committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The EU has pledged 7.2 billion euros over three years, France, 1.26 billion euros (420 million per year). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> At the opening of the COP16, the EU has pulled out all the stops to convince its partners from the fact of their commitment to the fast-start funding: faithful detail action report of its Member States, press conference, great side events, distribution of brochures. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The operation transparency is remarkable and estimated precisely for its real value: the developing countries and civil society would like to see all the developed countries with the same precision level. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The EU announced 2.2 billion in the year 2010 euro have released what it puts on the right path to Respektbezollung its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But if you look into the details, things are a little more complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should be according to the Copenhagen treaty "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional deployment was introduced, without, to the detriment of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately, there is no consensus, which means "new and additional." </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the EU Commission had proposed a harmonisation, have blocked certain members states, including France, the procedure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today everyone chooses the indicative value as it best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The EU Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those choosing of 2009: the international financing will be maintained, and in the context of the financing of the fast-starting " over three years to 150 million. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries have similar guidelines, either on year, or about conditions at the level of official development assistance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In return, France was of the opinion that the financing "of all new projects" of 2010 were "new and additional." </seg>
<seg id="17"> In other words, there is no benchmarks in the spending of the previous year or at the global level of official development assistance. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Specifically, can remain stable, the total amount of French support for developing countries (or decrease), France, to comply with its commitment to the "new and additional" funding. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is no rule, and each elects its calculation method. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, such as France, borrowed 1 _ as being equivalent to 1 _ donated. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This is obviously very difficult acceptable: the trouble is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loans for certain profitable investment (often to the emission-curbing projects based on actually technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro, which captured the equivalent for a donated euro... also should only the cost of the loan for capital donor country be counted as a commitment (i.e., the equivalent of an interest rate). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France has nothing else in mind than the following observation: it provides "respected" his commitment of 420 million euros, by 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros), and 8.5%) 36.1 million euros), also see the EU document in order to convince himself. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only EU land that loans to a great extent. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) with its commitments to 100% with donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union 1 _ spends to fulfil their commitments, France has just 10 cents and a similar commitment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Beautiful hocus-pocus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double deception: a part with a Weiterentwicklkung the action on the time and partly with the reality of financial support. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France, manages to suggest that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million, in line with its promises and saves euro 36.1 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy, the arbitrage has carried out) could be a doubly negative effect to; even internally (why drive the other members states with the donations, if it is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries are not completely fooled... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter of the premature funding only a small question on relatively short time compared to the discussions on the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it could be the drop too much in the huge machinery of the UNFCCC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> We hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Whatever the case, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year of premature funding. </seg>
<seg id="36"> First and foremost, France could be a change in his Verbuchungsart announce for the years 2011 and 2012, and in a spirit of respect for its obligations and compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> But above all, France could escape the discussions on the subject of a dispute, the long-term financing forward (another crucial and currently topic): the issue of "Verrechenbar" or the Verbuchungsart not its loans. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could change its position, in order to be just ahead of the curve in terms of the contentious issues, such as it is in other things. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The hope is based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A surprising announcement on the fast-starting of France and his vision of "Verrechenbar" as well as the use of loans would increase, by nature, the international confidence, which is necessary for further discussions. </seg>
