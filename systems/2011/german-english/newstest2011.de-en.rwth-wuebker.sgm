</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Surprisingly, the new councils in relation to the fall into these new concepts somewhat in the dark. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The claim they at least. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Anyone who is Voldemort?" </seg>
<seg id="8"> "No idea." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am a newcomer in the Prague policy", Lukáš Kaucký, the new President of the Council for Culture, the test of the "Godfather" vocabulary. </seg>

<seg id="11"> For example, the term 'golf hole ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "This is the only expression of those who put me here, I use every now and then." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Otherwise, I do not think much of slang." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "I believe, that is, to go into any Prague catering operation ," Plachý is close to reaching a solution to the problem, when we know that this is the headquarters of Janoušeks firms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> In line with Březina claimed he accessed on this knowledge, but rather from the newspaper, that it would be this vocabulary. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="1"> The right and the right mattress beds rust? Women have other things than men </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The tollste bed frame, but the quality of the mattress deck area - rust and make the bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> They must complement each other harmoniously, however, in order to meet the wishes of the actual user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In choosing to play a role in many cases, the weight, the size of the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the Schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Equally important is the Interieur, which have to mattress and rust. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> A typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In a weekend house in which will not heated regularly, are not Latex mattresses, as they need much longer, "warm". </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition, they are much more difficult than usual Polyurethan mattresses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And they should be changed regularly. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If they are not sufficient Entlüftungskanälchen at heart and still have to be a solid record, movement of moisture: It is not excluded that emerges from the mold. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the election, of course, also plays a role, which is used to be. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Anyone who has been a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with Weichschicht, will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with hard surface. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "All ice hockey players who have returned from the NHL, have complained to me that they cannot sleep more correctly." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "For their abgeschundenen shoulders, heels and waists, they need a Weichschicht from Visco sparkling (Memory Foam - a form of memory Polymer)." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I recommend including diabetic people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the" information "from the ligaments and skin badly ," said Sylva Hadamcziková who specialised in padded furniture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> That is why I have many years ago ice hockey players, but also other customers, with Visco foam mattresses (Memory Foam). </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses provide, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> And we must not necessarily be a famous ice hockey players, the benefits of the Visco surfactants estimate. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" actually works quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The sparkling optimalisiert his toughness and form the heat absorbed, in other words, he schmiegt itself, the warm body. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Nowhere is there, in the middle of the night shifts are not around as after a major battle. </seg>
<seg id="22"> We simply sleeping much better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The viskoelastische sparkling also offers protection against Dekubitus (gangrene). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In the election of the mattress size should add to body size is still the length of the foot soles, or about 21 to 34 cm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> As Mrs Mann, who are 180 cm tall, so a 210 to 220 cm bed. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Each of the sleepers should be at least 90 cm deck width available, 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In separate beds, for example, in singles, 120 to 140 cm. </seg>
<seg id="28"> For the sake of comfort and also for any visitors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Otherwise, the following rule of thumb for the ideal bed width: "If you remain on the back, should be enough room for the easy angewinkelten arms ," advises Ing. Prokopová Helena, the guild champion of the Polsterer and Raumausstatter who, for years the issue of healthy Schlafes and the ergonomics of furniture, and then put this issue to the schools. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> In a double bed everybody needs its own rust and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping for a mattress so high. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Otherwise we have no choice but to Roste in differing degrees to install and it is not every bed frame. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with the skeleton 15 cm, should account for at least three centimetres in the form of class and fine cushion. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "With the hand or placing may feel the feathers under any circumstances ," warns Prokopová Helena. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Every mattress makes a special type of rust. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document as of Siam twins have to be found in the bedroom. </seg>
<seg id="36"> These mattresses and cannot reveal the reference can wash what today already. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And since you lose in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years, slowly to a huge (and congested sieve). </seg>
<seg id="38"> Experts also reject advertising slogans, the mattress with a lifespan of up to 25 years, or even a lifetime guarantee. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Every case has its ifs and buts. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And that is why a practical advice from dealers: mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width of the hygiene of the waschbaren, not abziehbaren salary, however, it is recommended to use a Matratzenschoner, and wash it easily. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Even if they are made in the mattress salary with Rundumreißverschluss, so you get after the opening two halves (immensely important for the washing process and the washing machines size!), is the manipulation with larger mattresses, above all, how often the unequal struggle between David and Goliath. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> They are in bed instead of a Rostes a record? </seg>
<seg id="43"> In order to get out! </seg>
<seg id="44"> Or, at most, for a bed for unpopular guests and for a single night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> It should also provide them the record with ventilation holes (if not included) and mattresses with the skeleton and 15 cm minimum level with the Taschenfederkern and fine cushion. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Polyurethan mattresses are not in such a document. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For not verstellbare standards Roste with 14 to 18 (the last Lamellen) are Latex or sandwich mattresses (possibly also combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay themselves Roste with a larger number of standards, from 28 or more in services, with Lordosenstütze in Lendenwirbelbereich and the ability to regulate the tough standards. </seg>
<seg id="48"> On verstellbare Lamellen Roste are no mattresses with the skeleton, because they do not respond to the workplace disguise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> In addition to the suspension of the Steife pen to be offered special flexible shoulder modules. </seg>
<seg id="50"> This is a special fastening the services that makes it possible einzudrücken the pen, or verwinkeln so that they allow the specific Einsinken the shoulder of the Schläfers. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Especially for men with broad shoulders, an important matter. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There are even mattress manufacturers who have started, "gentlemen mattresses' Weichzonen for the shoulder area. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Also in the ladies - is intended to give these Weichzonen in the Hüftgegend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For ambitious customers are punktelastische Flügelfedersysteme (Lattoflex) or Roste with punktelastischen Pads contact with the Multitorsionsfederung. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure will be distributed to several points, reducing the tension. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But - if the right mattress and rust right a bad (too large and fülliges) used pillow, most of the benefits. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Here too, a rule of thumb: the pillow to prop up the head, his top should extend only to the shoulders, so that we can relax the shoulder muscles. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The ideal is a 50 x 60 cm deep cushions, as it may, for example, the Scandinavians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In the pages of the pillow (along with the Schulterentlastungszone rust or in the Weichzone in the mattress) make up the back. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Some of our modern mattresses, with the former (hay and straw bags packed) but in common. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials, or at least their mixtures. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Also in mattresses says the new magic word "organic". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Instead of oil raw materials used in the manufacture of Polyurethan foaming increasingly naturelle oils - for example, Rizinus and soya oil. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Soya is used well known by all manufacturers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> "Organic mattresses, which is to say their nuclear materials from purely natural ," said Petr Vašíček by the company Tropico Plus. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Naturstoffe but also be used in the production of mattress salaries - one of the first was Aloe Vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> You can take but also micro capsules, which spread the sleeping fresh forest or Lavendelduft. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Here, too, makes a difference between a man and a woman. </seg>
<seg id="69"> While the men "kühlender" is used plant extracts from birch leaves, so that the mattress to absorb the heat and cool the body, can have the salary for women "wärmende" effect. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Extracts from red Paprikaschoten stimulate the blood circulation, the weaker sex is sleeping in the wohlig so warm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> And today's favorite? </seg>
<seg id="72"> Mattresses from Kaltschaum (he has greater Poren with destroyed cell structure and is therefore atmungsaktiver than standard Polyurethan and much more flexible). </seg>
<seg id="73"> The combination of the various Steife (severity) of Kaltschäumen and Visco foaming create additional zones mattresses, who know exactly where to head, hip and heels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> For a quality mattress, but 7000 kronor and fork. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Gesundheitsmatratzen but usually are burdened with lower value added tax, as they apply as medical devices. </seg>
<seg id="76"> The first Czech companies was Gumotex this advantage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> You can see, the mattress and not to save the rust is so easily. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Every now and then there are special offers from manufacturers and retailers who offer two for the price of a mattress. </seg>
<seg id="79"> So the brand Magniflex the mattress Duofreeze with in the verstepptem Visco sparkling Memory for 11.990 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="80"> The second you get free of charge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> It was the Tempur material that launched the era of viskoelastischen sparkling substances with open cell structure and high density in almost kosmischem pace. </seg>
<seg id="82"> No wonder, but they have been developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to the launch of enormous excessive impositions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83"> Tempur will heat soft, entrenched in a cool environment it in turn. </seg>
<seg id="84"> So it fits perfectly in the human body and distributed on the best way the body. </seg>
<seg id="85"> It is therefore not only an ideal for the prevention of fire, but increased pressure generally sleep comfort. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86"> Viskoelastische sparkling substances are not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as, for example, used in particular Fußpolstern, allowing the legs and the vessels. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Domestic manufacturers use the sparkling substances Eucatherm C, Twin Saver or similar products. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Czech army has bought 445 kilometres detonators, detonated with bombs. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the previous year had supplied the Ministry of Defence, 224 kilometres but because of the army camp. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is reassuring to know that ausgesorgt the armed forces for 225 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The problem is the durability of the detonators - two, but no more than four years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The army bought the detonators of the Company STV Group, for example, mere 40 million kroner. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In his explanatory statement for the purchase of this huge amount, but because of the General Staff MF DNES, the soldiers would consume annually, but because of the 60 kilometres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Research by the army Pyrotechnikern, according to the MF raised DNES, comes from the fact that the army is a very intensive pyrotechnic education - by all the generals and officers of the army commandos, to the secretaries and women. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The defense minister Alexandr Vondra and army General Vlastimil Picek. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is the only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres Zündschnüren halfway. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The length of calls for 25.000 Detonationen. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="12"> But it also would extend this army stocks for more than ten years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But if the old rule of experts that are sufficient for the training of each new professional soldiers two metres but because completely, then the army by these Neueinkäufe - in the light of the increased needs of pioneering and special forces - created a reassuring stock for the already mentioned in 225 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The soldiers complained of Schnelleinsatzbrigade recently at the Defense Minister Vondra, they had almost no cartridges for small arms, so that more are almost certainly being restricted because of the lack of funds. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Not to mention the lack of trousers. </seg>

<seg id="16"> "I am not a, why they buy from us such huge detonators." </seg>

<seg id="23"> These tests are not in vain, but cost more money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Another argument of the Defense Department is the amount of the rebate for 445 km but because. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "It cost us sixty percent less than the letztjährige delivery of 244 kilometres ," says spokesman Pejšek the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="26"> Only by way of comparison, the annual consumption of Zündschnüren by the police, Pyrotechnikern liquidate the munitions from the Second World War or the Soviet army's brother, a few years, barely 1.500 metres. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> In the building of the soil in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police arrests in the last few days. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It has been taken of the European media entrepreneurs and real estate brokers Luboš G. by the Detektiven in handcuffs. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This allegedly tried to manipulate a just a public competition to the settlement of Restitutionsansprüchen so that Koštunica did the competition offered land a specific interests. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This is said to have paid Luboš G. for half a million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "At this stage, I can only confirm that the police a person convicted of the crime of fraudulent practices in a public competition ," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner prosecutor of the newspaper," Právo more details could not provide them with regard to the ongoing investigations. </seg>
<seg id="7"> 24 hours later was released the 46-year-old entrepreneur from the police. </seg>
<seg id="8"> How he was able to manipulate the public competition, we can speculate about the lack of official information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The spokeswoman of the land fund Lubomír Černá led to the question of Právo, the police have made in the Pilsner antenna of the land fund actually arrests and this during a public competition. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "It was a client and nothing to do with one of our staff ," it was. </seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Luboš G. were apparently information, who had filed the request and because he was justified, since he had bought a number of Restitutionsansprüchen, he offered a real estate interests that he is withdrawing from the competition. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Obviously, against a fat severance pay. </seg>
<seg id="16"> That would also be a sufficient explanation as to why he had to arrest him such a large amount of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Luboš G. had in the past too good contacts with the Pilsner soil. </seg>
<seg id="18"> So he played in the issue of the former chief of the land fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted because he failed to substitute restitution of properties that have been passed already location decisions on construction projects. </seg>
<seg id="19"> At the time Luboš G. acquired the land fund, for example, land intended to build public roads, more precisely, where was the construction of the access to the main route Borské pole industrial area. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Later he exchanged this very favourably with the magistrate directly against a house in the historic centre of the city, which exceeded the value of the properties. </seg>

<seg id="21"> Luciano has not forgotten his training but also the icing on the cake of national and even Latin Überbaus: "Italy Gelato is simply the best - and then there is still plenty of romanticism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first step towards the production seems quite simply. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Luciano repeals the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a big Mixgerät, heated with an electronic programme to 85 degrees and then cools immediately to four degrees. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Then he pulls the plug on a machine, and in a white base pasteurised cream, basis for all Milcheissorten. </seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg id="28"> How many ice cream "only from natural ingredients," has used may nevertheless stabilisers - usually a natural product, such as Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Of course, can produce ice without stabilizer, it must only be sold within a day, otherwise sackt it, and the customer bites on Eiskörnchen louder. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Some variation on the basic mass are permitted. </seg>

<seg id="38"> Now, the course participants in the Eismaschinen. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano leaves they each have four different types of vanilla, chocolate, Mokka and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The same experiment will be subject to the Fruchteissorten. </seg>
<seg id="41"> More flavouring substances, more fruit puree - taste is not necessarily better. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Hazelnut ice cream tastes not necessarily nussiger if it contains more hazelnuts. </seg>

<seg id="44"> A balanced mix highlight the taste of a Gelato correctly, says Luciano. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Eisherstellung is a computing task: will use peach puree with high sugar, must be reduced the amount of sugar in the basic recipe. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For lemon ice is an extra dose of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano draws a device, with a consequent impact on the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winemakers to measure the Oechsle in grape must). </seg>
<seg id="48"> Fortunately, facilitate the Rechnerei tables. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Ice to make no longer requires as much physical effort as before. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Not only the device for the automatic establishment of the mass. </seg>
<seg id="51"> There is also a device in which the final ice mixture and at the same time cremig is cooled to minus temperatures. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> In the audience may have thought of the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn Valhalla over there, "Rising" has changed? </seg>
<seg id="5"> A captured Vikings warriors with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) freed himself from his tormentors and with almost superhuman forces multitudes of his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody Action, precisely because it uses our hero like rough methods of killing and seized his enemies before the Gedärme from the vibrant, if he has a bad mood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On the other hand, says Einauge, as it is called, the film is not a word, and the other characters sought to succumb to a maximum of one or two sentences or a few agonizing death cries. </seg>

<seg id="9"> Well, if a film has several target groups, it is a shame, if they are mutually exclusive. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Director Winding Refn applies since his wild and gestylten drug dealers trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically, his works with a little humor the mainstream or a little less brutality, Arthouse accessible. </seg>

<seg id="13"> No wonder, then, that "Rising Valhalla over there" has been found in Germany no cinema distribution and appeared only on DVD. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is particularly because of the magnificent images of a hangover, but also because it is hiding behind the façade of a blood-stained unpretentious and sometimes exciting piece of cinema, which deserves some attention. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The country is, however, to comment on - nor does it controls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At midnight on 5 and 6 September 2007 are at least four Israeli F- 15 I fighter planes, a mystery, würfelförmiges building in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is on the banks of the Euphrates; the next major city, 30 kilometres, is Dair as Saur. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Their name comes up in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, built with Syria allegedly with help from North Korea in the Quader, hidden in a valley, the lack of electricity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a briefing of the U.S. foreign intelligence agency CIA at the end of April 2008 would have been appropriate, also under the name of the nearby town of el Kibar so common reactor to produce plutonium - to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For other purposes, by contrast, the technology from the fifties. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CIA has produced a video presentation with blurred satellite images. </seg>
<seg id="10"> By Computeranimation they played a, where they are supposed to be what components of the reactor, before the destruction of the Yongbyon fell a copy of the North Korean nuclear model from the centre. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In addition, it presented photos, the building from the show or even the atrium. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reactor has been just before the operation, it said, but has not yet been drawn up with fuel prongs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more than it was then known, the mystery over time were more likely to grow. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Former U.S. President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack fairly sure that Syria built in el Kibar a reactor, but hardly points to the fact that the country "an active nuclear weapons program". </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some intelligence officers in Europe are still cautious and prefer to speak of a "alleged reactor ," even if the CIA presentation of" plausible ". </seg>
<seg id="16"> You do not have hard evidence, as well as the IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Asked how he was sure to have a nuclear reactor, said a senior U.N. diplomat in the summer only shrug, the IAEA "enough material to ask questions ." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The rubble of the alleged "unused military building", the Syrians are rushing to one side and planierten the terrain. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Nevertheless, took place in June 2008 an IAEA team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el Kibar traces of uranium that had been made by people. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, the IAEA on a Member State provider of commercial satellite images from the period immediately after the attack, the more meaningful than the one presented by the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, to get these recordings on the market, because of the unknown client - perhaps Israel - it has bought exclusively. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The IAEA could not verify their authenticity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Syria has always, never a secret nuclear program or built a nuclear reactor. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then, refuses to Damascus to discuss it - as well as on the satellite images. </seg>
<seg id="27"> It also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el Kibar and access to the wreckage of the bombed-out building. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But Israel says sticking. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "We will never comment on this ," said recently at the time of the attack, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> So limps toward the investigation of the case since June 2008 fruitless and "is becoming increasingly to a serious credibility problem for the authority ,", a senior Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna - after all, is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area, which the IAEA. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As the key to progress in the investigation, the IAEA apparently three other facilities, the "in" functional link to relate to the alleged reactor - and unlike this. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The inspectors have so far not open, what plants are, or what role they have or what they considered suspicious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally as Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived from nearby towns. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and satellite images of a building complex in Masyaf, which is probably one of the suspected of objects. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It may be in or adjacent to a military base - with this explanatory statement denied Syria, the IAEA access to the three locations. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that will be sent on ahead so the IAEA from the United States, in order auszuspähen military installations. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Because the nuclear detectives were turned off by the U.S. secret services to the facilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos that was transported between the three locations and the Quader material on the Euphrates. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna, could at least one of the plants' in connection with the fuel production ". </seg>
<seg id="40"> "But there was no evidence of sensitive activities" uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes that are necessary to build nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The type of reactor operated with enriched uranium, which is not. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But where the uranium could have come from and where it should be separated from it later the plutonium for the bomb, on these key issues, there are at most plausible assumptions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> It is also unclear whether debris that could run the valuable traces, stored in three places. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As if the hundreds of lorry loads from the earth, no one wants to have information about where the rubble. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The only a few kilometres from el Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, salt mine al Tibni, has studied the Syria 1998 on their suitability as a storage facility for radioactive waste, the IAEA as unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had it in a recent analysis of satellite images for the prestigious journal Jane's Intelligence Review 'of the reactor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Borrowed from the orbiting show that Syria to the three suspected places Erdarbeiten and large container, after the IAEA access. </seg>
<seg id="48"> This may be a coincidence, but little to dispel the suspicion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> In addition, they say in diplomatic circles, have used the IAEA several months to develop a plan for inspections, which should allow Syria to maintain military secrets - shows the amount of the interest of the inspectors. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte this proposal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Had reassured Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, yes, that is why it is not a high sense of urgency, such as U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months' special inspections, one of the harshest means that the Vienna nuclear authority to enforce controls. </seg>
<seg id="52"> IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, these inspections should suggest, has been "an option, for which I am in the future ', but still he hesitates. </seg>
<seg id="53"> It is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it needs for a majority of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and many of the 35 countries represented there are anything but eager for an escalation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On the other hand, as a diplomat: "What if they end up with nothing?" </seg>

<seg id="2"> In the weeks after the sudden death of your man told Argentina's President Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy that pushed their popularity rate by 20 points to more than 50%. This is the highest value since its election in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Whether her, but next year to a re-election depends on whether the visibly mourning Cristina Fernández be more willing than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The signs are not clear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Néstor Kirchner, who drew even after the election of his wife's economic policy, often budgets, the tax revenues, the economic growth and inflation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This allowed the president, the couple spend extra revenue as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On paper, the Fernández government last year, the majority in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27, led to further divisions. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten rally behind Cristina Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But after chaotic meetings (in which a parliamentarian another in the face, and others accused the government of the bribery) Congress failed to pass the budget for 2011. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="11"> "I will not discuss it ," the President. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The 2010 budget is now for the next year, which the President has more opportunity to spend money as they see fit. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy is hot: they probably will grow this year by up to 9%. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official inflation rate is z.Z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands from the unions - the value of nearly 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was beset by economic crises, growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not the reduction of inflation. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="20"> The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the inflation undermined the spurt of growth through a large devaluation in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Perhaps join Cristina Fernández for this reason, Argentina economic terms to the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Earlier this year, the government has an agreement with shareholders, who had rejected the previous rescheduling of the country in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Now seems to push Fernández on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to which it owes about $6.7 billion. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Kirchners had a review by the IMF, as elsewhere, rejected. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But last month, the Economics Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund in the drafting of a new national consumer price index "technical assistance" will do. It appears that this would be the first step towards the cleansing of the INDEC. </seg>

<seg id="27"> It is not known whether Fernández after the end of its term of office without the support of her husband politically active. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely enough by the Kirchnerismus. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the Argentines in March from their summer holidays, the wave of sympathy, it has been shown to be fizzled. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice, Senator John Ensign acquitted of the charges, after his affair with a former Wahlhelferin and his attempt to make her husband, a lobbying against him were made, the lawyers of the senator on Wednesday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> That decision ended the most serious legal charges against Senator Ensign, a Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, the nationwide headlines and sparked a damper on his career, he was seen as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As Senator Ensigns office, he was known about the verdict after the year-long investigation "delighted". </seg>
<seg id="5"> The ethics committee of the Senate could impose a Disziplarstrafe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to the Ensigns lawyers were informed by the Department of Justice that stopped the investigations against Senator Ensign and that in this matter any further charges. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Justice Ministry refused to comment on the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The verdict was for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice a surprise. They believe there was sufficient evidence that Ensign has flouted the ban on lobbying. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Interviews, E e-mails and other documents that have been shown for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times open, gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election workers, helped to lucrative contracts to buy his silence about an affair with Hamptons wife Cynthia. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Cynthia Hampton was during an election campaign Ensigns as Treasurer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Ensign came in contact with some political friends to give Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over for them after the cessation Hamptons lobbying. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Since Hampton was recently in Ensigns election team, it was allowed to take it for a year of lobbying for his former employer, or the full Senate. </seg>
<seg id="13"> According to a statement of ethics experts in the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were friends before the affair, against the ban on the revolving door Lobbykratie. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> According to the published evidence "is apparently a consultation and the violation of the revolving door statutes ," Stanley fire, a Washington lawyer who has specialised in the defence of clients who are in the sights of the government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> While the Department of Justice official refused to give the reasons for the decision in the case Ensign known, said Mr. fire and other ethics lawyers, the department seems to be very careful in fuelled political charges after a series of defeats, persecuted by the media with great interest, including the decision last year, the indictment against the former Senator Ted Stevens because of misconduct on the part of the public prosecutor to drop. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Prosecutors "are obviously schreckhaft ," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the Association of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose objective is to fight against corruption in Parliament and government circles in the United States), a group of lawyers, has brought the various charges against Mr. Ensign in court. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "This means in principle that can expect high-quality government officials now believe that the laws do not apply to them ," she added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Paul Coggins, main defenders of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview on Monday that he had a telephone call from a prosecutor and another the next day, in which he was told that the Ministry will make no complaints against his client. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator, as his office in a statement on Wednesday repeated again, "acted in accordance with the law ." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr. Coggins refused, the legal arguments that he had made to the prosecutors to explain in more detail. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "I am not, in the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice and me. Let me just say this: We believe that made the right decision to have ," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Last month the Federal Election Commission to suspend the investigation because of a separate lawsuit by the ethics group, have breached a payment of $96.000 by Mr. Ensigns parents to the Hamptons against the federal election law. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money is something other than a gift. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Cheshire appeal on Twitter attention </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Half a dozen of them tippten in the riots in the courtroom. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the minutes, verschickten them on Twitter their reports on grausige testimonies. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the end, the defence, there were more than 140.000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and beds gekettete children in a house, the flare-up in flames. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Thursday, the process closely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was indicted, three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to find an official end, if the ruling on the death sentence, which the jury, falls. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted applications to court, the grounds for appeal and will employ the courts for years to come. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> One of the provozierendsten reasons is that it through the intense coverage of the process - through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporter - to a "circus" atmosphere and a widespread, swift penetration rebel details, so that the jury had been illegally by public outrage. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This objection could lead the Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules in the courtroom is necessary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "As I have seen during this process, I believe that it is a real danger, if the arrival of the new technologies in the courtroom that every individual's right to a fair trial ," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' main defender. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue chamber of the Supreme Court, said last week the applications by decision succinctly when he said that the "new media" would be monitored carefully, and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But this was not the last word on this matter. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For decades, the appeals court noted that the coverage of the notorious cases doubts about the fairness of the process. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In his historic 1966 decision, the Supreme Court of the United States the ruling against Dr Sam, a Sheppard osteopaths from Cleveland, who is said to have killed his wife, lifted and said in its ruling that because of the New Media, "a carnival atmosphere in the courtroom ". </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some believe that a television series and the game film "On the flight" is based on this crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some say lawyers, court appeals, which Mr. Hayes condemnation for half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary to ensure that the channels of communication from the courtroom, which at the time of the case were Dr. Sheppard still inconceivable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "There is a good reason, about the impact of new media in processes, which will be followed by a wider public, to be worried ," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut. His report says that it is imposed arbitrarily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor said Donohue, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of instant communications from the courtroom, could make the process fairer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Twitter is just one of many that the lawyers of Mr. Hayes to discuss for years and thus delaying a condemnation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defenders claim, for example, that have been regarded Mr. Hayes could already be, as the judges Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential judges by showed during the almost-certain selection grausige scene photos. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some of the judges said that photographs of the victims, Petit Jennifer Hawke, 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17 years, and thanking, 11 years, they have met with disgust. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defenders say, they would also make the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge mistakenly have exchanged a Juror, who was a critic of the prosecutor's office, and that he had exerted undue pressure on the ruling, as he had taken the unusual decision to make the jury over the weekend. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The judges were not isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But their arguments about the influence of the extensive coverage of the process is perhaps the greatest interest. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In a judgment that the challenge they have submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign for the office of the governor and the American Senate candidate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They argued that sparked the New media continually the flames of emotion on the case. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "Such a daily crush of media Scandinavia, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom ," the lawyers wrote," has seen it before in New Haven, and perhaps not even across the country. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Its focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In interviews, some journalists that the assertion that these are rabble-rousing than direct news reports, which will be reimbursed more slowly, is a technikfeindlicher, the verarme reporting about future processes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> But some lawyers, Appelationsgerichte would often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes need the Adaptation through the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr. Hayers lawyers reinforce this claim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In its objection to the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, which was lifted the sentencing of Dr Sheppard due to the reporting and made it clear that the new media, new rules. </seg>
<seg id="32"> "This case ," they wrote," represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century. " </seg>

<seg id="1"> Can combine courtesy that which divides us? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> After a campaign of epithets and negativity broke out this week little civility in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It is the harbinger of a real Zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion, before returning to quickly to the parties in the capital? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The meeting Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress brought no breakthrough in the big issues, during the so-called "lame duck" session, the meeting at the end of a government in which decisions are taken no longer had to employ. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After all, what we hear, it was neither to govern a polite discussion between the two sides of a consideration of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partisan collection points. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The public meeting of the deficit commission's president on Wednesday was civilized, despite the political differences that exist between the members. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months a mutual respect obtained of the ideological divide that separates the members from each other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> This is hardly enough to claim that it has entered a new era of cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Both sides are now in a test phase, in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise, even while trying to weigh up the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters, according to a new parties warfare. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants at a minimum requirements or charges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to be a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, could expect. </seg>
<seg id="12"> No matter whether taxes, donations, or health benefits, the two sides are miles apart. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Last but not least, voted in the November election, at least for a short time mild. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "No question, the tone has changed ," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, which is now for the" Ethics and Public Policy Center "works. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "This is inevitable after elections. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elections give partisan passions, the die again. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And that is a good thing. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> In some areas, particularly in those who are on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. " </seg>
<seg id="19"> Bush's tax cuts end up at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether temporarily or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is also expected to reach a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that people think that the favored tax cuts for the rich, while they support unemployed workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House has increased optimism that these issues during the "lame duck" session and at the same time to ratify the new START treaty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But warns William glass tone of the Brookings Insitution that a successful cooperation in pressing issues of the lame duck session "should not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation between the parties, if the new 112th Congress convened in January. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Instead, he says, is a phase of the Nichtübereinstimmens more likely, perhaps even inevitable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "After the things that need to be done, done, will turn these short-term psychology in confrontation ," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - the courtesy to gain their cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> "I do not see much of what is happening today until 2012, when Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012 ," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The reasons have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Teeparty voters who were their education. </seg>
<seg id="29"> However, Republican leaders are also concerned about the fact that they play poker too high, they know that they must try to fulfill their pledges to cut government spending and the healthcare reform law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> This party lines are already in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Commission's deficit, which include a tax reform and raising some taxes and raising the retirement age and reduce government spending. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have assumed that one of the toughest jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, so that the deficit issue on the public agenda that cannot be ignored. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But they need within the Commission in 14 of the 18 votes in order to make its plan to official recommendation and they are struggling to come even close to this figure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The biggest opposition in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters, today at least, there is little room for compromise or little sympathy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Galton says two phases in the battle between the White House and Republicans in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The first battle will be held next year in the form of party clashes, if Obama Republicans in the state budget, defying the taxes and the health system, followed later by a phase of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> What will lead to this change? </seg>
<seg id="37"> The public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It is shown that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, the majority of Americans still that the two parties together. </seg>
<seg id="39"> If confrontation in a dead end, as happened in 1995, both parties need to be careful about the public reaction. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Who will always doomed to lose, will change the course and must find a compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> This may indeed be an optimistic view. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Partisanship and polarization are today than in the mid-1990 s, and they seem more ideological divide between Obama and the Republicans in Congress at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At the same time, the activists of both parties in 2010 as a mere prelude to a much greater consistency in 2012 elections. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> In this sense, may have the courtesy which will be taken this week, will be welcomed by many Americans. </seg>
<seg id="45"> But it will require both sides very much more effort to find a common denominator in the issues that divide the two still. </seg>

<seg id="12"> "It was for life under the Khmer Rouge glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "It is dividing families themselves." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> During the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, were executed an estimated 1.7 million people, or they died of disease, starvation or overwork. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> "Cambodia is living in peace and stability ," she said. </seg>
<seg id="40"> "There would be no more prosecutions, would be war." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has fled in 1878 by the Khmer Rouge, has also repeatedly warned that the situation is uncertain, would accuse the court more suspects, although experts and historians to discuss this. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> "Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past ," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to move forward, said Chhang Youk by the Documentation Centre. </seg>
<seg id="44"> "Reconciliation with the Rouge times means gathering the broken pieces ," he said. </seg>
<seg id="45"> "It is our duty to put this broken parts together so that we can understand everything." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> The centre has created the first by the government approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75 page "history of Democratic Kampuchea". </seg>

<seg id="49"> Valeak touch, 19, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students to understand an important part of their history. </seg>
<seg id="50"> But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it. </seg>

<seg id="53"> Such resistance makes the reconciliation process is complex and complicated, said Sok Leang. </seg>
<seg id="54"> But the public forums, the school book and the court, and influence, "he said. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Belarus is in agreement, not weapons-grade uranium accumulate </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide has announced the Government of Belarus on Wednesday that will collect no longer highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting between the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The U.S. government had been trying for years to persuade Russia to collect no more highly enriched uranium and seemed achieved last spring a hurdle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But the U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that have been made in the past two months, two secret agreements with Belarus to remove about 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This was the scene of the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material, according to an official staff, which is due to the sensitivity of the issue of anonymously, about 500 pounds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuklearem security summit of 47 nations" in April, who had ruled Belarus. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And it was obviously well enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I was really excited by the fact that they have a seat on the Nuclear Security Summit (2012)." </seg>
<seg id="10"> "This is proof that it works ," said Ken Luongo, President of Global Security, a group for the promotion of nuclear safety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, within four years all vulnerable nuclear material. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since then, has helped the U.S. government six countries to its highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Belarus will be the seventh. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At the time of Obama's Nuklearem security summit, the White Russian President Alexander Lukashenko, the nation will never give up its uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally waffenfähig, and less enriched uranium ," Lukashenko said at the time. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "This is our commodity... We are not dirty bombs and we will sell it to anyone ." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We use it solely for research purposes, that is all ." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Belarus approached, however, a few months ago, the United States, as the tremor interest in meeting of an agreement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The first attempt to remove the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly complicated because the material was contaminated by radiation, officials say. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It was loaded into a Spezialzug, of more than 1.300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal of, say officials. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the officials by plane. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The U.S. government is paying for this effort $14 million, with much of the money flowing into the Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which can be used for nuclear weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "This was coordinated very carefully in order to build confidence ," to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, which is working on the Global risk reduction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The estimates James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende studies that Belarus this year at least £88 waffenfähhigen uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Belarus wants to dissolve the joint agreement be camp until 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenkos harsh disregard for human rights. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But the statement Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> "The progress of this global security issues, heißend, the United States of America and Belarus announced that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus is a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens ," she said. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> After the significant increase in Members' votes and the last regional elections, the PP is focusing on the general election - preferred or not.

<seg id="2"> The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday dismissed the possibility that there could be a wave of mergers of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry will be restructured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> When the concentration of the Spanish savings banks, not several savings banks out of the first phase. They were the second round. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand, assured the Director General of the Spanish savings banks'Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round would take place. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Zapatero and the red line of Germany </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin has opted for the favour of, keeping the euro, but at the same time, conditions for the whole of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tension on the markets have triggered a two-fold response from the government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand, has produced José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and micro enterprises, the regulation of temporary work agencies or the removal of the EUR 426 of support for the unemployed, not unemployment benefits, to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of the Barajas airport and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former government minister Felipe González, the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible for the current crisis herausbeschwört said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How to understand these events? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their public relations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In Germany, a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future, which clashes with the maintenance of the old traditions of most of its partners. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In the face of the resistance in Europe begins to spekuliern in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first is that a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south to leave the euro area. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Second: the reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - though it sounds now for science fiction - supported by a majority of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The third: a restructuring of the Eurostat according to German proposals. This means that more macroeconomic control; strict financial management; penalties for countries that exceed the targets; möglichereweise the default of some countries, as well as the extension of the costs of adaptation measures on the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is clear and, for some time. That is why there are no excuses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission incentives for deficits, and the German government is a constitutional reform from the sleeves in order to prevent this from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It was the first signs of the divergence between what was necessary for Germany (strict fiscal plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second message, the Central European country, as hinausschob Merkel's decision to rescue Greece. </seg>
<seg id="18"> At that time was heavily criticised. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion completely opposed to a bailout of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally, Merkel in recent days October anew with a clear position. It calls for a reform of the European Union agreements to facilitate the rescue of a country and at the same time, the private lenders to pay a portion of the costs. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position has been interpreted as anti-European, Ireland crisis and everything was as follows. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But her proposal, if somewhat sweetened. In the coming months we will be in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures from 2013 onwards. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has drawn a red line to. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It says all that - even if they have to be taken now unpopular measures - there will not be as of this date the functioning of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="24"> 2013 will be the year of birth of a new monetary area, in which the offending countries should be severely punished, may be forced to declare themselves bankrupt and, in this case, the private sector is part of the costs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany shows us that we must take a hard line growth, with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it has been led by Spain in boom times, will not be tolerated. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we would do badly to understand it. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not only about runterzufahren the government deficit by the year 2013 to three percent. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The demands are much tougher. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, is to cheat ourselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the current turbulence in more calm. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And the opportunities that will be offered until will use the spring of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that Zapatero has understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the major companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that, despite the criticism of Merkel's hypothesis to create order in their own house, had their way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But the Germany of red line is there, and it does not seem that would change. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Among the options under consideration is that we would have to leave the country with little serious cramped euro area, cannot be ruled out. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In this case could say Germany still, it warned us. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Sport and rule circumvention </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tricks like Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to circumvent a sanction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The alleged by two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos), launched in the game of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League meant that much ink has been spilled about whether it is an unsportliche act or not, and whether it should be sanctioned possibly both players by UEFA. </seg>
<seg id="4"> As is well known, the two players for a few minutes ago post-match (their team won already clearly) time and played several fouls, so that the referee showed them the second yellow card. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way, would give the Real Madrid and his group, the two players the mandatory sanction the next league game against the Auxerre comply with and without the cards in the next phase of the game. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Finally, punished the Disciplinary Committee UEFA's coach of the clubs, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The provocation of a yellow card or similar under such circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It has spread so far that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport followed rules. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Part of that debate about the case to the fact that a team of football clubs Real Madrid (the anthem in his precious courage and honor and on other occasions his players for similar incidents had punished) played the main role, and the proportion of Mourinho, the episode has added a more to its long history as theatralischer provocative and technicians. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In any case, the debate about whether this does not contradict the statutes expressly prohibited behaviour to the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts of circumvention rule. Indeed, this approach to the statutes of the sport, but seem to circumvent its meaning. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this matter should be examined the damage caused to the spirit of sport. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the offending players an unfair advantage from the opposing team. And it did not happen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The paradox is the act of players of Real Madrid, that it is not what we normally under false game or circumvention rule, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly, in order to avoid a penalty, but they should be as visible as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The players were waiting and took the sanction happily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Another issue is what kind of took advantage of the offender from the deliberate fouls. </seg>
<seg id="17"> It should be pointed out that neither of the rival in a disadvantageous position were still erheischt advantages for the feigned game, was the obvious result of this action, that the team with fewer players continue to play. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is also an useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have the players. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The advantage is clear is that the players in the next phase of the Champions League game without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree of uncertain advantage, because it could leave the team at some point. Moreover, the players with this approach a sanction and go in the second cycle of cards, in which they leave for accumulation of cards with a card less than in the first cycle. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is not clear whether it really is an advantage. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hydro Quebec has approved by mutual agreement project planning firms $450 million in contracts for the hydroelectric project Eastmain- 1 A Sarcelle Rupert. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consisting of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, the most important, namely the project management, has received a total of $295 million without tender. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The consortium, called "gérance Énergie", was 2004 as a side effect of the decision of Hydro Quebec, the private sector accountability, this important to entrust hydroelectric project amounting to a sum of $5 billion, formed. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In early 2005, earned the consortium "gérance Énergie" the lucrative contract, without a public tender. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For the Parti Québécois the embrace of business consortia a serious ethical problem, raising the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung and a price increase. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "This is a new way of a conspiracy and refuted the competition." </seg>
<seg id="8"> "That means that instead of taking fixes rather than on secret manner in an open manner ," said yesterday Simard Sylvain, representative of the PQ, at the press conference. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Early in the morning Simard had raised the issue before the National Assembly, because it seems to him hard to understand how to serve the public's interest in this way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Ressourcenministerin Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon, when she vehemently denied that it had acted on this treaty is a stitch-up. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "I stand by my line ," she railing, nourished by the PQ" dishonest ", and" lack of rigour ". </seg>
<seg id="12"> She said that it was "the least" that the PQ apologize. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The model of the consortium is common practice. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is usually a time such temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise in a bid to a tender for a complex project. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The project "East Main" has a high level of complexity in terms of its labour scale. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The construction is under way and should be drawn up until 2012. </seg>
<seg id="17"> However, it has been awarded the contract without a competition could take place; it had already made in negotiations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Moreover, the model of the consortium in the Quebec even with relatively simple projects no longer an exception. </seg>
<seg id="19"> As the newspaper Le Devoir "noted last week, is in a civil engineer and advisory system used model of the consortium of government investigations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> A short screen of the Quebecer company register makes it possible to identify more than 200 consortia, of which appear to be of some duration consistent. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In this way, for example, the company Dessau is working in partnership with the majority of its main competitors, CIMA +, Génivar, SNC lava Lin or Roche and Tecsult, together. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Any link, and there are several dozen, at one and the same legal entity, namely Dessau. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> What the consortium "gérance Énergie", Normandeau minister stressed that "is subject to the territory of the Baie James special labour dynamics and that is Hydro Quebec this fact since the 70 s in a particular way '. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Réal Laporte, the major employers of the Société d énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that the nose on the fact that frowning has approved the project led to agreement. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "If you are an invitation to tender and there are few applicants, will your prices." </seg>
<seg id="26"> "You have two options: either you do the people who are in this Walmart and saying you: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price." </seg>
<seg id="27"> "The idea is, however, that is not the price, but the expertise of the people ," said Laporte. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The consortium "Énergie gérance" approved contract is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50.000 of the Parti Québécois received $. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The contracts were either approved by the Hydro Quebec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain- 1 A Sarcelle Rupert. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" more than 100 engineering and consultancy contracts, the companies or their subsidiaries including, in particular, laboratories, resources have been allocated between 2002 and March 2010. </seg>
<seg id="31"> SNC lava Lin had tightened up 22 contracts per se, Génivar Tecsult had received 16, 14 and 10, Dessau without their participation in the "gérance Énergie" mitzurechnen. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Barometer verantworungsbewußten consumption - The "green" label is not inspire confidence </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Greener, but frankly sceptical. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The Quebecer consumer has little confidence among the main actors of sustainable growth, however, nor to the unmarked stamps or organic labels to steer his election. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is a shame, although basking in a media-oriented universe, where abound of information in favor of a more responsible consumption only: the scoreboard responsible consumption has to complain about a lack of credible information, a deficiency, which impede his commitment, as the first reading, which was held yesterday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Although they have encouraged the use of the so-called socially compatible products in 2010, the Quebecer, however, those who try to sell it to pay little credit. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Two thirds of the population Quebecer admits, in fact, the commitment of the firms as little as the green corporate advertising, betrays the responsible consumer Centre at the University of Sherbrooke sophisticated measuring instrument. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Another result: half of the consumer doubts the reliability of the official, the supposedly fair products have made allowances, but also the credibility of the products and brands, who declare themselves as environmentally aware, the scoreboard. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Following the same pattern is the discourse of the politicians on the subject of only 14.6% of the population Quebecer seriously. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The information on responsible consumption, it seems, however, important to stimulate consumption this segment, which is now being revived by nearly one third of the Quebecer consumers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In fact, viewed as dampening emptiness and dubious nature of the information the zeal of 46% of consumers. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is after the higher price of the products, the second part of the barometer identified brake. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, a third of the Quebecer indicated the performance of green products and services to them is trying to suspicious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to a different communication had already changed more than half of the consumers in 2010 and changed their habits of the brand of one or more products in order to give their conviction. </seg>
<seg id="14"> According to Eurobarometer had preferred it to 61% of their purchases of dealers city area and encourages the purchase of food grown in their region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Greener and more responsible - the index of the environmentally friendly consumption had reached this year, 64 of the maximum value of 100 - the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of the recycling, which is trying to reduce its left traces in the environment, he cares about animal welfare. </seg>
<seg id="16"> But the social and environmental consciousness seems to be still in his car, so the scoreboard: just 28% of the Quebecer have indicated, in 2010, public transport or the Mitfahrzentrale to demonstrate their ecological interest. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Walking and cycling were also advocated by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which keeps the stereotypes. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Quebecer government, which has been asked by the Société Angus and the Parallèle companies to participate financially in the takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris, with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a loan deal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The developers society Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of about seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture for the adoption of the Daniel Langlois, eXcentris cinema complex on the Boulevard Saint Laurent, to entrust this back its cineastischen function, not what they have demanded. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, however, to their own conditions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Instead of the expected Quebecer donation offers the government a bond in lower than initially expected, which could create a viable solution to advantageous conditions, at least in the view of the state from the scaremongers entnehmbaren sources. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, the Bittgesuch has been corrected since the overall, it once again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> A proposal, together with an action plan were already by the President of the "Société de développement of entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, sent to St Pierre, the minister in charge of the eXcentris acts. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Several days ago, he had to send a final technical report. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The proposal of the cabinet was sent to the SODEC, however, on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December time to respond to this. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In any case, seems to have been pushed the premise of the Heads of State donation really on the side. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Let us remember that had made the Quebecer owners community of cinemas and cinema complexes against direct government investment to support the takeover of eXcentris by made the argument that the Culture Ministers have to provide financial aid for real estate projects, he also have other cinema halls. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Several other participants in the market segment of the market, there have, however, by contrast, substantial economic assistance. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Kinochef Daniel Langlois was reported after the construction of the self-financed cinemas over ten years, with great difficulty, the authors cinema in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exception from the treasury. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The lack of cinema halls, the independent films in Montreal, is more than obvious, and eXcentris knew to keep its clientele. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The Société Angus and the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, a privately financed campaign in which they hope that a sum of $700 000 to boost the acquisition. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="2"> The new, American diplomats, who were told by Wiki Leaks, open up about what the United Nations under the Minderwertigkeitskomplex the Canadians to the Americans, however, with the same blow the mixing of the latter to Canada. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Consequently, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters at the ballot kanadisch American relations in the spirit, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government to enforce its budget by 2009. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were told yesterday, offer more juicy details as the substantive content, in which the very people. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One of 22 September 2008 carved, i.e. in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage in full swing, reported, which do not join the United Nations more of their political leaders discussed operations. </seg>
<seg id="6"> To the astonishment of David Wilkins, in Ottawa, the American ambassador. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Mr Wilkins offers a variety of channels this situation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "The Canadians led to an almost innewohnender Minderwertigkeitskomplex, perhaps the Canadian political leaders have much to talk about the issues of everyday life, as the United States in this election the can (as in 1988 when the campaign on free trade) ," he says. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The United Nations, he concludes, is "the proverbial Goliath this election: omnipresent, but potentially threatening to speak of him". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The ambassador understands the "deafening silence" the less, since the two countries have close political and economic relations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Logically ," he assessed," it should be the ability of a candidate of a party, and much more of a party leaders for holding such a crucial relationship, which has in the polls as a key factor in the spirit. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The other, this sense of importance is in on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, broadcast, communication is to prepare the President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Their trip will help ensure the continuation of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget in early February, which will give Canada its first deficit after more than a decade known, which is due to a recovery program in the 30 to 40 billion dollars ," describes Breese. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Nowhere did he mentioned that the government's parliamentary session before Christmas had to be postponed, so that Parliament would be overthrown by the coalition and would be the case with the opposition parties on the quality of the proposed recovery programme. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Further, in January 2008 and carved from the ambassador Wilkins written communication Washington from the increasingly negative image that the broadcast on CBC, dramatic series by the United States. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The ambassador is worried about programmes such as Border, Mosque calls on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly" list can observe or payments for the purposes of Muskelprotze of CIA interrogations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Yet another communication widely reported, as asked Hillary Clinton in her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting on whether Europe is prepared to accept some detainees from Guantanamo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question, however, on the basis of an individual "case by case" decision. </seg>

<seg id="20"> "The Secretary of State has pledged to look through the acts again". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Finally, we note that Discussions passions on the Web site Wiki Leaks. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very closely related adviser, declared on CBC that the people responsible for this massive leak "should be killed". </seg>

<seg id="1"> A global plan for renewal of the lighting </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The U.N. has yesterday in Cancún a plan to renew the lighting of households, Trade and Industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (CFCs), equivalent to almost a third of the additional reduction, which must be implemented in order to stabilize the earth's climate by 2020. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This ambitious plan takes his position in the concrete steps of major projects, the implementation of the U.N. in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by developed countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> After yesterday's plan would be the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) can be avoided, because of the lighting of the earth, CFCs, if the weißglühenden pears, which has a monopoly of between 50% and 70% in the market, by fluoreszierende or, better still, by light-emitting diodes (LED) would be replaced. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of global vehicle fleets. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In Copenhagen last year had to exhaust the big emitters like the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans, which should lower the global CFC emissions from 53 to 49 Gt Gt. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This review should be deducted, however, still 5 Gt to stabilize between now and the year 2020 climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius, in order to prevent this is out of control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the weißglühenden pears show 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% of the light. </seg>
<seg id="10"> With the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen, reduced energy consumption by 75%, with the new LED bulbs this energy demand once again twice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen keep on average between 6000 to 10.000 hours. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The new LED bulbs, such as those expressed by the manufacturer Philips this week on the market, the company has also participated in the study - have a life expectancy of 25.000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a weißglühende pear, which gives an indication of the savings of the replacement plan, which is to be applied in 100 countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> In addition to the fact that iese completely new light bulbs very little heat, they can work with a rule. </seg>
<seg id="14"> And they contain no mercury. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Several experts have pointed out that Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves, because they contain mercury and therefore must dispose of hazardous waste, which is not always possible in the developing world, except the producers are an adoption agency. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal plants that emit more mercury to produce the weißglühenden pears wasted electricity. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the United States alone, these coal plants 25.000 tons of mercury annually. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The report sets out in detail the profits, which would account for each country, thanks to this international program. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Indonesia would save as, for example, a billion dollars annually in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose edification Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> One thing is certain: the 2018 edition of the grasp of the FIFA is in Europe, its traditional stronghold, (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The 2022 edition will be something exotic; hopes the International Football Federation, after the first of its kind on the African continent in 2010 new countries (Australia, Qatar) win for himself, or his office in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to pursue. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The list of personalities, the delegation of (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Prime Minister, Zidane, Beck mothballed, Cruyff) is the degree of economic and political use of a world championship. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The machinations behind the scenes are threatening to hold until the last minute. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="9"> But these considerations will not be for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees at the election so important. </seg>

<seg id="18"> "At the moment there are no problems, not on short-term or long-term view, because of Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, and A. R.) calls for lower stabilisation progress than from other countries ," observed Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD. </seg>
<seg id="19"> There remains the question of the political Unstetigkeit. </seg>

<seg id="9"> There are two ways: the creation of a special tax to Erschließund and higher taxation of office on the Ile de France. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The former, remove Article 15 of the bill, "for the benefit of the public service broadcaster Société du Grand Paris". </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is calculated: "The product of this tax amounts to EUR 117 million per year ." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Zweitere is an overhaul of existing corporate taxation: "to modernize them in order to increase the resulting from their product and to entrust this increase the Société du Grand Paris". </seg>
<seg id="13"> How much would it? </seg>
<seg id="14"> A mystery. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This amount is calculated not in the text. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Of the 4 billion is far away. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "It is said that the fiscal resources will be added to the 4 billion euro capital endowment, which will be paid by the state and the Société du Grand Paris gradually for the project ," says the explanatory statement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The SGP is not this system at all offensive. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The affair Wiki Leaks has a double meaning. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On one side, it turns out the obvious scandal, a scandal, which is simply a scandal in the Sinner hypocrisy, the Beziehunge between states, the public and the press. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other hand, it announces radical changes at international level, and gives a taste of the future dominated by regression. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But we are moving in the right order. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of Wiki Leaks is the confirmation of the fact that any of the intelligence produced a file (x) any nation composed entirely of Zeitungsausschnitten. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary ," American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi's throw anything more than what we had to read for months anyway in any particular x Journal (except for those whose owners Berlusconi), and the appalling karikaturierte Gaddafi's profile was Kabarettkünstlern already for a long time for their skits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule, not the secret files from previous news, is essential for the dynamism of the secret services, and not only in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go into a library dedicated esotherischen publications, you will see that each plant (the Grail, the mystery of Rennes le Chateau, the Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) exactly the repeated what has been written in previous works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is not, therefore, that wants to publish the author occult texts (no research yet, therefore, that he did not know, not to turn to when news of the exist), but because those who dedicate themselves to the Okkultismus, nothing else than to believe what they know and have already confirmed what they have learned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is also the best mechanism of Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Similarly, the secret files. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informant is lazy, lazy and (or limited mental) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be, for example, editor of Libération), the only considers to be true, he acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Top Secret information on Berlusconi, who had sent the U.S. embassy in Rome, the Staatsdezernat were the same as those who had already Newsweek published the week before. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> So why was made such a fuss about the revelations of this dossier? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On one side, which stipulate that any educated person knows already that the messages - can call at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the Government each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of a few small representation tasks, have turned into espionage centres. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that acting to ignore it. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Still, the fact to repeat it publicly, the task of hypocrisy and serves to put the American diplomacy in a bad light. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Second: the idea that can tap a x any hackers geheimsten the secrets of the most powerful country in the world, poses a significant blow to the prestige of the Staatsdezernats. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The scandal also produce fewer victims, rather than the "executioner". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we are of the profound nature of what has happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Formerly, to Orwell's times, was able to concentrate all power as a Big Brother, every gesture of his subjects are controlled. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Orwell's prophecy could prove as absolutely right, where you can monitor any movement, thanks to the telephone, making any transaction, visited the hotel, the motorway and so on; the citizens would become the victims of the eyes of the total power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But if you consider what is happening today that can escape, not even the secret Krypten the power of the control of a Hackers, listening to the control of, unilaterally and will zirkelförmig. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power to control every citizen, every citizen, or at least the hackers - acquired as avenger of the citizen - can bring the secrets of power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> How can a power that is no longer able to maintain their own secrets? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is true, Georg Simmel said that is a real mystery a hollow secret (and a hollow secrecy can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's basically a secret free of Geheimis because it exposes the public sphere; to lay in the styles of Wiki Leaks openly that the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty secrets, means to deprive them of any power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Wiki Leaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Angela Merkel, but on the other hand, Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What will be the consequences of this violation that has been inflicted on such a huge power? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that the states in the future no longer reserved for information online - which would amount to the street corner angeklebten posting. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is also clear that, with the current technology is to be hoped in vain, to be able to keep confidential reports on the telephone. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing is easier than figuring out whether and when to move a head of state in a plane and has contacted one of his colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could be maintained in the future, and only to some ears certain relations? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know very well that my prediction sounds at the moment, science fiction and romanhaft, but I feel compelled me to imagine the government agents, in a secret way preoccupied with uncontrollable march routes, moving their communications anywhere else than the mere memory in order, and the few written information that they have, in the verbergend footwear sales. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically has enjoyed the espionage attempt by Watergate less success than Wiki Leaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity to write that the technology now like a cancer, backwards. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A century after the Telegraph wireless communications, reconstructed the Internet with a Telegrafen (telephone wire). </seg>
<seg id="38"> The video cassettes (analogue) had enabled the researchers film, a film auszukundschaften band for band by was able to lift it from behind, spulen and all the secrets of the assembly, while the numerical (CDs) allow nowadays is to jump from chapter to chapter, macro portions. </seg>
<seg id="39"> With the high-speed trains you drive within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this requires by plane, including switching three and a half hours. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It is not unusual that policy and communications technology on car and horse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> One final observation. </seg>
<seg id="42"> In earlier times tried to understand the press, which have been forged between the secrets of messages. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Currently, the messages, the confidential information from the press. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Climate: amount as France its financial promises </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to comply with the quickly resolved financing promises (also known as "fast start" funding or premature), which were carried out by the developing countries. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And already are exposed the rough French blandishments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With the Copenhagen Treaty have committed themselves to developing countries, 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The EU has pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France (1.26 billion euros (420 million) per year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> At the opening of the COP16 has learned the EU out all the stops to convince its partners from the fact of its commitment to the fast start funding detailgetreuer approach: report of its Member States, press conference, great side events, distributing leaflets. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The operation transparency is noteworthy and I feel valued for its real value: the developing countries and civil society would like, if developed countries were all the same thing at the same level of precision. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The EU announced, released in 2010 2.2 billion euros, which it puts on the right track to Respektbezollung commitment of $7.2 billion in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you look into the details, but things are a little more complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> This money should, according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new and additional" to ensure that has been tabled an additional commitment, without benefit to the detriment of public development aid. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means. </seg>
<seg id="12"> While the EU Commission had proposed a harmonisation, certain members states, including France, blocked the procedure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Today, everyone chooses the benchmark, which he considers to be the best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The EU Commission has chosen, for example, a benchmark for those of 2009: the international financing will be retained, and within the framework of the "fast start" funding over three years to 150 million. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other countries have similar guidelines, either in a year or about conditions at the level of public development aid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In return, France was of the opinion that the financing "of all new projects" 2010 "new and additional". </seg>
<seg id="17"> In other words: there are no benchmarks in the spending of the previous year or at the global level of official development assistance. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Specifically, the total amount of French support for developing countries stable (or decrease) - France, his commitment to the "new and additional" to keep funding. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Moreover, there is no rule, and everyone chooses its calculation method. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some, such as France, 1 Euro borrowed as being equivalent to 1 Euro donated. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the trouble is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to the emission reduction projects, which are based on maximum technology) can be justified, it is misleading to present the euro, the captured as equivalent to a donated Euro... They should be counted only the cost of borrowing for capital commitment as a donor country (that is, the equivalent of an interest rate). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But France has nothing other than in accordance with the following comment: "respected" its commitment of EUR 420 million, 91.5% of loans (389.8 million) and donates 8.5%) 36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince themselves. </seg>
<seg id="25"> France is the only land of the EU that loans. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among others) to their commitments to 100% with donations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union in 1 Euro to fulfil their obligations, France just 10 cents and understands including a comparable effort. </seg>
<seg id="28"> More beautiful hocus-pocus! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> All in all, France in his fast start funding with a double deception: part with a Weiterentwicklkung the action over time and partly with the reality of the financial commitment. </seg>
<seg id="30"> France will succeed, believe that there are 420 million "new and additional" has spent millions in accordance with its promises and save 36.1 million euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it appears that it was Bercy, who carried out the arbitrage) could have a negative effect on twice; once the EU (why the other member states with the donations, but if there is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, since not all developing countries are completely... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The chapter on premature, only a small issue on relatively short time compared to the entirety of discussions on the climate. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it may be too much of the drop in the machinery of the UNFCCC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> We hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> However, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year premature funding. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In the first place, France could announce a change in its accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for his commitments and the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> But above all, France could bring the discussions on the subject of long-term financing forward (another key topic) and at the moment: you can escape the Verrechenbarkeit "or" not the kind of recording its loans. </seg>
<seg id="38"> France could change its position in order to be as advanced in terms of the issues, as is the case with other things. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The hope is based on the new environment minister Kosciusko Morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A surprising announcement on the fast start of France and his vision of "Verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loans would increase by nature, the international confidence, which is necessary for further discussions. </seg>
