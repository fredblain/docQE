Do the castle clubs pull soon to a strand?
Last there was again and again discord between the two Wolfratshauser castle clubs.
Now the executive committees think about a possible co-operation.
As model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser castle the deceased Richard Dimbath, former chairmen of the Wolfratshauser of castle friends stated, the project in the French Guédelon.
Still one year ago no good climate between the castle club and the castle friends Wolfratshausen prevailed.
Expressed differently so far the points of view seemed, how with the history of the Wolfratshauser castle and a possible reconstruction were to be gone around.
Now the both bearings approach one on the other: Already soon discussions are to be led across a joint action.
The club executive committees Torsten Sjöberg (castle club) and Herbert Piffl (castle friends) on demand of our newspaper confirm that.
“I called and suggested Mr. Piffl that we could build ourselves up once”, report Sjöberg.
According to him all members of both clubs could pull in the future to a strand.
So faster visible successes are to be registered.
While the castle friends had the deceased Richard Dimbath to last a reconstruction of the castle at the mountain forest in the eye around that suddenly, the “development and experiencing bar making” of the area in foremost place stand for the castle club around Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, second chairmen of the castle friends, was pleased according to their own statements about the call very much.
Since Dimbaths death it manages the castle friends.
A new chairman is to be found to in the middle of Septembers in a meeting of the members.
Momentarily the club counts 74-year old approximately 40 members according to.
“After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath we let the club activities from respect rest first”. This “thinking phase” was necessary, in order to consider “, like it to continue could”.
According to Piffl the new chairman is to then go into the discussion with the castle club.
By then the castle friends could make themselves also a current painting conveying a special atmosphere within their grouping.
There is, says a candidate for the presidency momentarily not yet Piffl.
“However I am confident that someone will be”. He does not want to stand as a candidate, because he has his domicile in bath Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to cooperate in the project “however very gladly further”.
The different points of view in things reconstruction will probably remain existing in the eyes Piffls in next time.
It appreciates Dimbath as “missionary”, which always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already far progressed projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a castle in the air.
By a high participation of the population as well as by voluntary aides from all over the world they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: “Also I was at the beginning sceptical.
But in the course of the time I am more and more arrived at the conviction that it is meaningful, the project to advance”. A “unique selling proposition” can be created for the Flößerstadt.
Here it gives nothing else.
Besides the project would be eligible for financing by European Union-subsidies, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, believes Piffl.
“I do not want to throw the idea of the reconstruction personally therefore simply over board”. He hope that perhaps the castle club in this point moves something.
Their goal of documenting history first “is important and good”.
Afterwards one would know further marriages.
