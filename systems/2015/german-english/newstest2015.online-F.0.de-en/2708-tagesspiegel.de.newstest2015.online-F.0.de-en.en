The devastating Ebola epidemic shifts the economy of west Africa a heavy impact.
The harvest rots on the fields, which are mines abandoned and which markets becomes an orphan - the virus added to the region heavily.
Also some international enterprises already go on distance.
“The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economical”, judges the boss of the African development bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is hardest concerned
“It is a total disaster, we loses very much money”, says Alhaji Bamogo, which sells Monrovia clothes on the second largest market in of Liberia capital.
On the market comes only, who wants to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola.
Liberia is hardest of the virus met, alone here fell the fever more than 600 humans to the victim.
Recently the health authorities, the illness explained in each angle of the country had penetrated.
Also in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria the virus spread.
Altogether already more than 1500 humans, thousand further died were infected.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Everywhere in the resources-rich countries companies suspend their enterprise.
Foreign enterprises like the steel concern Arcelor Mittal withdraw their employees, several international airlines do not approach the regions concerned.
Also the native resellers and farmer react: Only few merchants leave still their places of residence, in order to procure supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which stand under quarantine, among other things the cocoa and coffee beans on the fields, important for the export, rot.
The farmers do not dare it to leave for the harvest it home.
Food becomes limited
“Humans will less and less travel”, say Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert for the economy of west Africa.
The man for example, normally on the market goes and its vegetable rather at home sold, remains.
The population gets therefore the consequences of the epidemic urgent to directly and feel: Food becomes limited.
On the markets the supply of staple food shrinks such as rice.
An image damage threatens the region strongly dependent on international companies at the same time - with sweeping consequences.
The largest danger is that international companies avoid the area in principle over long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French Think tank iris.
Is crucial, as far and how long the virus will still spread.
With investors the impression can develop, “that it is dangerous, in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia warns to live and thus also invest”, Hugon.
The illness loads also the strained national budgets of the states
The illness loads also the national budgets of the states concerned strained anyway.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets strongly by the high expenditures for the health system and additionally by the worsening economy are strained.
The African development bank already promised to help out the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million dollar (45 million euros).
Noticeable the effects also already are in Nigeria, where so far only few cases of Ebola were diagnosed.
The oil-rich region is not so far concerned in the southern Niger delta.
But already many humans from fear of an infection remain elsewhere at home.
Also reservations in hotels decrease clearly.
