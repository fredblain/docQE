Matthies means: High time to large interlacing
In view of the galloping technical progress, which threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech control centres, our columnist Bernd Matthies with electronic accessories extremely trusted comforts itself.
While I write that here, falls my view of the coiled cable, which connects the listener with the telephone, and I think: Boah, how retro is?
But behind it a consideration puts: If the cable were not, in no time all listeners would fly around abandoned in the house, and that would still importantly be more retro.
Anyway is valid on the ekeltronischen (ekeltronischen?
No, typing errors: electronic) sector the rule that the world first is today the electrical scrap iron from tomorrow, bought - becomes outdated.
And who has for example still today another tube television in the living room, it says with the fact only that he rejects television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the crushes of the Ifa at the radio tower this week again our absolute incompetence leads us in questions of electronics before eyes.
The layman, who controlled early washing machine and CD player blindly, does not even understand today the purpose of the devices, which are spread with incomprehensibly vain expert speech before it: “Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and urban Technologies” promises us the press office.
Yes, it goes still?
About what is one to talk with people, which spread obviously voluntarily such quark?
In the reason it concerns yes for approximately 20 years above all that we are to interlace kindly our house.
So that orders itself additionally yogurt, so that the fire alarm communicates us on vacation on the Maldives that it burns in the work room degree.
And wouldn't it be marvelous, if we from the office the air conditioning system on our imminent arrival…?
Yes, however an air conditioning system presupposes.
But a dream completely certainly shortly true: We lift our wrist-watch, say it according to “sucking!” - and at home the dust suction robot drives off.
Err.
Everything runs out on nothing smaller than a revolution: “The borders between whiter and brown goods blur”, murmur an industry insider, one can the washing machine with a headphone connect, the steam oven send the weather forecast and the data glasses show, how long the pizza in the baking-oven still needs, which uses however nothing, because we are located in the back-up.
From daily practice we know in addition: If newfangled equipment is really urgently used times, is guarantees the accumulator empty.
Which a further reason for it is that the coiled cable at the telephone will survive also the next radios and television exhibitions.
