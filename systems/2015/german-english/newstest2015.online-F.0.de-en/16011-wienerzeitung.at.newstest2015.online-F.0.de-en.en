Konstantin Weckers's relentlessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical certification than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, Liedermacher, Pazifist, activist, brought ex-prisoner, in “monk and warrior” on 287 pages to paper.
Not chronologically, but more thought shred for thought shreds wrote on 1 June 1947 the born Munich its memoirs down, each chapter by way of introduction by a suitable song text.
And it is relentlessly honest thereby: Of the masturbation as a high school student up to the shoplifting and drug consumption he does not omit human weakness.
Also, in order to point out, how he learned tolerance in handling his fellow men.
Widths area take also abstract, but all the more important terms: Love, soul, ego, its in now, spirituality - all it tries to go on the reason, on very philosophical, in addition, very personal way.
And it described also its pacifism, its social criticism, its political commitment coined - and also, like it not only the music (the opera lover became the soul and rock musician), but also its prison stay.
The latter has the life man Konstantin Wecker also the ascetic monk brought home, which results “from subtraction”, as it says, “as one all unnecessary one omits”.
Between all the high-mental opinions gives it in addition, short anecdotes for grounding: for instance over fights in one of GIs frequented restaurants or a crazy drive, with which it sighted frontally a tree.
It is relentlessly honest also there.
