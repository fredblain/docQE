Lenny Henry: My father never took me into the arm.
Has never said “I loves you”
Henry was from seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in the year 1958.
Its father, who died, when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses rare records, which are partly based on an imaginary discussion with its father and developed from the series on radio 4 for a comedy, Rudy's.
That soundtrack is a mixture from reggae and RAP, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work itself by some difficult childhood moments.
It visited “many” therapies after the death of its mother, and Henry is thoughtful over its relationship with its father.
It was heavy to know it.
One never saw its face, heard only its voting: “Stop with the noise.
Leave your sister in peace.
Move you!
I want to look Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - which had already arisen, when I was a child - went with him into the tavern and spoke about things, like the form of the beer glass or the beauty of a Cricketschlags.
I had never such a discussion with him.
A majority of my life it was this serious type in the corner, which the newspaper read.
Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at times of its father, he won nevertheless an insight of as the life for him might have been.
It is now somewhat brighter, but they are dark, stygische labyrinths smoke-filled and deep with flame impacts and smoke and much soot.
My father put to hear in former times simply into the tub and then could one him slowly, how he began to sing, because he could wash the foundry of itself.
When I ran around there, it became clear me that he had for many years done that, in order to bring the meal on the table, and my attention for him became larger.
Henry buildup nevertheless as a child without love testifying of its parents.
My father never embraced me, he said never “I loves you”.
Only as it to my mother toward end of their life badly went, began we, “I loves you, I loves you, I loves you” to say.
By its own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could divide the love, which he had missed as a child.
Could you times with “I love you” to stop?
Stop nevertheless embracing me!
Dad, I am 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She is a great mother.
It is still friendly with French, with which it was 25 years married.
Dawn is good humans.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henrys own mother was Diabetikerin.
That contributed to its death.
As I thus very much, very overweight became and symptoms of diabetes showed, said my physician “you must be radical.
Thus I pulled this fitness thing through and had also a drastic diet to make, in order to turn around the symptoms.
It is very heavy.
And it is arduous.
Nobody eats gladly carrots.
Perhaps Henrys career change shows up in its elegant, shortcut beard.
Since it was praised by the critics for its Othello, he is taken in of the theatre.
The comedy of the erring followed, and then Fences of August Wilson.
That is another experience than the sitcom and comedies, which filled out its busy working life.
It began with only 16 years, when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered it on the stage, as he people imitated and wrote new Faces over him.
Its television career began in the middle of the seventies. “I was for a rather long time the only black Imitator/comedian on TV.”
He learned in the profession.
I did not only have to become large before the eyes of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985 to learn, how I could become an efficient joke telling machine, while I was by the television a star, and that was really with difficulty.
Lenny 1975 with new Faces
Since its manager possessed the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel show, an easy entertainment program, in which the people painted themselves “black”, specified Henry its Comedy there over five years.
My family was very unpleasant that.
I wished somehow that it would have never happened, but I do not repent that I did it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I cooperated in giant projects and learned, how one deals with a large audience.
But this “price-crowned light column for many years of the British television” was also a “grotesque parody of black people.”
By the introduction of figures, which lampooned and celebrated the British black culture both, Henry in the 80s worked on an alternative Comedykreis.
The front row of Lenny Henry Show went 1984 on transmission, and into the 90s he was among other things as the kitchen boss Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series boss! admits.
Advertisement, documentary films, TV-series and roles coined its next decade, but after its BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 it imagined: “Which you make next, Len, because it feels in such a way everything, as if bring you only the time rum or step a little on the place.”
Afterwards a documentary series came in such a way for radio 4 with the title What's Great About…?
The first consequence turned around Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare was I proper allergically.
I had learned and regarded at school never correctly something over him him predominantly as a domain of the middle class, white one in thights and a cabbage in front in it.
Thus I had large fear before it.
All, which we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said “you should it times try.
Do not make it bad, if you do not know, about which you talk.
Take a few words into the mouth, and then you will understand, why we love all Shakespeare in such a way.
Henry specified 20 lines from Othellos of last speech for the documentary film and it was enthusiastic.
I had the feeling that I could create that.
It was nearly, as if someone would have put the head finally correct to me on.
“Around it, it goes is a serious thing, takes it seriously, learns your text, investigates a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months, before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and the happened simply not.
And soon it arose in the comedy of the erring.
I in the national theatre and I were sudden could it hardly believe.
There there was one moment, when I thought, “Oh, you changed. ""
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctive that he had to maintain the audience.
“A small voice told me “you must now 10 minutes bridge, while they repair the computer. ""
Instead the stage leader announced that the conception would continue, as soon as the problem was solved.
I went from the stage and something in me said “Oh, thank God”.
I am not responsible for it.
I can leave that someone else.
“You plays in a play, therefore remain in your role.”
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
The text for Fences to learn was demanding.
Panic is very good, strengthens the chords.
Also arrived well, it is thus like a large sign of the Gods, me say “that is your regulation here. ""
He says this, naturally, with a THUNDERING voting.
Thus I remain thereby.
I really love that.
I love it to be in a sample area.
Henry has however still the head a comedian - our discussion is from humorous outbreaks pulled through, while it imitates people again and again.
I decided to make no condition UP Comedy because I find that this kind of the immediate satisfaction of a hall of full strangers is somehow dangerous.
If one looks for that all the time, one drives thereby before a wall.
I arise sometimes live in the Apollo, if I have in addition desire, but altogether give not so much it to me like in former times.
I ask it whether he will make ever again a stand-up comedy tour.
That joke, which I have a beginning in an area with a director, who helps thereby, to form a center section and the end of a travel - I do not believe that I would like to ever again give up.
Is that here thus its new incarnation?
I think already.
I am gladly an actor.
It makes joke.
One always tell a story, and that is great.
I love stories.
Humans love stories.
