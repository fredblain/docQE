“Pig house” in Ipswich stands to the sale
The picture of a house standing to the sale was removed from real estate agents, when it became clear that it showed a large pig, which had made itself comfortable in the living room it.
The free standing house had a bedroom, is because of a private road in Ipswich and for 120.000 £ is offered.
To the details an illustration of the living room of the house belonged - to also a pig belonged that on a sofa had bedded its head.
Real estate agent Connells said, the pig in the photo was the domestic animal of the owner.
“The photo was published however erroneously and in the meantime removed” said a spokeswoman of the enterprise.
In the Exposé of the house Connells described the earlier meeting house than a “singular single family house with a bedroom.”
Although the broker removed the picture from the web page, it still appears on advertising material.
The house selling provided in the social media for interest, as if some it asked whether the pig was contained in the purchase price.
