When the 2nd table tennis district class was painted some years ago for rationalisation of the league organization, that was a step into the right direction.
Now the German table tennis federation took an additional 3rd Bundesliga in the program.
The consequence: Who did not ascend, descended.
Thus of Goettingen avoided, plays class-highest team torpedo in first league relegation the descent in the coming season however only fifth-rate ones.
Fourth-rate ones remain torpedoes ladies, despite their magnificent victory into the regional league.
The boys and girls of torpedo start in the Lower Saxony league, just as the boys the sports club of the Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the torpedo reserve begins in the new local league, in which national league are no Göttinger club more represented.
With the ladies the TTV Geismar in the local league plays, torpedo second in the national league.
Which by the composition looks like a better district class, now new highest regional division is south.
Here TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, torpedo III, steps Geismar, installation-hits a corner, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, the FC Weser and that on TTC.
In the district league Dransfeld and the sports club Weende allude, in the district class that TTC II, red Weis, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. the highest regional division of the ladies begin at least in desired strength as regional representatives.
Güntersen, that TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here also from the portion.
In the district league accumulate torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start.
With ever nine crews
The sports club Weende sends its girls into the small district league.
Also the district league relay of the SCW boys - there still torpedo II starts - is not complete.
In a district class Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the again-created region federation the two Göttinger eighth divisions with nine crews each start.
In the west relay red Weis the II, Bovender SV III, leaves oh II, are torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder sports club II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the east relay play among other things Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
Lady eighth division consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
That is still better than in the circle Easter ode, where there are no more lady teams on area level.
Remarkably that none of the six 2.Kreisklassen reaches desired strength, here the innovative and bustling district executive will have itself to make already thoughts.
