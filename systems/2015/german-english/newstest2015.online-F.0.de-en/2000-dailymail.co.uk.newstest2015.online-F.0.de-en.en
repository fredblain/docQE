The hell decade of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years passed since the dreadful siege of the school, like the children involved in it still today suffer.
Before ten years over 1.000 humans of Chechnian militias in a school in Beslan in south Russia as hostages were taken.
More as 330 humans, more than half of it children, were killed in three-day-long martyrdom that the world shocked.
We returned to Beslan, in order to find some the victims, that had escaped death with the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly among them 186 children, the heroical survivors warned one decade after the terrible siege of the school of Beslan, with which 334 humans died, past night before a new Apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatical Islamist terrorists children and parents on 1 September 2004, which beginning of a new school year, imprisoned took and killed, seemed like the worst of the bad one.
The tragedy united west and east in abhorrence, and transformed then surprisingly into action and hope for the future in the middle in the worst misery.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan, in order to find some the victims, that had escaped death with the atrocity in the classroom.
We found surprising young people, who overcame resistances, although the memory of this hell of terror will always pursue them.
Their largest hope?
That the war, which afflicts Ukraine now - and in that children like them die - now an end finds.
The girl, who was photographed with the attempt to back-climb into the shot-up school sports hall
It was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakow and famous, when her only in its underwear tried to back-climb into the shot-up school sports hall after a mine had exploded.
Completely confused Aida looked for Larissa for its mother, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but them survived.
“A woman told me, I was to run around my life, but I could not,” said Aida at that time.
My legs were bathed in blood.
I rose and climbed in, in order to look for my mother.
A soldier brought it in security.
After a set of operations it held itself for completely healed, said however yesterday: “Three months ago the pain returned.
I am afraid that I must be operated again.
Some garnet fragments are still in my knee.
Their goal is it now to become tooth lady doctor in order to help humans, as was helped to her by physicians.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it did not break me, says” it pugnaciously.
“That happened to me, and which one cannot change.
Once in the year I always go into the sports hall, in order to remind me of, which remained there.
My friends and I try not to talk on other days about it.
The pain is too large.
My best friend and future school fellow Dzera Gapoeva were killed there.
We played together, when we were small, and dreamed to go together to the school.
“I do not want to marry, until I terminate my study and begins my career.
Of a family I think later.
She says that the siege will remain always a part by it, although the memory becomes somewhat weaker each year.
I am glad that many humans in the world remember still our frights and we are so gratefully for the assistance, whom we received ago from humans in Great Britain and everywhere.
If I see online the photo of me, how I back-climb into the school, I that many humans see it for the first time, think for understanding and to it contribute our disaster that something like that does not happen again.
The boy, who fled by hail of bullets, in the opinion, its mother is dead
It was its first school day (Russians go with 7 years into the school) and survived the three-day-long siege in the arms of its mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old he said: “Mummy told me, I am to lie down, if there were an explosion, and its hand hold.”
After an explosion thought it, it would die.
She told him: “Run.”
Full fear, it, fled he can be dead and saw on the way a crying infant, seized it at hand and fled by a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who closed its son outside into the arms, said: “Damir told me that its mother had died.
He said: “I could not save it.”
In reality Tamara was tripped after outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, for their part in the acceptance that its son had died.
After its reunification she said: “I cried for joy.
I could not believe it.
He ran and embraced themselves.
Damir was flown later to London (of the newspaper news OF the World dissolved in the meantime), in order to receive from the Prime Minister at that time Tony Blair and his Mrs. Cherie the title of a Barnardo's Children's champion.
“This horror pursues you each day, but I wished, I could stop with reminding,” said he yesterday.
But I can say that it becomes pale in my memory.
I know still that I threw thereafter all my toy pistols away directly.
But I cannot play computer games with firing scenes and that am for me a problem now.
“I do not have a fear to decrease into the sports hall but I do not think about me.
I remember these children, with whom I played in the yard, and who did not create it after outside.
We never say that they were killed or are dead.
We say that they remained in the sports hall.
I remember very well my travel to London, particularly the toys shop, where I could select myself everything, which I wanted, and which trip in an open above car.
But now it has fear around place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of accident, which it and its friends suffered.
This horror pursues you each day, but I wished, I could stop to remind me of it.
“It does in such a way suffering to me around all those, which suffer from the atrocities,” said Damir, which worked past week as a volunteer in a monastery.
I want to help so gladly.
I want to go one day to the police and hope that they take me next year at the training academy.
Its mother Tamara, 48, said: “37 children from our neighbourhood were killed, can imagine you that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, it gave simply no children, who could call and run around, and this silence persisted many months.
It remembers lively its travel to London with Damir.
Humans in London cried, when I tell our story.
I understood at that time, how humans on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, and shows their support.
It was grateful to Cherie Blair and its foundation for the price and the possibility of traveling in the autumn 2004 to London.
I wished, I could Cherie call and to her simply say that 10 years passed, but I the meeting me it and their man in London to still remember, and how the Damir helped and me.
I remember still, how Damir wanted to eat gladly borshch and they called all local Russian restaurants.
I remember, how he played with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot with its water pistol at it and it ran away and played with it.
And that was only one month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British divided so readily our pain and supported us.
She said: “I always think that this world did not become better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war continues now, and each day die humans, and I believe the fact that many children were killed and still is killed.
Those are exactly such children like ours.
I think that for many the war is a part of the news, which hears it, if they are busy with something different one bored or.
I know simply, what these humans feel, the whole horror.
And I cannot stop with feeling.
Nothing changed, humans wants still mutually to kill itself and that is so sad.
Damir became large and is a very gentle and calm boy, it is aggressive or furious not at all.
It does not look for example for revenge, it is not overwhelmed from the past atrocities.
I know that he does not remember gladly, but he has six close friends out of the class and her to go occasionally into the sports hall and ignite there candles.
When it was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember, as he on the sofa put sometimes, the face turned away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, its eyes were open.
I remember also still, how he threw all his weapons and other military toys away. Damir is now 17, more largely than I, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I unite hours was long so safe that it is dead and I would never see him again.
When I came myself to the explosion recovered and on the legs, I looked around, and saw hell around me, with parts of the body lying about everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my small boy in this hell could not possibly have survived.
“I remember that I shouted him, “Damir, run, run away”, but I was also so sure that he had not heard me.
But it heard it and ran away it.
And in such a way the life, differently than many different, continues for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy, whose terrible picture became after the siege the symbol of the atrocities from Beslan
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with its mother Fatima after the siege 2004, on the right of a picture of Georgij today
Its blutüberströmtes face was drawn of fear, when it ran around its life, while Chechnian terrorists shot his school fellows down.
Its picture was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarism of Beslan.
Its mother Fatima, 54, a lady doctor, had set him off for his first school day, before she rushed loosely, in order to bring her older son Vladimir to the university.
“I left the yard about two minutes, before the terrorists him stormed, and so remained my small boy there for three terrible days alone,” remember her.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were killed all.
Only my Georgij created it to survive.
The more near this date moves, the more heavily is it to remember and of it talk.
There is not one day, on which we do not remember this tragedy.
We do not think that it for a long time ago is, I mean, some scenes would have happened from these days yesterday pursue me all the time.
Nobody is forgotten ever, promises I to you.
Urgently: The picture of Georgij (left) was one the most shocking attack and as Statue (right) was perpetuated.
I remember that Georgij wanted to go on this day so gladly to the school. He said, he wanted to embrace its teacher.
I knew only that he alive was, when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this Statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not see the picture gladly, and it is at home in the bookshelf hidden with us.
I understand that, but I mean also that humans in all world feel our pain owing to this picture.
Georgij says today: “It is important, which can never happen something like that again.
“I doubt that we ever experience the truth.
Humans examine such tragedies again and again and never experience the truth.
And now they examine the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Are we ever experienced, what caused it?
This world becomes something terrible one.
“I cannot understand, how that is possible, because if you ask humans, nobody wants a war, thus as happens that?
Ten years are not nothing at all with such pain.
We need dozens of years, in order to forget it a small little.
It attacked my health and feels I it still.
About three or four years long I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it became better.
I went later in the year 2004 again to the school and had each day fear.
I thought of my friends and school fellows, who had been killed.
Therefore I always go into the sports hall, if 1 September more near moves.
I want to mean to mean old childhood friends tribute to tribute.
It is heavy for me to go into the sports hall but I must do it.
I do not feel as a victim, this history am now a part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I do not pity myself.
My life continues.
I concluded and visit this year the school a medical university in Wladikawkaz.
I will become a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health did not permit that.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy, who survived, although he was imprisoned to feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was imprisoned during the siege to feet of a murderous terrorist, but he created it to survive.
During the siege it was in the sports hall and sat beside the bomb, which was fastened to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is really a miracle that it was not killed.
“We feel it, as if it would have been yesterday,” say Georgij, which wanted to go as a secret service officer to FSB, but this because of its health damage due to the siege not to do could.
It is not still with me, it is anything that I left behind me.
I am now older and humans say that children can deal easily with bad experiences - I do not have to say, vote.
“2006 I worked with psychologists and felt for it actually somewhat better, but I cannot forget it.
And I was gladly forgotten.
2005 - in the year after - was the first and only mark that I went again into the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will return never again there and not ask you me ask not to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of itself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is tremendous and I carries it each day with me.
My friends know the fact that I do not remember gladly or about it speaks and asked it me never for the school.
Physically am I well.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can now run well.
But because of my health I could not study at the secret service academy of FSB in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted.
I returned my documents, also the medical and answered her that it is not possible.
My second passion were the animals, therefore I went to veterinary Institut.
I have there already two years behind me.
He learns the treatment of all animals “from cats to cows”.
He said: “I knew that I would never report to my children of my experiences.
About it children should not know anything and them should it naturally also suffer.
Its mother Marina, 42, said: “This pain never leaves me.
It is worse in my soul, if the anniversary moves more near.
I will go to the ceremonies to the memory.
I know that Georgij will not go.
It must be still many more violent for it, because he was not and I there.
I waited at home for him and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan all of it are drawn.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is heavy to accept if somewhat so unfair happens.
He is a boy, he likes sport, but he cannot participate because of its knee.
It was operated several times, it can run, but drive no sport.
I would say that he overcame the horror 50%, but one can never overcome and forget that completely.
This terrible experience will always pursue us.
Many friends and neighbour were killed with the siege and to strengthened only mean the pain.
I lost many humans, whom I could do well and who me were expensive.
My son is with me, and that is the largest gift that God could make for me, but my heart cries around the killing.
I know from families, in which new children were born, in addition, from widows, who never married again.
It is difficult to accept that the life continues, even if one does not want that.
I am never forgotten, how my heart jumped in me, when I saw it in the hospital.
And now I see, what proceeds in the world - wars in other regions.
For what do these humans fight?
Why do they kill themselves mutually?
The war is our country now much and I can that nearly not believe.
We were in former times a friendly country, how it can be that we fight now?
Humans and children suffer, I am sure that in Ukraine many children were already killed and still many are killed.
If we only all these rebels to seize and eject could - as far away as only possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby, who was carried so moving by a special employment command in security
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is brought by a Russian special employment command in security (left).
Them are now ten (right) and remember not at all cruelties
Die Welt stopped 2004 the breath, when the baby Aljona in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege was carried of Beslan.
The terrorists let it go, but held back in their cruelty her 30-year old mother, the 10-year old sister Kristina and its brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, at that time three years old, escaped, but Aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous massacre.
Its father Ruslan married since then again and has with his new Mrs. Swetlana a little girl that he called Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, today ten years old, remembers the siege and is not grown up to an intelligent and happy girl, says neighbours.
“You are a large happy family and Aljona and a Makhar are both now great children,” say a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants them all the memories to save, which approach with the tenth anniversary.
They will understand, why.
