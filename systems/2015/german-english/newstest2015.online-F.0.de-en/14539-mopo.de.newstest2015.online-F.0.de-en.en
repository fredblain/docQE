Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At new countries the place are accommodated now refugees in tents.
The center Erstaufnahme for refugees in Harburg bursts from all seams.
Now the authority for domestic affairs let three tents of the red cross set up beside it.
The district politicians were only a short while before informed - they are few enthusiastically.
“These striking jerk actions stir far reservations of the citizens and give to the district politicians no possibility, constructionally in the human accommodation of refugees of participating”, say for instance Britta Herrmann, Fraktionsvorsitzende up of the Greens in the Harburger district meeting.
Their party demands that the district administration Harburg places unused houses at present to the accommodation to the order.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for the overstocking in the Erstaufnahme are the attack of person seeking helps - and the circumstance that the authorities cannot make sufficient places available in ancillary facilities.
Many refugees remain longer from there than the regular three months.
