Israeli children return to the war to Gaza to their schools
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas in the proximity of the Gaza Strip returned on Monday to the schools, after they had spent the summer in air shelter, while rocket and mortar fire came down on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and the Hamas and remained closed the schools in Gaza, while the area recovered from the fights.
The school start brought in the south of Israel a feeling of joy and expectation to the communities drawn by rocket bullet holes, but the indications of the fights are still fresh.
In the southern city Ashdod removed employees of the “Pashosh” - kindergarten, which was met by a rocket, before the arrival of the pupils garnet fragments from the walls and sliding panels.
“We have a little fear, but are excited,” said Ronit Bart, Anwohnerin in the Kibbutz Saad and English teacher there.
Many children from our area need urgently the return to a routine.
Her 11-year old daughter Shani Bart said, it feels “a little strangely” to go suddenly again into the school.
“That were difficult times, and we did not go at all out of the house,” told them.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz the close border to Gaza, in order to offer its support.
Until an armistice interrupted the war last week remained thousands of inhabitants of the border communities such as Saad in its houses or their houses left, in order to pull and the rocket and mortar fire escape into safer areas further remotely from Gaza to.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a community in the proximity of the border to Gaza, in which a 4-year old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar, still hesitate with the return.
The Ministry of Education communicated, about a dozen to families yet did not return.
Their children were accommodated provisionally in other schools.
Prime minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town to Gaza, which is heavily drawn by the Palestinian bombardment.
It appealed to the children to learn much and said “we will ensure that their knowledge acquire and offers you security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on past Tuesday on a unbefristeteten armistice.
The cessation of hostilities provided for an immediate end of the fights; important problems remain however unresolved, like the demand of the Hamas after an abolition of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade by Gaza and the reopening of air and seas port in Gaza.
Israel demands a disarmament of the Hamas and the delivery of the corpses of two Israeli soldiers killed with the fights.
A new round of indirect discussions will begin presumably still in this month in Egypt.
In the war more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of it civilians, and at least 494 children according to estimations of the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies these information and estimates that it concerns with at least half of the killing fighters, submitted however no concrete proofs for these information.
On Israeli side 66 soldiers and six civilians, under it a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortars during the fights on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile the Israeli military accomplished more than 5,000 air and different attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area and about 250,000 humans searched in more than 100 UN-schools refuge, which were converted into provisional shelter.
While tens of thousands of humans live further in the shelter and the fights persist, the education authorities shifted past week the beginning of the school year.
“I hope, the school am soon again opened, so that we can learn further, as the children in the world and the Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year old boy, who lives at present in a school in Gaza city.
