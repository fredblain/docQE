Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobsons's high-praised new novel over love and the letter “J”.
They dissolved, then one could describe it best, her dissolved slowly like a cardboard, one let which be located in the rain.
Occasionally a Mrs., he told him was too seriously, arduously, intensively, reserved and perhaps somewhat kratzbürstig.
And then the hand shook to it.
It knew Kratzbürstig.
It was prickly, as in hedgehogs, yes.
The last victim of these pricklyness was a straight affair beginning, which had been more promising for an alleviation of the lonely boredom of its life than otherwise, and him perhaps even a certain satisfaction would have brought.
Ailinn Solomons was trembling a tender beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the north island, which was even still been a long way and rougher than haven Reuben.
She had come with an older company to the south, which regarded Kevern as its aunt, and whom a property in a damp however paradisiacal valley with the appropriate name Paradise Valley had inherited.
Over several years nobody had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaking, in the baths were still spiders, naked snails their traces on all windows had left and believed, that belonged to them everything, and the garden was with weeds to over-grow, which looked like enormous cabbages.
It was both threatening and enticing like the house from a child fairy tale, a garden of full secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel “J” stands on the Longlist for which one Booker Preis 2014.
The shortlist is announced in the coming week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn little hand-holding on the broken beach chairs in the high grass and an unusually warm spring afternoon had enjoyed. Both had latched themselves spirit-absent into the service console, which supplied the country with reassuring music and calming news, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song one for a long time forgotten black entertainer, to which its father had listened gladly with closed roll shops in the house.
Your feet are too large.
Due to their very own aggressiveness song of this kind no more were not played on the console.
Did not forbid - nothing was so correctly forbidden - simply not played.
It successfully obsolesziert, as the word obsoleszieren.
The general taste created, which decrees and regulations would have never created, and how the people select of the Tellerwäscher to millionaire memoirs, cook books and love novels with books, then they selected the ballads with the music.
In the euphoria of the day Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and to sing about in a roughfunny serenade Ailinns large feet.
Ailinn did not understand that.
“That was a well-known song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller,” explained it and put automatically two fingers to its lips.
That had always done its father, in order to stop the letter J, before he came from his mouth.
It had begun as a play between it and its father, when it was still small.
Its father had played it with his own father, then he had told.
If you begin a word with a J, without putting two fingers over your lips, it costs a penny you.
It had been no very hilarious play already at that time, and it was not still very hilariously.
He knew, that was expected this by him, that was everything.
It had to explain, what jazz was.
Ailinn had not heard ever which.
Jazz was not played, even if it were not directly forbidden.
Improvising was not modern any longer.
It was only place for only one “if” in the life.
Humans wanted to be completely safe at the beginning of a melody, where them would end.
Likewise the understanding.
Its unpredictability made humans nervous.
And jazz was in music expressed understanding.
Although it had become 10 years old, without of Sammy Davis Junior to have heard, Kevern knew somewhat about jazz of the half secret collection of old CDs of its father.
But at least it did not have to explain Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At its age it could not remember probably to a time, in which pop singers were not black.
Again was valid, no laws or obligations.
A conformal society meant the fact that each element of this society agreed gratefully the principle of the group gift - gratefully as of the fate spared.
Humans with afro Caribbean origin were suitable by temperament and figure for entertainment and sport, therefore and ran they sang.
Humans, who originally came from the Indian subcontinent, were blessed as of nature with electronic talent and were cared for with the task to guarantee that no family without functioning service telephone remained.
Which still from the Polish community was remaining, worried about drains; which from the Greeks was remaining, plate smashed.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante, whose grandparents had not left the country fast as WHICH HAPPENINGS WERE, IF IT WERE HAPPENING event from fear of fire stirring to be accused from fear even that the flames would consume them next had opened - Labneh and Shisha whistle restaurants, held themselves consider and became depressive with the inactivity.
Everyone after its abilities.
Since it only ballads heard had, to understand fell it Ailinn heavily, how insulting words, which had sung Kevern it straight, set to music per become could.
Music was expression of love.
“Are not really insulting those,” said Kevern.
Except perhaps for humans, whose feet are too large.
My father never insulted someone, but he loved this song.
It talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceitful feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound absorption of the enormous Kohl-like sheets.
Ailinn did not understand yet.
Why would your father have something so dear should?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, hesitated however, to put in their present again two fingers to the lips.
It thought anyway already that he was somewhat strange.
“It appeared to it hilariously,” said it instead.
It shook disbelievingly its head and blocked Keverns view.
There was nothing else to see around the world, as its ungekämmtes jet-black hair.
There was nothing that he would have wanted to see otherwise.
“If you it say,” my her without conviction.
But it does not explain yet why you sing it to me.
It seemed honestly anxious.
Are my feet too large?
He looked again.
Your feet so directly not.
Perhaps your ankles, a small little…
And you say, you hate me, because my ankles are too thick?
You hate?
Naturally I do not hate you.
That is nevertheless only the stupid song.
He could have said “I loves you”, but it was still too early.
“Your thick ankles are exactly the reason, why you please me,” he tried it instead.
I am there a little perverted.
That did not sound correctly.
It should have been funny.
If it tried to be funny he brought himself often in trouble, because he did not have like its father the reassuring Charm, which one needed, in order cruelty inherent in jokes to bezähmen.
Perhaps father wanted to be to be also cruel.
Perhaps it, Kevern, wanted to be.
Despite its friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose from its beach chair, upset the console and buried the wine, which they had drunk.
Elder bloom wine, therefore was not drunkenness an apology for it.
In its excitation it seemed to tremble, like palm fronds in the storm.
“And your thick head is exactly the reason, why I feel perverted to you moved,” she said…
Except that I am that not at all.
She did suffering, both because of the unnecessary unkindliness of its words as well as the fear, to him who showed up in their eyes, when them revolted themselves against him.
Did it think that he would strike her?
It had not told it of the life on the cold northern archipelago, where she had grown up, but he did not have doubts that it was essentially like that like here.
The same enormous and ice-cold ocean broke here as there on the bank.
The same confused men, with still thicker skin and more morosely after the WHICH HAPPENING WAS than it their ancestors than smugglers and beach robber had been, pulled from tavern to tavern, always ready, the hand against a woman to raise, those them refused myself or derided.
Thick head?
Those would have shown it a thick fist, if them did not watch out!
They only smooch - smooching was the most frequently used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the insignificant love ballads from the console - it only smooch and then strike.
After Keverns opinion was an unnecessary refinement, since smooching already represented an act of the force.
Ailinn Solomons gave to go to it through its body an indication.
He rose from the beach chair like an old man.
It felt likewise leaden, but the force of its mourning surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They nevertheless hardly knew each other.
It watched it, as it departed - as of a room in the upper stick her companion it thereby watched - a man, weighted by somewhat, which he had caused.
Adam leaves the garden, thought her.
It felt a sudden pain for it and men generally, although some their hands had raised against her.
A man turned away from it, its back bent, ashamedly, defeated, without fighting spirit - why that was a sight, which she seemed to know well, if she could not remember nevertheless only once, at which her something like that the today's day ago had already seen?
When it again alone was, Ailinn Solomons looked on its feet.
Some years before straight told occurrences worked Esme Nussbaum, intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, which non-legislative monitoring device for the public tendency, at a short lecture on the continued force on low and middle level in exactly the regions, in which their decrease, if, earliest are had to be expected not abolishment, considering the funds and energy, which had been invested into the extermination of this force.
“It was done already much, and much,” wrote it must be still done to appease “around the innate aggressiveness of a people who led thousand wars and won most of it, in particular in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human friendliness was felt rarely historically seen despite the high-rising steeples between the hedges.
But some characteristics turn out as ineradicable.
The more highly the steeple, then seems it, the smaller the passion, which it wakes further.
The population cries when hearing sentimental ballads, inebriates themselves at stories over overcome difficulties and states to believe firmly in the virtues from marriage and family circle to but nevertheless only the earlier rawness does not keep the rural communities firm just like our urban structures in the hand, but there are also proofs for developing a new and perfidious contentiousness at home, on the job, on the roads and even on the playing fields.
“You have a unfortunate tendency for exaggeration,” meant their mentor, when it had read the whole report.
I suggest that you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I must also ask: are you atheist?
“I believe, which I do not have to say,” answered to Esme Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Again Esme referred to its right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
Again silence.
“I do not ask that,” said Luther Rabinowitz finally, “because I against atheism, Lesbentum or feminism would be.
That is an impartial job here.
We serve an impartial society.
But certain kinds of hypersensitivity, which are actually absolutely acceptable and praise worth, can distort occasionally results, as you presented it.
They have obviously prejudices against the church, and these things, which call you “perfidiously” and “roughly”, could be naturally interpreted of others just as well than expression of one strength and vitality.
If one continues to harp on on, WHICH HAPPENING IS, IF IT IS HAPPENING, as if it, if it had happened, would have happened yesterday, meant, to take to the country its substantial vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around, while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind its head a LED signature in flamingo-pink repeated the pieces of advice, which Ofnow had longer given to the country in the last quarter century or.
If you smile at their neighbour, esteem their partner, hear you ballads, visit you musical, use you their telephone, speak you, explain you, listen you, agree you, apologize you.
Speak is better as silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
“I understand absolutely, on which you want outside,” answered Esme Nussbaum with calm voting, when she was safe that its superior had in the end spoken, “and I said nothing else, that we did not heal yet so effectively, as we fool ourselves.
My concern lies in the fact that we regain us without preliminary warning possibly thereby as we repeat the errors, which ARE in the first place to the WHICH HAPPENING, IF IT IS HAPPENING led.
This time there is however not the others, at which we vent our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with the hands.
In order to suggest thereby a patience of a saint.
“You go too far,” said it, “if you to actions as “errors” to designate, which committed our grandparents perhaps or also not.
They go also too far, if you speak of the fact that these would have vented their “anger” and it “distrust” at “others”.
It should not be necessary actually to remind someone in your position of the fact that we with the understanding of the past as with the protection of the present, not of “us” and “others” to speak.
There was none “we” and it gave no “different”.
It was a time of the disorder, which is everything that we know.
“Of that, if we are honest to us, dared” Esme to throw in, “no part of the society to state can well to have behaved.
I do not complain anybody on.
Whether it was done badly or well, what happened, is happened.
That was at that time.
In addition nothing more must be said - there are we us united.
And exactly like no debt to be assigned must, then also no debt must be erased, if such a repayment were appropriate and if there were a way to erase it.
But for which the past serves, if we do not learn from it -
The past serves for the fact that we forget it.
If I may say to it something -
Luther Rabinowitz let his pyramid collapse.
“I will consider,” said and dismissed its report he her.
On the next day, when she went as used to the work, it was run over by a motorcyclist, who, as passerbies described, had driven brutal rage” in a kind to “on the footpath.
There are coincidences.
