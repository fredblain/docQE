Production in the euro zone on a 13-Monats-Tief
The rise with production in the euro zone slowed down in August on the lowest point of the last 13 months, so an exactly observed study also.
The final Markit purchase manager index of the producing trade (PMI) fell in August on 50,7 in, after conditions of 51,8 in July.
An information concerning 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders decreased and factories experienced break-downs in a time of rising tensions between the European Union and Russia over Ukraine.
The numbers arrive before the meeting of the European central bank (EZB) on Thursday.
The markets expect a clear plan for handling a hesitating recovery of the euro zone as well as for the threatening deflation from the bank with an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
It adds to speculations that the director/conductor of the EZB, could make Mario Draghi, in the process of this week more further details, whether it considers a quantitative relief for the euro zone, according to that, which was made by Great Britain and the USA during the financial crisis.
“Although a small growth is better than no growth, is the braking effects of the increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties for the manufacturers become,” said more clearly Rob Dobson, leading economist with Markit.
Factory PMI for Germany, the largest trade partner of Russia in the European Union, fell on the lowest level in 11 months with 51,4.
In the meantime France, PMI fell on 46,9 in the second largest economic nation of the block.
France remains a problem child, like also the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to the stagnation.
Referring to it that incentives for growth do not reach in the key industry mechanism Germany as well as into Spain and the Netherlands any longer, are likewise not reassuring,” said Mr. Dobson.
The decrease of the industry probably stirs the fire up of the analysts, which expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI rose to 57,3, the highest level since at the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chefwirtschaftsexperte with IHS Global Insight, said: “The best, which one can say for the purchase manager index of the producing trade in the euro zone from August, is that thereafter the sector grows further.”
It added: “Producers in the euro zone find the life at present obviously quite with difficulty, there the current increased geopolitical tensions - particularly regarding Russia and Ukraine - to uncertainties in the further difficult conditions in many countries increase.
These increased uncertainties impaired completely clearly the economy - in particular, and probably lead the confidence of the consumers, and to it that some orders are delayed or even cancellation, in particular large orders.
He said that it becomes “ever more probable” that the EZB must finally introduce a kind of the QE, “although we assumes that this will be limited.”
