Csm A.D. Berni Diether works since the locking of the former troop exercise area as a ammunition technician
For scarcely ten years on the former troop exercise area in Münsingen is not no more shot.
Nevertheless still each month deadly ammunition in the heart of the biosphere area Swabian Alb emerges.
The shells are sometimes still so dangerous that they must be blown up locally.
A deafening bang resounds with the breakups over the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004 the last sharp shot fell on the troop exercise area Münsingen, at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military enterprise was closed.
Since this time that is 6500 hectares large area the core of the biosphere area Swabian Alb, which is opened on 13 proven ways for ramblers and cyclists.
