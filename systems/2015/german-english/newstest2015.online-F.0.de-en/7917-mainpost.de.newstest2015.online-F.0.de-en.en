Under this treetop prevails rest
We showed a powerful trunk with our task of mystery of the summer series “my piece of the Rhöner luck” on past Friday.
Several of these tree giants there are still in the district, the shown copy is the “Geißruheiche” above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to that approximately 600 years old oak.
It goes past at ouples, basalt cairns and basalt stone seas.
A bit underneath the quarry north of the farmer mountain, a kilometer the road after instruction brook, there stands it.
The natural monument looks vital, it exceeds over the other trees of the environment and reminds with an extent from over eight meters to an American sequoia.
A small Buddha on a stump points to the fact that it concerns a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive searches there was only referring to the name origin.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted specially the Bischofsheimer archives and asked in order to experienced older people from Unterweißenbrunn, which Bewandtnis has it with the Geißruheiche.
The result of its investigations remained the quite sober explanation for the name.
Therefore the goat shepherds their animals from Unterweißenbrunn are to have toilsomely stubbed on those and to have driven from stones released meadows to forwards about 80 years.
At the foot of the tree the animal guardians exhausted by the ascent are to have rested themselves.
In the meantime the range won its meaning back, because on the meadows actually again herds of goat feast.
In addition the range was explained as the core zone of biosphere reserve, cutters continued to find out.
When entering the accumulations of stone one should let caution reign however, because of the sun warmed up basalt is also for cross otters a popular place of residence.
A trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is appropriate however for something hidden.
Further ways are signposted, the direction Hochrhön climb and to an expanded migration invite.
Where does those stand for castle surrounded by moats?
Castle surrounded by moats, which is looked for with our next task, are to be found rather rare however in the height.
The reflection in the ditch already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district, to which building-counter-protect fit could.
