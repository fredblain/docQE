On the hopping castle with the castle garden festival some was the matter on Saturday.
The concept of the organizers was correct.
Despite the strong downpour on Saturday evening came roughly 1200 of music fan to the open air celebration in the castle garden.
Occasionally had admit to be stopped.
“That was annoying”, said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l light and joke.
From two Spanish words Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the open air in the Salzwedeler castle garden is to radiate brightness on the day and in the evening by various shows.
Well, and joke comes anyway from alone.
That showed up already in early Saturday, when the first visitors opened themselves to the open air.
The organizers had promised a celebration for all generations.
And that succeeded to them.
Approximately around the supply conditions on the castle garden meadow Salzwedeler, in addition, guests from the closer and further environment had made themselves it cosy.
They pursued the first live appearances, whipped with the foot in the beat, enjoyed cool beverages - short: Relaxation purely and benefit were announced.
And straight through the generations.
While the one on covers on the extra angekarrten white sand at the beach bar lolled themselves, others at a quarter wine in the Vinothek refreshed themselves, raved the new generation on the hopping castle, which was a large point of attraction for the smaller guests.
In addition, with child make-ups had the voluntary aides in the true sense of the word all hands fully to do, in order to become the crush gentleman and do magic fantasyful creations into the small faces.
The larger ones used the kicker tables or took part in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel aligned.
Until the large rain came.
Shortly before 17.30 o'clock it pelted down on the visitors, above all families looked for that width and dry one.
But did to the attractiveness of the celebration this no abort.
“Came more humans than expected”, said Ron Sem, which spoke of a “success on the whole line”.
Therefore oppose a repetition of the large party in the coming year nothing.
Although on contents and size of the event must be still worked, Sem in a first balance made clear on Sunday in relation to the voice of the people.
As annoying designated it that in the meantime admit to be stopped had.
Obviously the security company had been booked also too few forces.
The consequence: Some, which had already paid, did not come any longer on the area.
The resonance was very good.
In a first careful estimation the Salzwedeler Mitorganisator spoke of approximately 1200 visitors, who cavorted in the castle garden.
There were problems with the audio engineering.
The Salzwedeler hip hop volume of block ` n ` Rox fallow their appearance therefore weakens off.
The technicians were not able to create a halfway reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha Lounges could not be developed, because the tents could not be brought because of a flat tyre to Salzwedel.
“In the next year they will be however thereby”, so the organizer.
The premiere the Amula open airs from the numbers of visitors had more than succeeded.
And in bad weather.
However the organizers committed some errors, which are still forgiven with the first time, but with the second edition to be eliminated to have.
Also in the social network Facebook must put the organizers in criticism.
“Sorry, but for twelve euros one expected, expresses themselves simply more” Melanie Meier on the event side.
“Took over, means you you unfortunately a little” Ele Carpenter in same place.
Others do not see the initial problems completely so closely.
I find it very good that some do not only chat stupidly, but also really tries something on the legs to place.
Hat off! ”, Stephanie Jenß writes to the Amula.
Now one year remains for the organizers time, in order to turn these points of criticism off.
