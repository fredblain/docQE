Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort, a whose character changes things, even in a as gigantic organization as NHS.
As an advisory anaesthesia physician he dedicated his career to the task to save to the patients both the death throes of the illness as well as the agonies of the treatment.
Among his patients, then its wife remembers, was a MI6-Mitarbeiter, which had to live with the devastating effects of tortures.
Lawson knew that the diagnoses and diseases are important to the physicians, while the treated ones are busy with somewhat completely different one predominantly: Pain.
One day in the year 2007 it was however that, whose suffering way began.
“I did not feel,” wrote he in the May of this year.
I had difficulties to gather up me.
While it fought with the flu-similar symptoms, he noticed that he made impatiently reproaches for his Mrs. Juliet.
“I want all dearer immediately than later”, noted he.
When Juliet was, felt for one week on a business trip Lawson unusual-proves completely and without reason concerned.
Was appropriate for something in air.
It asked a colleague to make an x-ray examination of its chest.
Only two weeks ago it in the French alps to the skiing had been.
The result of the x-ray examination was present.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer, which attacks the chest skin, thus the lungs covering skin.
As is the case for most cancer conditions is difficult the exact trigger usually to determine.
While for example some smokers at cancer of the lungs get sick, not all cancer of the lungs-gotten sick were early smoker.
But mesothelioma is different.
In nearly all cases the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which was considered once as “miracle material” however in the meantime as deadly was recognized.
For most of us mesothelioma is an illness, which can to be easily ignored as.
Asbestos is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos was not no more used in Great Britain since the 1960er years, than itself the industry obligated voluntarily not to use this no more.
Also, where it was still used, only humans in certain industries worked directly with the material - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and throwing workers for example.
As an industrial dangerous material from another time it seems to be still causing concern today hardly.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Great Britain, then seems it, deeply felt today the high point of an Mesoltheliom epidemic.
It gives more deaths by mesothelioma here than in every other country in the world.
With altogether 2,500 deaths per year twice as many humans at this illness die as with traffic accidents.
Annual numbers of the mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and prospective future deaths in Great Britain
The reason, why we experience the deadly effects now, although asbestos is illegal for years (1999 all asbestos types forbidden), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the scourge the mesothelioma is not limited on former workers the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is frequently still, in the houses present, in which we live, which offices, in which we work, the schools, in which we learn and which business, in which we buy.
And from there mesothelioma does not know class barriers, financial borders, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, of the elegant department stores in London up to private schools, are not a shelter.
The parliament building are asbestos-contaminated.
Also in the hospitals, in which we are nevertheless healthy to become to be supposed, already as an output herd of this deadly carcinogenic agent constituted.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was also no plumber.
It fell it indeed heavily to introduce itself where he could possibly have come with asbestos into contact.
Then it found it out.
“It looks in such a way, as if in the tunnels at the Guy's hospital, where I completed six years long my training, was present a quantity asbestos.” it wrote.
All - students, nurses, physicians and doormen - use the tunnels.
One asks oneself, how many become my contemporaries at the same illness suffering?
It could unfortunately at least partly answer this question.
“Of the four physicians, who were trained at the Guy's hospital, and who got sick in the last five years at mesothelioma”, wrote he to 2010 in a letter, “are I the latter, still live.”
How will many of us still get sick?
With Andrew Lawson mesothelioma at the age was diagnosed by 48 years.
When it died on 17 February of this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma-gotten sick die within 8 months after the diagnosis.
The illness ends always mortally.
We can repeat from there only Lawsons question: “Will still get sick like many of us?”
The prominent expert of Great Britain to mesothelioma, professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic will presumably come into Great Britain to succumbing altogether to the victim it will be pleased to 90,000 of the illness.
Most of it have for the moment still no idea that they will die in such a way.

A short view of the documents of the courts, to which the concerning turn frequently because of demands for payment of damages, shows, how far the scourge of the mesothelioma is already common.
In June this Marks & Spencer added for example, Janice Allen to year negligent-proves asbestos to have suspended.
She worked nine years long for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible over the clothe department on two locations - one of it the Flagshipstore in the Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years as, when it began her activity with M&S.
Now it has two children in the 20s.
“Before this thing,” it says, “I ever of mesothelioma had heard, I not yet times really did not know something about asbestos.
I would have never thought that would concern me times.
There are only few humans, who know much about asbestos.
Fact is that the term asbestos refers not a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name is due to the word “Asbestiform”, a description of the fibrous structure, which makes the material resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction industry.
Chrysotil, also as white asbestos admits, is today by far most frequently found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof slabs, floor panels, Rohrisolationen, storage water heater isolations, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less mortally as other asbestos forms, of the European Union and the WTO as “large health risk” with possible resulting in death is however nevertheless viewed.
More dangerous are however the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Great Britain was once the world largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts assume that “there are clear, however indirect notes for it that this was a principal reason for the singularly high mesothelioma rates.”
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to London, asbestos in the Flagshipstore in the Oxford Street, Alamy
Janice Allen did not see herself perhaps as a typical mesothelioma victim, but it points the work of Julian Peto to the fact that her history is not under any circumstances unusual.
It submitted a study of the concerning, in which it is represented that “a substantial portion of the mesotheliomas without well-known suspension was probably caused by work or in the house by asbestos contact in the environment.”
A majority of these contacts is based to its statement after on the “normal use and aging” of our buildings.
It looks in such a way, as if nobody can assume that to be safe.
A report of Goddard consulting, which examined the palace of Westminster, shows, how humans could have been suspended also in the heart of the government, unknowingly the material.
2009 reported Goddard that the service pits and pipings behind the committee areas of the parliament with asbestos were contaminated, whose deadly fibers could be whirled up by somewhat as harmless as “strong air movements”.
Members of parliament are frequently accused of to worry about their own interests but it looks in such a way here, as if the opposite would apply.
While the management of the parliamentary one insisted labor service on the fact that the Westminsterpalast a “clean health certificate” had received, is it in the meantime undisputed that 1 billion £ effort over several years be brought up must, in order the parliament to recondition, the electricity installations to modernize and the asbestos remove, and that after the general elections 2015 the delegates will meet probably rather in the nearby QE2-Konferenzzentrum as in the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report pointed out also that “the presence was not handled by asbestos according to the respective regulations.”
Nobody can know whether this Miss management will cost lives.
Everything that one can do now, is waits.
A person, those the contact with asbestos exactly to never determine could is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
Like Andrew Lawson the 50-year old Abbott assumes that it was exposed to the asbestos during its work in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital, in which asbestos complaints were decided positively”, say he, “however I can it in my case not prove.
It is so difficult to remember all places on which one worked, and the data.
That it is still exactly reminded the day at the beginning of December 2009, on which he got so a kind fever.
It was 45, and accomplished straight late in the evening an operation.
Suddenly I had vibration frost.
It came completely suddenly.
I felt terribly.
I believed not to create the trip home any longer.
When physician knew Abbott that the pain was due to the skin to the chest skin, around its lungs.
But like Janice Allen it did not have a reason to assume a mesothelioma.
It did not go one month to work.
Surprised physicians made radiographs of his chest and set Pleurakathether, in order to take and test in the laboratory liquid out of the lungs.
Its complaints remained however without diagnosis.
Its health improved slowly, and it returned to its job.
Occasionally the symptoms returned however, frequently to sporty manipulation and violent breathing.
2011 came a patient Abbotts with similar symptoms in its practice and with mesothelioma were later made a diagnosis.
In addition, now did not connect Abbott this with his own case.
Finally its patient was older some decades and directly with asbestos had worked.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011 Abbotts condition worsened again and its family doctor brought its CT-scans and radiographs to a team of experts.
In December 2011, accurately two years after Abbott for the first time suffer yourself had felt, became a probe equipped with a camera into the cave between the rib and the chest skin inserted.
I am an optimist.
I continue mostly simply,” say he.
Honestly said, I had worried not at all so many.
But Rachel, my wife, was anxious.
The result of the Biopsie was present in the week between Christmas and New Year: “One told me that it was mesothelioma.”
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott had dates with Macmillan nurses, of whom one recommended to him to take itself a lawyer.
He understood the extent of the epidemic only now.
“It turned out that asbestos was very far common, particularly in large public buildings, in which pipes were insulating with asbestos often,” says it.
Humans, who were exposed to the asbestos in these buildings, get sick now.
And in such a way mesothelioma meets now younger people, who did not work in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos isolations in hospitals lay underground, therefore patients were probably rather not exposed to the material.
But many employees, who changed in pedestrian tunnels of a building in the other one (how Andrew Lawson) or in underground cafeterias ate (like it Graham Abbott often did), came with largest probability into contact with the poisonous substances.
It is shown that over several decades after the war hospitals for the patients were possibly life-saving, but life-threateningly for the treating physicians.
It is also still today removed.
Pupils turned their Bunsen burners off to asbestos mats.
And it does not only concern hospitals.
Asbestos was used due to its marvelous isolating and flame retarding characteristics frequently in offices, business, libraries and town halls.
Also schools.
Actually many humans probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, pupils turned off their Bunsen burners to asbestos mats.
To web pages the topic asbestos is now frequently responded in schools.
And meanwhile as innocent articles contained asbestos in our houses as floor panels or shed roofs according to standard.
“It is an industrial poison that in large parts of our real estate is contained,” notices Andrew Morgan, the attorney, who represented Andrew Lawson during its process against Guy's hospital.
In a case the only contact, which occurred to a woman concerned, was the outline of a garden shed into the 1970ern.
Thus you watch out, how you tear your garden shed off.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the illness is incurable, it is immense.
“It takes a while to process” says Graham Abbott.
I went again to the work and tried to make further but I noticed that I could not concentrate on that, which I did.
I was two weeks in practice.
Then I knew that I had to go and to care me around me.
Well yes, I will experience no further Christmas.
With the largest difficulty was the Perspektivwechsel of the position of a physician to some patient.
Like countless patients before him it reminds of it, how he overwhelms from all the information was, with whom it by right to come oneself had.
“It was very heavy to take up all this” says it.
“I asked mean physician “like for a long time have I still?”
And one gave me still about 12 months.
I do not remember that I thought, “well yes, I a further Christmas will experience.
That was it then. ""
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious, because it our life support mechanism - which breathing - it is that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibers.
If that is whirled up asbestos and the fibers are inhaled, they can itself in the chest skin, which skin around the lungs, to determine.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest skin and can cell mutations release.
“The problem develops in such a way for professor Tom Treasure, a heart thorax physician, who changed 2001 to the Guy's hospital with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers,”.
Exactly the hospital, by which Andrew Lawson is assumed a prominent center that it exposed him to the asbestos, now ironically, with the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some different, which were probably likewise during their training in the hospital exposed to the asbestos.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, “it by the breath procedure to the edge is pressed, where the skin is.
By nature it is invasive from the outset.
The usual options with other cancer conditions do not work with mesothelioma so well.
The effectiveness of an operation is for example hot disputed.
Some it mean that she is worth an attempt.
Treasure answers that in the negative.
“One cannot cut the chest skin out,” says he.
They do not come around with the measurer therefore.
Meanwhile the cancer does not address “on chemotherapy very well,” the “effect shows”, but does not heal.
“Sometimes there are long-term survivors,” says Treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately some patients live actually for a long time, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
To two and a half year after his own diagnosis Graham Abbott fights still.
After it had contacted mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become four years after its diagnosis a one-man support and a consulting office for affected too ones.
To “cancer center,” he had an interview hello, with calls merrily.
“It was very positive,” says Abbott.
It had received and was still very active its diagnosis 4 years before.
Originally Abbott six chemotherapy cycles had been offered, which would extend four months to last and its life presumably only by one month.
“I had despaired,” say he.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson created it however “the things in a somewhat more positive light appear to let.”
After the consultation of several physicians decided Abbott, its treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski to continue Herz-Thorax-Spezialist at the Guy's.
“We had an advantage thereby that I did not have to be further-referred, I called simply and got a date,” admit Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and for the approval of the treatment to wait would have.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma-gotten sick, in order to be able to notice the best available therapies.
But if these treatments finally fail inevitably, many concerning of another financial concern stand - over the future of the families, which leave them.
And in such a way they turn to the courts in hope for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan von Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It is since 1898 well-known that asbestos is extremely dangerous for the health,” says Morgan.
But which changed into the 1960ern is that one recognized that also a very small load represented a health risk.
And here the negligence of the enterprises began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital settled her case finally, but it was not what calls Morgan a “full compensation”, since Lawson could not prove with absolute security that its mesothelioma was to due to an asbestos contact at the Guy's.
After the investigation to its death a spokesman of the Guy's confirmed however that “the asbestos fibers in the basement area concerned were removed into the 1990ern.”
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
As asbestos can be removed
It is actual for mesothelioma-gotten sick, which strive for compensation, an enormous problem to assign the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a job - normally decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers were closed sold or.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those, which resist requirements, know that the time for it is, but completely surely not with the plaintiffs.
As reaction to it there were clear new legislation, which simpler for mesothelioma-concerned it makes in this year, to sue for a compensation even if their former employers are not to be found any longer.
The law could prove from the insurance industry promoted funds of 350 million £ for all furnished, which were diagnosed after July 2012, a contact, but nobody to sue be able.
In these cases the plaintiffs receive 80 percent its that could have awarded a court in them - about 120,000 to normal damage suit £.
About 300 successful requests with the program are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks as so many mesothelioma-concerned that 350 million represented £ to “very good work” of the insurance industry.
“That is a deal of insurers for insurers,” says it, and suggests the fact that it concerns with this sum a quarter of its, which insurers would have had to pay, if the time had not passed over it and mesothelioma-got sick the enterprises find and it normally sue could.
Also Mike Penning, work at that time and pension Minister, admitted that the law was not perfect “”.
But both Penning and Morgan addition that in view of seven victims daily fast acting was necessary.
“Humans suffer so much and need today assistance,” said Penning during the second hearing of the mesothelioma law in the December of the past year.
At this time Graham Abbott was for 19 months in the hands of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski.
After its first consultation long Lazdunski recommended an operation, from which he expects a positive effect contrary to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by a radiotherapy and a chemotherapy - a three-fold therapy, with which long Lazdunski can present a survival rate over five years of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
“That is naturally the most important with,” says Abbott.
One sees that again and again with patients.
There is there something that lets you continue.
If you give up, are you very fast more badly.
Graham Abbott underwent in March 2012 of the operation.
At the end of August had it the last six chemotherapy cycles behind itself.
Aftercare scans did not show any signs of the illness.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer marks around my chest.
I became straight 50.
That is not life-threatening.
That is life-terminating.
Again Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumors is more visible.
But the procedure is physically and psychologically much exerting.
They must think of practical things - of the money, if I am not any more, for example, or my wife to show, how the storage water heater time attitude functions.
If you receive bad news, become negative.
They must look forward.
As a father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that is not always easy.
“For parents that is heavy,” says it.
It is difficult to know, what one is to say and like much.
When I mean first diagnosis received, said I mean girls that I would have an illness, with which I would become not old.
They reacted completely differently.
Tamsin is very informal and impetuous.
It told her friends and we got soon a great many calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She did not say much.
Such discussions are something, which all cancer patients must go through.
But for mesothelioma-gotten sick such discussions are from hope did not pull through, not from a trace of hope for surviving.
The illness brings (as finally also for Stephen Jay Gould) a furious security.
Like Andrew Morgan says, “mesothelioma is not life-threatening.
