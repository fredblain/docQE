In view of the voice losses of the NPD in Saxony CDU Bundesvize Thomas Strobl for an end of the current NPD Verbotsverfahrens before the Federal Constitutional Court expressed itself.
Berlin - sound CDU Bundesvize Thomas Strobl should current prohibition procedure against the NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court the end find.
“the NPD fares more badly than with the last mark”, said Strobl, who is also CDU state boss in Baden-Wuerttemberg, the “Leipziger Volkszeitung”.
That is a pleasing development in the right direction and a development, which let me come rather to the result that one fights the NPD politically and not before the constitutional court.
The NPD had failed with the vote because of Sunday completely scarcely because of the five-percent hurdle.
A first approach for a prohibition of the right-wing extremists a party had failed 2003, because the protection of the constitution had informants at that time also in the NPD point.
In December 2013 the Upper House of Parliament submitted a new request in Karlsruhe after long preparation.
Federal Government and Bundestag did not follow.
