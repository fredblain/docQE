Amazon buys Twitch for 1.04 billion $
AMAZON confirmed just now, what had reported information on Monday mornings: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety other things - buys the Videostreamingdienst Twitch for 1.04 billion $ (970 million US-$).
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because nobody had expected an assumption of Twitch, but because it was assumed far away that YouTube would acquire the enterprise.
Three months ago it looked in such a way, as if the sale of Twitch was to the video service of Google for a cool billion done deal, and co-operation appeared also naturally.
Twitch, which was only created before three years as Justin.tv, was started as general Streamingdienst - a live version of YouTube.
Instead it became fast a platform for players, who published their bravura pieces in plays wanted, a “YouTube for live plays”, such an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And “let's play”, a video category, in which know-it-alls give a painting of secret science theatre (usually older) to the plays, are on YouTube already much likes.
It is just like that YouTube is often called, if one wants to describe Twitch therefore became the message that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy, something bored taken up, a text book example of an established technology enterprise, which buys up a potential competitor.
It is a mystery, why that did not come deal with YouTube, since the enterprise was ready according to reports, just as much to pay as Amazon.
Everything that we know for the moment about it, is this statement of Emmet Shear, Präsident von Twitch: “We have ourselves for Amazon decided, because they believe in our Community, it divide our values and long-term visions and them want us to help to arrive faster there.”
A further secret is honestly said, unbelievable success by Twitch.
For snobs like me, which explain that they drive dear sport as thereby to watch, are it heavily to understand the attraction which assumes that, others when playing to watch instead of even the control console into the hand to take.
It is a thing to look a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning over the shoulder while it creeps by resident Evil, and somewhat completely different one to watch a crank how it is shot 20 times successively in call OF Duty into the head.
All these plays could view you now straight.
Another problem lies in it that many of the popular plays are today ego plays, therefore can watching without own control of the view perspective a correctly good recipe for headache be.
I admit that the high-speed runs, into which of Roger Bannisters's our electronics age whole plays in record time complete are entertaining.
But as long as play or humor-virtuoso is not thereby, its Twitch channel is probably not so much interesting.
But which sceptics know like I already of it?
Twitch is called of 55 million different visitor per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet peak traffic.
And how exactly does Amazon from it want to make money?
It is heavy to imagine that Twitch is integrated so elegantly in Amazon Instant video, as YouTube Twitch could have swallowed simply.
But Twitch has something that would have each enterprise gladly: Thousands of young men, who are wooed as advertising customers.
Like the chairman Shear, said von Twitch, Amazon and Twitch “did not believe both in the future of the Gaming,” and the medium shows signs of a contraction, not yet times - sip - as spectator haven.
