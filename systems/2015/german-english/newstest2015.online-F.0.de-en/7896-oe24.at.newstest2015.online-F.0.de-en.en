Hütteldorfer after second win of the season at place three of the table.
With the 2:0 over Grödig for rapidly a bitter week on Sunday a conciliatory end took.
“The victory is very liberating”, said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team with from in Europes League on Thursday had reached an interim low.
“The sense of achievement was terribly important”, confirmed Kapitän and Torschütze Steffen Hofmann, who advanced with green Weis at place three.
Schrammel Traumtor brings rapidly on winner route rapidly with the second win of the season the correct reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki showed and goes with a sense of achievement into the international match break.
“We wanted to show a positive reaction”, said counsel for the defense Thomas Schrammel, that with its wonderful guidance Volley of the sixteen-horizontal bar in the 14. Minute the switches set to victory.
“I imagined, I strike whole frustration of Thursday purely and snapped him under the slat”, meant the 26-year old smiling.
As Schrammel to 13. Novmember had met 2010 to the last mark in a Bundesliga portion, still was for Ried.
The first championship hit in the rapidly Dress will therefore remain for it in special memory.
“For me that is somewhat completely special, I am from the rapidly new generation”, said Schrammel.
Due to the short term basin wound of Mario Pavelic Schrammel of the left moved on the right defensive side and made also there its thing very good.
It has enough experience that he can also mirror-wrongly exercise this position.
He earned the gate, afforded, praised he this year already some Assists” Barisic.
Crew points a character Schrammel supplied also the flank to the 2:0 by Hofmann after well one hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because before it quite also the guests could have written down.
“Thank God we had, noticed today something luck” also Schrammel, which alluded thereby to gaping achievement and result in the past weeks: “The results were not correct, but the playful was always good in the comparison to the last year”.
Barisic found even that one had been better “in many plays than today” before - against “the strongest crew, which played in this season in this stadium”.
The first Dreipunkter since 26 July proved from there that the crew structure the setbacks is intact to the defiance: “Today my crew showed that it has a character”.
For it not less pleasing: “That we played finally again to zero”.
Much work during international match break also the circumstance that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several losses are to be deplored, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl as well as Philipp Schobesberger their first eleven debuts gave, make the victory still more valuable.
“One may not forget that”, reminded Barisic, which lost players in the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic, “those lately was very stable”.
The international match break must be used from there to add over “wounds to leaking and in the physical range a little”, explained Barisic, who has five U21-Auswahlakteure in its rows.
One, which the break probably particularly suits, is a captain Hofmann.
It tears up for the crew, goes over pain over it.
It showed straight ones in this heavy phase that he is for us a very important player”, stated Barisic.
Hofmann gave Rapids before its replacing to the play in the 68. Minute not only the structure, but obtained also the second gate.
For the 33-year old, its 350. Bundesliga play completed, was it the first hit from the play since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: “Being allowed not to believe the fact that now everything is good” “we has probably also a little luck had but sometime must come the luck also to us back.
Now was it high time”, said Hofmann.
It reminded certainly to concentrated continuing working: “One may do that not always black and knows to see.
We did not play in the last weeks so badly, as that was represented.
In addition, we may not believe that everything is good now.
It could not deny the meaning of its role for the team.
It is nevertheless a very young crew, which I can help for the moment much.
Adhere in certain phases nevertheless to me on”, said Hofmann.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had itself to accuse and its crew little.
It regretted the fast goal against “from the category charm gate”, as well as the regular gate of use in the 40. Minute, which had been denied by arbitrator Kollegger to injustice.
The only reproach, which I can make for the crew am that we were not concrete direction gate in some phases enough.
There we had too few conclusions.
Interior defender Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: “It began directly badly, then we found however pure and even a gate made.
On the whole would more in it have been.
