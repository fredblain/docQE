In a statement to the new press it contradicts statements of managing director Peer Medau and certifies to this to pose “like a general”.
The style of the university is not that, is called it in the report.
Thus the family Medau was informed already “in the middle of June verbally about the unjustified demand of the university.
The statement that only in July admits the plans became, are definitely wrongly”, like that Pötzl.
At the same time it refers to it that it does not concern with the plans “preliminary definitions or decisions”, it however “preferences” would give.
Also the development of the narrow road to the lock, necessary for the approach road, is feared up less dramatically than of the Medaus.
From nine meters spread road were and are not the speech.
Wide a meter goes than so far”, explains Pötzl to present conditions by 5.50 meters, that is.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and schoolown park surfaces are in the future then only used by students of the university, wants not to let Pötzl be valid.
One does not park across at all, because as with other public parking lots meanwhile intelligently can be solved.
Of the adjacents resident think
The creche mountain dwarf, which is on the area and would lead before their doorstep the approach road to the parking deck along, is not to be impaired according to the university president “”.
Rather it gives to consider, “that it not only around the creche goes here, but also around the adjacents resident at the inlet to the Friedrich Streib road and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring six-form high school.
It concerns thus much more than so around particularist interests of the Mr. Medau”, to Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parents adviser of the creche, with which development of the road one “few nature-left marks the Coburgs to be lost” is entitled can decide “the reader”.
At the beginning of Octobers wants Pötzl as well as the national board of works Bamberg the town councillors about the structural development of the university to 2020 to inform “and in this context the meaning of the new development address”.
Peer Medau had informed past week parents of the creche about the plans of the university.
Therefore the approach road for the new parking deck is to lead not as before across the campus and the Friedrich Streib road, but across the Medau mountain.
Thus the narrow road on approximately a kilometer of length would have to be removed two-lane.
According to computer forecasts of the Medaus traffic in the park of lock high rock thereby would increase tenfold.
From approximately 2000 vehicles the speech is daily.
On the part of the city one did not want to express oneself so far to the project.
