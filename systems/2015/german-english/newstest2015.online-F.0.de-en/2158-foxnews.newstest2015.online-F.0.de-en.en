4 hints for better underwater photos and videos
If you liked to make gladly photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most inexpensive option is a waterproof POINT and Shoot, as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or a Action Cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver edition, which both are to be had for approximately 300 $.
I took up these photos with a family celebration with several cameras, which are available all at a price of under 350 $.
Independently of the equipment there are a few rules for the best results.
Control your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery box and other subjects are closely locked.
Adjust your camera also to the photos or video, which want to take up you.
Some cameras and Camcorder have scene and admission modes, with which the exposure time for the d√§mmrigen underwater conditions is optimized.
And before you jump inside, check, until into which depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are certified only for up to 5 foot, others to 50 or 60 foot.
Look in our purchase leader and the evaluations for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make for multiple photographs - because many will not fold.
POINT and Shoot cameras do not have an LCD, with which you can compose pictures, Action Cams normally.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to view this under water and the correct framing is a luck thing.
Thus you take many photographs.
If had your camera a row mode, with which a set of photographs also easily changed exposure settings are made, use it.
Remain close of the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse, the further you depart from the surface.
If you remain possible thus closely at the surface, if it photographs in a pool, a lake or the sea to make.
Thus you can bring also more color into your photos; the more deeply you go, to the less color you will see.
Approach closely to the objects.
That is also ashore a good advice, but he is all the more important under water because of the bad lighting conditions.
It is completely particularly important, if you work with a Action Cam: These devices often have a firm wide angle lens, which means that you must more closely to your objects near, if these are to fill out the entire picture framework.
