Tax burden of businessmen in the area Washington rises with the economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customer, more sales and new jobs.
It means also higher taxes.
National and local tax assessments for enterprises in the country rose last year easily, while the economic recovery accelerated itself, so a again published study in the past week, and the companies in the area Washington did not form an exception.
Enterprises in the area District, Maryland and Virginia paid together 27.6 billion $ to national and local places in the financial year 2013, a rise by 3,8 percent in relation to the incomes of 2012 at a value of 26.6 billion $.
The national and local fiscal charges of the enterprises rose last year by 4,3 percent to 671 billion $ on, compared with 3,9 percent in the year before, and it was the third growth year in consequence after the several years of sinking answers 2009 and 2010.
National taxes rose more strongly than the local deliveries, by 4,3 percent, so the study, which was accomplished by the service agency Ernst & Young with the center for national taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenues of the District, 56 percent, originates from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of the incomes of Maryland from enterprises originate.
Virginia obtains the smallest tax revenues from enterprises with 28 percent.
A majority of the rise with the tax revenues is justified in a recovery of the real estate values of the enterprises, says the researchers, what led to an increase of the real estate taxes by 3,7 percent in this year after the three following each other years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these profits originated from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the expiration seems to apply also to the area Washington.
Enterprises in the District, Maryland and Virginia paid together over 10 billion $ at national and local real estate taxes last year, compared with 9.6 billion $ 2012 - a rise in the process of one year by 4,2 percent.
But the apparent recovery at the real estate values is not so effective in Maryland with the increase of national and local tax revenues, since the real estate taxes amount here to scarcely more than one fifth of the tax assessments of enterprises.
Enterprises in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their national and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
“In Maryland the following happens: a large part of the real estate, in particular in the tax area around D.C., is either in the possession of the government or from Non profit organizations, which do not pay real estate taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, Geschäftsführer the center of on State rating.
Maryland is compelling much more on the income taxes to rely for example in order to be able to offer the same services, which offer other states.
The recent recovery with the tax revenues by enterprises cannot be added alone to the recovery of the property market
Enterprise incomes seem to likewise recover, so the data.
Enterprises in the region reported over income taxes with state organisations of 2.3 billion $ compared with 2.1 billion in the year 2012.
Maryland took 1 billion $ in enterprise income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend goes into the same direction, the local tax burden for enterprises does not rise evenly at all three places.
The rise rate in the District corresponded to the national average, while the rise was clearly higher in Maryland, with 4,3 percent 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia announced a tax revenue below average of 4,1 percent.
Virginia has with 6 percent in all three competences clearly smallest enterprise income taxes (in all three there is firm of taxation of enterprises sets).
The taxation of enterprises set in Maryland lies with 8,25 percent and in the District with relatively high 9.975 percent.
A comparable study of the US-Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia smaller national and local corporate taxes are required and altogether a better tax climate prevail than in Maryland.
In the study the District was not examined.
Despite the advantages Virginia stands under pressure by his southern neighbour.
North Carolina adopted laws for the lowering of his taxation of enterprises sets in this year from 6,9 percent to 6 percent, which same sentence as Virginia, and the sentence will sink in the coming year on 5 percent.
If the state reaches further its income goals in the coming year, this law could reduce the enterprise income tax rate of the state until 2017 up to 3 percent.
In the meantime the small firms in the area Washington seem to be better, and they pay from there more national and local taxes, so the recent study.
Corporate taxes, those as personal income taxes by small businessmen to be paid - a transition structure, after which most small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose last year by 20 percent to 2.4 billion $, a clear faster growth rate than the corporate taxes altogether.
The researchers say that the trend and the rise will probably stop country with the corporate taxes generally speaking in this year, with an increase of the general multi-military tax revenues for the state and the local governments by 6,2 percent in the first three quarter 2014 in the comparison to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless the area Washington could lag behind, if the output shortage of the Federal Government affects the job market in the region.
