Recollection on the very American ideal of the labor laws as human rights
The congressional representatives Keith Ellison and John Lewis brought in a parliamentary bill, in order to establish the organization of trade unions as civil right.
“As trade unions, die also the middle class jobs die,” said Ellison, a democrat from Minnesota and deputy chairmen progressive Caucus in the congress.
Therefore I present the employee enabling act proudly together with the civil right icon John Lewis.
This innovative law gives the same legal possibilities to workers with discrimination because of the organization of trade unions as with other forms of discrimination - and stops so anti-into a union stopped forces.
The addition of the national labor law law, in order to create a possibility for a discrimination suspended workers for the organization of a trade union agency to receive in order to complain before a civil court around justice - and around payment of damages or fines - is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But it is not with security a radical initiative - anyhow not after American standards.
Actually the best way is to understand its that Ellison, Lewis and the further sponsors of its bill suggest, the connection back to a very American idea.
To expand and keep despite the setbacks, the trade unions were exposed to which in the past years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states generally speaking country - have Americans once countries in all world encouraged to recognize labor laws.
There was a time, which millions of Americans still remember, when this country called democracy, free speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in a breath.
When after the Second World War Japan occupied the United States, it encouraged general Douglas Mac Arthur and its staff the country to adopt a condition which is to guarantee that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos was replaced by democracy.
In full consciousness its that the workers and their trade unions took new Japan a role with the creation, used it a language, which recognized explicitly that “the rights of the workers to combination and common negotiating are guaranteed and acting.”
When the United States occupy Germany after the Second World War, Dwight David Eisenhower and its staff the Germans pushed general to write a condition which would ensure that fascism Adolf Hitlers was replaced by a strong democracy.
In acknowledgment of the fact that the workers would have themselves to organize, and their voting in the new nation raise should, the Germans inserted a clause, which stated explicitly: “The right will improve to create combinations to secure around work and economic conditions and each particular and each profession or trade guaranteed.
Agreements, which limit this right or aim at, it to diminish are zero and futile; whereupon aiming at measures are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency over the international human rights commission, by which the universal declaration of human rights was sketched, as it was taken over 1948 of the United Nations as world-wide agreement, inserted Roosevelt and the other authors a warranty that “everyone has the right, to trade unions for the protection of its interests to form or them step.”
For generations Americans accept the basic premise that labor laws are human rights.
When this country other countries advised how one could form civilian and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to the establishment of a trade union - and whereupon that this trade union may participate then in collective negotiations as equivalent partners with enterprises and government agencies - to be protected had.
After these rights came in America under bombardment are it actually much point to lead itself the American ideal again before eyes therefore the working population the right to have must to unite and provide in a free and open society hearing.
As minister said Martin Luther King Jr. before fifty years:
History is a great instructor.
Now all know the fact that the workers' movement did not limit the strength of the nation but increased it.
By the rise of the standard of living of millions of people work created a market for the industry in wondrous way and raised the entire nation to inconceivable levels of production.
Those, which attack the work, forget these simple truths, but history retains them.
History remembers, and which we should also do.
The formal acknowledgment of the labor laws as human rights - and the extension of the protection of the civil rights as protection against discrimination with the creation of representatives for the employees - is for a long time overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals, which made America in the past and which promises of democracy redeemed large.
