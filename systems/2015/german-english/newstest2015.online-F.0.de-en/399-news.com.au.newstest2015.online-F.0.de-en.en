Genetic disturbance often wrongly makes a diagnosis
A Briton says, it thought as consequence of a wrong diagnosis about many years that it would die.
Karin Rodgers lived nearly her entire youth in the faith that she had to only live few years, after she had been diagnosed with another illness.
She suffered actually from the Charcot Marie Tooth illness (CMT) - a group inherited disturbances, which damage the nerves outside of the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK communicated that wrong diagnoses are a frequent problem with humans with CMT, because so little admits over this illness is.
About 23,000 humans in Great Britain probably suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disturbances such as myasthenia, an uncertain course and curved toes.
Got sick suffer also with deafness feelings or pain. The illness is incurable and progressively, which means that the symptoms become worse with the time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she suffers from Friedreich ataxia (COMPANY) - an illness with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought, it in the wheelchair would sit, before them became 18, and before their 30. Birthday die.
The mother of two children, that is 51 years old today, said: “As a child I knew that I could not do the same as the others.
I constantly fell down and everything lasted with me longer.
I could never drive with the other children roller skate or skateboard and go at school because of my kind and run was often teased.
Rodgers said that she saw their patient document at the age of 13 years after several operations for the discharge of her Achilles' tendons and aspect ratio of their feet, when their physician had left and read the room that she suffered from COMPANIES.
“I felt guiltily, because I had been curious, therefore I the nobody told, but I went home, looked for the illness in the library and wrote the company company,” said her.
When I received answer, I was shocked and came dreadfully into panic.
I thought that I would be with 18 in the wheelchair and with 25 to die, and between them slowly all my abilities would lose.
I constituted that everything alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said, when them became 17, it clearly that had not so strongly removed her abilities, like it had introduced themselves and asked her physician.
He rose simply, and embraced themselves and said, “my love, I does not believe not that you have that, otherwise now already wärst you in the wheelchair.”
I believe, you have somewhat by far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests with their CMT was determined.
“As he me explained, what CMT was, I felt me, as if I would be a winner,” said her.
Charity CMT UK started one CMT Awareness month, in order to make attentive on this illness.
