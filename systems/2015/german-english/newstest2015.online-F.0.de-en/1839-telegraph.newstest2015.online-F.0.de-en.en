Perhaps with Rona Fairhead the BBC found the great director, whom it needs.
It meets with a proud fame-drags from the bank world, the medium management and the internal circle of the Tory party.
And it has own front experience.
Their career began CO with the world-wide management consulting firm Bain and., on which it changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
It was seven years long chairmen of the board of Financial Times and withdrew, when the highest post of the mother enterprise Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
Their compensation amounted to allegedly nearly 1 million £.
Also their political ranking is solid.
It was recommended David Cameron of Lord Browne, to the former chairman of BP, than this looked for more private-economical knowledge in Whitehall: it became the advisor of the cabinet.
Their husband is a former Tory Ratsmitglied.
Already in May I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned cup.
The BBC does not only stand as enormous and complex unit in the heart of the public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The confidence acts in two directions: inward on the first guard of the own management hierarchy in the BBC, in addition, outward as voice of public concern and unrest, if the things run wrongly.
That provides for a nearly untenable duopoly, which requires for a complete comprehensive reform.
But which would risk again arriving chairmen it to begin to hit everything and take an institution apart, which is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he perhaps brings himself thereby around his job.
It is a difficult task.
And as that would be not already enough, is interested also still many to see the BBC reduced - power, money and status overhaul.
While the competition moves more near and old, comfortable collateral threatens new technologies, the lining up negotiation of the royalties for the BBC is connected with special dangers.
For the modest sum of 145,50 £ per year the British public buys itself into the surely largest media company of the world.
The BBC tell a good story: she says that she reaches 96 percent of all households and to everyone of it only 40 pence per day costs.
And apparently the BBC rises again upward on the popularity scale: They support 53 percent today, compared with 31 percent before 10 years.
The seeing and use habits for the BBC to have changes: I get nowadays news headlines on my mobile phone and see missed programs later on my more iPlayer.
But it remains a very much loved and considerable institution.
It needs a considerable chairman - I hope, her him found.
