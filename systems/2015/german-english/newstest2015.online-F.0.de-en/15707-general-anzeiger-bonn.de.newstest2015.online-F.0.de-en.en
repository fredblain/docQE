Glandorf withdraws from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will not play no more for the DHB team.
The 31-year old of the German Bundesliga club SG Flensburg Handewitt stated health problems for this decision above all.
The decision is me not easily pleases, it over several months matured.
It is for me time to hear and my career in the national team terminate on the signals of my body”, communicated the world champion of 2007 on its Facebook side.
It goes thus with one balance from 167 international matches and 576 gates for Germany into the international retirement.
Because the throw-enormous back space player for the championsleague winner wants to go out of Flensburg still some years on gate hunt, it is not now to the new coach of the national team Dagur Sigurdsson any longer at the disposal.
With the Icelander, which announces its cadre for the international matches on Tuesday against Switzerland, Glandorf held a “long and good conversation.
Its ideas and approaches inspired me exactly the same, as they will inspire also my fellow players of many years and my successors.
But for my club I would like to be available also in the next years healthy, but longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which the current double load does not permit.
The left-handed person had had to fear 2012 after a heel infection its career end.
Because of Achilles' tendon problems it could be treated from team physicians of the German handball federation (DHB) with a Cortisonspritze, which had released a strong inflammation later.
An emergency operation and two further interferences followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the crew physician, ended the argument with a comparison.
Twelve years professional and eleven years national team career pass no body without trace.
I have some health building sites, which I cannot ignore no more.
After the three infection-conditioned foot surgeries, which took place 2012 in short distances, I never got correctly to mean blood pressure into the grasp.
For this some other wear-conditioned complaints come.
Already at the beginning the year I noticed that I mean head steer, but do not mean bodies not to deceive can”, explained Glandorf in the interview the magazine “handball time”.
For a comeback it would be available only in the absolute emergency.
“If all cords tear, are always willing to negotiate I”, explained the double family man to the specialist journal.
However I can count the years, in which I can play still handball, at a hand.
I must also say that I became after my long hospitalization 2012 also rather humbly, which concerns my health.
To my career I would like to be able at least to some extent to go straight.
Apart from the WM-title 2007 and the profit of the champions League 2014 he got 2008 (HSG north horn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo) the EHF cup.
2012 it secured itself besides with Flensburg the European Cup of the Cup winners.
