The tradition of the graduation balls in the USA is transferred now to the universities, where Freshmen of appearances with the private airplane are offered.
We are pleased to be able and that the first luxurious travel service of Great Britain for students today offer to react to this demand.
In order to be able to obtain a particularly impressing appearance at the university, the enterprise offers also to transport options such as private airplanes, roll Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also indicated that the service had a safety section.
This service is an ideal alternative for students, who would have chauffeur otherwise their belongings in a dangerously überladenen car by the country.
Together with our new VIF options we look forward to ensure in this year that the students reach the university with a minimum of expenditure and a maximum at luxury.
An employer speaker said that still no new reservations would be present, since the service had been just introduced added however that “students booked the service in the next weeks” became.
In addition the enterprise communicated that it expects a market for this offer despite the study fees of 9.000 £ per year.
Students today differ in their expectations and requirements much from the students before 10, 20, 30 or 40 years - it is more importantly ever to make a great first impression and with VIF one can do exactly that.
The national student union criticized the service however as taken off.
Megan Dunn, Vizepräsidenten of the NUS for university formation said: “This offer seems completely separate from the life the majority of the students.
Many students, who begin this month with the study, see themselves to a crisis of the cost of living suspended, since the available financial assistances do not hold in the form of credits and scholarships with the strongly rising bills for the simplest bases of life step, before they can remember at all to spend thousands of pound on something so simple like the arrival in the student hostel.
