China refuses Hong Kong right to government choice, demonstrator swears retaliation
On Sunday the Chinese parliament decided despite the increased calls after democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the elections 2017 by the Hongs Konger constituency.
This action probably beacons the long announced protests in of Hong Kong business district, while activists initiated planning and mobilization in addition within a few hours after the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese congress of people makes it possible to the communist leaders in principle to reject all not Peking-faithful candidates.
“Does not come unexpectedly, but it makes us nevertheless furious,” said Rechtsexpertin Emily Lau, chairman of the democratic party.
That is not what had promised Peking.
One lay the inhabitants of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we have to do it with an authoritarian regime.
In its defense of the Chinese decision said left protect, vice-Secretary-General of the standing committee of the national congress of people that the permission of public nominations would be “chaotic” with the elections for the Hongs Konger government too.
Since has Peking promised 1997, when Great Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, to let the inhabitants select starting from 2017 the government presidency.
The Chinese guidance presented the decision of Sunday as democratic break-through, because there is the citizen of Hong Kong a direct right to vote, but it makes the decision also clear that the Chinese guidance keeps the expiration firmly by a nomination committee controlled closely of Peking in the hand.
In addition after a new clause only candidates are to become certified “with love for the country and love for Hong Kong”.
The decision follows one summer, in which some the largest and audience-most effective protests in Hong Kong for some years took place.
Behind the per-democratic campaign in Hong Kong the movement Occupy cent ral With Love stands and for Peace, whose organizers threatened to bulkhead the financial district if Peking does not permit genuine general right to vote.
On Sunday evening within a few hours after the announcement hundreds of Occupy Central supporters in the rain before government headquarters in Hong Kong had met.
During the demonstration the organizers said that its movement had achieved a new stage of civil disobedience and they planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
They made however no more details to apparently avoid in order problems with the authorities.
In a report of online the organizers communicated that the movement considered “the occupation of the central district only as last means, an action, which was to take place only if all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and no other choice exists.
It does suffering to us, says to have that today all dialogue opportunities were exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong prepared for days for the announcement of Peking, and intensified security measures were valid for police force and barricades inclusively on Sunday before the government building.
The riots are strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they lose slowly control of their city.
The influx of humans of the mainland strengthens the competition around products and services.
In addition the fear grows that the values of Hong Kong begin to crumble such as democracy and free speech under the increasing pressure of Peking.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement, there it the business concern - which vital lines of Hong Kong - endanger.
“The protests, of which they speak, could cause large economic damage, depending on, like many in it are involved and like for a long time them to persist,” said Rechtsexpertin Regine Ip, which criticizes the movement for a long time.
We do not want to stir fears up that Hong Kong turns out out of control.
This impression is bad for investments.
The state-controlled mediums of China reported also recently on Demokratieaktivisten in Hong Kong as subversive agents steered of western powers.
In this summer activists organized an unofficial referendum to the choice elections, in which 780,000 humans participated - more than one fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
