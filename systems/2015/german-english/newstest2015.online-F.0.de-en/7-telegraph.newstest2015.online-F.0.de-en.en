Why “Guardians OF the Galaxy” no cash hit became
“The Expendables 3” of Sylvester Stallone brought in less than 30 million dollar its 90 million dollar budget in the USA, during “Sin City: A lady ton kill For” only 12 million dollar of his budget of 70 million dollar brought in.
The film “sex Tape” tailored to Cameron Diaz brought in on opening weekend only 14.6 million dollar, while children's films likewise disappoint like “Drachenzähmen easily made 2” with the incomes.
An article of the telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that with the children's films the lack of quality could be with the films themselves the reason.
Collin called 2014 “the worst year” so far for children's films and described “Drachenzähmen easily made 2” as purely “functional” fantasy continuation.
With films for a somewhat older target audience it seems however in such a way, as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic evaluation for each summer film release, which was shown between American Memorial Day and 20 July 2013 and in the current year on at least 2000 canvases.
The results rely on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics and point to the fact that the film hits of this year those of the past year equivalently are.
Some commentators mean that the development to changing Sehgewohnheiten and the increasing popularity of Web Streaming services are to due such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who works at present on of Disney soon appearing jungle book film, said Hollywood Reporter opposite the web page: “I believe, the times change.”
We must accept and not try that to run after the past.
Contrary to at present weak cash results of the Hollywoodproduktionen Netflix obtained in recent time of sales with Streaming contents at a value of 1.2 billion dollar, nearly twice as much like last year, in which the revenue 837 million dollar amounted to.
In the last summer the director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for the fact that they concentrated too much on filmings of comics and prophesied a “core melt-through” Hollywoods.
In the light of the present wing over seen some commentators argue that its dark prediction can quite contain a true core.
Due to the potential cash hit, under, it which can be expected in the summer 2015, Avengers: Age OF Ultron, mini ONS and Jurassic World are however more optimistic other representatives of the film industry:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the decrease of the cash results recently as simply “cyclic” and said opposite Hollywood Reporter: “The next summer will be the largest summer at the cinema cash at all, and nobody becomes more around the business worrying.”
