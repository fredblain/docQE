Putin requires the admission of “statehood discussions” of Kiev with east Ukraine
Russian president Wladimir Putin required Russian media reports according to on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stops and directly with negotiations to the “statehood” of the disloyal region takes up the fights against the separatists in the east of the country.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow got straight later that Putin had not meant with it that the area standing under control of the separatists becomes east Ukraine a part of Russia, but that its status must be redefined opposite Ukraine, in order to give to the Russian-speeking region power for the agency of his rights and interests.
Of Putin call to the Kiev government to negotiations on eye level with the per-Russian insurgent ones fits however the strategy apparently pursued by him since beginning of the excesses five months ago: Help for the separatists when taking areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government, in order to make for the again proclaimed region possible Novorossija actual independence for an alliance with Russia instead of with the west.
In an interview with the national television station channel unity condemned Putin the Ukrainian military campaign to the recapture of the areas in the eastern regions Donezk and Luhansk, thought of separatists, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea to 18. March had annexed.
The Kremlin and the separatists called lately the taken area “Novorossija” or “new Russia”, a term, which reminds of the pre-revolutionary gloss time of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those, which attack in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 October and during government groups civilian communities in the areas thought of separatists for imminent peace talks hope “in their illusions” are imprisoned reported Itar Tass.
“We must take up immediately detailed discussions, not only to technical questions, but also for the political organization of the society and the state status of southeast Ukraine, in order to protect the interests of there living humans,” said it.
Peskow said the fact that of Putin reference to the statehood in the context with the larger autonomy had to be seen, which is discussed for months by the Kiev guidance, in order to scatter fears in Russian-speeking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights is endangered.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern areas, said Peskow.
Here not Ukraine and Russia goes, said Peskow, “because it not around a conflict between Russia around negotiations between and Ukraine goes, but around an internal conflict in Ukraine.”
The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman for the correction of the “misinterpretation” of Putin remarks underlined the claim to leadership of Russia while handling the separatist rebellion in the east contrary to the direct Annektion the Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitant ethnic Russians are.
Moscow would have far larger difficulties to annex the regions Donezk and Luhansk in east Ukraine since most of the 6.5 million inhabitant are not Russians and surveys showed a broad majority for the whereabouts in Ukraine from the time before the conflict.
The autonomy, which was responded by Russian diplomats to international forums, would give to the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate own trade agreements and external relations and so the Kremlin de facto control of an area to give, which connects the Russian national territory with Crimea.
Five months ago the annexed peninsula in the black sea is the home port for the majority of the Russian navy as well as an important commercial port and a historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov area in Russia and Crimea is beyond that rich at mines, factories and foundries, which manufacture important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko suggested with his speech to the inauguration on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - was to consider additives for condition, with which the respective areas larger control of their finances and the status of the languages is granted.
But its conception of autonomy seems to stand for their armament and goading Moscow on in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, is accused.
Of Putin last request of Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders after eye level followed after a further penetration of the rebels in the past week, after Russian troops and tank penetrated over the before peaceful region along the Asow sea into east Ukraine.
The separatists supported by Russia transferred in the coup, which is according to fears of Ukrainian police officers the first step of a campaign for the assumption of the strategic coastal region up to Crimea, control of Nowoasowsk.
For this reason substantial civilian and military preparations started, in order to fasten Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500.000 inhabitants, which lies between Nowoasowsk and the narrow entrance to the peninsula Crimea.
Poroshenko spoke a former Soviet republic, which is independent for 23 years on Saturday with a meeting of the European Union-guidance in Brussels and asked urgently for acts, in order to prevent a further Russian aggression against Ukraine.
“We stand shortly before one point, at which it gives no back more,” warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of strange troops and hundreds strange tank are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide concrete actions, the guidance required the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which are to go in effect with a unspezifizierten escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw themselves from their positions into Ilowajsk, after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers penetrated in order besieged last week into the Donezkregion, separatists to support, said Colonels Andrij Lysenko, Sprecher of the Ukrainian national safety and defence council reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were included by the Russian idea in Ilowajsk, exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers, who had been imprisoned taken one week ago in Ukrainian area, communicated Lysenko on Sunday.
