<seg id="1">Return to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights.</seg>
<seg id="2">The congressmen, Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organisation of trade unions as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"As trade unions, die die too middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, and deputy chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.</seg>
<seg id="4">That is why I am proud with the civil rights icon John Lewis before the employee empowerment law.</seg>
<seg id="5">This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities of discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions, like other forms of discrimination - and stop the anti union of the forces.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to the national labour law in order to create a way for the discrimination of workers to organize an union to sue in civil court for justice - and to receive compensation or the - is a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, suggest Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill, the link back to a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the setbacks faced by the trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - once countries around the world have encouraged Americans to recognise labour rights to extend and respect.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time to remember the millions of Americans in this country, democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in the same breath.</seg>
<seg id="11">As the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution which should ensure that would replace the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos through democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their unions a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognised that "guarantees the rights of workers to union and common negotiation and action."</seg>
<seg id="13">As the United States after World War II Germany, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organise themselves, and should raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly testified: "the right to form associations in order to secure employment and to improve economic conditions and guarantees of every individual and every profession or industry.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict this right or seek to diminish it is null and void; seeks measures are unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="16">When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency of the International Commission on Human Rights, which was drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other author is a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form trade unions to protect its interests or to join them."</seg>
<seg id="17">For generations, Americans accept the premise that labour rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country other countries how to shape the civil and democratic societies, Americans said that the right to the establishment of a trade union - and that the union should take part in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - must be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">After these rights were under attack in America, it is indeed very wise to remember that the American ideal of working people must have the right to unite and in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr., fifty years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">The story is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now we all know that the labour movement is not limited to the strength of the nation but enlarged it.</seg>
<seg id="23">By raising the living standards of millions of people miraculously work has created a market for the industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack the work, forget these simple truths, but history.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers, and we should do this.</seg>
<seg id="26">The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights and protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue.</seg>
<seg id="27">Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and delivering on the promise of democracy.</seg>

<seg id="2">A U.S. federal judge on Sunday provisionally stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, the lawyers say that it probably would have led to the closure of all the state's five abortion clinics.</seg>
<seg id="3">This measure of Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, was raised in June 1. The law, and should, in effect, would force doctors to perform abortions, including the right to acquire a patient at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles of their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">The judge's decision means, however, that the doctors can perform legal abortions continue for the time being, while they apply for such a right.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The plaintiffs can continue, while trying to obtain these rights," wrote Judge John deGravelles in his judgment.</seg>
<seg id="6">A hearing will be scheduled within a month for the judges to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Abortion supporters welcomed the decision, said the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures, and that doctors have more time to obtain hospital admission rights.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana, a law that they want to take their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Centre for reproductive rights, which had sued on behalf of three of the five clinics of the state to stop the law.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the ruling also covered the doctors from two hospitals, which have not joined the lawsuit and had also asked for the rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of 11 states that have introduced similar laws, but such measures have recently declared courts in Alabama and Mississippi for the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="11">Cruxes of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the remaining clinics in the state to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and, as well as the American Medical Association say that the rights of doctors are demanding unnecessary restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="13">Anti-abortion activists counter that the measures serve to protect the health of women, although some of the effects of the closure of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana, has Patienteineinweiserechte, shared with the Centre for reproductive rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all the other doctors in the state are being forced to carry out any more abortions, this doctor would not carry out the operation, fearing for his safety, said the group.</seg>
<seg id="16">In their arguments against the judgment of the state of Louisiana, officials said that they would not punish doctors because of the performance of abortions, while their applications for patient rights, no way.</seg>

<seg id="5">That is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to come to the conclusion that the NPD fought politically and in front of the Constitutional Court.</seg>
<seg id="6">The NPD had failed narrowly in the vote on Sunday at the five% threshold.</seg>
<seg id="7">A first attempt to ban the far-right party had failed in 2003, because of the protections in the NPD's top informants at the time.</seg>

<seg id="4">And he is brutally honest: from Onanie during his high school to the shoplifting and drug use, it leaves no human weakness.</seg>
<seg id="5">Also, to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow men.</seg>
<seg id="6">Wide space, but also more abstract concepts: love, soul, ego, Being in the now, spirituality - all of which he is trying to go to the bottom in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.</seg>
<seg id="7">And he also explained his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how it has shaped not only the music (the opera lover became the soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.</seg>
<seg id="8">The latter has brought the ascetic monk, the high-living Konstantin alarm "by subtraction," as he says, "by omitting everything superfluous."</seg>

<seg id="1">Lenny Henry: my father never took me in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="2">Never said "I love you"</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry, Rudy's Rare Records for a comedy, which is based partly on an imaginary conversation with his father and was born out of the series on Radio 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.</seg>
<seg id="8">He attended many "therapies" after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was difficult to know him.</seg>
<seg id="10">We never saw his face, his voice only heard: "listening to the noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Let thy sister in peace.</seg>
<seg id="12">LU2300!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of cricket.</seg>
<seg id="15">I have never had such a conversation with him.</seg>
<seg id="16">A large part of my life, he was a serious guy in the corner, read the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="17">Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he gained an insight into how life was for him to be liked.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is a little brighter, but they are dark, smoky, deep Stygian maze with a lot of soot and smoke and flame surges.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father used to be presented in the tub and then you could hear him slowly, as he began to sing, because he could wash the foundry.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I went around there, I realized that he had done so for years to get the food on the table, and my respect for him has been greater.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, Henry grew up as a child without the love of his parents.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="23">Only when my mother was ill at the end of their lives, we started, "I love you, I love you, I love you" to say.</seg>
<seg id="24">By his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he shared the love that he had missed as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">Could you stop with the "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">But listening to hug me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I'm 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">With Dawn French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why should we not be friends?</seg>
<seg id="30">It is a great mother.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is still friends with French, he was married 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Dawn is a good man.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why should we not be friends?</seg>
<seg id="34">It is a great mother.</seg>
<seg id="35">Henry's own mother was diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="36">This contributed to her death.</seg>
<seg id="37">When I was so very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "you have to be radical.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I moved this fitness thing through and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="40">And it is exhausting.</seg>
<seg id="41">Nobody likes to eat carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">Henry's career change may be seen in his elegant, short cut.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he has been praised by critics for his Othello, he is captured by the theater.</seg>
<seg id="44">It was followed by The comedy of errors, and then, by August Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">That is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He started with only 16 years when he was working in a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">A DJ discovered him on the stage when he wrote to New Faces and imitation people about him.</seg>
<seg id="48">His television career began in the mid seventies. "I was for a long time the only black imitator / comedian on TV."</seg>
<seg id="49">He learned at work.</seg>
<seg id="50">I had to be not just great in the eyes of the public, but also learn from 1975 to 1985, as I tell all the jokes could be an efficient machine, while I was a TV star, and that was really difficult.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny 1975 New Faces</seg>
<seg id="52">Since his manager had the right to stage the Black and White minstrel show, a light entertainment programme, in which the people "black," said Henry anmalten his comedy there over five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family was very unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="54">I wish somehow that it never would have happened, but I do not regret that I have done.</seg>
<seg id="55">It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I was working on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.</seg>
<seg id="56">But these "years of award-winning light pillar of the British TV" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."</seg>
<seg id="57">Through the introduction of characters that the British black culture both celebrated and scorned, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circuit in the eighties.</seg>
<seg id="58">The first series of the Lenny Henry Show was broadcast in 1984, and in the nineties he was the chef Gareth Black Lock in the comedy series boss!.</seg>
<seg id="59">Advertising, documentaries, TV series and in the next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008, he thought: "what are you doing next, Len, because it feels all the time, or only as you stomp on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">Then came a documentary series for Radio 4, entitled What's So Great About...?</seg>
<seg id="61">The first episode was about Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="62">I was downright allergic to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">I had never really learned in school about him and held him mainly for a domain of the middle class, white tights and a cabbage in front of it.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I had a great fear.</seg>
<seg id="65">All those we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, said Judi Dench, "you should try it.</seg>
<seg id="66">It is not bad, if you don't know what you are talking.</seg>
<seg id="67">Put a couple of words in the mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry led 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary, and he was thrilled.</seg>
<seg id="69">I had the feeling that I was able to do this.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was almost as if someone put me at the head.</seg>
<seg id="71">"That is, it is a serious thing to take them seriously, and your text, a bit chaotic.</seg>
<seg id="72">The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we made it.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">They seemed to expect a car accident, and that simply did not happen.</seg>
<seg id="75">And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was a moment when I thought, "oh, you've changed yourself." "</seg>
<seg id="78">There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.</seg>
<seg id="79">"A small voice told me" you have to bridge now 10 minutes, while they fix the computer. ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, the stage director, announced that the idea would continue once the problem was solved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I went to the stage and said something in me, "oh, thank God."</seg>
<seg id="82">I am not responsible.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can leave it to someone else.</seg>
<seg id="84">"You are playing in a play, so stick to your role."</seg>
<seg id="85">Henry, at the Duchess Theatre</seg>
<seg id="86">The text was to learn for the ambitious.</seg>
<seg id="87">Panic is very good, which strengthens the sinew.</seg>
<seg id="88">It was also good, so it is like a big sign of the Gods, "this is your destiny." "</seg>
<seg id="89">He says this, of course, with a DONNERNDEN voice.</seg>
<seg id="90">So I maintain.</seg>
<seg id="91">I love that.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love being in a sample.</seg>
<seg id="93">Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is criss-crossed by humorous outbursts, while he imitates people.</seg>
<seg id="94">I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy, because I think that this kind of instant satisfaction from a room full of strangers somehow dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="95">If you look at it constantly, from a wall.</seg>
<seg id="96">I am sometimes live at the Apollo, if I wish to do so, but overall there is not so much as before.</seg>
<seg id="97">I ask him whether he will ever make a stand-up comedy tour.</seg>
<seg id="98">The fun that I have in a room with a director who helps a beginning, a middle and the end of a journey - I do not think I would ever give up.</seg>
<seg id="99">So here is his new incarnation?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think it is.</seg>
<seg id="101">I am an actor.</seg>
<seg id="102">It's fun.</seg>
<seg id="103">It always tells a story, and that is great.</seg>
<seg id="104">I love stories.</seg>

<seg id="1">Children need roots and wings</seg>
<seg id="2">He was a teacher for 44 years, 23 as head of the school.</seg>
<seg id="3">This time, Manfred Richter knows many of Peter's house, and Koll, from their time as a student.</seg>
<seg id="4">His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always in his quest to see the people in the school.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Snezka is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="6">Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home.</seg>
<seg id="7">Richter was born in 1930, northern Bohemia, Trutnov today.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 14, he was interested in the teaching profession after four years of secondary school.</seg>
<seg id="9">One year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within half a hour, the family had to leave their house.</seg>
<seg id="11">After a few months in a camp in Bavaria, it was 1946 - in the freight car.</seg>
<seg id="12">So judges staggered into the Upper Franconian lower village.</seg>
<seg id="13">The teacher training took place in Bamberg, Germany.</seg>
<seg id="14">Manfred Richter had to run ten miles six times a week to the next station, take the train to Bamberg, three kilometres across the entire city and go back to school.</seg>
<seg id="15">After two months, got Manfred Richter in a Red Cross home in Bamberg a sleeping: along with up to 15 students in a dormitory.</seg>
<seg id="16">In 1951 he made the first and 1954 candidates after three years of teaching the second exam.</seg>
<seg id="17">Because he was not free to teachers, he applied to Upper Bavaria and came to the school in the creek on 1 November 1954.</seg>
<seg id="18">The "Miss Room" was his first "service" in the school.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 1958 he was referring to the house next to the school teacher, a three -room apartment service.</seg>
<seg id="20">This house bought Manfred Richter, 1980, after the school was dissolved in 1968, Bach.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the meantime, there was a school association Peter Bach - Koll Bach, three classes and Peter, five.</seg>
<seg id="22">From the school in 1968/69, Peter, in today's town hall.</seg>
<seg id="23">When it was founded in the Indian village school association, remained the primary school in the village.</seg>
<seg id="24">In order to avoid demotion in the smaller school, according to Karl, the former rector of Georg Sigl and Manfred Richter was his successor.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Peter grew, and so could the children and their teachers from September 1982, the current building, which was expanded in 1997 after Judge retirement.</seg>
<seg id="26">Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Goetz, a workroom at community costs and in the expansion of 1997 cellars built, although that was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Mayor Goetz was very friendly," recalled school judges.</seg>
<seg id="28">Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative, who had responded to a school on law and justice: "we must never forget the love." Manfred Richter set up what he had heard as a young teacher.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We need to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84 -year-old.</seg>
<seg id="30">And he had to learn: "do not always succeed." Whether he means to his students or just his own six children, is not entirely clear.</seg>
<seg id="31">In any case, the judge was sometimes unconventional.</seg>
<seg id="32">If they are students, he got a criminal work and were not ordered to sit.</seg>
<seg id="33">At the expense of the community, judges had to buy two pairs of boxing gloves and left the two sides against each other, even if there should be a violet.</seg>
<seg id="34">For the good of the school of judges as rector of a good relationship with the former mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).</seg>
<seg id="35">This moved the French judges after his retirement to last at least 1996 candidates on the CSU list for the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="36">But the judge was selected in six and joined the CSU.</seg>

<seg id="1">The BBC has found with Rona fair, perhaps the great director, it needs.</seg>
<seg id="2">She meets with a proud glory, from the banking world, the media and the inner circle of the Tory Party.</seg>
<seg id="3">And it has its own front experience.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her career began in the global management consultancy Bain and Co., which they have moved to Morgan Stanley, the decoding of ICI and the media's.</seg>
<seg id="5">She was seven years and resigned as chairman of the Financial Times, the top post of the parent company's to a younger male colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="6">Their compensation was supposedly almost £1 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">Their political ranking is solid.</seg>
<seg id="8">David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when it was looking for more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: she became a consultant of the cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her husband is a former Tory councillor.</seg>
<seg id="10">In May, I described the role of the chairman with a poisoned chalice.</seg>
<seg id="11">Not only does the BBC as a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.</seg>
<seg id="12">The trust works in two directions: internally to the first guard on the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also to the outside world as the voice of public concern and anxiety when things go wrong.</seg>
<seg id="13">This creates an almost unsustainable duopoly, which requires a full comprehensive reform.</seg>
<seg id="14">But what new incoming chairman, it would risk everything and increase an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he may bring himself to his job.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is a difficult task.</seg>
<seg id="16">As if this is not enough, many are interested to see the BBC reduced - power, money and status.</seg>
<seg id="17">While the competition is threatening comfortable certainties of old and new technologies, the forthcoming negotiation of license fees for the BBC with special dangers.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public is buying into the largest media company in the world, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="19">The BBC tells a good story: she says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs each of them only 40 pence a day.</seg>
<seg id="20">And apparently the BBC rises back to the top of the scale of popularity: 53 percent support them today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="21">The impaired vision and habits have changed for the BBC today: I get news headlines on my mobile phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it remains a very beloved and significant institution.</seg>
<seg id="23">It needs a considerable chairman - I hope she has found it.</seg>

<seg id="2">A tweet from the official account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a disparaging remark about the democratic state district attorney who is at the heart of a criminal indictment against him for misuse of authority.</seg>
<seg id="3">The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of Perry's account, the abstritt the previous.</seg>
<seg id="4">Just a tweet was sent from my account, I was not authorized.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I do not approve of the tweet and I have deleted it," it said in the message.</seg>
<seg id="6">Employees of Perry responded immediately to requests for comments.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although the tweets of Perry's official account, it was not clear who actually uses the feed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the previous tweet was an unfavourable image of the district attorney of Travis County, Rosemary, Berg, who was sentenced in April 2013 due to drink-driving.</seg>
<seg id="9">Perry put a veto on a financial support of their offices, when they refused to resign, which could be an indictment of Perry - possibly 2016 presidential candidate - led to a grand jury this month in Austin.</seg>
<seg id="10">The text of the tweets: "I'm not always drunk with the triple allowable alcohol level... But if I do, I accuse Governor Perry when he ausplaudert."</seg>
<seg id="11">I am the betrunkenste Democrat in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="12">Clay's office was not entrusted with the leadership on the study of the Grand Jury against Perry.</seg>
<seg id="13">This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was chosen by a Republican judge.</seg>
<seg id="14">Perry pleads not guilty and called the indictment a political trick.</seg>
<seg id="15">His high-class team of legal assistance requested by the judges, the prosecution of the case and argued that the law, which proceeded against the longest-serving governor in the history of the State of Texas, is the version according to diffuse.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perry stopped $7.5 million in state money to the Public Integrity Unit of the state - which is based in Travis County and identified in cases of public corruption in Texas - refused to resign as a mud hill.</seg>
<seg id="17">This veto was a public complaint by a leftist watchdog group.</seg>
<seg id="18">Perry's official account is updated frequently and sometimes famous.</seg>
<seg id="19">After completing the rallies in Iowa during his presidential candidacy in 2012 as the fifth, Perry went on speculation that he will stop by posting a tweet a photo of a jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"</seg>

<seg id="1">Berkeley explains housing again for "normal"</seg>
<seg id="2">One of the most prominent developers of London pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England, "returned to normal levels."</seg>
<seg id="3">Homes in the capital were highly sought-after and subject to huge price increases, which the Bank of England due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble in June led to put limits on mortgage loans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the company, Berkeley said on Monday: "since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013," adding that this is a "stable environment" in action.</seg>
<seg id="5">The housing market in London was set up during the downturn, as well as foreign buyers in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the official cadastre, prices have risen in the last year alone jumped by 18.5 percent, far more than the average rise in England and Wales as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="7">The average selling prices in Berkeleys private, cheap and student offers rose by around a fifth in the past year, and the end of April to £423,000.</seg>
<seg id="8">A stronger pound has made in recent months, however, property in London less attractive to foreign buyers - some of them are also through the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "tax" has been deterred before the general election next May.</seg>
<seg id="9">The London estate agents Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, presented in the tougher lending rules, also in the second half of the year would lead to lower market growth in both the property and prices.</seg>
<seg id="10">New data from the Bank of England on Monday showing a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the housing market cools.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hamptions International, another real estate agency, revised its forecast for the rise in house prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, on the basis of an already faltering Hauspreisbewußtseins.</seg>
<seg id="12">The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London like Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, meanwhile, has fallen by a quarter year on year, so the broker WA Ellis.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital city of Berkeley is a blessing, with the amounts due to date sales to more than £2.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Pidgley added: "the demand for the right, well planned product in the best locations remained stable, and as a result, the date sales have remained stable."</seg>
<seg id="15">In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="16">Annual pre-tax earnings rose by 40 percent to £280 million per year, sales by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a statement on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr Pidgley said that the revenues would be expected for Berkeley in the current year, the current market expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">The analysts estimate £450 million in annual pre-tax earnings.</seg>
<seg id="19">Berkeley shares were fixed at £23.96 in the afternoon trading in London.</seg>

<seg id="1">Exclusive extract from Howard Jacob's hochgelobtem new novel about love and the letter "J."</seg>
<seg id="2">You zerflossen, so the best way to describe it, it could be resolved slowly, like a cardboard box, which has been in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="3">Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, demanding, intense, scratching, and perhaps a little brush.</seg>
<seg id="4">And then he shook their hands.</seg>
<seg id="5">The brush, he knew.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was stachelig, such as hedgehogs, yes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The last victim was just starting this Stacheligkeit affair, which has been promising to alleviate the boredom of his life than he would have otherwise, and perhaps even a degree of satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ailinn solo Mons was a delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart trembling from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.</seg>
<seg id="9">It came with an older accompaniment to the south, considered the Kevern for her aunt, and had inherited a plot in a damp but heavenly valley with the aptly named Paradise Valley.</seg>
<seg id="10">Over several years, no one had lived in the house.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pipes were in the water baths were still spiders, slugs had left their mark on all windows and believed that they belong to all of this, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbage.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was like the house from a children's story, both menacing and enticing, a garden full of secrets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the list for the Man Booker Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">The shortlist will be announced next week.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ailinn Kevern had sat with hands on the broken chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had joined in the spirit of service console, which supplied the country with soothing music and soothing news than the sight of the brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer, happy his father had closed shutters in the house.</seg>
<seg id="16">Your feet are too big.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the basis of their own aggressive songs of this kind were not played on the console.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not banned - nothing was forbidden - simply not played.</seg>
<seg id="19">It has been successfully obsolesziert obsoleszieren as the word.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the general taste, which had never managed decrees and regulations, and how the people in the books From the dishwasher - for a millionaire - memoirs, novels, cookbooks and love for the music they chose the ballads.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the euphoria of the day Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing in a coarse comic serenade Ailinns big feet.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ailinn did not understand this.</seg>
<seg id="23">"This was a well-known song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he said, and automatically presented two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="24">His father had done to stop the letter J, before he came out of his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="25">It began as a game between him and his father, when he was still small.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father had played it with his own father, he had told.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you have a word with a J start without two fingers on your lips, it will cost you a penny.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even then, it was not a very fun game, and even now it was not very funny.</seg>
<seg id="29">He knew that this was all that was expected of him.</seg>
<seg id="30">It had to explain what jazz was.</seg>
<seg id="31">What Ailinn had never heard.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz was, even though he was not directly prohibited, not played.</seg>
<seg id="33">The improvisation was no longer fashionable.</seg>
<seg id="34">There was only room for one "if" in life.</seg>
<seg id="35">The people wanted to be quite sure where it would end up at the beginning of a melody.</seg>
<seg id="36">Likewise, the mind.</seg>
<seg id="37">His unpredictability made people nervous.</seg>
<seg id="38">And jazz was musically expressible mind.</seg>
<seg id="39">Although he was 10 years old, without being heard by Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least he had to explain Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">They probably could not remember her age at a time when the pop singers were not black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again, no laws or constraints.</seg>
<seg id="43">A compliant society meant that each element of this company agreed to the principle of groups like the talent - and grateful to fate.</seg>
<seg id="44">African-American people of Caribbean origin were suited by temperament and conformation for entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran.</seg>
<seg id="45">People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent, were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were charged with ensuring that no family was left without a functioning telephone service.</seg>
<seg id="46">What was left of the Polish community, took care of the sewage system; what was left shattered by the Greeks.</seg>
<seg id="47">Those from the Gulf and the Levant, whose grandparents had left the country soon as WHAT HAPPENED IF THERE IS WAR, WAR happened - for fear of being accused of Feuerschuerens, fearing that the flames would consume the next - had opened Labneh and shisha pipes - restaurants, were given and were depressed by inaction.</seg>
<seg id="48">Each according to his abilities.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since she had heard Ailinn only ballads, it was difficult to understand how the insulting words which had her Kevern, could be just as ever.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music was an expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"We are not really offensive," said Kevern.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except perhaps for people whose feet are too big.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father has never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him a false sense of security.</seg>
<seg id="55">Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the giant cabbage leaves.</seg>
<seg id="56">Ailinn still not understood.</seg>
<seg id="57">Why your father should have something to love?</seg>
<seg id="58">He wanted to say that there was a thump, but hesitated to put two fingers on the lips in their presence.</seg>
<seg id="59">They already thought that he was a little strange.</seg>
<seg id="60">"It appeared to him instead," he said.</seg>
<seg id="61">She shook her head in disbelief and kept Keverns view.</seg>
<seg id="62">There was nothing else in the world to see their ungekaemmtes raven black hair.</seg>
<seg id="63">There was nothing that he otherwise would want to see.</seg>
<seg id="64">"If you say it," they mean without conviction.</seg>
<seg id="65">But this doesn't explain why you vorsingst me.</seg>
<seg id="66">She seemed genuinely concerned.</seg>
<seg id="67">My feet are too big?</seg>
<seg id="68">He saw again.</seg>
<seg id="69">Your feet are not directly.</seg>
<seg id="70">Maybe your ankles, a little bit...</seg>
<seg id="71">And you say you hate me, because my ankles are too thick?</seg>
<seg id="72">You hate?</seg>
<seg id="73">Of course, I do not hate you.</seg>
<seg id="74">This is just the silly song.</seg>
<seg id="75">He could have said "I love you," but it was still too early.</seg>
<seg id="76">"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you think," he tried it instead.</seg>
<seg id="77">I am a bit perverse.</seg>
<seg id="78">That was not correct.</seg>
<seg id="79">It was meant to be funny.</seg>
<seg id="80">When he tried to be funny, he was often in trouble because he did not like his father about the soothing charm, needed to restrain the cruelty inherent in jokes.</seg>
<seg id="81">Perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Perhaps he wanted to be the Kevern.</seg>
<seg id="83">Despite his friendly eyes.</seg>
<seg id="84">Ailinn solo Mons was red and arose out of her chair, threw the console and buried the wine that they had drunk.</seg>
<seg id="85">Elderberry flower wine, so it was no excuse for drunkenness.</seg>
<seg id="86">They seemed to tremble in their excitement, such as palm fronds in the storm.</seg>
<seg id="87">"And your thick head is exactly the reason why I am perverse to you," she said.</seg>
<seg id="88">Except that I am not at all.</seg>
<seg id="89">It did him tired, both because of the unnecessary cost of his words as well as the fear that was demonstrated in their eyes when they rebelled against him.</seg>
<seg id="90">She thought that he would beat them?</seg>
<seg id="91">She had not told him of the life on the cold northern archipelago, where she was raised, but he had no doubt that it was essentially as here.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same huge and icy ocean broke here and there on the shore.</seg>
<seg id="93">The same men who have been confused with a thicker skin and verdrießlicher, WHAT HAPPENED TO WAR than were their ancestors as smugglers and wreckers, went from pub to pub, always ready to raise a hand against a woman who refused or derided.</seg>
<seg id="94">Thick head?</seg>
<seg id="95">It would have shown her a thick fist when they don't care!</seg>
<seg id="96">They only canoodle - Deathstar was the word most often used for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the bland love ballads from the console - and then they laughed.</seg>
<seg id="97">The Keverns view was an unnecessary refinement, as was the Deathstar itself an act of violence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Ailinn solo Mons gave him to go through her body a sign.</seg>
<seg id="99">He arose from the deckchair as an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She also felt bleiern, but she was surprised by the ferocity of his grief.</seg>
<seg id="101">That was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They hardly knew, however.</seg>
<seg id="103">She saw him on how he removed as from a room on the upper floor of their companion - a man who complained to him by what he had created himself.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam leaves the garden, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against them.</seg>
<seg id="106">A man, she turned back, ashamed to be defeated without fighting spirit - why was this a sight seemed to know them well, if they could not remember a single time, but they had seen something before the day before?</seg>
<seg id="107">When she was alone again, looked Ailinn solo Mons on her feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">A number of years before the events worked just told Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher commissioned by Ofnow, the non-legislative body for the public mood, in a brief presentation on the continued violence on low and middle level in the areas of the country where the reduction, if not abolished, will most likely have been expected, given the money and energy that had been invested in the eradication of violence.</seg>
<seg id="109">"A lot done, and much still needs to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that had a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness historically seen despite the towering spires between the hedges was rarely felt.</seg>
<seg id="110">But some properties are ineradicable.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the steeple, it seems, the less the passion that he continues to inspire.</seg>
<seg id="112">The people weep when listening to sentimental ballads, enthralled claims to overcome difficulties and stories about the virtues of marriage and family life, but does not believe only the former rudeness of rural communities, as well as our urban fabric firmly in the hands, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and insidious argument is looking at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playing fields.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration," said her mentor, when he had read the entire report.</seg>
<seg id="114">I suggest that you read less novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">ESME Nussbaum lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask: are you atheist?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I think I have to say," said Esme Nussbaum.</seg>
<seg id="118">Are you a lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Esme was once again on their right to privacy and refusal to testify.</seg>
<seg id="120">Feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I am not asking this," said Luther Rabinowitz, finally, "because I would be against atheism, Lesbentum or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">This is a prejudice free workplace.</seg>
<seg id="124">We serve a prejudice free society.</seg>
<seg id="125">But certain types of hypersensitivity that are absolutely unacceptable and commendable in itself, can occasionally results, as you have presented to distort them.</seg>
<seg id="126">You obviously have prejudices against the church, and these things that you describe as "cowardly" and "raw" could be interpreted by others as well, of course, as an expression of strength and vitality.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you ride around on WHAT IS IF THERE IS, as if it would have happened if it had happened yesterday, means the country's essential vitality.</seg>
<seg id="128">ESME Nussbaum looked around, while Rabinowitz said.</seg>
<seg id="129">Behind his head repeated a LED sticker in Flamingo pink Ofnow the advice that gave the country in the last quarter of a century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">Smile, you appreciate their neighbors, their partners, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, you talk, you listen, you agree to apologize.</seg>
<seg id="131">Speaking is better than silence, the song is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I understand completely what you want," said Esme Nussbaum with a quiet voice, when she was sure that her boss had spoken to an end, "and I say that we are not yet healed as effective as we delude ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">My concern is that we find ourselves without warning, perhaps, as we repeat the mistakes in the first place, IF THERE IS THIS WHAT IS.</seg>
<seg id="134">This time, however, it is not others where we miss our anger and our mistrust.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Rabinowitz, a pyramid with hands.</seg>
<seg id="136">In order to indicate a patient.</seg>
<seg id="137">"They go too far," he said, "if you act as a" mistake "that our grandparents may or may not have committed.</seg>
<seg id="138">They also go too far when you say that their "anger" and their "mistrust" of "others" had left out.</seg>
<seg id="139">It should not really be necessary to remind someone in your position that we understand the past, such as the protection of the present, not by "us" and "other."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "we" and there was no "other."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of disorder, that is all we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"If we are honest with ourselves," dared to Esme, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.</seg>
<seg id="143">I accuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it was done badly or well, what has happened has happened.</seg>
<seg id="145">That was then.</seg>
<seg id="146">Nothing more needs to be said - we are all agreed.</seg>
<seg id="147">And just as no blame must be assigned, it must be repaid, not to blame, if such a repayment would be appropriate and if there were a way to eradicate it.</seg>
<seg id="148">But what if we do not learn from the past -</seg>
<seg id="149">The past is that we forget them.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I may say something about that -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther Rabinowitz did coincide his pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I will remember her report," he said, and dismissed them.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, when she went to work as usual, was run over by a motorcyclist, who, as passers-by described, in a kind of "brutal rage" was driven onto the footpath.</seg>
<seg id="154">There are coincidences.</seg>

<seg id="1">Production in the euro area on a 13-month low</seg>
<seg id="2">The increase in production in the eurozone slowed in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months, a closely watched study.</seg>
<seg id="3">The final Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a stand of 51.8 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">An indication of 50 gives an expansion.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders went back and saw factories at a time of rising tension, between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The figures come before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The markets expect the bank a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery of the eurozone and the threat of deflation with an inflation rate of just 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could make further details later this week if he draws a quantitative easing for the eurozone, according to those who have been made by Britain and the U.S. during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although a small growth is better than no growth, have become the restraining effects of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties for the manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.</seg>
<seg id="10">The factory PMI for Germany, the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months, with 51.4.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the meantime, the second largest economy of the bloc, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.</seg>
<seg id="12">France remains a problem child, as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Indications that growth incentives in key industrial machinery, as well as in Spain, Germany and the Netherlands are also not reassuring, "said Mr Dobson.</seg>
<seg id="14">The decline in the industry is fueling the fire of the analysts expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.</seg>
<seg id="15">Good news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.</seg>
<seg id="16">Howard Archer, chief economics expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "the best thing that can be said for the purchasing managers index of manufacturing in the euro area in August, is that the sector continues to grow."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "producers in the eurozone find life difficult at the moment, obviously, since the current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine - continue to increase uncertainties in the difficult conditions in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and probably lead to some contracts being delayed or even cancelled, especially large contracts.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said that it is "increasingly likely" that the ECB should launch a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."</seg>

<seg id="9">We found surprising young people who have overcome the resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will pursue them forever.</seg>
<seg id="10">Their best hope?</seg>
<seg id="11">The war that has plagued Ukraine - and the children as they die - is now at an end.</seg>

<seg id="16">"A woman told me that I should run for my life, but I could not," said Aida.</seg>
<seg id="17">My legs were bloodied.</seg>
<seg id="18">I stood up and climbed again, to search for my mother.</seg>
<seg id="19">A soldier brought her to safety.</seg>
<seg id="20">After a series of operations, she was healed completely, but said yesterday: "three months ago, the pain returned.</seg>

<seg id="25">"This has happened to me, and that cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="26">I always go to the gym once a year to remember those who have stayed there.</seg>
<seg id="27">My friends and I try not to talk on other days.</seg>
<seg id="28">The pain is too great.</seg>
<seg id="29">My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.</seg>
<seg id="30">We played together, when we were small, and dreamed of going to school together.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I don't want to marry until I finish my studies and my career will begin.</seg>

<seg id="33">She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, although the memory of every year something weak.</seg>
<seg id="34">I am glad that many people in the world, to our horror, and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="35">The online photo of me when I see how I zurueckklettere in school, I think that many people see it for the first time, our disaster and help to understand that this does not happen again.</seg>
<seg id="36">The boy, who fled through the bullets, in the opinion of his mother is dead</seg>
<seg id="37">It was his first day of school (Russians go with 7 years in school) and survived the siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.</seg>
<seg id="38">When, he said: "Mama has told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold their hand."</seg>
<seg id="39">After an explosion, he thought she would die.</seg>
<seg id="40">She said to him: "run."</seg>
<seg id="41">Terrified that it could be dead, he fled and saw on the way to a baby, it took at hand and fled through a hail of bullets.</seg>
<seg id="42">His father, Vladimir, who completed his son out into the arms, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.</seg>
<seg id="43">He said: "I could not save them."</seg>
<seg id="44">In reality, Tamara was stumbled outside and leg injuries in the hospital, in turn, on the assumption that her son had died.</seg>
<seg id="45">After its reunification, she said: "I wept for joy.</seg>
<seg id="46">I couldn't believe it.</seg>
<seg id="47">He ran and hugged me.</seg>
<seg id="48">Damir was flown to London (from the now dissolved newspaper News of the World), by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion.</seg>
<seg id="49">"This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop the remembering," he said yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="50">But I can say that it is in my memory.</seg>
<seg id="51">I know that I then threw all my toy guns.</seg>
<seg id="52">But now I can play computer games with shot scenes, and that is not a problem for me.</seg>
<seg id="53">"I am not afraid to go back into the gym, but I do not think about myself.</seg>
<seg id="54">I remember these children, with whom I have played in the courtyard, and which have failed.</seg>
<seg id="55">We never say that they have been killed or are dead.</seg>
<seg id="56">We say that they have remained in the sports hall.</seg>
<seg id="57">I remember very well my trip to London, especially in the toy shop, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the journey in an open top car.</seg>
<seg id="58">But now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine, where wars are causing the kind of accident that he and his friends suffered.</seg>
<seg id="59">This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop to remember.</seg>
<seg id="60">"I am so sorry to all those who suffer from the horrors," said Damir, worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.</seg>
<seg id="61">I am so happy to help.</seg>
<seg id="62">I hope one day will go to the police and take me to the training academy next year.</seg>
<seg id="63">His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine that?</seg>
<seg id="64">I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there was simply no children who were able to create and run around, and this silence lasted for many months.</seg>
<seg id="65">She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.</seg>
<seg id="66">The people wept in London, when I told our story.</seg>
<seg id="67">I then understood how people can understand on the other side of the world our feelings, and show their support.</seg>
<seg id="68">She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="69">I wish I could call and tell her own Cherie that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting of her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and helped me.</seg>
<seg id="70">I remember how Damir wanted to eat borsch and they all cried local Russian restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="71">I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot with his water gun on them and they ran away and played with him.</seg>
<seg id="72">And that was just one month after the horror.</seg>
<seg id="73">I was surprised that the British so readily shared our pain and supported us.</seg>
<seg id="74">She said: "I always think that this world is not better in these 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="75">The war in Ukraine is now, and people are dying every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and killed.</seg>
<seg id="76">These are precisely the kind of children like ours.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think that for many of the war is a part of the news that they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.</seg>
<seg id="78">I know what these people simply feel that the whole horror.</seg>
<seg id="79">And I can't stop it, to feel that.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.</seg>
<seg id="82">For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past horrors.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like it, but he has six close friends from the class and sometimes they go into the gym and ignite candles there.</seg>
<seg id="84">He suffered when he was small, including - I remember how he sometimes put on the sofa, turned the face of us for hours.</seg>
<seg id="85">Not sleeping, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that I was a few hours so sure he was dead and I would never see him again.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I came to me after the explosion, and on its feet, I saw myself, and saw the hell around me, with all the body parts.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely sure that my little boy could have survived in this hell impossible.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember that I called him," Damir, "but I was so sure that he had not heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he has heard it and he ran away.</seg>
<seg id="92">And so goes the life, unlike many others, for us.</seg>
<seg id="93">Georgi Ilyin, 17</seg>
<seg id="94">The boy, whose terrible image after the siege was a symbol of the horrors of Beslan</seg>
<seg id="95">Consolation: the Beslan survivors Georgi Lyin with his mother, Fatima, 2004, right after the siege of Georgi today</seg>
<seg id="96">His blutueberstroemtes face was marked by fear when he ran for his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.</seg>
<seg id="97">His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="98">His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dismissed him for his first day of school before they rushed to get their older son Vladimir to university.</seg>
<seg id="99">"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and my little boy remained there for three terrible days alone," she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="100">Not alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.</seg>
<seg id="101">Only my Georgi managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="102">As the date draws nearer, the harder it is to remember and to talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="103">There is no single day that we do not remember this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We do not think that it is a long time ago, I think it would have happened yesterday, I am constantly watching some scenes from these days.</seg>
<seg id="105">Nobody will ever forget, I promise you.</seg>
<seg id="106">Urgent: the image of Georgi (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).</seg>
<seg id="107">I remember that wanted to go to school, so keen on this day. He said that he wanted to embrace his teacher.</seg>
<seg id="108">I only knew that he was alive, when I saw him on television.</seg>
<seg id="109">And now there is even a statue of the weeping Georgi in San Marino.</seg>
<seg id="110">Georgy does not look like the picture, and it is hidden at home with us on the bookshelf.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand that, but I also think that people around the world feel our pain, thanks to this image.</seg>
<seg id="112">Georgy today says: "it is important that this can never happen again.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt that we ever learn the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">People constantly examine such tragedies and never learn the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">And now they are investigating the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Will we ever know what caused it?</seg>
<seg id="117">The horror of this world becomes something.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I cannot understand how this is possible, because if you ask the people, nobody wants a war, so how is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing in such pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need dozens of years to forget about it a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="121">It has attacked my health and I feel it still.</seg>
<seg id="122">About three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it was better.</seg>
<seg id="123">Later in 2004, I went back to school and had scared every day.</seg>
<seg id="124">I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="125">That is why I always go to the gym, when the 1th of September.</seg>
<seg id="126">I want to pay my tribute to my old childhood friends.</seg>
<seg id="127">It is hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.</seg>
<seg id="128">I do not feel as victims, this story is now a part of my past.</seg>
<seg id="129">I will not forget it, but I am not sorry.</seg>
<seg id="130">My life goes on.</seg>
<seg id="131">I have concluded the school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz.</seg>
<seg id="132">I will be a heart surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="133">My first choice was a training in the army.</seg>
<seg id="134">I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not.</seg>
<seg id="135">I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="136">Georgi Fanijew, 20</seg>
<seg id="137">The boy, who survived, even though he was caught at the feet of murderous terrorists</seg>
<seg id="138">A miracle: Georgi Fanijew was trapped during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="139">During the siege, he was captured in the hall and sat next to the bomb, which was mounted at the feet of murderous terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="140">It is really a miracle that he was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">"We feel it as if it were yesterday," says Georgi, who wanted to go as an intelligence officer in the FSB, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.</seg>
<seg id="142">It is still with me, it is nothing that I have left behind me.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am older now and people say that children can deal easily with terrible experiences - I have to say that is not true.</seg>
<seg id="144">"I worked with 2006 psychologists and then actually felt a little better, but I cannot forget it.</seg>
<seg id="145">And I would like to forget.</seg>
<seg id="146">2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back into the gym.</seg>
<seg id="147">I lost consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="148">I will never go back there and please do not ask me to show you where I have sat in this famous image.</seg>
<seg id="149">Philippa: Georgi Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop</seg>
<seg id="150">My pain is enormous and I wear it every day with me.</seg>
<seg id="151">My friends know that I do not like to think or talk about and they never asked me after school.</seg>
<seg id="152">Physically, it is good to me.</seg>
<seg id="153">I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can now run well.</seg>
<seg id="154">But because of my health, I was unable to study at the FSB secret service academy in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted.</seg>
<seg id="155">I have my papers submitted to the medical and they replied that it was not possible.</seg>
<seg id="156">My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have been there two years behind me.</seg>
<seg id="158">He learns the treatment of all animals, from cats to cows. "</seg>
<seg id="159">He said: "I knew that I would never tell my children from my experience.</seg>
<seg id="160">Children should not know about it and they should not suffer, of course.</seg>
<seg id="161">His mother Marina, 42, said: "this pain never leaves me.</seg>
<seg id="162">In my soul, it is worse when the anniversary.</seg>
<seg id="163">I will go to the celebration of the memory.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know that will not go in.</seg>
<seg id="165">It must be even more intense for him, because he was not there and I.</seg>
<seg id="166">I waited for him at home and could not help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. All of them are here in Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="168">It remains to us.</seg>
<seg id="169">Georgy is now an adult, but he is still in this horror.</seg>
<seg id="170">It is hard to accept that if something happened to be business-friendly.</seg>
<seg id="171">He is a boy, he likes sport because of his knee, but he is unable.</seg>
<seg id="172">He has been operated on several occasions, he can run, but no sport.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that he has overcome the horror of 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget.</seg>
<seg id="174">This terrible experience will always follow.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and that only reinforces my pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I have lost a lot of people who I knew well and were expensive to me.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart cries for the slain.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know of families in which children were born, but also of widows who have never married.</seg>
<seg id="179">It is difficult to accept that life goes on, even if this is not.</seg>
<seg id="180">I will never forget how I jumped in my heart when I saw him in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="181">And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.</seg>
<seg id="182">These people are fighting for what?</seg>
<seg id="183">Why do they kill each other?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is now very close to our country and I cannot believe this.</seg>
<seg id="185">We were a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?</seg>
<seg id="186">People are suffering and children, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many more are being killed.</seg>
<seg id="187">If we could only throw up all these rebels - as far away as possible.</seg>

<seg id="192">In 2004, the world held their breath as the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="193">The terrorists thought they would go, but in their cruelty, their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.</seg>
<seg id="194">Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.</seg>
<seg id="195">Since then, her father Ruslan has married again and with his new wife, Svetlana, a little girl that he called after his lost daughter Kristina.</seg>
<seg id="196">Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips for better pictures and videos</seg>
<seg id="2">If you want to make photos or videos under water, there are a variety of devices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is a waterproof Point and Shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or Action Cam, such as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, which are both for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took these photos with a family celebration with several cameras, which are all available at a price of less than $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Check your equipment twice.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery pack and other subjects are closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">Put your camera on the photos or videos that you want to get in.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some cameras and camcorders have scenes and recording, which optimizes the exposure time for the underwater twilight conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump into it, check until the depth of your equipment.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are allowed only for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Browse our buyers and the ratings for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Take multiple shots - because not many fold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Point and shoot cameras have a LCD, with which you can compose images, not normally action cams.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to see under water, and the right picture setting is a matter of chance.</seg>
<seg id="16">So make a lot of shots.</seg>
<seg id="17">If your camera has a row mode, which made a series of recordings with slightly altered exposure settings, you can use it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay near the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The light is dramatically worse, ever further away from the surface.</seg>
<seg id="20">If so, you can stay close to the surface, if you are shooting in a pool, a lake or the sea.</seg>
<seg id="21">This allows you to bring more color in your photos; the deeper you go, the less you will see color.</seg>
<seg id="22">Go close to the objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important because of the poor lighting conditions under water.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is particularly important if you are working with an Action Cam: these devices often have a wide-angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill the whole picture.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort, whose character changed things, even in such a huge organisation like the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="2">He spent his career as a consulting anesthetist the task of the sick to avoid both the agony of the disease as well as the agony of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among his patients, remembers his wife, was a MI6 employee, who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that the doctors are important diagnoses and diseases, while the cases mostly with something quite different: pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">But one day in 2007, he was the one who started his ordeal.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have not felt," he wrote in May of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I had difficulties to pick me up.</seg>
<seg id="8">While he fought with the flu similar symptoms, he noticed that he made his wife Juliet impatient accusations.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want everything immediately rather than later," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Juliet for a week on a business trip, felt disturbed by Lawson, unusually, and without reason.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was in the air.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague to carry out a radiograph of his chest.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks ago, he was in the French Alps for skiing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The result of the radiograph was before.</seg>
<seg id="15">He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer of the breast skin, attacking the skin covering the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="16">As with most cancers is usually difficult to determine the exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">While some smokers with lung cancer, for example, have been previously diagnosed with lung cancer, not all smokers.</seg>
<seg id="18">But mesothelioma is different.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases, the trigger of asbestos contamination - contact with the fiber material, which was once called the "miracle material" but was recognized as lethal.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us mesothelioma is a disease that is easy to ignore.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos is a product of the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type was not used in Britain since the 1960 s, when the industry voluntarily committed itself to not using this.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even where it was used, only people worked directly with the material in certain sectors - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">As an industrial risk material from another time, he hardly seems to be worrying.</seg>
<seg id="25">But complacency is misplaced.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it seems, is the culmination of a Mesoltheliom epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.</seg>
<seg id="28">With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease than in road accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">Annual figures of Mesotheliomtodesfaelle since 1980 and likely future deaths in Britain</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason why we see the deadly effects of asbestos for years now, even though it is illegal (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999), is that after decades of a mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="31">And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was and still is often found in the houses in which we live, the offices we work in, the schools where we learn and the shops where we shop.</seg>
<seg id="33">And that is why mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limitations, professions or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not protected.</seg>
<seg id="35">The buildings are contaminated with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, have been identified as a result of this deadly Karzinogens.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was also not a plumber.</seg>
<seg id="39">In fact, it was difficult to imagine where he could possibly have come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he found out.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It looks as if the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years, there was a lot of asbestos." He wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All students, nurses, doctors and porter - use the tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="43">One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same illness?</seg>
<seg id="44">Unfortunately he was unable to answer this question, at least in part.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital, and in the last five years, mesothelioma patients," he wrote in a 2010 letter, "I am the last one is still alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us will fall ill?</seg>
<seg id="47">When Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">It was an unusually long time.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">The disease always ends fatally.</seg>
<seg id="52">We can therefore only reiterate Lawson's question: "how many of us will fall ill?"</seg>
<seg id="53">The UK's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to come to a standstill, will be a total of 90,000 fallen victim to the disease.</seg>
<seg id="54">At the moment, most of them have no idea that they will die.</seg>
<seg id="55">An asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada Alamy</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick glance at the files of the courts, which often turn for claims, shows how widespread the scourge of Mesothelioms already.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, Janice Allen negligently exposed to asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department in two locations - one of the flagship in Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs. Allen was only 18 years when she began her career at M.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now she has two children in their twenties.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I don't really knew anything about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="62">I never thought that I would deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="63">There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="64">The fact is that the concept of asbestos is a substance, but a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">The name comes from the word "Asbestiform," a description of the fiber structure, which makes the fabric resistant and flexible.</seg>
<seg id="66">Three of the six were used in construction.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile asbestos, also known as white asbestos is now by far the most frequently found asbestos in buildings.</seg>
<seg id="68">It was on the floor of plates, pipe insulation, boiler insulations, used even for brake pads in cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but by the EU and the WHO as a "great risk" with possible casualties.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "it's clear, but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high Mesotheliomraten."</seg>
<seg id="72">An employee of Marks & Spencer was in store in Oxford Street, London, exposed to asbestos Alamy</seg>
<seg id="73">Janice Allen may not be seen as a typical Mesotheliomopfer, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that their story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He presented a study of those affected, showing that "a significant proportion of mesotheliomia without well-known suspension was caused by work or home, presumably by asbestos exposure in the environment."</seg>
<seg id="75">A large part of these contacts is based his statement on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.</seg>
<seg id="76">It seems that no one could expect to be safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">A report by Goddard Consulting, which studied the palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government have been unknowingly exposed to the substance may be.</seg>
<seg id="78">2009 Goddard reported that the service shafts were contaminated and pipes behind the committee rooms of the Parliament, whose deadly asbestos fibres could be caused by something as harmless as "strong" air movements.</seg>
<seg id="79">MEPs are often accused of looking after their own interests, but here it looks as if the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="80">While the management of the Parliamentary Labor Service that the Westminster Palace have received a "clean" health certificate, it is now indisputable that must be raised to £1 billion over several years to renovate Parliament to modernise the electrical installations and to remove the asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election will meet members of the QE2 conference centre in nearby rather than on the green benches in Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions."</seg>
<seg id="82">No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All we can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">A person who was able to determine the exposure to asbestos is never exactly Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="85">Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott believed that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I worked in a hospital in the asbestos lawsuits were decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It is so difficult to remember all the places where we worked, and to the data.</seg>
<seg id="88">He still remembers the day in early December 2009, in which he got a kind of fever.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was just 45, and led an operation by late evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly, I had chills.</seg>
<seg id="91">It came suddenly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible.</seg>
<seg id="93">I thought not to create the ride home.</seg>
<seg id="94">As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain from the chest skin, the skin around his lungs came around.</seg>
<seg id="95">But, like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="96">He was not a month to work.</seg>
<seg id="97">Doctors were surprised to see Pleurakathether x-rays of his chest and put fluid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="98">His complaints, however, remained without a diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">His health is slowly, and he returned to his job.</seg>
<seg id="100">However, the symptoms returned from time to time, often after physical activity and heavy breathing.</seg>
<seg id="101">Abbott's 2011 came with similar symptoms a patient in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="102">But even now, Abbott is not his own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">After all, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">The connection was clear in the case.</seg>
<seg id="105">Abbott's condition deteriorated again in September 2011 and his family doctor brought his CT scans and x-rays to a group of experts.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after the first time Abbott had felt ill, introduced a camera equipped with a probe into the cave between the ribs and chest fur.</seg>
<seg id="107">I am an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I usually just go, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="109">Frankly, I had made so many concerns.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife, was worried.</seg>
<seg id="111">The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year's Day: "I was told that it was mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham Abbott: diagnosis of mesothelioma</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom he recommended taking a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">Only now he realized the extent of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turned out that asbestos was spread very far, especially in large public buildings, which were often isolated pipes with asbestos," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings, now become ill.</seg>
<seg id="117">And so mesothelioma is now younger people who have not worked in the professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were under the earth, so patients were more likely to be exposed to the substance.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees, who alternated in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson), or in underground canteens (as did Graham Abbott often), most likely came into contact with toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">It turns out that for several decades after the war were hospitals for patients may be lifesaving, but life-threatening for the treating physicians.</seg>
<seg id="121">It will still be removed.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students showed their bunsenburner asbestos mats.</seg>
<seg id="123">And it is not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls.</seg>
<seg id="125">Even schools.</seg>
<seg id="126">Indeed, many people probably have had the first contact with asbestos in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="127">Across the country, thousands of hours of chemistry students have parked their bunsenburner on asbestos mats.</seg>
<seg id="128">The website is now often mentioned the issue of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">And, meanwhile, have included innocent objects in our homes, such as floor plates or scales by default asbestos roofs.</seg>
<seg id="130">"It is an industrial poison that is contained in large parts of our properties," said Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who has represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case, was the only contact the women affected by the demolition of a Gartenschuppens in the 1970 s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So you have to be careful how you tear off your garden shed.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.</seg>
<seg id="134">"It takes a while to digest," says Graham Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't concentrate on what I did.</seg>
<seg id="136">I was two weeks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I knew that I had to go and take care of myself.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I will not see another Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="139">With the greatest difficulty was the change from the position of a doctor to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">Like countless patients before him, he recalls how he was overwhelmed by all the information with which he had to come.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was very difficult to include everything," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked my doctor," how long do I have? "</seg>
<seg id="143">And you gave me about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember that I thought, "well, I will not see another Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's it. ""</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life conservation mechanism - breathing itself - is that caused the deadly cancer.</seg>
<seg id="147">The majority of cases of mesothelioma caused by exposure to asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is composed of tiny fibres.</seg>
<seg id="149">If the asbestos is kicked up and the fibres are inhaled, they can in the breast skin, the skin around the lungs, set.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibres irritate the skin and can cause breast cell mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem arises with the needle of inhaled asbestos fibres," says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart / thorax doctor, who moved in 2001 to the Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="152">Just the hospital, which Andrew Lawson, that he has exposed to asbestos, is now, ironically, a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="153">Treasure knew Lawson and several others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">Once the asbestos needles are pressed from the tissue, says Treasure, "breathing process to the edge, where the skin.</seg>
<seg id="155">From the outset, it is inherently invasive.</seg>
<seg id="156">The usual options for other cancers do not work so well with mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="157">For example, the effectiveness of an operation is controversial.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some say that it was worth a try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Treasure denies this.</seg>
<seg id="160">"You can't cut out the breast coat," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">They do not come with the knife around it.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, the cancer "does not speak very well to chemotherapy," the "effect," but not cure.</seg>
<seg id="163">"Sometimes there is a long time to live," says Treasure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But in the end they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after Graham Abbott is still fighting its own diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he contacted mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had four years after his diagnosis, an one-man support and consultancy for Mitbetroffene.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Hello, cancer central," he said, happily on calls.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="171">He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.</seg>
<seg id="172">Abbott had originally offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which is expected to take four months and would prolong his life only a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was desperate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, was "the things in a more positive light."</seg>
<seg id="176">Following the advice of several doctors decided Abbott, his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang - Lazdunski, heart specialist at the thorax Guy "s.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage because I had to be referred to, I just cried and got an appointment," Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">A normal patient would have to receive a payment and have to wait for the approval of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money is crucial for mesothelioma - sufferers, in order to be able to perform the best available therapies.</seg>
<seg id="180">But if these treatments fail, eventually, inevitably, many of those affected by another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.</seg>
<seg id="181">And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But what changed in the 1960 s that recognized that was also a very low burden of a health risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital, in their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full compensation" because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma at Guy's was due to an asbestos exposure.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation into his death was confirmed by a spokesman of Guy's, however, that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the basement area in the 1990 s."</seg>
<seg id="188">It was too late for Andrew Lawson.</seg>
<seg id="189">How can be removed asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, it is seeking compensation for sufferers of mesothelioma, an enormous problem, the deadly asbestos contact a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance documents can be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who defend themselves against claims, know that the time for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, there were significant new legislation this year, which makes it easier for mesothelioma - to enforce compensation, even if their previous employers are more.</seg>
<seg id="195">The law has set up a fund of £350 million funded by the insurance industry for those who have been diagnosed after July 2012, can prove a contact, but no one can sue.</seg>
<seg id="196">In these cases, the plaintiffs will receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal compensation process could grant them - about £120,000.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful applications in the program are expected per year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan thinks that, like so many mesothelioma - £350 million a "very good work" of the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if it ignored the time and mesothelioma patients - and they could sue the company.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Penning, former labor and pension minister, admitted that the law "not perfect."</seg>
<seg id="201">But both Penning and Morgan admitted that rapid action is needed in the face of seven deaths every day.</seg>
<seg id="202">"The people are suffering so much and now need help," said Penning during the second hearing of the mesothelioma Act in December of last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">At that point was Graham Abbott for 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang - Lazdunski.</seg>
<seg id="204">After their first meeting, Lang - Lazdunski an operation, which he expects in contrast to Tom Treasure, a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was accompanied by a radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy, with Lang - Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.</seg>

<seg id="207">"This is, of course, the most important thing," says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="208">Time and again, we see in patients.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is something that you can move on.</seg>
<seg id="210">If you are going, you very quickly get worse.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">At the end of August, he had the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">After concern scans showed no signs of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had a scan in March 2014.</seg>
<seg id="215">There were several cancer spots around my chest.</seg>

<seg id="217">That is not life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="218">This is lebensbeendend.</seg>
<seg id="219">Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">No trace of the tumors is now more visible.</seg>
<seg id="221">But the process is physically and mentally exhausting.</seg>
<seg id="222">You have to think about practical things - about money when I am not, for example, or my wife, as the boiler works time.</seg>
<seg id="223">If you receive bad news, you will be negative.</seg>
<seg id="224">You have to look to the future.</seg>

<seg id="1">China denies Hong Kong right to government election, protesters swear vengeance</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday, the Chinese parliament despite the increased calls for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.</seg>
<seg id="3">This approach probably fueled the protests in Hong Kong's business district, announced during the planning and mobilization of activists, within a few hours after the announcement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders in principle, not to reject all candidates loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, leader of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">That is not what Beijing had promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They have lied to the people of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">In his defence of China's decision, said Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, that the approval of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government to "chaotic."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese control, Beijing has promised the residents from 2017 to choose the government seat.</seg>
<seg id="11">China's leaders on Sunday presented the decision as a democratic breakthrough, because it gives the people of Hong Kong a direct vote, but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the process through a nomination committee tightly controlled by Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to a new clause only candidates should also "love of country and love Hong Kong" to be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most effective public protests in Hong Kong for several years.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement in Hong Kong behind the pro-democracy campaign, whose organizers have threatened to seal off the financial district if Beijing allows no genuine universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">Within a few hours after the announcement on Sunday night had hundreds of Occupy Central's supporters gathered in the rain before the government headquarters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="16">During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience, and they planned to protest waves in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">They did, however, no details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In an online statement, the organizers of the movement "has learned that the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that should take place only when all dialogue possibilities have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We are sorry to say that today all dialogue possibilities have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will take place.</seg>
<seg id="20">The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for days for the announcement of Beijing, and tighter security measures including police and government buildings were on Sunday in front of the barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unrest is exacerbated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control of their city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of people from the mainland increased the competition for products and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, there is growing fear that Hong Kong's values such as democracy and freedom of speech are starting to crumble under growing pressure from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement, because they are the lifeblood of Hong Kong's business - is.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protests, which they say, could cause major economic damage, depending on how many people are involved in it and how long they persist," said legal expert Regine Ip, who criticised the movement for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="26">We do not want to stoke fears that Hong Kong gets out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This impression is bad for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">China's state-controlled media also reported recently on democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral rights, which were attended by 780,000 people - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="30">In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists criticise race and police behavior after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">The unarmed teenager was at the beginning of this month, killed by a police officer in Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="3">The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "hands up, don't shoot," while they waited for the funeral.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">After their experience white feminist commentators put the sex before the race, when it comes to reproductive rights and to address income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">While tensions rose in the Midwest, and received attention throughout the country, saw Perez that turned the responses of white women, 100% of the race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared with the responses of black women shortly after the shots of 9 August, the personal essays with titles like "thoughts on Ferguson from a white woman" and "feminism is not just about the oppression of women" relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Perez meant an important change.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I do not think that many people in feminism, and talk about the white privileges on the high-class kind," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The people felt pushed to express something about the incidents.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is characteristic of the crisis we are facing and because the situation in Ferguson is ethnicized so that they have to say.</seg>
<seg id="12">For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems faced by black women every day, but not be seen as "women's issues" in the cultural area.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere," said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">If I post something about how people are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.</seg>
<seg id="15">"How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about safety in public spaces?" She asked.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women, such as Mitchell, race, gender and sexuality have studied in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender issues.</seg>
<seg id="17">For black women, they have not had the luxury of separating the issues of clean; they live every day in the combined reality.</seg>
<seg id="18">While the issues of race and gender combine white women in the feminist mainstream circles, says Angela Hattery, professor of women and at the George Mason University that their predecessors did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"At least 10,000 black men were lynched between 1865 and 1890, and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="20">White women had to be involved in the story to justify the Lynch murder.</seg>
<seg id="21">For Hattery came the division between white and black women at the point where white fighters for women such as Susan B. Anthony the country in the late years of the 19th century, and that could be the fight for the right to vote only for one group: women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They took the decision to stand up for women's suffrage, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="23">If such things are remembered, one with power, why don't trust women of color white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have not done our job well.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after 1920 women were given the right to vote, it took a decade to get organized, white women against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.</seg>
<seg id="27">The group was founded almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - a mirror of the times in which white feminists played "catch" with the problems of black women for generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to a child's education as seriously as they do with the right to conception control?" Asked Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="30">The second generation of feminists, who built their careers on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, try to understand what that means.</seg>
<seg id="31">The familiar white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pithy article by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian, which calls for more protests on the issue of racism by white Americans.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope that women who have a different, but parallel reason to understand the danger inherent in the body - and opinions on the race, which are significantly different in public opinion polls - will lead the changes," Steinem wrote.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Steinem stands for a more intersectional feminism, which raises the race as well as gender issues are perplexed by some of their comments on the racial issue in America.</seg>
<seg id="34">Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "who Stole Feminism?" Said to She The People, that young men in the United States, in particular young men of color, "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinems comments on Ferguson, in contrast to their previous criticism.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">But when the White House recently a small program, My Brother's Keeper, clapped in order to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were infuriating reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.</seg>
<seg id="37">The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is at the forefront of mainstream feminism.</seg>
<seg id="38">After the U.S. border police took up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the southwest border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform comes to the surface again - this time as a women's issue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Andrea Mercado, Co Chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes the women for immigration reform, said that the issue as a key issue for women it must publish the stories of immigrant women.</seg>
<seg id="40">"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the vast majority of working visas, male immigrants, are the women who accompany them in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="42">"These stories find an echo in the women's organisations," she said.</seg>

<seg id="4">The devastating Ebola epidemic puts a severe blow to the economy of West Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The harvest rots in the fields, the mines are abandoned and orphaned the markets - the virus has afflicted the region difficult.</seg>
<seg id="6">Some international companies are already at a distance.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The Ebola epidemic is not just a medical crisis, but also an economic one," the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.</seg>
<seg id="8">Liberia is the hardest hit</seg>
<seg id="9">"It is a total disaster, we are losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sold on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.</seg>
<seg id="10">Anyone who wants to buy food only comes on the market, or something to disinfect against Ebola.</seg>
<seg id="11">Liberia has been hardest hit by the virus, alone, fell victim to the fever of more than 600 people.</seg>
<seg id="12">Health officials recently declared that the disease had penetrated every corner of the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">The virus has spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="14">A total of more than 1500 people have died, thousands more are stuck in.</seg>
<seg id="15">Draw employees from foreign firms</seg>
<seg id="16">Everywhere in the resource-rich countries put companies out of business.</seg>
<seg id="17">Foreign companies such as ArcelorMittal, the steel industry and their employees, several international airlines fly to the affected regions.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also, the local traders and farmers respond: only a few merchants still leave their homes in order to obtain supplies.</seg>
<seg id="19">In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, among other things, the rot for the export of major cocoa and coffee beans in the fields.</seg>
<seg id="20">The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.</seg>
<seg id="21">Food is scarce</seg>
<seg id="22">"People are travelling less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert for the economy of West Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">The man, for example, usually goes on the market and sold his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="24">The population gets so directly the consequences of the epidemic and urgent: food is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the markets, the supply of basic foodstuffs such as rice.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, the threat of damage - a region heavily dependent on international firms with far-reaching consequences.</seg>
<seg id="27">The greatest danger is that international companies avoid the area for a long time, basically, says Philippe Hugon from the French think tank Iris.</seg>
<seg id="28">The key is how far and how long it will spread the virus.</seg>
<seg id="29">If investors could give the impression that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and invest," warns Hugon.</seg>
<seg id="30">It also affects the strained state budgets of the Member States</seg>
<seg id="31">The disease also burdened the already strained state budgets of the countries concerned.</seg>
<seg id="32">The credit rating agency Moody's feared that their budgets are being stretched by high spending on the health system and in addition to the worsening economy.</seg>
<seg id="33">The African Development Bank has already pledged to the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million dollars (45 million euros) to help.</seg>
<seg id="34">The effects are already being felt in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not affected by the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta.</seg>
<seg id="36">But elsewhere, many people remain at home for fear of contagion.</seg>

<seg id="4">Persistent concerns from the CDU, the CSU wroth have against the car toll.</seg>
<seg id="5">German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke after prolonged resistance from their CDU foot for the introduction of a car toll.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Let me be very clear: it is in the coalition agreement, and they will come," said the party's top bodies on Monday after meetings of the CDU in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="7">But for now, Merkel has not presented a detailed model.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the government program "certain parameters are black and red."</seg>
<seg id="9">Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) have "made a proposal, and now will continue."</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the NRW CDU insists on saying "no" to a toll on all roads.</seg>
<seg id="11">Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) put constructively in the discussions on a bill.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the subject, he spoke with Dobrindt about other ways to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, as well as broadband expansion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tax rises of businessmen in the Washington area with economic recovery</seg>
<seg id="2">A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">State and local tax rulings for companies in the country rose slightly last year, while accelerating the economic recovery, a new study published last week, and the companies in the Washington area were no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia area jointly paid $27.6 billion to state and local authorities in the 2013 financial year, $26.6 billion in 2012, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to the revenue.</seg>
<seg id="6">State and local tax burden of companies last year rose by 4.3 percent to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent in the previous year, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of decline in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">Government taxes more than the local taxes rose to 4.3 percent, according to the study, conducted by Ernst & Young service agency with the National Center for taxation, a tax policy group was conducted.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the tax revenues of the District, 56 percent comes from corporate taxes, compared to 36 percent of the revenue from Mary's company.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia made with 28 percent of the lowest tax revenue from companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">A large part of the increase in tax revenue is based on a recovery of the real estate companies, say the researchers, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years, with growth rates of less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large proportion of these profits from large states like California, New York and Texas, seems to be the end for the Washington area.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia were paying about $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent in the course of a year.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not as effective in improving state and local tax revenues, since the real estate taxes amount to barely more than a fifth of the tax rulings of companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"In Maryland is happening: a large part of the property, particularly in the tax area, D.C., is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that pay no property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Maryland, for example, is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, in order to be able to offer the same services that offer the other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent recovery of tax revenues by companies may not be attributed solely to the recovery of the property market</seg>
<seg id="18">Corporate revenues also seem to recover, according to the data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Companies in the region reported on income taxes $2.3 billion in state organizations, compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">While the trend in the same direction, does not increase the local tax burden on companies evenly in all three locations.</seg>
<seg id="22">The increase rate in the District, with 4.3 percent of the national average, while the increase was significantly higher in Maryland, 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only Virginia reported a subpar tax of 4.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Virginia, with 6 percent in all three areas the lowest corporate income taxes (in all three there are fixed tax).</seg>
<seg id="25">The corporate tax rate is 8.25 percent in Maryland and the District at a relatively high 9.975 percent.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year in Virginia that requires lower state and local taxes and a better overall tax climate than in Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">The District was not investigated in the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite the advantages of Virginia under pressure from its southern neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates from 6.9 percent to 6 percent this year, the same sentence as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.</seg>
<seg id="30">If the state continues its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the meantime, the small businesses in the area of Washington seems to be better, and they therefore pay more state and local taxes, the most recent study.</seg>
<seg id="32">Corporate taxes paid in personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure on the basis of most small businesses - are organised in the District, Maryland and Virginia last year rose by 20 percent to $2.4 billion, a significant faster growth rate than the corporate taxes as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="33">The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes across the country are likely to continue this year, with an increase in general VAT revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nevertheless, the region will lag behind Washington, if the spending of the federal government has an impact on the labour market in the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Twin town: German beer for Guangzhou</seg>
<seg id="2">Hops and malt - a popular combination in China.</seg>
<seg id="3">German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.</seg>
<seg id="4">Frankfurt now wants a brewery in China, and also hopes for a direct flight between the two cities.</seg>
<seg id="5">German beer, brewed in Frankfurt and Guangzhou - that is the urgent desire of officials in China.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We would be delighted if we were to establish a German brewery in our city," said the deputy secretary of the South China Metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week during a visit to the SPD delegation in his city.</seg>
<seg id="7">Again and again, the official of the ruling Communist Party of China in the course of the conversation on this metropolis of twelve million.</seg>
<seg id="8">Guangzhou, which is called in Germany, Canton, is one of the richest cities in China, Li.</seg>
<seg id="9">People therefore have the purchasing power to afford German beer.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German delegation, said the host to politicians, he will hear in Germany after a possible partner for the project.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It does not need a lot of beer: good water, grain and vitality," he added at the lunch with the top party in Guangzhou.</seg>
<seg id="12">This joy shine, Mr Li, flattered the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="13">As a result, the official from Guangzhou with Schäfer-Gümbel - albeit with red wine, which was served at the meal.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tsingtao - beer is brewed according to the German purity law.</seg>
<seg id="16">More commerce</seg>
<seg id="17">A second request of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said deputy leader Li.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier in the year 2012, but for economic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It would be worth it again," he was convinced the local politicians.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The commerce between our two cities continues."</seg>
<seg id="21">Currently, travelers would have to take a detour through Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.</seg>
<seg id="22">The administration of the Guangdong province, whose capital is Guangzhou, hopes the flights.</seg>
<seg id="23">The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, made the request during his conversation with the Social Democrats in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="24">"This is a very good idea," said Schäfer-Gümbel - the Chinese vice-minister Li Jinjun, an intimate knowledge of Germany, nodding approvingly.</seg>
<seg id="25">The partnership</seg>
<seg id="26">The hopes of the deputy leader of Guangzhou, that he can visit Frankfurt next year to a partnership meeting.</seg>
<seg id="27">Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this role.</seg>
<seg id="28">He came into office only this year, after his predecessor had been promoted from office on corruption charges.</seg>
<seg id="29">The local leader Wan Qing had to go.</seg>
<seg id="30">The action against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and the administration, which is enforced by tough leader Xi Jinping.</seg>
<seg id="31">The new leader Li Yiwei had worked before his party career for an American company, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.</seg>
<seg id="32">Before he took office in Guangzhou, he was a top official of cars built in Fujian, where VW a great work.</seg>
<seg id="33">Frankfurt has officially received more than a dozen twinning.</seg>
<seg id="34">The connection to the Guangzhou 9000 miles away is one of those that are maintained by both sides, including school exchanges.</seg>
<seg id="35">Last year was celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Sino-German relationship.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion</seg>
<seg id="2">Amazon has just confirmed what had reported information on Monday morning: the online retailer and video producer, and a host of other things - Twitch buys the video streaming service for $1.04 billion (US $970 million).</seg>
<seg id="3">The announcement comes as a surprise, not because nobody had expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely assumed that the company would buy YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago, it looked as if the sale of the Twitch video service from Google for a cool billion, and the cooperation also appeared.</seg>
<seg id="5">Twitch, which was founded only three years ago when Justin.tv was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="6">Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted their stunts, published in games, "YouTube for live games," says an insider.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Twitch interface.</seg>
<seg id="8">And "let's play," a video genre, in which the know-alls (mostly older) give games a veneer of secret science theater, are already very popular on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="9">The fact is that YouTube is called often, if you want to describe Twitch, so was the news that wanted to buy YouTube Twitch, recorded a bit bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is a mystery why the deal was not reached with YouTube, since the company was reportedly prepared to pay as much as Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">Everything we currently know about this statement by Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "we have opted for Amazon, because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."</seg>
<seg id="12">Another mystery, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.</seg>
<seg id="13">For snobs like me, who say that they prefer sport than watching, it is difficult to understand the attraction, which assumes the games rather than watching others to take even the control console.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is one thing to look over the shoulder of a friend at 3 o "clock in the morning, while she creeps through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch a nutcase, as he is shot 20 times in Call of Duty in the head.</seg>
<seg id="15">Now you could see all these games.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so the watch may be without its own control over the prospect of a really good view recipe for headaches.</seg>
<seg id="17">I admit that the fast runs in the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age in record time, all games are entertaining.</seg>
<seg id="18">But as long as it is not a game or humor, virtuoso Twitch channel is not likely to be very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="19">But what skeptics like me know it?</seg>
<seg id="20">Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors a month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.</seg>
<seg id="21">And how exactly Amazon wants to make money from it?</seg>
<seg id="22">It is hard to imagine that Twitch is integrated so elegantly into Amazon Instant Video, YouTube Twitch could easily swallow.</seg>
<seg id="23">But Twitch has something that each company would have liked: thousands of young men who are courted by advertisers.</seg>
<seg id="24">As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the media shows no signs of contraction, or even - schluck - as a spectator sport.</seg>

<seg id="1">On the bouncy castle at the castle garden festival was on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="2">The concept of the organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Despite the strong downpours on Saturday evening an estimated 1200 fans came to the open-air festival in the castle garden.</seg>
<seg id="4">The admission had to be stopped temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It was annoying," said Ron Shem, one of the organizers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Salzwedel l light and fun.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two Spanish words have formed the name Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem Amula.</seg>
<seg id="8">Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler castle garden will radiate brightness on the day and evening through various shows.</seg>
<seg id="9">Well, and the fun comes from alone anyway.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was demonstrated early Saturday, when the first visitors to the open air.</seg>
<seg id="11">The organizers had promised a feast for all generations.</seg>
<seg id="12">And they succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="13">Around the supply at the castle garden, it had also made Salzwedeler, guests from the near future.</seg>
<seg id="14">They pursued the first live performances, wippten with the foot of the beat, enjoyed cool drinks - in short, were called for relaxation and enjoyment.</seg>
<seg id="15">And across the generations.</seg>
<seg id="16">While the luemmelten on blankets on the extra angekarrten white sand at the beach bar, labten others at a quarter of wine in the wine, the offspring raged on the bouncy castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.</seg>
<seg id="17">But even in the face of the volunteers had their hands full in the truest sense of the word to the crowd, and to conjure up imaginative creations into the little faces.</seg>
<seg id="18">Adults used the kicker tables or took part in a skateboard workshop, the crew of the good foot from Salzwedel.</seg>
<seg id="19">Until the big rain came.</seg>
<seg id="20">Shortly before 17.30 p.m. rubberpussy he settled on visitors, especially families sought the vastness and nests.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this did not diminish the attractiveness of the festival.</seg>
<seg id="22">"There were more people than expected," said Ron Shem, a "success on the line."</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why I am a repeat of the big party in the coming year, nothing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although it has to be worked on the content and size of the events, Sem made on Sunday in a first assessment to the popular vote.</seg>
<seg id="25">He described as annoying that the admission had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="26">Obviously, the security company had been booked with too few forces.</seg>
<seg id="27">The result: some who had already paid, were no longer on the site.</seg>
<seg id="28">The response was very good.</seg>
<seg id="29">In a first tentative estimate, said the Salzwedeler co-organizer of about 1200 visitors, the contrast in the castle garden.</seg>
<seg id="30">There were problems with the sound.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Salzwedeler hip-hop band Blocks "n" Rox broke their appearance so unnerved.</seg>
<seg id="32">The technicians were unable to create a reasonably sensible sound.</seg>
<seg id="33">The planned shisha lounges could be built, because the tents could not be brought because of a puncture after Salzwedel.</seg>
<seg id="34">"But they will be next year," says the organiser.</seg>
<seg id="35">The premiere of the Amula Open Airs was succeeded by the number of visitors.</seg>
<seg id="36">And in bad weather.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the organizers have committed some errors that will be the first time, but must be eliminated at the second edition.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the social network Facebook, the organizers critique.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Sorry, but for twelve euros, we expected more," says Melanie Meier on the events page.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Unfortunately, you've taken a little bit," says Ele Zimmermann at the same point.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others do not see the initial problems so closely.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think it is very good that some people are not only stupid, but also really try to do something on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="43">Hats off!, "writes Stephanie Jenß for Amula.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now the organizers a year to these criticisms.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pull back the clubs together?</seg>
<seg id="2">Finally, there was always a dispute between the two Wolf Hauser Castle.</seg>
<seg id="3">The bureaux now think about a possible cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="4">As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolf, Hauser was the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolf Council Hauser Castle friends, in the French Guédelon project.</seg>
<seg id="5">A year ago, there was not a good climate between the castle and the castle of Wolfratshausen friends.</seg>
<seg id="6">So far, seemed very different points of view, how to deal with the history of the Wolf Council Hauser Castle and a possible reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="7">The two camps now move closer together, it should be held soon to discuss a common approach.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is confirmed by club CEOs Torsten Stockaryd (Castle Association) and Herbert Piffl (Castle Friends) to demand our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I phoned Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down with us," says.</seg>
<seg id="10">In his view, all members of both clubs could learn to work together again in the future.</seg>
<seg id="11">So there were faster visible successes.</seg>
<seg id="12">While the castle had friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath until a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain, stands for the Association of the Castle, "opening and Erlebbarmachung" at the forefront of the terrain.</seg>
<seg id="13">Herbert Piffl, second president of the castle friends, was on the call, according to their own.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since Dimbaths death, he is the castle friends.</seg>
<seg id="15">A new chairman is to be found in mid-September at a general meeting.</seg>
<seg id="16">The association currently counts around 40 members under the age of 74.</seg>
<seg id="17">"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath we have the first activities out of respect." This "thinking period" was needed "to consider how it could happen."</seg>
<seg id="18">According to Piffl, the new chairman should go into the conversation with the castle.</seg>
<seg id="19">Until then, the castle could make friends with a current mood within their group.</seg>
<seg id="20">There is not yet a candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.</seg>
<seg id="21">"But I am confident that someone will be found." He himself will not be standing because he has his residence in Bad Toelz.</seg>
<seg id="22">The new chairman should be a wolf Council.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Toelzer wanted to "participate in the project but very happy."</seg>
<seg id="24">The different positions in terms of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="25">He praises Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Two similar projects are already far advanced in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream.</seg>
<seg id="27">A high participation of the population, as well as by volunteers from all over the world, be they a.</seg>
<seg id="28">Piffl: "I too was skeptical at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="29">But over time, more and more I have come to believe that it makes sense to promote the project. "It could create a" unique "for the raftsmen city.</seg>
<seg id="30">Here, there is nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="31">Moreover, the project would be financed by EU subsidies, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"The idea of reconstruction is why I personally do not want to throw overboard." He simply hope that the club moves on this point, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="33">The aim of documenting the story first, "is important and good."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clever ways to save at university textbooks</seg>
<seg id="2">Since the cost of university textbooks for many students more than $1,000 a year, considered the fast second semester student Matt Schroeder a clever saving idea.</seg>
<seg id="3">He invented a temporary system for books by students of higher semester and offered a nominal compensation in order to delay the sale.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My maths book normally costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick - fil A biscuit," said Schroeder, 19, who visited the Covenant College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The books needed for last semester would have cost him $430, he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He gave $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">The college leadership said that students spend on average more than $1,200 a year for textbooks and study materials for the students, however, that there were several cost-containment options.</seg>
<seg id="8">Online shops and creative approaches such as Schroeder's are increasingly the solution of choice for students.</seg>
<seg id="9">The hiring of textbooks is popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a considerably lower price than when buying.</seg>
<seg id="10">Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university book stores, said that the hiring of textbooks have doubled since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Polls show the industry that was rented for about a quarter of the books in the college bookstores last spring semester, said Neebos Vice-President Tevor Meyer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Less than half of all textbooks are bought according to the Amalgamation National Association of College Stores in campus bookstores.</seg>
<seg id="13">Here is the multiplication table for the best deals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Buy online</seg>
<seg id="15">Some new books online cost only a third of the price they are in the campus bookstore.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of the "Annunciation" VNO Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be obtained at the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.</seg>
<seg id="17">Used to buy</seg>
<seg id="18">If the notes of others or make up a normal wear nothing, second-hand books are a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Annunciation" is used to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Casaday, 25, a student at Brigham Young University, says that he has spent on Amazon .com 42 cents for a second-hand copy of "Strategic Business Media Fells: understanding The End Of The Advertising Business."</seg>
<seg id="21">The book was sold new for $48.</seg>
<seg id="22">Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls advised students to ask their professors, whether earlier editions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases, often older editions can be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.</seg>
<seg id="25">Besides Chegg and Amazon, half .com, eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rent</seg>
<seg id="27">The hiring of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them fairly well, remember to return them and you don't want to keep the books at the end of the course.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.</seg>
<seg id="29">A student could, for example, "rent" for the duration of a semester for about $20.</seg>
<seg id="30">Find out about the provisions of the shop where you can rent, including the penalties that may be incurred for writing notes, or usage.</seg>
<seg id="31">Tenants beware: if you return the book, the penalties can exceed the price of a new book.</seg>
<seg id="32">E-books</seg>
<seg id="33">Instead of traditional textbooks, e-books are an option.</seg>
<seg id="34">In fact, these books are sometimes hired by an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon .com and Barnes & Noble Inc. Chegg is provided.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Annunciation" at Chegg can rent for 6 months for about $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best deals, which can be downloaded free of charge, while nowadays many classic scientific and engineering science textbooks can be very expensive.</seg>
<seg id="37">In any case, look around.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepper's Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price of books, because you can be sure to find the right textbook.</seg>
<seg id="39">And an online order should be examined, and whether the book is actually in stock.</seg>
<seg id="40">He learned that lesson the hard way.</seg>
<seg id="41">He bought a book for four weeks and had finally paid the full price in the college bookstore.</seg>

<seg id="5">Collin described 2014 as "the worst year for children's films" and "2" made it easy to tame dragons as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.</seg>
<seg id="6">In films for a slightly older audience, however, it appears as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.</seg>
<seg id="7">In July, Entertainment Weekly average Cinema Score and Meta Critic - evaluation for each summer movie, between the American Memorial Day and the 20th of July 2013 and at least 2000 canvases in the current year.</seg>
<seg id="8">The results are based on the opinion of cinemagoers and film critics and suggest that this year's film hits equivalent to those of last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing habits and the growing popularity of Web streaming services such as Netflix.</seg>
<seg id="10">Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's upcoming animated film, said to the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think the times are changing."</seg>
<seg id="11">We must accept that and not try to chase after the past.</seg>
<seg id="12">In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix streaming content with the recent sales of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year's sales amounted to $837 million.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticised the film studios that they concentrated too much on the comic and predicted a "meltdown" of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="14">In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his grim prophecy could contain a true core.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because of the potential blockbuster expected in the summer of 2015, including the Gers: Age of Jurassic World Ultron, Minions and other representatives of the film industry, however, are more optimistic:</seg>
<seg id="16">The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the decline in cash results recently as "cyclical" and compared to the Hollywood Reporter said: "the next summer will be the biggest summer box-office at all, and no one will be more concerned about the business."</seg>

<seg id="1">Synomymous after second win of the season three th place in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2">With the 2:0 on a grim week for Rapid, has taken a positive end on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached with the training in the Europa League on Thursday between a deep.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The sense of achievement was incredibly important," and the captain Steffen Hofmann, who confirmed the three th green and white.</seg>
<seg id="5">Schrammel - Traumtor brings Rapid on season-opener Rapid has shown with the second season the right response to the disappointment of Helsinki and comes with a sense of achievement in the break.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said foreign defender Thomas Schrammel, with its splendid leadership volley from Sechzehnereck asked in the 14th minute to set the course for victory.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I thought I was up all the frustration of Thursday and schnalzte it under the bar," said the 26-year-old smiling.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Schrammel Novmember had taken on the 13th so far in 2010, the last time in a Bundesliga game, was for Ried.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first championship match in Rapid Dress will therefore remain in special memory.</seg>
<seg id="10">"For me this is something special, I am from the rapid generation," said Schrammel.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the short-term basin - Blessur Schrammel Mario Pavelic, from the left to the right defensive side and also made it very well.</seg>
<seg id="12">He has enough experience that he can exercise this position as well.</seg>
<seg id="13">He has earned the gate he has done several assists this year, "praised Barisic.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team shows character Schrammel also supplied the flank of 2:0 by Hofmann after a hour, which finally made the decision.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because before the guests could also write.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Thank God we had some luck," said Schrammel, alluded to the divergence of performance and result in the last few weeks: "the results did not vote, but the Spielerische was always good in comparison to last year."</seg>
<seg id="17">Barisic even found that "in many games before - was better than today," against "the strongest team that has played in this stadium this season."</seg>
<seg id="18">The first Dreipunkter since 26 July have therefore proved that despite the setbacks, the team structure intact: "my team has shown today that it has character."</seg>
<seg id="19">Less pleasing for him: "we have finally played back to zero."</seg>
<seg id="20">The fact that too much work while Sestak with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni, and Michael Schimpelsberger are multiple failures, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp be pushed to their Startelfdebuets, make the victory even more valuable.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We must not forget that," warned Barisic, who lost in the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who were very stable in recent times."</seg>
<seg id="22">The play-offs should thus be used to "lick wounds and move up in the physical area a bit," said Barisic, who has five U21 - selection of players in its ranks.</seg>
<seg id="23">One of the suits, perhaps, is captain of Hofmann's break.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is for the team that goes beyond pain.</seg>
<seg id="25">In this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us, "noted Barisic.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his replacement in the 68th minute, not only the structure, but also achieved the second goal.</seg>
<seg id="27">For the 33 -year-olds, who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit of the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 on Admira).</seg>
<seg id="28">Hofmann: "must not believe that everything is good" "we have certainly had a bit of luck, but eventually the luck must come back to us, too.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now it was high time, "said Hofmann.</seg>
<seg id="30">But he warned: "we must see to it, not always black and white.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have not played so badly in recent weeks, as has been stated.</seg>
<seg id="32">We cannot believe that everything is fine.</seg>
<seg id="33">The importance of its role in the team could not deny it.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is a very young team, which I can help at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="35">In certain periods, but to me, "said Hofmann.</seg>
<seg id="36">The coach Michael Baur and his team had little.</seg>
<seg id="37">He regretted the quick against Zaubertor hits "from the category," as well as the regular gate of utility in the 40th minute, which was denied by referee Koll Egger.</seg>
<seg id="38">The only criticism I can make the team is that we were not specific enough towards Tor in some phases.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since we have had too few qualifications.</seg>
<seg id="40">Striker Maximilian Karner was similar: "it has just started badly, but then we have found and even made a gate.</seg>
<seg id="41">By and large, would have been better.</seg>

<seg id="2">We showed a powerful tribe in our series "my piece of the puzzle for the summer Rhoener happiness" last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">There are several of these giant trees in the county, the copy is the "Geißruheiche" above the white Brunn.</seg>
<seg id="4">A bumpy walk leads up to the 600-year-old oak.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is past the piles of stone and basalt, basaltic rock seas.</seg>
<seg id="6">A little below the quarry from the mountain, one kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, because it is.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vitality provides the natural monument, it stands on the environment, and other trees with a volume of over eight metres to an American sequoia.</seg>
<seg id="8">A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.</seg>
<seg id="9">But despite intensive research, there were only references to the name of origin.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bischofsheim archives and interviewed older people from among white, to discover the explanation it has with the Geißruheiche.</seg>
<seg id="11">His findings remained a rather sober explanation for the name.</seg>
<seg id="12">Until about 80 years ago, the goat shepherd should have driven their animals from the white, from the laboriously cleared rocks and liberated meadows.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the foot of the tree should have rested on the ascent exhausted animal guardians.</seg>
<seg id="14">Meanwhile, the area has won back its importance, because actually, goats graze in the meadows.</seg>
<seg id="15">The area has been declared in addition to the Biosphere Reserve, Schneider has discovered.</seg>
<seg id="16">Entering the stone collections must be careful though, because the rehashed basalt from the sun is also a popular place for cross otters.</seg>
<seg id="17">A path leads from the white, to the tree, but something is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="18">Other ways are signposted, the direction of Rhoen and invite to an extended hike.</seg>
<seg id="19">Where does the Wasserburg?</seg>
<seg id="20">An outing that is sought in our next task is to find the rare height.</seg>

<seg id="2">Renzi sees the government as a close daily newspaper La Repubblica, the appointment of his favourite team in the government's current Mogherini as strengthening the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="3">He also expects a boost for its "reform package" in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Last but not least, Renzi hopes to make the left base quietly risen against him again and again, because she is - albeit more moderate way.</seg>
<seg id="5">With the conservative representatives with President Jean-Claude Juncker and the President of the Council nominated Donald Tusk, Poland will be the prevailing view in Rome in order to produce a political settlement.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because the chief diplomat of the EU Commission President Juncker will at the same time, the deputy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The pending approval of the European Parliament is considered safe.</seg>
<seg id="8">Otherwise President, Giorgio Napolitano, the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) is hardly a "important recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="9">La Repubblica spread optimism that for almost two decades, leading party offices and Mogherini, known for its ambition to "enormous challenges" will show up.</seg>

<seg id="16">When Renzi in February 2014, Premier Mogherini, he called on his foreign minister.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the PD now has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40 percent of the party's votes in the EU elections in May, then, as will be noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini a share.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reproaches in Brussels, the new High Representative have too little diplomatic experience, so lacking in substance, will be in the PD.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Brussels, especially from Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini's suspicious realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine and Russia as "friendly" defamed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin called on Kiev to the inclusion of "welfare talks" with eastern Ukraine</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, according to Russian media reports that the Ukrainian government is fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and directly with negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman Dimitri Peskow was later realized that did not mean that Putin will be under the control of the separatist area of eastern Ukraine part of Russia, but that its status must be defined in relation to the Russian-speaking region of Ukraine, the power of representation of its rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">Putin's appeal to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits the strategy apparently since the beginning of the riots five months ago: aid to the separatists in the areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novo Rossiya de facto independence for an alliance with Russia rather than with the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with the state television station Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the territories held by separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists have recently taken the area as "Novo Rossiya" or "Novorossiya," a term that recalls the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin pointed out that all those Ukrainian politicians during the campaign for the elections on Oct. 26, while government groups and civilian communities in the attacking areas held by separatists hope for imminent peace talks are "trapped" in their illusions, told Itar-Tass.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We must immediately begin detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to protect the interests of the people who live there," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskow said that Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership, in order to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that threaten their cultural and linguistic rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern areas, said Peskow.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskow said, "because there is no conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."</seg>
<seg id="12">The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman for correcting the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underlined Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, in contrast to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have been far more difficult to annex the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from before the conflict in Ukraine to remain a broad majority.</seg>
<seg id="14">The autonomy, which was raised by Russian diplomats at international forums, would give the regional governments in Ukraine, its own authority to negotiate trade agreements and foreign relations, thus giving the Kremlin a de facto control over an area that connects the Russian territory of Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Black Sea peninsula annexed five months ago, is the home port for the majority of the Russian navy, as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region.</seg>
<seg id="16">The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and the Crimea is also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his investiture speech on June 7 that the Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should consider amendments to the Constitution, which provide the respective areas of greater control over their finances and the status of languages.</seg>
<seg id="18">But his idea of autonomy appears in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, is accused of arming and incitement to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="19">Putin's last call for Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing, followed by a further encroachment of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks have entered on the previously peaceful region in eastern Ukraine along the Sea of Azov.</seg>
<seg id="20">The coup that took over the Russian-backed separatists, according to the fears of Ukrainian security agents, the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to the Crimea, the control of Nowoasowsk.</seg>
<seg id="21">For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations are under way to Mariupol, a steel industry port of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and asked for urgent action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, which has been independent for 23 years.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We are close to the point of no return," warned Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="25">The EU summit decided no concrete actions that lead to the drafting of further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force at an unspezifizierten escalation of Ukraine crisis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ukrainian soldiers have had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk, after the two columns of Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers last week in the Donetsk region, in order to support the beleaguered separatists, said Col. Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Repo, on Saturday in Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="27">The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped by the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk, were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago on Ukrainian territory, announced on Sunday with Cadets.</seg>
