When some years ago the 2nd table tennis district class was deleted for the purpose of tensioning of the league-division, that was a step into the correct direction.
Now, the German table tennis federal government took an additional 3 Federal League into the programme.
The consequence: Who did not climb up descended.
So Göttingens class-highest team sink avoided the decline in the Second League reference, plays in the next season, but only a fifth class.
Fourth-Class ladies have torpedoes, in spite of their overwhelming passage into the regional league.
The boys and girls of sink start in the lower Saxony League, as well as the young of SC Weende.
Upon the SG Lenglern and the torpedo reserve enter in the new association league, in the country league no Göttinger clubs are more represented.
With the Members the TTV Geismar in the association League, the torpedo-second league, plays in the country.
What of the composition looks like a better district class is now the new district Second League south.
Here are TSV seul, VfB Lödingsen, torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bove Skandinavia Langenholtensen of, the FC Weser and the TTC.
In the district League Dransfeld and SC Weende allude as regional representatives, in which local class of TTC II, red White, Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. The district Second League of the Members begins at least in establishment.
Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here to.
In the district league start torpedo III and Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen run.
With each nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also the district league relay of the SCW-boys - there torpedo II still sets off - is not complete.
In a district class Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first region Association collapse of the two 1444 circle leagues with nine teams.
In the West will have the Rot-Weiß II, Bove of SV III, Laubach II, torpedo IV and V, MTV south-east, off fields SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Leng learning II.
In the east-relay Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen, Santa Claus mountain and Landolfshausen play among other things.
The lady circular league consists of Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
That is still better than in the old circle, where there is on circle level no ladies not-European more.
Conspicuous that none of the six 2.Kreisklassen reaches establishment, the innovative and driven man circular Board will have to be concerned.
