In a comment onto the New Press it contradicts statements of the manager Peer Medau and certifies this to pose "as a commander".
The style of the University of this is not, it says in the communication.
It is the family Medau already "Mitte June orally on the suggestion made by the University has been informed.
The statement that the plans became known only in July, are definitively wrong so Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that it is not in the plans for 'Vorfestlegungen or even decisions, however, is it' preferences'.
Also the expansion of the narrow street, necessary for the access up to the castle is less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
By a nine metres wide street was and is not the speech.
It is a question to present state of 5.50 meters, that is "a meter more widely than up to now," declared Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau-operators that their parking areas clear of all charges and school-own in future are used then only still by students of the college wants to make not be meant for Pötzl.
Zugeparkt does not become at all because that can be dissolved as at other public parking places in the meantime intelligently.
Think of the residents
The creche Bergwichtel that is on the ground and before whose entry door would lead along the access to the parking deck is not supposed to be influenced according to the university education president.
Rather it gives to consider "that it is not a question only of the creche here but also around the residents at the emptying to the Friedrich Streib street and the 800 pupils of the adjacent secondary school.
It is a question therefore of a lot more than of individual interests of the gentlemen Medau ", so Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parents Advisory Board of crèche with the expansion of the street would a "of the few natural spots Coburgs lost", "right to say whether the reader can decide for themselves".
At the beginning of October Pötzl wants to inform the councillors, together with the State Construction Office Bamberg of the structural development of the College by 2020 'and speak to the importance of the new development in this context.
Peer Medau last week had the parents of the crèche on the plans of the university.
Accordingly should the access for the new parking deck not as up to now above the campus and the Friedrich Streib street, but over the Medau mountain lead.
In this way, the narrow streets would have to be extended on such a kilometre length in a two-way.
According to the Medaus projections would a tenfold increase in the transport of high.
Of approximately 2000 vehicles is the speech on a daily basis.
On the part of the city, we did not want to comment on the project.
