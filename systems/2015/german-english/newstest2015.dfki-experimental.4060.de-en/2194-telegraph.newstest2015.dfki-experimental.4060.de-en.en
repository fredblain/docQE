Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort that character changes things even in a so gigantic organization as the NHS.
As a consultative but no anesthetic doctor he devoted his career to the task to be spared the sick both the agony of the disease, and the pain of treatment.
Among his patients, so his wife remembers, a MI6 employee was that had to live from tortures with the disastrous effects.
Lawson knew that the doctors are the diagnoses and diseases important, whereas the next Generation offers mostly with something quite different: Pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose ordeal began.
"I did not feel myself," he wrote in May this year.
I had difficulties to raise me.
While he was fighting with the flu-similar symptoms, he noticed that it did his wife Juliet reproaches impatiently.
"I want everything more directly than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, lawsone fully felt unusually, and without reason concerns.
Anything was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out a radiological examination of its breast.
Only two weeks ago it had been in the French Alps for the skiing.
There was the result of the X-ray test.
He suffered from mesothelioma, a incurable cancer, the breast fur, in other words the the lungs on drawing the end of skin.
As with the case of most cancer illnesses the exact trigger is to be determined mostly heavily.
For example, while some smokers are falling with lung cancer, all Lungenkrebserkrankten were not previously smokers.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the cause is an asbestos burden - contact with the fibre material that was once seen as "miracle material but has now been recognised as serious
For most of us, teambuilding is a disease that can ignore how easy.
Asbestos is, after all, a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbestos type was not used in Britain since the 1960 "s more than the industry has committed itself voluntarily to stop using this.
Also, where it was still used, only people worked in certain branches directly with the material - plumbers, building workers, carpenters and dockers for example.
As an industrial dangerous material from another time it today hardly yet seems to be alarming.
But this complacency is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the culmination of a Mesoltheliom disease.
There are more deaths from teambuilding here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year twice as many people die from this disease than road accidents.
The annual figures Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and expected future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we are seeing the fatal consequences now, even though it is asbestos for years illegal (1999 have been banned all types of asbestos), is that developed a teambuilding only after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is frequent still, in the houses available, in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools, in which we learn and the businesses in which we shop.
And that is why teambuilding knows no class barriers, financial borders, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, of the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a harbor.
The Parliament building are asbestos contaminated.
Also in the hospitals in which nevertheless we are supposed to become healthy were defined already as initial stoves of this fatal carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a plumber.
It was difficult for him in fact to imagine where it could have come possibly with asbestos in contact.
Then he found it.
"It looks as if in the tunnels at the Guy 's an amount of asbestos were available to hospital, where I completed my training for six years." He wrote.
All - Students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many will be my age at the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was unable to answer this question, at least in part.
"From the four doctors that were trained at the Guy 's hospital, and that fell with Mesotheliom ill in the last five years" he wrote in 2010 in a letter, "I am the last one that still lives."
How many of us will fall ill?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with Mesotheliom in the age of 48 years.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty per cent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months after the diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatal.
We can therefore only repeat Lawsons question: 'How many of us will fall ill?'
The leading expert Britain "s to mesothelioma, a professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870-74 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic in the United Kingdom is expected to come to a standstill, a total of 90.000 of the disease will be the victims.
Most of them have no idea at the moment, so that they will die.

A short look onto the files of the courts which the concerned persons turn to frequently because of claims for compensation shows how far the scourge of the Mesothelioms is already spread.
In June this year "s Marks & Spencer has, for example, too, to have stopped Janice of All negligently cast an air asbestos.
She worked nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible on the clothing department in two locations - one of them the purchase in the Oxford Street.
Mrs Allen was only 18 years as, when it began its work in M & S.
Now it has two children in the twenties.
In this matter, "says, 'I had never heard of teambuilding, I had not even really on asbestos.
I never thought that I would affect the.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name stems from the word 'Asbestiform ", a description of the fibre structure that makes the material resistant and flexibility.
Three of the six have been used in construction.
Chrysotile asbestos, also known as white asbestos today, is by far the most widely found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof plates, slabs, tube isolations, storage water heater isolations, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less serious than other asbestos forms, but is regarded as a major health risk "with possible death by the EU and the WTO.
More dangerous is, however, the brown asbestos (Amosite) and that blue asbestos (Cape asbestos).
Britain was once the world "s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts believe that" it clear indirect evidence that this is a major reason for the uniquely high Mesotheliomraten.

Janice Allen may have seen not as a typical Mesotheliomopfer, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that their history is not unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected, in the is presented that 'was caused a substantial proportion of the mesothelioma without known suspension through work or in this House probably by asbestos contact in the environment'.
A majority of these contacts is based according to his statement on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It appears that no one can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard consulting, the Palace of Westminster has investigated, shows how people in the heart of the government, unknowingly may have been exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service formulating and pipelines behind the committee rooms of Parliament with asbestos whose serious fibres could be caused by something as safe as "strong air movements" were contaminated.
Members of Parliament are accused often to look after their own interests, but it looks as if the opposite would have to.
While the management office of the Parliamentary Work Service was insisting on the Westminsterpalast receiving a "clean health certificate", meanwhile it is undisputed that 1 billion £of amount of work must be found over several years in order to renovate the parliament to modernize the electrical installations and that asbestos remove, and that according to the general elections in 2015 the representatives will presumably rather meet in the QE2 conference center seemed likely than on the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also indicated that 'was not handled the presence of asbestos in accordance with the relevant provisions'.
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.
Everything that can be done now is wait.
A person who was able to determine the contact with asbestos never exactly is Graham Abbott, a general practitioners.
As Andrew Lawson the 50 old Abbott suspect that it was stopped in its work in hospitals, the asbestos.
"I have worked in a hospital in which asbestos complaints positive were decided," he says, "but I can not prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all places which one worked on and onto the data.
At which it still exactly remembered is the day at the beginning of December 2009 at which he got such kind of fevers.
He was 45, and was late in the evening by an operation.
I had suddenly joggling-frost.
It was all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I thought not to get the trip left home.
As a doctor knew Abbott that the pain of breast fur, the skin by his lungs came around.
But how Janice Allen he had no reason to suspect, a mesothelioma.
He was not a month to work.
Amazed doctors made X-rays of his breast and apply Pleurakathether in order to take liquid from the lungs and to test in the lab.
His complaints, but without diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and it has returned to his job.
From time to time the symptoms returned, however, often after sporting activity and violent terrorists.
2011 was a patient Abbott "s with similar symptoms in its practice and has been diagnosed with teambuilding later.
But also now Abbott did not combine this with his own case.
After all, its patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011 Abbotts state worsened again and his family doctor brought his CT-Scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt for the first time ill, introduced a with a camera equipped probe in the between the music and the breast.
I am an optimist.
I am generally simple further, "he says.
To be honest, I had not made me so many concerns.
But Rachel, my wife, was concerned.
The result of the purpose: Lay in the week between Christmas and New Year: 'I was told that it was teambuilding.'
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis teambuilding
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan-nurses from whom one recommended him to take an attorney.
Only now he understood the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread especially in big public buildings in which tubes were often isolated with asbestos", he says.
The people, that the asbestos in these buildings were stopped, fall ill now.
And it is now teambuilding younger people who have worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos isolations in hospitals below the earth, so patients were not stopped the material
But many employees, that changed into pedestrian Tunneling from a building into the other one (as Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as it often did to Graham Abbott), came with greatest probability into contact with the poisonous substances.
It shows that were for several decades after the war hospitals for patients may save lives, but slum-livers for the Firouz doctors.
It will also still today.
Pupils geared their bunsen burners to asbestos mats.
And it is not just hospitals.
Asbestos was due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant polyester properties often in offices, shops, libraries and city halls.
Also schools.
Indeed, many people have had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, pupils geared their bunsen burners to asbestos mats.
The issue of asbestos is spoken about Web sites now often in schools.
And meanwhile so innocent objects in our houses as slabs or scale roofs contained asbestos as a default.
'It is a industry poison that is contained in large parts of our real estate,' noticed Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy 'has represented.
In one case, the only way that a woman remembered was the dismantling of a garden box in the 1970 "s.
So you look out as you tear down your garden box.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
A while regrets to process that ", Graham Abbott says.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I noted that I could not focus on what I have done.
I was two weeks in practice.
Then I knew that I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I am not going to further Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty was the perspective change of the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
As countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed it was from all the information with which he rightly had to come.
It was very difficult to include all of this, "he says.
"I asked my doctor 'how long I still have?'
And I was still around 12 months.
I remember that I thought, "Well, I am not going to further Christmas.
That was it then. "
Teambuilding is particularly insidious, because it our lives conservation mechanism - the breathe itself - is that caused the fatal cancer.
Most of the cases of teambuilding are caused by asbestos.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibres.
If the asbestos is has caused and the fibres are inhaled, can they in the pleura, skin, by the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can activate cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled acerose asbestos fibers", so professor Tom treasure, a heart thorax doctor that changed Hospital in 2001 onto the Guy 's.
Exactly the hospital, of the Andrew Lawson believed that it has suspended the asbestos, is now ironically, a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasury knew lawsone and dealt with some others that probably during their education in the hospital the asbestos were stopped.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the pulmonary fabric treasure says "where the skin is, if they are pressed from the breath process onto the edge.
By nature it is from the beginning invasive.
The usual options on other cancers not work in teambuilding so good.
The effectiveness of a operation, for example, is hotly contested.
Some say that it is worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"One cannot cut out the pleura", he says.
You are not with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer is not to chemotherapy very well, "the" effect ', but does not cure.
"Sometimes there are long-term on living," says treasure.
But in the end they die all.
Fortunately, some patients live long, in fact, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after its own diagnosis is fighting Graham Abbott still.
After he had contacted mesothelioma, Abbott in contact with Andrew Lawson, of the four years after its diagnosis a Check-In man support and consultancy for company had become Mitbetroffene.
He imagined "Hallo, cancer headquarters," cheerfully in the case of calls.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier, and was still very active.
Initially, Abbott had been offered to six chemotherapy cycles, which would last four months and likely to extend his life by only a month.
'I was desperate, "he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, was' things in a slightly more positive light '.
After the consultation of several doctors Abbott, its treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, decided to continue heart-thorax-specialist at the Guy.
"We had an advantage by the fact that I do not further had to be referred, I called simply and got a date," Graham.
A normal patient would must be given a reference and have to wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for Mesotheliom-ills in order to be able to use the best available treatments.
But if these treatments finally inevitably fail, many are affected by a different financial concern - on the future of the families who leave them.
And so they are directed to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It is since 1898 known that asbestos is extreme dangerously for the health", says Morgan.
But what in the 1960 "s changed is that it was realized that was also a very low burden a health risk.
And here the negligence of companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy was laid in their case, finally, but it was not what Morgan a 'full compensation', as has been able to prove not Lawson with absolute certainty that teambuilding be on a asbestos contact on Guy 'was due.
After the investigation on his death confirmed a spokesman for the Guy ', however, that' have been removed the asbestos fibres in the affected Keller area in the 1990 "s.
This was for Andrew Lawson too late.
How asbestos can be eliminated.
It is actual for Mesotheliom ills that make an effort for compensation, an enormous problem to assign the fatal asbestos contact to a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their previous employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who are against claims, know that the time for it is, but certainly not with the prosecutor.
As reaction to that there were this year clear new legislations that it makes more simply for Mesotheliom concerned persons to demand a compensation even if their former employers are not to be discovered anymore.
The law established a fund of 350 million £for all that were diagnosed after July 2012 supported by the insurance industry be able to prove a contact, but not be able to sue anybody.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80% of what a court could have given to them in a normal compensation process - roughly 120,000 £.
Some 300 successful applications in the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan feels like so many Mesotheliom concerned that £350 million represented a 'very good work of the insurance industry.
"That is a deal of insurers for insurers", he says, and points out that it is a question of a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay with the case of this sum if the time had not passed over that and Mesotheliom ills find the enterprises and they could sue normal.
Also Mike penning, former work and retirement minister, admitted that the law is not "perfect".
But both penning and Morgan admitted that faced with seven deaths a fast action is necessary daily.
"The people suffer so much and need help today," said penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom-law in December of last year.
At this point, Mr Abbott was for 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski.
According to their first deliberations Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, of which he unlike Tom treasure a positive impact expected.
This has been accompanied by a radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate more than five years of up to 40%.
Abbott felt strengthened.
That is, of course, with the most important thing, he says.
You can see that again and again in patients.
There is something that you can continue.
If you give up, you are feeling very quickly more bad.
Graham Abbott subjected himself to the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
After concern scans is showing no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There have been several cancer-spots by my chest.
I became 50.
That is not life-threatening.
That is life-ending.
Again Abbott subjected himself to six chemotherapy cycles.
Now is not a trail of tumours more visible.
But the process is very hard physically and psychologically.
You need to think of practical things - on the money, if I am not more, for example, or to my wife, as the storage water heater timing worked.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
You must look forward.
As father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that is not always easy.
'For parents is the difficult, "he says.
It is difficult to know what we should say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I said to my girls that I would have an illness with which I would not get old.
You responded very different.
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.
She told it to their friends and we got soon many calls.
Ellie was more cautious.
You did not say a lot.
Such discussions are something that have to go through all cancer patients.
But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such conversations are not from hope pulled through, not of a track of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as end to Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma is not life-threatening.
