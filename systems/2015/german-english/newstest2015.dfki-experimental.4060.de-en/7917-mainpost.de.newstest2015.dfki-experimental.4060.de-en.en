There is silence under this treetop
We showed a powerful tribe during our puzzle task of the summer series "My piece of the Rhöner Glück" on the last Friday.
There are still several of these giant trees in the rural district, the shown copy is the "nanny-goat silence oak" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the about 600 years old oak.
It is past fields, basalt stone clusters and basalt stone seas.
A small piece below the kind of bottomless pit of the farmer mountain, a kilometre north of the road to it is wise.
The natural monument looks energetic, it projects over the other trees of the surroundings and it reminds of an American mammoth tree with an extent of more than eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree Stumpf suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, there were only references to the names of origin.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bischofsheimer archive extra and consulted older people from Unterweißenbrunn in order to find out which circumstance has it with the nanny-goat silence oak.
The result of his inquiries remained the very sober explanation for the name.
Accordingly the goat herdsmen are supposed to have driven their animals until about 80 years ago onto the meadows arduously cleared and released from stones from Unterweißenbrunn.
At the foot of the tree the animal guardians exhausted from the rise are supposed to have taken a rest.
Meanwhile the field gained his importance back, because on the meadows goat herds graze in fact again.
The field was in addition declared as the nuclear zone of the biosphere reservation, if Schneider kept on finding the way out.
During the entry of the crowds one should make but caution, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is a popular whereabouts for common vipers.
A path leads from under white Brunn to the tree, but something is hidden.
Other ways are indicated, the direction high Rhön reach and an extended hike.
Where does the water castle stand
A water, which will be sought in our next task, however, is to be found in the level.
The reflection in the gap is already a good impression of the building but we have some historical structures in rural district, to which the building portrait could fit.
Where is our "piece of the Rhöner Glück"?
