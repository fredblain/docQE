Amazon buys $1.04 billion for With
Ginebra has just confirmed, had reported what information on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a number of other things - is buying the video streaming service after for 1.04 billion ($970 million US $).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one had expected a takeover of shrug, but because it was assumed that YouTube would win the company.
Three months ago, it looked as if the sale of With to the video service of Google for a cool billion decided, and the cooperation also appeared of course.
Shrug that only three years ago as Justin.tv was established had started as general Streamingdienst - a living version of YouTube.
Instead of this that it wanted to publish their acts of daring a platform quickly for players in games, a "YouTube for live games", such an insider.
The Twitch-interface.
And '1,081 play', a video genre, in which who preached the (mostly older) give a veneer of secret science theatre, are popular on YouTube already very.
It is now the case that YouTube is often mentioned in order to describe shrug, so it has become the information that YouTube shrug wanted to buy, something boredly, a textbook example of an established engineering company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube was not achieved, since the company reportedly was prepared to pay as much as Amazon.
All that we know at the moment about that is this statement of Emmet shear, president of Twitch: "We decided for Amazon because they believe in our Community they split up our values and long-term visions and they want to help us with reaching there more quickly."
Another secret is, to be honest, the incredible success of With.
For snobs as me that declare that they do sport more gladly than to watch during that, is to watch it to others during the playing heavily to understand the attraction that comes from that instead of taking even the control console into the hand.
It is a thing to look to a friend at 3 o 'clock in the morning over the shoulder while she is creeping through resident Evil and something very else, to watch to a silkworm moth during how it is fired into the head 20 times after each other in call of Duty.
All these games could now just look at you.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games being ego-games today, so the watch without its own control of the look perspective can be a very good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the rapid flows into which Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete whole games in record time, entertaining.
But as long as a game or humor virtuoso is not in this case, his Twitch-channel is not presumably so very much interesting.
But what skeptics know as I have?
After is called of 55 million of different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.
And as exactly Amazon wants to make money from that?
It is difficult to imagine that is so after in instant Ginebra, after such as YouTube simply would have been able to swallow.
But after has something that would have every business: Thousands of young men, which are courted as advertisers.
How the chairperson of Twitch, shear, did not say yet Amazon and Twitch "believe both at the future of the gaming", "and the medium does not show any signs of a shrinkage once - swallow - as spectator sport.
