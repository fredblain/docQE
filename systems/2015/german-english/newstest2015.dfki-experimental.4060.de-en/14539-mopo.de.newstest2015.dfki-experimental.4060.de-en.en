Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At the new countries place are put refugees now in tents.
The Central initial incorporation for refugees in Harburg bursts from all joints.
Now the inside authority made three tents of the Red cross next to that be set up.
The politicians have been informed just before - they are little.
"These beating-jerk actions continue to whip up reservations of citizens and do not give the local politicians any opportunity to participate in the human needs of refugees constructively," says, for example, Britta Mr Mann, group chairman of the Greens, Harburger district meeting
Your party demands that the local administration Harburg provides currently unused houses for housing.
96 refugees can be placed in the three tents.
Reasons for the overcrowding in the initial reception are the influx of those seeking help - and the fact that the authorities do not provide sufficient places in a row facilities.
Many refugees remain therefore longer than the regular three months.
