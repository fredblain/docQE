The school start brought a feeling to the municipalities drawn from missile bullet-hole holes from joy and expectation in the south of Israel, but the signs of the fights are still fresh.

Israel denies these information and reckons that it is a question of fighters with the case of at least half of the killed ones did not present, however, any concrete proofs of these information.
On the Israeli side were 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai workers, killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired off 4,591 missiles and mortar shells during the fights onto Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.

The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gazagebiet and about 250,000 people searched refuge that preliminary shelters were altered into in more than 100 UN schools.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fight continues, the educational authorities last week postponed the beginning of the school year.
