Feminists criticize according to racial issue and police behaviors Ferguson
The unarmed teenager became early this month of a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. killed.
The participants lifted their hands into the air and sang, "Hands high, not fire" while they were waiting before the funeral.
After two week long protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
After their experience put white feminist commentators the sex before the race, when it comes to reproduction right and raise income disparities.
While the tensions were going up in the Middle west, however, and receiving country observation as a whole, Perez saw that the answers were about the race from white women to 100%.
In comparison with the answers of black women shortly to the shots of the 9th August the personal essays with titles as "thoughts" came "of a white woman" to Ferguson "and" feminism does not turn only around the suppression from women "relatively late.
But for Perez that meant an important change.
"I do not believe that one finds many people in the feminism that be about the white and speak privileges in so highly class way she said.
The people felt for this purpose pressed into squeezing out something for the incidents.
It is typical of the crisis in which we are and because the situation in Ferguson lawmaker so that they must put it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of the Ohio state University Ferguson problems onto the light to whom black Americans that, however, are considered not as "Woman topics" in the cultural room are abandoned every day brought.
"I can publish something merry on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes here from everywhere", said Mitchell.
If I post something over how colors stand in their own country under siege, the silence is deafening.
'How can it be for women sure to speak publicly about a relationship, but not on security in the public sphere?' She asked.
For black women as Mitchell who studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the USA there is not any dichotomy between race and sex problems.
For them black women do not have the luxury of clean, had to separate the issues; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women are combining the topics now race and sex in the feminist main stream circles Angela Hattery, professor for women and sex research at the George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"In between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman", said Hattery.
White women have had to be involved in the history to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery the split came between white and black women at the point at which white fighters analyzed the country for the woman right to vote as Susan B. Anthony in the late years of the 19th century and stated that the fight could be successful for the right to vote only for in each case a group: Women or blacks.
'You made the decision to stand up for the right, and the right to vote for blacks should come later,' Hattery said.
If one remembers such things, it becomes conscious to one with power why colored women do not trust white women.
We did not make our job good.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Also after women received the right to vote in 1920, it lasted another decade until white women organized themselves against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of lynching.
The group was almost 40 years after the original request for assistance from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, race discrimination - is a mirror of the time, in which white feminists "call tracing call holds" played with the problems with which black women sat down from each other since generations.
"It would be great if the activists, the feminist platforms traditional over such relief the right to education of a child so seriously would take as they did with the right to design control?" Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second generation that based their career on the fight for reproduction rights and the access to contraceptive means attempt to understand now what means that.
The well-known white feminist activist of their children was two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and has published an article by Rebecca Carroll, certain dates only of the Guardian, which calls for more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope for women who have an other, but parallel reason for understanding a danger being inherent in the body - and opinion on the race which are clearly different in public inquiries - mentioning the changes", wrote Steinem.
Even though Steinem for a more through feminism, be addressed in the race, as well as gender issues are perplexed by some of their comments on the race issue in America but.
Christina summer, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who stole feminism?" Said to She The People that young men in the United States, in particular young coloured men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinems comments on Ferguson are contrary to its previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently a small programme, My Brother 's keeper opened, to vulnerable young black and to help Hispanic men, there was annoying reactions of many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police to the black community is not the only problem that at the forefront of the mainstream feminism is pressing.
After the US border police picked up almost 63,000 unaccompanied capella minors at the southwest border of the country this year, also the topic of the immigration reform goes again onto the surface - this time as a woman topic.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairperson of We Belong Together, of an organization which mobilizes women for the immigration reform said that for a new consideration of the topic as an essential woman topic she must publish only the histories of the immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," Mercado said.
If the great majority of the work visas goes onto masculine immigrants, the women who accompany it are in a position in which they are sensitive to domestic power and exploitation.
"These stories will find a echoes in the women" s organisations, "she said.
