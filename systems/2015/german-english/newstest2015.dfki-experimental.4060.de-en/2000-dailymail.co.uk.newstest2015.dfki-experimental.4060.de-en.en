The hell decade of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have gone by since the frightful siege of the school as the children involved in that suffer today still.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken into Beslan by Chechen militia in a school in southern Russia as hostages.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, have become in the three-day martyrdom that the world shocked, killed.
We returned according to Beslan in order to find some of the victims which had escaped the death with the case of the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrible siege of the school of Beslan at which 334 people died under that 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night in front of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
Caught to Kinder and to parents on 1st September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, as fanatic Islamic terrorists took and killed, that as the worst thing of the evil shone.
The tragedy united West and East in horror, and then turned surprisingly in action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later we returned according to Beslan in order to find some of the victims which had escaped the death with the case of the atrocity in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who overcame resistance, although it will pursue the memory of this terrorist hell forever.
Their best hope?
That the war that has plagued Ukraine now - and die in the children as they - will take now to an end.

I am glad, that many people still remember our terrors on the world and we are so thankful for the help that we received from people in Great Britain and everywhere here.
If I in an online way see the photo from myself as I climb back into the school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and contribute to something like that not happening again.
The boy who fled from the face of bullets in opinion his mother is dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go with 7 years in the school) and survived the three-day siege in the poor his mother Tamara.
As seven year long one he said: "Mama said to me I am supposed to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold their hand."
After an explosion he thought that it would die.
She said to him: 'Course.'
Full fear it can be dead, he fled and a crying small child saw on the way, it took with the case of the hand and fled through a ball hail.
His father Vladimir, who concluded his son out there in the poor, said: 'There told me that is dead his mother.
He said: 'I could not save it.
In reality had stumbled according to Tamara outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, for her part their part in the assumption that their son died.
After its reunification she said: "I wept with joy.
I could not believe it.
He went in and embraced me.
There has been flown to London (by the now dissolved newspaper News of the World) in order by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie the title of a useful accessories Children 'to champion.
'This horror followed you every day, but I wish I could stop the remembering,' he said yesterday.
But I can say that it is paler in my memory.
I still know that I threw away all my toy pistols directly after that.
But now I can play computer games with shot scenes and that is not a problem for me.
"I am not afraid to go back to the gym, but I do not consider myself.
I remember these children with whom I played in the yard and who did not get it towards outside.
We never say that they have been killed or are dead.
We say that they stayed in the gym.
I remember very well my journey to London, especially at the game product cases, where I could select myself all which I wanted, and the journey in an above open car.
But now he has fear for place such as Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of accident that he and his friends.
This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering that.
"I am so sorry to all those who suffer under the abominations," said Damir, the last week as a volunteer in a Convent worked.
I want to help so gladly.
I want to go one day to the police and hope that they take me next year at the training academy.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, you can imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply not any children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
You can still vividly recall their trip to London with Damir.
The people of London wept when I told our history.
At that time I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, and their support.
It was thankful for the price and the possibility to travel to London in the fall 2004 to Cherie Blair and to their foundation
I wish I could Cherie call and simply say that have passed 10 years, but I am still remind me of the meeting her and her husband in London, and how the there and has helped me.
I remember as Damir wanted to eat borshch and they called all local Russian restaurants.
I remember, as he with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot with its water pistol on them and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised, that the Britons in a so inclined way divided our pain and supported us.
She said: "I always think that this world did not become better during these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war goes on now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children were killed and are still killed.
These are precisely such children as our.
I think that for many the war is a part of the news which they hear if they are bored or occupied with something else.
I simply know what these people feel the whole horror.
And I can not cease to feel.
Nothing has changed, the people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir became large and is a very soft and quiet boy, it is not aggressive or angry at all.
He does not seek revenge, for example, for it is not overwhelmed by the last dreadful atrocities.
I know that he does not like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class and they go occasionally in the sports hall and ignite candles there.
When it was smaller, he suffered from that - I remember as he laid onto the sofa sometimes, turned away the face from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I remember, as he threw all its weapons and other military game witness. There is now 17, greater than I, Catherine, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so secure for some hours that it is dead and I would never again see it
When I recovered after the explosion and came to the legs, I looked around, and the hell looked around me around, with parts of the body lying around everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my small boy could have survived in this hell.
"I remember that I called on him," Damir,, run away ', but I was also so sure that he had not heard me.
But he has heard it and it is ears when she ran away.
And so the life, different than that of many others, for us goes wider.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy, whose terrible image after the siege become a symbol of abominations of Beslan was
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004, to the right a picture of Georgij today
His face covered with blood was drawn from fear when he went to his life, while Chechen terrorists were shooting down its class, however.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped it off for his first school day before she hurried loosely in order to bring their older son Wladimir to the university.
"I left the farm. For two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so my small boy remained alone there for three terrible days' she remembers.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they have been killed all.
Only my Georgy managed to survive.
The closer we come to this date, the more difficult it is to remember and to talk about it.
There is not any single day, at which we do not remember this tragedy.
We do not think that it long ago is, I believe that it would be done yesterday, some scenes from these days constantly follow me.
No one will ever forget, I can assure you.
Powerful: The image of Georgij (to the left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (to the right).
I remember, that Georgij wanted to go so gladly on this day to the school. He said he wants to embrace his teacher.
I knew only that he was alive, when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not see the picture gladly, and it is hidden with us at home in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also believe that the people in the world thanks to this image our pain.
Mr says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
"I doubt that we ever find out the truth.
The people examine such tragedies again and again and never find out the truth.
And now they examine the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we find out ever what caused it?
This world becomes something terrible.
"I cannot understand how this is possible, because if you ask the people, nobody wants a war, so how is this happening?
Ten years have nothing in such pain.
We need dozens of years, around it one to forget little in a small way.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I have had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it was better.
I went later in the year 2004 back in school and had every day fear.
I thought of my friends and classmates, which had been killed.
For that I always go into the gym when the 1st September comes closer.
I want to say my old childhood friends toll.
It is difficult for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I do not feel as victims, this story is now a part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I do not pity myself.
My life goes on.
I have completed this year the school and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I will become heart surgeon.
My first election was a training in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health did not let this happen.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy lived, to feet, even though it was caught a murderous terrorists
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was during the siege caught to root of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, it was caught in the gym and was next to the bomb, which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is really a miracle that he was not killed.
"We feel it as if it have been yesterday", says Georgij that wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but could not do this because of his sanitary damages due to the siege.
It is still with me, it is not anything which I have let behind myself.
I am now older and people say that children can deal with terrible experience - I must say that this is not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt after that a little better in fact, however I cannot forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - the year after that - was the first and only time that I back into the gym.
I lost the consciousness.
I will return never again there and they do not ask me to show you where I was in this famous picture.
Survivors': Georgij Fanijew today, with a host of themselves in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry it every day with me.
My friends know that I do not like to think and speak or they never asked me after the school.
I am well physically.
I should be careful with my injured knees, but I can now go well.
But because of my health I could not study at the secret service academy of the FSB in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I have my documents also the medical ones sent in and they answered, that it is not possible.
The animals have been my second passion, so I went to the veterinary institution.
I have already there two years behind me.
He learns the treatment of all animals "of cats up to cows".
He said: 'I knew that I would report back to my children never by my experience.
About that children should not know anything and they should not suffer it as a matter of course either.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain leaves me never.
It is in my soul, worse, if the anniversary comes closer.
I will go to the celebrations in memory.
I know that Georgij will not go.
It must be much more for him, because he was there and I do not.
I waited at home on him and could not help.
I am God so grateful that it was returned to me. Here in Beslan all of them are drawn
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in it.
It is heavy to accept that when something so Unfair happens to one.
He is a boy, it may sport, but it can not due to its knees.
He was operates on several occasions that he can run, but no sport.
I would say that he overcame the horrors to 50%, but one can never overcome that and forget that.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbours were killed during the siege and the only increases my pain.
I lost many people who I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart cries for the people killed.
I know of families, in which new children were born, but also of widows, the never again have married.
It is heavy to accept that the life goes on even if one does not want that.
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw it in the hospital.
And now I see what in the world goes on - wars in other regions.
What do these people fight for?
Why do they kill each other.
The war is now very close to our country and I can almost not believe that.
We were formerly a friendly country, as it can be that we fight now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that in Ukraine have many children were killed and many be killed.
If we include and could throw out all these rebels, as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby who was borne movingly so by a special task force out of danger
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is saved by a Russian special task force (to the left).
It is now ten (to the right) and does not remember the atrocities at all.
The world stopped in 2004 the breath when the baby Aljona was taken into the pauper of a Russian policeman by Beslan from the siege.
The terrorists made her go, but they held up their 30-year old mother, the 10-year old sister Kristina and their brother Makhar in the school gym in their cruelty.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Your father Ruslan got married since then, and has a little girl, with its new wife Svetlana that he named after its lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the siege and grew up to an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
"You are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children", a close friend says.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that approach with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
