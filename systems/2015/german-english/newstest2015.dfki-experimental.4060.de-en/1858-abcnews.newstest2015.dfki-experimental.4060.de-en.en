Perry from Texas says that reducing tweet was not authorized
A tweet of official account of the Republican Texas Governor Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a reduce comment on the democratic local government lawyer that is at the heart of a legal charges against it because of the abuse of power.
The tweet was put out later and user account was compensated for it by another from Perrys who denied the previous one.
Just a tweet which was not authorized by me was sent from my account.
"I do not approve of the tweeting and removed it", it was said in the later information
Employees of Perry did not answer inquiries for comments immediately.
Although the tweets of Perrys went out official user account, it was not clear who in fact helps himself the Feed.
In the former tweet a disadvantageous picture was drawn of the district state attorney of Travis county, Rosemary Lehmberg that was condemned in April 2013 because of drunken driving.
Perry inserted a veto against a financial promotion of their office when she refused to resign which led into Austin for an accusation against Perry - who could be a premiership candidate possibly in 2016 - in front of a gravel jury this month.
The text of the tweets: 'I am not always drunk with the triple permitted alcohol mirror. But if I do, I would accuse Governor Perry, if he ausplaudert.'
I am the drunk democrat in Texas.
Loam Bergs office was not with the leadership on the investigation into the Grand jury against Perry.
This has led to a special prosecutor from Michael McCrum from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and the prosecution called a political trick.
His highly class team of legal advisers applied with the judge entrusted with the case, to reject the accusation and argued, that the law with which against the service-oldest governor in the history of the Texas state is proceeded is unverfassungsgemäß diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of public money to the Public integrity Unit of the state - that is based on County in Travis and investigates cases of government corruption in Texas - than Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto guaranteed for a public complaint on the part of a left watchdog-group.
Perrys official account is updated often - and sometimes famous.
After it had closed with the case of the election meetings in Iowa during his premiership candidacy 2012 as Fifth, Perry understood on speculations that it will stop in his posting a tweet of a photo of themselves while jogging near a lake with the words "South Carolina, we come"!
