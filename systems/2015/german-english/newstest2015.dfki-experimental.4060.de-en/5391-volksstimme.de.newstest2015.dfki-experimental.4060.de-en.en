On the hopping-castle during the castle garden party some was on Saturday rid.
The concept of the organizers was right.
In spite of the strong downpour at the Saturday evening approximately 1200 music fans came to the Open-Air-celebration in the castle garden.
The admission temporarily had to be stopped.
"That was angry," said Ron SEM, one of the organizers.
Salt whisk l light and fun.
Maxim Sachraj and Ron SEM formed the name Amula from two Spanish words.
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler castle garden is supposed to radiate brightness through various shows on day and at the evening.
Na, and the fun comes in any case of alone.
That was proved already on the early Saturday, when the first visitors to the Open Air prepared themselves.
The organizers had promised a party for all generations.
And they succeeded in this.
Around the supply stands at the castle garden meadow Salzwedeler had it, but also guests from their immediate surroundings.

He was shortly before 5.30 p.m. on the visitors, particularly families were looking for the space and dry.
But the attractiveness of this did not diminish.
"More people came than expected," would say Ron SEM, who spoke of a "success on the whole line".
Therefore, nothing is opposed to a repeat of the major party in the coming year.
Although at content and size of the events must be done, SEM made clear in a first balance on Sunday to the people.
He designated as annoyed, that meanwhile the admission had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company with too little forces have been booked.
The consequence: Some that already had paid did not come anymore to the ground.
