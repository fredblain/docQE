Matthies means: Highest time for the great cross-linking
Faced with the galloping technical progress that it threatens to change our comfortable into High-Tech control rooms home our columnist Bernd Matthies with some extremely familiar electronic accessories comforts himself.
While I am writing that here, my look falls onto the coiled cord which unites the listener with the telephone, and I think: Boah, as retro that is then?
But a consideration is behind that: If the cable was not, all listeners would fly around in shortest time in an abandoned way in the house, and that would be still significantly more retro.
Already applies in the disgust Tron, (disgust Tron,?
No, typing error: Electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty is electronic waste from today, from tomorrow, bought - is out of date.
And who has a tube television set for example today still in the living room, that one only says in this way that he refuses television fundamentally.
Why these considerations?
Because the pushing of the IFA makes our absolute incompetence to us clear again at the radio tower in this week in questions of the electronics.
The layman who mastered formerly washing machine and CD Player blindly does not understand today even the purpose of the devices which are spread with incomprehensibly vain Expertensprech in front of it "connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promise us the press office.
It still works?
Over what one is supposed to talk to people, the apparently voluntary such curd expand?
Basically it is a question for about 20 years particularly of our being supposed to cross-link our house most pleasingly.
So that the yogurt itself reorders itself so that the fire detector on vacation informs us on the Maldives that it burns in the study Grad.
And would it not be wonderful if we by the office from the airconditioning on our early arrival...?
Yes, however, requires an air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly will soon be true: We raise our watch, tell her according to 'vacuuming!' - and at home from the dust Aug.
Misleading.
Everything does not come to anything smaller than a revolution does: "The borders between white and brown product become blurred", a branch expert whispers, one can connect the washing machine with some headphones, who sends to steam the weather report and the data glasses indicate how long the pizza still needs in the oven, what, however, does not use anything because we stand in the jam.
From the daily practice we also know: If a fashionable equipment is really urgently needed, is guaranteed the battery empty.
What a further reason for this is that the coiled cord will withstand the next radio shows at the telephone.
