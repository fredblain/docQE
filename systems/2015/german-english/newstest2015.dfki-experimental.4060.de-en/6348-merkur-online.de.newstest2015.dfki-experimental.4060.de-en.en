The seemed very different positions, as with the history of the Wolf Council Hauser Castle and a possible reconstruction should be handled.
Now the two warehouses on each other move too: Conversations are supposed to be led already soon about a common procedure.
The association executive boards confirm to Torsten Sjöberg (Castle association) and to Herbert Piffl (Castle friends) on demand of our newspaper that.
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could get together once", tells Sjöberg.
