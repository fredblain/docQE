Richter stops law temporarily, that all abortion clinics could force in Louisiana for the closing
A US federal judge stopped on Sunday the conversion of a law into Louisiana, from which attorneys say that it would presumably have led to the closing of all five abortion clinics of the state, temporarily.
This measure which was raised by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, in June for the law and is supposed to come into force on 1st Sept. would force doctors who carry out abortions to gaining a reception admission right near a hospital within a radius of 30 miles around their practice.
The decision of the judge means, however, that the doctors for the time being legally abortions continue to carry out, while they can apply for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue working law-consistently while they are making an effort to obtain these rights, wrote federal judge John deGravelles in its judgment.
Within a month will be set a hearing for the judges, for the law in order to bring about a more permanent decision.
Abortion proponents welcomed the decision, the youngest one in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors would win so more time in order to attain hospital installation rights.
"Meant" the present decision that the women escape "in Louisiana" "an insidious law that wants to take their health and their rights from them", Nancy Northup, president and chairperson of the center for reproduction rights that had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics of the state in order to stop the law, said.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment applied also to the doctors from the two clinics which had not followed the complaint and applied also installation rights at it.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that enacted similar laws and courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for not constitution.
Key places of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the clinics remained in the state for the closing, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion supporter and the American college of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association say that investment rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors.
Abortion opponents argue that the measures are used for the protection of the health of women, although some welcomed the effects of a closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who carries out in Louisiana abortions, has Patienteineinweiserechte, told the Centre for reproductive rights.
If all remaining doctors are forced in the state not to carry out any abortions anymore, this doctor would not carry out the operation anymore for fear around his security said the group.
Their argument against the judgment said representatives of the State of Louisiana that they would punish no doctors because of the implementation of abortion, would be during their requests for I way rights still pending.
