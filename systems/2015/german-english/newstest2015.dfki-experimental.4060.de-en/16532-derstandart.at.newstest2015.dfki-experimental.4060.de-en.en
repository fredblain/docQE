Huthi-rebels block streets in Yemen 's capital
In the conflict between Shia Huthi-rebels and the Yemeni government the Houthis called for civil disobedience in Sanaa capital.
Huthi-supporters would have filled on Monday central streets in Sanaa, said a speaker of the Huthi-party "Ansar Allah".
Also access to the Parliament was blocked.
Yemeni media report on a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online-edition of the newspaper 'Yemen Post' Huthi-leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called on Sunday evening for the measures.
Huthi threatened according to the tables with a further escalation of the conflict, if his demands should not be met.
The Shia Houthis are fighting for more independence from the Sunni governed Yemen and call on the resignation of the government.
The tribe of the Huthi is besieging for just two weeks the Yemeni capital.
About 30,000 rebels constructed protest warehouses at the big access roads from Sanaa.
In the surrounding area it results again and again in bloody fights with the Yemeni army.
