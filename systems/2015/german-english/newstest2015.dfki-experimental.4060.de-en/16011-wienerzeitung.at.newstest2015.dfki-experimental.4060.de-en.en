Konstantin Weckers merciless, honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical report than biography, which brought Konstantin Wecker, singer-songwriter, pacifist, into "Monk and warrior" political-surely activist, ex-prisoner, on 287 pages to paper.
Not chronologically, but more thought shred for thought shreds the inhabitant of Munich born on 1st June 1947 wrote down his memoirs, introduced every chapter through a suitable song text.
And it is in this case ruthlessly honest: From the onanism as a Gymnasiast up to the shoplifting and drug consumption he does not skip any human weakness.
Also, in order to show how he learned even tolerance in the contact with his fellow men.
Broad space are also abstract, but all the more important terms: Love, soul, ego, the existence in the now, spirituality - all the he tried to get to the bottom, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And it explains also his pacifism, his social criticism, his political engagement - and also, as only the music did not shape him (the opera lover became the Soul and skirt musician), but also his prison stay.
Latter familiarized also the ascetic monk that arises for "through subtraction" with the playboy Konstantin Wecker as he says "when one leaves out everything unnecessary".
Between all the highly-intellectual opinions there are, however, also short anecdotes for the derivation: About instance about fights in a restaurant frequented by GIs or a crazy drive in the case of which he aimed for a tree frontally.
There he is also be brutally honest.
