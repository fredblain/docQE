The tradition of graduation balls in the US is transferred to the universities, where incoming appearances by private aircraft are offered.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and the first luxurious travel service of Britain for students today.
In order to be able to make a particularly impressive performance at the University, the company also offers transport options as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce phantom, Aston marten or McLaren P1.
Mr leaders also declared that the service has a security section.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise would have to drive their belongings through the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF-options we look forward to guaranteeing for the students reaching the university with a minimum of expenditure and a maximum at luxury this year.
An enterprise speaker said that there would not be yet any new bookings since the service was just introduced first added, however, that Students would book the service in the next weeks.
The company has also stated that it expects a market despite the tuition fees of Â£9,000 per year for this offer.
Distinguish students today in their expectations and claims very of the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is ever more important then to do a splendid first impression and with VIF can one exactly that.
The National Student Union criticized the service, however, as removed.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the nus for higher education said: "This offer seems entirely separated from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who are starting to study this month, face a crisis of the cost of living, since the available financial aid do not keep up with the soaring bills in the form of loans and grants for the simplest bases of life before they can feel at all - to be spent thousands of pounds for something simple as the arrival in the dormitory.
