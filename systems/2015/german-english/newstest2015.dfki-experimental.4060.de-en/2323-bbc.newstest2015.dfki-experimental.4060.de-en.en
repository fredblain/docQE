"Pig-house" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house being for sale which had set it off to itself comfortably in the living room was removed by estate agents when it became clear that it showed a big pig.
The free-standing house has a bedroom, is due to a private street in Ipswich and 120,000 Â£are offered.
A figure of the living room of the house belonged to the details - to which also a pig belonged, that his head onto a sofa had bedded.
Estate agent Connells said the pig on the photo is the domestic animal of the owner.
"The reception mistakenly has been published and is now away a speaker of the company said.
In the plan of the house Connells described the former meeting house than a "unique single-family house with a bedroom."
Although the broker removed the image of the Web site, it still appears on advertising-material.
The house sale guaranteed in the social media for interest as if some would ask whether the pig is contained in the purchase price.
