Putin demanded of Kiev the inclusion of 'national' talks with the eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin required under Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and take them immediately with negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His speaker Dimitri Peskow explained later that Putin did not think in this way that the field of east Ukraine standing under the control of the separatists becomes a part of Russia, but that his status must be defined opposite Ukraine again in order to give the power to the representation of his rights and interests to the Russian-speaking region
Putin "s appeal to the government to negotiations on an equal footing with the Russian insurgents, however, is on the since the beginning of the riots five months ago seems to be persecuted strategy: Assistance for the separatists in the adoption of territories and pressure on the Ukrainian Government to allow place the newly proclaimed region Novo expo-centre de facto independence for an alliance with Russia with the West.
In an interview with the state television channel: Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions Donetsk and Luhansk that were adopted in March and April, Moscow was annexed the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently held the area as' Novo expo-centre 'or' New Russia ', a term that recalls the vorrevolution√§re center of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the wake of the campaigns Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 images and during government groups civilian communities in the areas of separatists squeaker attack hope for early peace talks' trapped in their illusions', this.
"We must begin immediately detailed discussions, not only to technical issues, but also to the political organisation of society and the State of status of the South-East Ukraine, in order to protect the interests of the people who live there, 'he said.
Peskow said that had to be seen Putin "s reference to the statehood in the context of the greater autonomy, which will be discussed for months ago by the leadership in order to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that threatened their cultural and linguistic rights.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern fields, said Peskow.
We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskow said, 'because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine'.
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin "s remarks underscored the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, unlike the direct Annektion of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have annexed far greater difficulties the regions Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine there most of the 6.5 million people no Russians and turned out from the time before the conflict a broad majority to remain in Ukraine.
The autonomy which was spoken to by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine proxy to discuss own commercial agreements and exterior relationships, and give so the Kremlin de facto the control of a field which combines the Russian state field with the Crimea.
The home port for the majority of the Russian navy as well as an important commercial port and historical coast region is the five months ago annexed peninsula in the Black Sea.
The regions between the biggest area in Russia and the Crimea is, moreover, rich in mines, factories and foundry that produce important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko suggested during his speech for the inauguration on 7th June that the Ukrainian legislation is supposed to consider - after new choices - additions to the constitution with which a greater control is empowered to the respective fields about their finances and the status of the languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems in sharp contrast with those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, has been accused of their arming and incitement Moscow.
Putin "s last request to Kiev to negotiate with the separatists leaders on an equal footing, followed an further encroachment of the rebels in the past week after that Russian troops and tanks on the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov in the eastern Ukraine.
The separatists supported by Russia took control in the surprise attack which according to apprehensions of Ukrainian security guards the first step of a campaign for the takeover is to the strategic coast region up to the Crimea from Nowoasowsk.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations began to Mariupol, to strengthen a steel industry port with 500,000 people that lies between Nowoasowsk and close access to the Crimea.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and asked urgently a former Soviet republic which is independent for 23 years for actions in order to prevent a further Russian aggression against Ukraine.
'We are on the eve of the point of no return,' warned Poroshenko.
There are thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU peak did not conclude any concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia which are supposed to come into force with the case of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks pillars and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week in order to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, Speaker of the Ukrainian of National Security and Defence Council reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers who have been included by the Russian incursion into Ilowajsk, have been exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers that had been taken prisoner a week ago on Ukrainian territory told Lysenko on Sunday.
