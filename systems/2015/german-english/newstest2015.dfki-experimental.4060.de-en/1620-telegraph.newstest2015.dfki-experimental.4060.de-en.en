Lenny Henry: My father has never taken me to the poor.
Never said "I love you
Henry was one thing of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in the year 1958.
His father, who had died when Henry 19 has worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry performed for a comedy, every jobs', which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and the series to Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited many therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thinking about its relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
One never saw his face, heard only his voice Stop with the crash.
Leave your sister in peace.
Move!
I want to look cricket.
My older brethren Seymour and Hilton - the were already grown up, when I was a child - went with him in the pub and talked about things, such as the form of beer glass or the beauty of a cricket.
I never had such a conversation with him.
A majority of my life it this serious form in the corner that read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in the days of his father, but it won an insight into how the life may have been for him.
It is now somewhat brighter, but they are dark to buy, deep stygische labyrinth 84kg with fire and smoke and a great deal of soot.
My father simply lay down formerly into the tub and then one could hear it slowly how he started singing because it could wash the foundry of themselves.
When I pictures there, it was clear to me that he had done so for years, in order to bring the food on the table, and my respect for him was greater.
Nevertheless Henry grew up as a child without love evidence of his parents.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you".
Only when it was my mother against the end of their lives badly, we began to "I love you, I love you, I love you to say.
By its own daughter Billie, with Dawn, he was able to share the love that he had missing as a child.
You could stop once with that "I love you"?
Hearing but to embrace me.
But Daddy, I am 22.
With Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
It is a great mother.
It is gotten used still with French with which it was married 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why should we not be friends?
It is a great mother.
Henry 'own mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to their death.
When I was so very, very overweight and symptoms of diabetes showed, said my doctor "you must be radically.
That is why I went through this fitness and also a drastic diet had to do in order to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is hard.
No one eats like carrots.
Henrys career change is perhaps in his elegant, a Bart.
Since it was praised by the critics for his Othello, it is captured by the theater.
This was followed by The comedy of errors, and then fences of August Wilson.
That is another experience than the sitcoms and dies that filled its occupied working life.
It began with only 16 years ago, when he was working in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage, when he people imitation and wrote to New Faces about it.
His television career began in the middle of the 1970s. "I was the only black clone / comedian on television for a very long time."
He learned in the profession.
I did not have to become tall only before the eyes of the public, but learn also from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient Witze-Erz√§hl-Maschine while I was being a star through the television and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 with New Faces
There his manager the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show had, a light conversation program in which the people painted themselves black Henry performed his Comedy there more than five years.
That was very unpleasant to my family.
I wish somehow that it would be never happened, but I do not regret that I have done.
It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I have worked in giant projects and have learned how to deal with a large public.
But this "prize-winning light column of the British watching television lasting for years was also a" grotesque parody of black people. "
Through the introduction of figures, both the British black culture, celebrated mock as Henry worked in the 1980s to an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of Lenny Henry show went 1984 on shipment, and in the nineties, he was, among other things, as the chef Gareth Black lock in the comedy series boss!.
Advertising documentaries, TV-series and reels of film shaped his next decade, but according to his BBC-series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought himself: "What you do as next, Len, because it feels so everything when you bring only the time for that or kick a little on the place."
After that, a documentary number came to radio 4 with the title What "s So Great On...?
The first consequence turned around Shakespeare.
I was downright allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never learned something about it correctly in the school and mainly held it for a domain of the middle class, whiteness, in tights and a cabbage in front in that.
So I had big fear.
All of us who for the show interviewed, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said 'you should try it.
Do not make it bad if you do not know what they are talking about.
Take a few words in their mouths, and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare.
Henry listed 20 lines from Othellos of last speech for the documentary and it was enthusiastic.
I had the feeling that I could create.
It was almost as if someone would have put me on its head correctly.
"For that it works, it is a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, investigates a little.
The tests were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car crash, and this happened not easy.
And soon he was in the comedy of errors.
I was sudden in the national theater and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment, as I thought, 'Oh, you have changed.'
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to maintain the audience.
A small voice said to me, 'You must bridge 10 minutes now, while they are dealing with the computer. "
Instead of this the stage conductor announced that the idea would go on as soon as the problem is solved.
I went from the scene and anything in me said 'Oh, thank God'.
I am not responsible for this.
I can leave it to anyone else.
"You plays in a play, in other words, in your role. '
Henry in fences at the Duchess Theatre
The text for fences to learn was demanding.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the sinews.
The sold well, so it is as a great sign of the gods, which tell me here is' "provision.
He says this, of course, with a thundering voice.
So I will say it.
I really love that.
I love to be a test.
Henry still has, however, the head of one comedian - our conversation is from humorous outbreaks pulled through, while he is imitating persons again and again.
I decided not to make any Stand-up-Comedy because I believe that this type of immediate satisfaction of a Chamber is somehow dangerous to full foreigners.
If one is looking for that, it is in this way to a wall.
I perform sometimes live in the Apollo if I fancy for this purpose, but in total it does not give to me so much as formerly.
I would like to ask him whether he will make a Stand-up-Comedytour ever again.
The fun that I have in an area with a director, which helps to craft a start, a central part Member and the end of a journey - I do not believe that I would ever like to give up again.
So here is the its new incarnation?
I have already think.
I am a actor.
It is a mockery.
One always tells a history and that is great.
I love stories.
The people love stories.
