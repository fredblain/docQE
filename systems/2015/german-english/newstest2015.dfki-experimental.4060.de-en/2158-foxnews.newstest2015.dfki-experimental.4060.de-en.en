4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you wish to make photographs or videos underwater, there is a choice of equipment.
The cheapest option is a watertight Point-And-Shoot, such as the Nikon AW120 or a Action-Cam as the first Hero3 + Silver edition, which are both for about $300.
I have received these photos of a family party with several cameras available for a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a watertight camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other subjects are closed.
Put your camera on the photos or videos, which you want to capture.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and photo modes with which the exposure time is optimized for the dim underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, you check until which depth your outfit is operative.
Some cameras are approved only for up to 5 feet, others to 50 or 60 feet.
Search for digital cameras in our purchase leader and the evaluations for traditional and waterproof models.
You are multiple photos - because many will not work.
Point-and-Shoot cameras have a LCD, with which you can compose pictures, Action-Cams usually not.
Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to do so under water, and the right image attitude is a matter of chance.
So you do many photographs
If your camera has a row mode with which a series of photos with slightly changed illumination attitudes are done, you use it.
You remain near the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse the wider you leave the surface.
If possible, they remain so close to the surface if you do photographs in a pool, a lake or the sea.
So you can also bring more color in your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Approach close to the objects.
The country is also a good Council under water, but it is all the more important because of the bad light conditions.
It is completely especially important if you work with an Action-Cam: These devices have often a firm wide-angle coverage lens which means, that you thicker onto your objects must, if these are supposed to fill the entire picture frame.
