Tax burden of businessmen in the area Washington increases with the economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local notices of assessment assessment notices bills demands levies for enterprises in the country went up in the last year easily while the economical recovery was speeding up, such an again published study in the last week, and the companies in the Washington room did not form any exception.
Companies in the area District, Maryland and Virginia paid 27.6 billion to state and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8% against the revenues of 2012 at the level of 26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of companies rose last year by 4.3% to 671 billion, compared to $3.9% in the year before, and it was the third growth year in a row decisions after the several years of decline in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose to more than the local taxes, by 4.3%, so the study by the services agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State taxation, was carried out of a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenue of the District, 56%, comes from corporate taxes, while 36% of revenue Mary ends up are coming from companies.
Virginia is the least tax revenue with 28% of companies.
Much of the increase in the tax revenue is justified in a recovery of the GDP of companies, say the researchers, which led to an increase in the real estate taxes by 3.7% in this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1%.
While a large proportion of these profits was coming from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the course seems to extend to Washington.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia paid more than $10 billion at state and local property taxes in the last year, compared with $9.6 billion 2012 - an increase in a year by 4.2%.
But the apparent recovery with the case of the real property values is not so effective in Maryland during the rise of state and local tax yields since the real property taxes amount to just more than one fifth of the notices of assessment assessment notices bills demands levies of enterprises here.
Companies in Virginia and DC pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland following happens: A big part of the real properties, in particular in the tax field around D.C., is either in the possession of the government or of non-profit-organizations that" do not "pay" any real property taxes, said Douglas to Lindholm, manager of the center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely on the income taxes for example much more in order to be able to offer the same services which other states offer.
The recent recovery in the tax revenues by companies alone cannot be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market
Corporate income also seem to recover, such as the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes in state organizations of 2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend is going into the same direction, the local tax burden does not go up for enterprises at all three places evenly
The increase in rate in the District was 4.3% with the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only Virginia reported a average tax revenue from 4.1%.
Virginia has by far the least corporate income taxes (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates) with 6% in all three areas of competence.
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is approaching at 8.25% and the relatively high 9.975%.
A similar study of the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year has shown that in Virginia smaller state and local corporate taxes are required, and there is a better overall tax climate than in Maryland.
In the study was not investigated the District.
Despite the advantages Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina passed legislation to reduce its corporate tax rates this year of 6.9% to 6%, the same rate as Virginia, and the sentence will fall in the coming year to 5%.
If the government continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the corporate income tax rate of the state to 2017 apart from 3%.
In the meantime, it seems as though the small businesses in the room Washington better to leave, and they pay therefore more state and local taxes, such as the recent study.
Corporate taxes that are paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a temporary structure that most small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose last year about 20% to 2.4 billion, a clear faster growth rate as corporate taxes as a whole.
The researchers say that the trend and the rise near the enterprise steering wheels as a whole will presumably stop country this year with a rise of the general increase dam tax yields for the state and the local governments about 6.2 percent in the first three quarters 2014 in comparison with the same period of the previous year.
But the Washington area may lag behind if the spending cuts in the federal government for the labour market in the region.
