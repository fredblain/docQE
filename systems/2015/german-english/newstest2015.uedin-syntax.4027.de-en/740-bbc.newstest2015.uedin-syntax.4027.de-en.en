NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
At the weekend, there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the centre of Newport to an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people from the local town hall in Cardiff came together to hold a so-called anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has followed the developments over the weekend for us and spoken to protesters who have travelled from Bridgend in Belgium.
