Some international companies are already at a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not just a medical crisis, but also an economic one," says the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the hardest hit
"It is a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," said Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes at the second-largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
On the market only if you want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, here alone fell victim to the fever of more than 600 people.
