The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affected flights from Adelaide Airport
The spring has brought a wintry surprise in South Australia, with heavy showers and strong winds affected flights from Adelaide airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m. further 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6,6mm that were already gone down in the night on Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a casting, which began shortly before 8 p.m. and was almost 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After last week's winter had ensured an early dose of spring, temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to a maximum of just 15.8 ° C.
The böigen weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a flight of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a wind shear - a sudden change in wind speed and direction over a short distance - and had to run through.
Wind gusts reached about 50 km / h on the ground at the Adelaide Airport at this time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to start with a second landing by finally around 20.40 p.m. set.
The flight delay led to the delay in the wake of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and Hoschar AG-flight from Sydney.
A maximum temperature of 16 ° C on Tuesday is forecast for Adelaide, with possible showers.
