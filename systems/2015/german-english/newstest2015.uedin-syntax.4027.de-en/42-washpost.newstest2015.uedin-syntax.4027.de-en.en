Tax burden of businessmen in the Washington area is rising with the economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country rose slightly last year, while the economic recovery accelerated in the past week, and the companies in the Washington area, according to a newly published study were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia paid $27.6 billion in state and local authorities together in the 2013 financial year, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to revenue of $26.6 billion in 2012.
The state and local tax burden of businesses rose by 4.3 percent to $671 billion last year, compared to 3.9 percent in the previous year, and it was the third year in a row after several years of falling voided in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes more than the local taxes, increased by 4.3 percent, according to the study, which was conducted by the Center for State taxation, a tax policy group of the service agency Ernst & Young.
More than half of the District, 56%, revenue comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Mary's revenues come from businesses.
Virginia has the lowest tax revenue from businesses, with 28 percent.
A large part of the increase in the tax revenue is due to a recovery of corporate real estate values, the researchers say, which led to an increase in property taxes at 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large proportion of these profits came from big states like California, New York and Texas, the process seems appropriate for the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes together last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - a 4.2 percent increase in the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in the real estate values is not as effective in the increase of state and local tax revenues in Maryland, as in the real estate taxes amount to barely more than a fifth of corporate tax rulings.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"Happens in Maryland is the following: A large part of the real estate, particularly in the tax area around D.C., either by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to be able to offer the same services that offer other states.
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the property market
Corporate revenues also seem to recover, so the data.
Businesses in the region reported income taxes in state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend in the same direction, the local tax burden for businesses is not evenly in all three places.
The growth rate was significantly higher in the District corresponded with the national average of 4.3 percent, while the increase in Maryland, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an average tax revenue from 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income taxes (in all three with 6 percent in all three areas, there are strong business rates).
The corporate tax rate from 8.25 percent in Maryland and the District at relatively high 9,975 percent.
A similar study at the beginning of this year, the US Chamber of Commerce showed that lower state and local business taxes will be required in Virginia and a total of a better tax climate than in Maryland.
The district was not examined in the study.
Despite the advantages, Virginia has been under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates in this year of 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the coming year.
If the government continues to achieve its revenue targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, it seems to be the small businesses in the Washington area, and they are therefore more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes, which are paid by small businessmen as personal income taxes - a transitional structure, organized by the most businesses - in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose by 20 percent to $2.4 billion in the past year, a clear faster growth rate than the corporate taxes as a whole.
The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes across the country will probably continue in this year, with an increase of general VAT revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
However, if the spending cuts by the federal government has an impact on the labour market in the region, the Washington area could lag behind.
