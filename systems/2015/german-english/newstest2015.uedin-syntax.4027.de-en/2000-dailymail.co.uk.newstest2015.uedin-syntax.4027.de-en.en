The infernal tenth year of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the horrific siege of the school, like the spate of children are still suffering.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants in a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, have been killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world.
We have returned to Beslan, in order to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of bestiality in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific school siege in Beslan in which 334 people were killed, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
Children and parents on September 1, 2004, the start of a new school year, as fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed, it seemed like the böseste of evil.
The tragedy brought together West and East in disgust, and then turned surprisingly in action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan, in order to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of bestiality in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will pursue it forever.
Their best hope?
Now that the war that Ukraine will now have to cope with - and in the children as they die - to come to an end.
The girl, which was photographed in the attempt, in the age of school sports hall singer
She was photographed by the Russian Star photographer Dimitri Beliakow and famous, when she was only in her underwear, was in the age of school sports hall singer, after a mine exploded.
Totally confused sought Aida after her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both have been held for dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me that I should run for my life, but I could not," Aida said at the time.
My legs were blood flow.
In order to look after my mother, I stood up and climbed back into the pool.
A soldier brought them to safety.
After a series of operations, they completely healed, but said yesterday: "Before the pain returned three months ago.
I am afraid that I must again be operated on.
Some shrapnel shards are still in my knee.
Their goal is now to be a dentist, in order to help the people, as she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it has not broken me," she says a tear.
"This has happened to me, and that cannot be changed.
Once a year I always stayed in the gym to remind me of it there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it, on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and dreamt of to go to school together.
"I do not want to marry until I finish my studies and my career start.
I think of a family.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, but the memory of each year is a bit weak.
I am pleased that many people in the world still remember the horrors and we are so grateful for the support we received from people in the UK and all over the place.
When I see the photo online of me, as I understand our disaster in the school zurückklettere I think that many people see it for the first time, and to ensure that this does not happen again.
The boy, who fled by bullets, in the view that his mother is dead
It was his first day (Russians go with seven years in the school) and Tamara survived the three-day siege in his mother's arms.
As seven years, he said, "mom told me that I should get me if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him: "Run."
Full of fear that they could be dead, he fled and saw the baby on the way to a wine, took it by the hand and fled by bullets.
His father, Vladimir, into the arms of his son out there, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said: "I could not save them."
In fact, Tamara outside stumbled with leg injuries in the hospital, for their part in the assumption that her son died.
After its reunification, she said: "I wept with joy.
I could not believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (of the now dissolved newspaper News of the World), in order to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop with the memory," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it is pale in my memory.
I remember that I wegwarf directly after all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer games with shot scenes and that is not a problem for me.
"I am not afraid to go back in the gym, but I do not think about myself.
I remember these children, with whom I have played in the yard, and have not made it to the outside world.
We never say that they have been killed or are dead.
We say that they are stuck in the gym.
I remember my trip to London, particularly in the toy shop, where I was able to choose everything very well what I wanted, and the ride in an open top car.
But he has now fear for the ground like Ukraine, where wars cause the sort of accident that he and his friends suffered.
This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the answer," said Damir, who last week worked as a volunteer in a monastery.
I want to help so much.
I will one day go to the police and hope that they will take me to the training academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighbourhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there was simply no children who could call and run around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She remembers vividly on their trip to London with Damir.
The people of London cried when I told our story.
I understood at the time, as people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and the ability to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and you say to yourself that 10 years have passed, but I still remind me of her and her husband at the meeting in London, and how it works - and has helped me.
I remember how happy Damir wanted to eat borscht and she cried all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant. - shot with a water pistol on them and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British are so willing shared our pain and supported us.
She said: "I always think that this world is not improved in the last 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war now again, and people die every day, and I believe that many children were killed and still be killed.
These are precisely such children as ours.
I think that, for many, the war is a part of the news that you hear when they are bored or preoccupied with something else.
I just know what these people feel throughout the horror.
And I cannot stop to feel that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that is so sad.
Damir was large and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
He is looking for example not revenge, he is not overwhelmed by recent abominations.
I know that he does not like to remember but he has six close friends from the class and they go occasionally in the sports hall and light candles.
When he was small, he suffered including - I remember, as it is sometimes presented on the sofa, the face away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I still remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys away. - is now 17, bigger than I, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that, for a few hours, I was so sure that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came on the legs, I saw me and saw the hell around me, with body parts lying around everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in the hell could not possibly have survived.
"I remember that I reminded him," Damir, going, going away, "but I was so sure that he had not heard me.
But he has heard it and he ran away.
And, unlike many others, life goes on for us.
Georgy Ilyin, 17
The boy, whose terrible image after the siege has become the symbol of the horror of Beslan
Comfort: The 2004 Beslan-survivor Georgy Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege, on a picture of born today
His blutüberströmtes face was painted by fear when he ran for his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a nurse, had sold him for his first day, before they rushed to bring their older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the court for about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so was my little boy there for three terrible days alone," she recalls.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my born managed to survive.
The closer the date approaches, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is no single day on which we remind ourselves of this tragedy.
We do not think that it is a long time ago, I think it would happen yesterday, some scenes from these days are following me constantly.
No one will ever forget that, I assure you.
Urgent: The image of born (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as statue (right).
I wanted to remember that born on this day are so happy to go to school, he said that he wants to embrace his teacher.
I only knew that he was alive when I saw him on television.
And now there are even this statue of the wine-born in San Marino.
Born does not like the image, and it is hidden at home on the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also think that people around the world feel our pain, thanks to this image.
Born today says: "It is important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People investigate such tragedies again and again and never learned the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is becoming something awful.
"I cannot understand how this is possible, because if you ask the people, no one wants a war, so how is this happening?
Ten years is nothing in such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it just a little.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
About three or four years, I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it was better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and had fear every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were slain.
So I always in the gym when the 1st September approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends of mine.
It is difficult for me to go to the gym, but I must do it.
I am not a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I don't like bemitleide.
My life goes on.
I have concluded the school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I will be heart surgeon.
My first choice was an education in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health has not.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgy Fanijew, 20
The boy, who survived, even though he was caught at the foot of a murderous terrorists
A miracle: Georgy Fanijew was caught during the siege at the foot of a murderous terrorists, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was caught in the gym and sat beside the bomb, which was attached at the foot of a murderous terrorists.
It really is a miracle that he was not killed.
"We feel it, as if it was yesterday," says Georgy, who wanted to go as the FSB intelligence officer, but could not do this because of his health damage due to the siege.
It is still with me, there is nothing that I have left behind me.
I am older now and people say that children can easily cope with terrible experience - I have to say that this is not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and felt better after something, but I cannot forget it.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005, a year later, was the first and only time I went back in the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never do not return and ask me to show you where I have sat in this famous image.
Survivor: Georgy Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is extraordinary and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me after school.
Physically, it is good to me.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can now go well.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB's intelligence academy in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted.
I have submitted my papers, including the medical and they have responded that it was not possible.
My second passion were the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have been there two years behind me.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows."
He said: "I knew that I would tell my children never in my experience.
Children should know nothing and they should not suffer it of course.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "The pain never leaves me.
He is in my soul, worse if the anniversary is approaching.
I will go to the celebrations in his memory.
I know that born will not go.
It must be even more intense for him, because he was there and I do not.
I waited for him at home and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me, and all of them are drawn in Beslan.
It remains in us.
Born is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is difficult to accept that, if a little experience so Unfaires.
He is a boy, he loves sport, but he cannot attend because of his knee.
He was operated on several occasions, he can run, but no sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horrors to 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege, and that only reinforces my pain.
I have lost a lot of people, which I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart cries for the slain.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who have never married again.
It is difficult to accept that life goes on, even if it does not want.
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now, I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country, and I can hardly believe that.
We were once a friendly country, how can it be that we are now fighting?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine, and many more are being killed.
If only we could all use and throw these rebels - as far away as possible.
