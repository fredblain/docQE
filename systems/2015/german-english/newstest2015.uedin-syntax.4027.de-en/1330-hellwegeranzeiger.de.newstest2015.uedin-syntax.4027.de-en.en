The district chairman of the union of German locomotive engineer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, said in DÃ¼sseldorf.
We expect significant cuts.
It does not give regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike was the freight.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything in order to minimise the impact.
The GDL have not said where they wanted to strike, so that it is difficult to foresee the consequences.
