Österreichs after second season victory in third place in the table.
With the 2-0 on Grödig a bitter week for Rapid has taken a hoping end on Sunday.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached a low with the death in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The sense of achievement was incredibly important," confirmed captain and Müller Steffen Hofmann, who came in third place with green and white.
Schrammel Traumtor brings Rapid on winning street Rapid has shown the right response to the disappointment with the second season victory against Helsinki and comes with a success in the countries game break.
"We wanted to show a positive response," said foreign defender Thomas Schrammel, with its splendid leadership-volley from Sechzehnereck has asked the course to victory in the 14th minute.
"I thought, I Hau all the frustration of Thursday purely and schnalzte it under the bar," said the 26-year-old smiling.
The last time Schrammel on 13 Novmember 2010 so far had taken in a league game, it was still in Ried.
The first championship match in Rapid-dress will therefore remain in special memory.
"This is something special for me, I am from the Rapid-kids," said Schrammel.
Due to the short-term pelvic-Blessur of Mario Pavelic became Schrammel from the left to the right defensive side and also did very well in his cause.
He has enough experience, that he can put this position also reversed.
The gate has earned it, he has done some assists this year already, "praised Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel delivered Hofmann's flank for 2-0 after an hour, that finally brought the decision.
Because before that could well can also contact the guests.
"Thank God we have had a bit of luck today," said Schrammel, alluded to the divergence of performance and result in recent weeks: "The results have not voted, but the playful was always good compared to last year."
Barisic was, in fact, that it was "in many games before better than today" - against "the strongest team that has played in this season in this stadium."
The first Dreipunkter since July 26 have therefore proved that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character."
Equally pleasing for him: "That we finally have played back to zero."
A lot of work while countries break Even the fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni alar and Michael Schimpelsberger mourning several failures, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp pushed be citizens gave their Startelfdebüts makes the victory even more valuable.
"We must not forget that," warned Barisic, which lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "which were very stable in recent times."
The countries break should therefore be used to "lick wounds and purchase a bit in physical terms," said Barisic, which has five U21 squad players in its ranks.
The break is particularly suits, one is Captain Hofmann.
He breaks for the team, goes beyond pain over it.
In this difficult stage, he has shown that he is a very important player for us, "noted Barisic.
Hofmann gave the Rapids game before his replacement in the 68 minute not only the structure, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-olds, who completed his 350. Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4: 2 on the eigentlich).
Hofmann: "Cannot believe that everything now is good," "We have certainly had a bit of luck, but eventually the happiness must come back to us.
Now it was time, "he said.
He warned, however, remain to be concentrated: "You should not always black and white.
In the last few weeks we have not played as badly as it has been presented.
But we must not think that all is well.
He did not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It is a very young team that I can help a lot at the moment.
To keep themselves in certain phases, but to me, "he said.
Grödig-coach Michael Baur himself and his team had few complaints.
He regretted the fast against hits "from the category Zaubertor," as well as the regular gate of the farm in the 40th minute by referee Kollegger had been wrongly denied.
The only criticism I can make the team is that we were not specific enough towards the gate at some stages.
Because we have had too few qualifications.
Inside defender Maximilian Karner looked like it: "It is a bad start, but we have only found and even made a gate.
On the whole, it would have been better.
