Konstantin Weckers ruthlessly honest memoir
It is actually more philosophical testimony as a biography that Constantine alarm clock, songs, a pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, "monk and warrior" on 287 pages put on paper.
Not chronologically, but more thought scraps for scraps of thought, written on June 1, born in 1947, his memoirs in Munich, each chapter initiated by a suitable song text.
And he is brutally honest: From the Onanie as high school student to shoplifting and drug use, he leaves no human weakness.
Also, to demonstrate how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Broad areas are too abstract, but even more important concepts: Love, soul, ego, Being in Now, spirituality - all that he tried to go to the bottom, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explained his pacifism, social criticism, his political commitment - and also, as it has shaped not only the music (the opera lovers was the soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has brought the man Konstantin alarm clock live closer to the ascetic monk, "by subtraction" is, as he says, "by all unnecessary has omitted."
There are also short anecdotes between all the highly intellectual views on earth: A tree about beatings in a restaurant frequented by [or a crazy drive in which he head-on target.
Here, too, he is brutally honest.
