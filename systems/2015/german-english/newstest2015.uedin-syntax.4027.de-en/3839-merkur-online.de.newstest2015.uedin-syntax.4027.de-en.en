Merkel speaks Power Word: Toll will come "very clear"
Now it is committed to the Chancellor clearly once again.
A licence for all complicated details but it is not.
Persistent concerns against the car toll for the CDU, the CSU is wroth.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a word of power for the introduction of a car toll after persistent resistance from the CDU.
"To be clear: It is in the coalition agreement, and they will come," said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU-peak bodies in Berlin.
On a detailed model, Merkel is not yet clear.
In the black-and-red government program are "certain parameters."
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) have "made a proposal, and will now go ahead."
The NRW-CDU, however, insists on their "no" vote to a toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch채uble (CDU) also put a constructive role in the discussions for a bill.
Beyond the issue, he spoke with Dobrindt also on other ways to enable more private capital for investment in infrastructure, such as the broadband expansion.
"There is nothing special." Sch채uble had left a "mirror" report comments on Sunday, his house to check its own concept highway to reimburse investors with toll revenues - after the election in 2017.
CSU leader Horst Seehofer, then warned to develop toll concepts against the relevant ministers in the Cabinet.
CDU Federal Deputy Armin Laschet reiterated its objections.
"The coalition agreement was never expect to put all the authorities and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU-country chairman.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Mr Seehofer announced now, once again, to talk about the issue.
Opposition to the plans also comes from the CDU-national associations of Baden-W체rttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
Background are fears that a toll affected local border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had asked about the toll of criticism from within the CDU coalition loyalty.
The left sees the plans in the face of the dispute in the Union as a failure.
"The Murks toll is dead," said party leader Bernd Riexinger of "Neue Osnabr체cker Zeitung" (Monday).
"With the toll fails the minister." Dobrindt wants to introduce a new duty on all German roads, which is expected to start in 2016.
Domestic car owners may be charged according to the coalition agreement but not in addition.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the toll on the car tax.
The model should not penalize foreign drivers but under EU law because of their nationality.
