The Socialists in France should "shut up and put France in order," said the most important ally of Francois Hollande.
Mr Valls called the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reshuffle is met with disapproval at the vast majority of the French.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to remain at his side," he said to loud applause.
As anodyne gesture was the Prime Minister insisted that his government's controversial 35-hour week in France despite intense demands for a relaxation of the rules of the new economy minister, Emmanuel Macrons, will not call into question.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his Mitsozialisten to show "united" with the government.
But the justice minister, Christiane Taubira, rubbing sand in the gears, in which she appeared at a meeting breakaway socialist deputy and the Socialist Party attacked that they take "the belief in their future," the French.
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, derided the constant infighting of the socialists and said that they could not imagine that the new Valls government would stick for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has no, they are not forced to form a new government, if the old times has survived a summer.
"And the new will also do not survive the fall or winter," said Miss Le Pen told supporters.
They repeated their party's reputation after a dissolution of Parliament and said she was confident to emerge victorious in early elections and is ready for government.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was in the EU elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche showed that 76 percent of French people are of the opinion that the Socialist Party is the risk to crumble before the end of 2017 in several rival groups of Hollande's tenure.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new Socialist government cannot improve the economy and record unemployment figures.
"There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
