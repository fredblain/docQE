An exclusive extract from Howard Jacob ons hochgelobtem new novel about love and the letter "J."
They zerflossen, one could best describe it, they are slowly on a box that you have in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he is too serious, exhausting, intense, aloof and perhaps kratzbürstig.
And he shook the hand.
Kratzbürstig knew it.
He was stachelig, such as hedgehogs, yes.
The last victim of the sting was just starting the affair had been promising for a reduction of the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and he might even have brought a degree of satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomon's was a trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and harsh as Port Reuben.
They had come with an older accompaniment to the south, held the Kevern for her aunt, and had inherited a property in a damp but heavenly valley with the correct name Paradise Valley.
Over several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were taking, in the bathrooms were still spinning, nudibranchs had left their mark on all windows and believed that they belong to all of this, and the garden was overgrown with weeds, it looked like a huge cabbage.
It was like the house from a children's tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the list for the Man Booker Prize in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced in the coming week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn Händchen contestants on the broken chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon, both had a spirit absent slotted into the console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news crossed as the sight of her brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer, and his father had listened in closed shutters in the House.
Your feet are too great.
Due to their own aggressiveness songs of this kind were not played more on the console.
Not banned - nothing was really banned - just not played.
It was successfully obsolesziert, such as the word obsoleszieren.
The general taste, which had never managed decrees and regulations, and how people vote in books, the memoir From-dish washer-to-millionaire cookery books and romantic novels, they chose the ballads in the music.
In the euphoria of the day began Kevern big feet to an imaginary piano to play and in a gross-Komische Serenade Ailinns besingen.
Ailinn do not understand this.
"This was a well-known song called a jazz pianist Fats Waller," he told her, and will automatically put two fingers to his lips.
That his father had always done, in order to stop the letter J, before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father, when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, he says.
If you put a word with a J website offpage without two fingers on your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It was not a very funny game, and it was also not very funny now.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what was jazz.
Ailinn had never heard what.
Jazz was not played, even if he was not directly prohibited.
This was no longer of improvisation.
It was the only place for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody, where they would end.
As well as the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically ausgedrückter mind.
Although he was 10 years old, without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz of the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he had to Ailinn not declare that Fats Waller was black.
At their age, they probably could not remember a time, in the Popsänger were not black.
That was again no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society is grateful for the principle of groups agreed with talent, as the fate spared them.
People with Afro-Caribbean origin were suited by temperament and body for entertainment and sports, so sang and ran them.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent as by nature and were served with the task to ensure that no family remained without functioning telephone service.
Still, what was left of the Polish community cared about the sewers; what was left of the Greeks did plate.
Those from the Gulf and the Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly than what had happened, if IT happened geschah- for fear of being accused of Feuerschürens, even for fear that the flames would consume them next - had Labneh- and shisha pipe restaurants opened, kept in mind and have been depressed with the inaction.
Each according to his ability.
Because they had heard only ballads, it fell Ailinn difficult to understand how the offensive words, the Kevern's very front yard had ever could be set to music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They are not really offensive," said Kevern.
Except perhaps for people whose feet are too big.
My father has never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him a false sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of huge cabbage leaves.
Ailinn still do not understand.
Why would your father should love something?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but hesitated to put two fingers to their lips again in their presence.
They already thought that he was a little strange.
"It was fun," he said to him instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and kept Keverns perspective.
There was nothing to see in the world, as her ungekämmtes pitch black hair.
There was nothing that otherwise he would want to see.
"If you say it," they mean no conviction.
But it never explains why you have me vorsingst.
They seemed genuinely concerned.
My feet are too big?
He saw yet again.
Your feet do so directly.
Perhaps your ankle, a little bit...
And then you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
You hate?
Of course I hate you.
This is just the silly song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was still too early.
"Your thick ankles are precisely the reason why you find me gefällst," he tried it instead.
I am a bit perverse.
That sounded not right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he was often in trouble because, like his father, he does not have the soothing charm that you needed to goad the inherent cruelty in jokes.
Perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he wanted to be the, Kevern.
In spite of its kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomon's was red and arose from their deck chair, raised the console and buried the wine they had drunk.
Elder flowers of wine, drunkenness was no excuse for it.
In their excitement, they seemed to tremble, like palm fronds in the storm.
"And your thick head is precisely the reason why I am perverse feel attracted to you," she said.
Except that I am not at all.
They did him tired, both due to unnecessary unfriendliness showed his words as well as the fear in their eyes, as they revolted against him.
They thought that he would beat them?
She had not told him of his life on the cold northern archipelago, where they grew up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially such as here.
The same huge and icy ocean broke up here and there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and verdrießlicher after THE what had happened as it had been their ancestors as smugglers and wreckers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise a hand against a woman, refused to meet them or derided.
Thick head?
It would have shown a big fist, if not farewells.
They only Knut Chen - Knut Chen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the vacuous love ballads from the console - they only beat Knut Chen and then.
Keverns believe it was an unnecessary refinement that Knut Chen was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomon's gave him a sign to go through her body.
He arose from the deck chair as an old man.
They also felt bleiern, but the impact of his grief surprised them.
That was not the end of the world.
They knew very few.
They saw him as he removed himself - as he watched from a room on the top floor of their companion - a man, complained had provoked by something he himself.
Adam leaves the garden, they thought.
They felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against it.
A man turned on her, succumbed to his back, ashamed, defeated, without fighting spirit - why it was a sight that seemed to know them well, if they could not remember a single time, where they had seen something like this before the day before?
When she was alone again, looked Ailinn Solomon's on their feet.
An intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of a number of years before the events, ESME Nussbaum, has just told Ofnow, the non-legislative oversight body for the public mood, in a short lecture on the continued violence in low and middle-level in exactly the areas in which they reduce, if not eliminate, most likely to be expected, given the money and energy that had been invested in the eradication of this violence.
"It was a lot done, and a lot still needs to be done," she wrote, "in order to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that has won a thousand wars and most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country in which the sweet breath of human kindness has historically been rarely felt despite the towering church towers between the hedges.
But some properties are ineradicable.
The higher the tower, it seems, the less the passion he still inspires.
The population cries while listening sentimental mental ballads enthralled with stories about overcome difficulties and claims to believe strongly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but it is not just the former rawness rural communities, as well as our urban fabric firmly in control, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and devious dispute is looking at home, at work, on the streets, and even on the playing fields.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration," her mentor when he had read the entire report said.
I suggest that you read a few novels.
ESME Nussbaum lowered her head.
I must also ask: Are you an atheist?
"I believe that I should not say that," said ESME Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Re-appointed ESME on their right to privacy and denial of the statement.
A feminist?
Silence again.
"I do not," said Luther Rabinowitz, finally, "because I would be against atheism, Lesbentum or feminism.
This is a prejudice-free workplace.
We serve a prejudice-free society.
But certain types of hyper-sensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely unacceptable and commendable, occasionally can distort results, as you have presented to them.
They have obviously prejudices against the church, and these things that you describe as "disingenuous" and "raw" could be interpreted as well as an expression of strength and vitality of course by others.
If we continue on the riding around, what will happen if, as if it were, if it had happened, happened yesterday, IT IS done is to take the country's essential vitality.
ESME Nussbaum looked around, while Rabinowitz said.
Behind his head repeated the advice of an LED lettering in Flamingo Rosa Ofnow gave the country in the last quarter-century or more.
Smile on their neighbours, you value your partner, you will hear ballads, please visit musicals, use your phone, you, you, you hear, you agree to excuse yourself.
Talking is better than silence, the song is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I can absolutely understand what you want," ESME Nussbaum said in a quiet voice, as she was sure that her boss had spoken to an end, "and I say anything other than that we are still not healed as effectively as we fool ourselves.
My concern is that without notice of us, we may find, as we repeat the mistakes that led to disclose what will happen if IT IS done in the first place.
This time, but not the other, in which we miss our anger and mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz form a pyramid with the hands.
To indicate a patience.
"They go too far," he said, "if you describe the actions as a" mistake "that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They go too far, if you say that they had left their "anger" and their "distrust" of "other".
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we understand the past, such as the protection of the present, not to speak of "us" and "other".
There was no "we" and there was no "others."
It was a time of disorder, this is what we know.
"From the, if we are honest with ourselves," dared ESME smash, "no part of the society can claim to have behave well.
I accuse anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well, what happened, happened.
That was then.
Nothing has to be said - as we are in agreement.
And just as no blame must be assigned, no debt must be repaid, if such a repayment would be appropriate and if there were a way to wipe them.
But what is the past, if we do not learn from it -
The past is designed to ensure that we forget it.
If I may say something -
Luther Rabinowitz, his pyramid coincide.
"I will remember her report," he said and dismissed them.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, it has been overtaken by a motorcyclist, who described as passers-by, was driven into a kind of "brutal rage" on the footpath.
There are coincidences.
