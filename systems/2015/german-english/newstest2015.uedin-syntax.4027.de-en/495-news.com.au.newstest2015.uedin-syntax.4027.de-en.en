Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
Amazon has just confirmed that information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (US $970 million).
The announcement is surprising, not because no one had expected a Twitch takeover, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would buy the company.
Three months ago, it looked as if the sale of Twitch decided to Google's video service for a cool billion. The cooperation also appeared, of course.
Twitch, which was founded as see only three years ago, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead it has quickly become a platform for players who wanted their bravura pieces published in games, "YouTube for live games," said an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play," a video genre, in the opinion of the (mostly older) games give a veneer of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is precisely that YouTube is often called, if you want to describe Twitch, so was the news that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy a little bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitors.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not do so, because the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
Everything that we know at the moment is Emmet Twitch sheer, President of this statement: "We have decided on Amazon, because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us get there faster."
Another mystery is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who say that they prefer to watch a sport, it is difficult to understand the attraction, the assumption that others watching the games themselves to take the control console in the hand.
It is one thing to see a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning on the shoulder while they trailed by resident Evil, and quite another to watch a spinner as 20 times in a row in Call of Duty is shot in the head.
You could see all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games are ego games today, so the watch without control over the look of their own perspective can be a good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the quick passes, all of our electronic age in the Roger Bannisters complete games in record time, are entertaining.
But as long as it is not a game or humor virtuoso, his Twitch channel is probably not very interesting.
But what do skeptics like I already know of them?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic spikes.
And exactly how Amazon wants to make money from it?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch so elegantly integrated into Amazon instant Video, such as YouTube Twitch simply could swallow.
But Twitch has something that each company would like: Thousands of young men to be courted as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, sheer, said that Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium is showing no signs of contraction, yet not even - gulp - as a spectator sport.
