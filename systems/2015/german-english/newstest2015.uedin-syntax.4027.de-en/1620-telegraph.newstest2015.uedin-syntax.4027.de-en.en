Lenny Henry: My father has never taken me in the arm.
Has never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family Jamaica Cuban immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father died when he was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearsing for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was difficult to know him.
You never saw his face, only heard his voice: "Hearing with the crash.
Let your sister in peace.
Beweg you!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up, when I was a child - went with him in the pub and talked about things, such as the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket strike.
I have never had such a conversation with him.
A large part of my life, he was a serious guy in the corner, the newspaper.
Recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, Henry won it with an insight into how life may have been for him.
It is now a little brighter, but they are dark, cheapest, deep stygische maze with flames shock and smoke and soot.
My father was simply earlier in the tub and then you could hear him slowly, as he began to sing, because he could wash the foundry.
When I went around there, I realized that he had done so for years, in order to bring the food on the table, and my respect for him has been growing.
However, Henry grew without stuff of love to his parents as a child.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother went badly towards the end of their lives, we began to say "I love you, I love you, I love you '.
By his own daughter Billie, Dawn French, he could share the love that he had missed as a child.
Could you let's stop with the "I love you"?
Hearing but to embrace me!
Dad, I am 22.
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She is a great mother.
It is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I was very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "you have to be radical.
So I moved through this thing and has also had to make a drastic diet, in order to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change is perhaps evident in his elegant, short cut.
Since he was praised by critics for his masterpiece, he is captured by the theater.
It was followed by The comedy of errors, and then fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started with only 16 years, when he was working in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage, when he wrote persons and imitation of New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black impersonator / comedian on television for a very long time."
He was at work.
I had to not only be large in the eyes of the public, but also learn from 1975 to 1985, as I could be an effective jokes-narrative-machine, while I was a star on television, and it was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 in New Faces
As his manager had the stage right to the Black and White alternatively show, a light entertainment, in which the people "black anmalten," Henry led to his comedy there over five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
Somehow, I wish that it would never happen, but I regret that I have done it.
It was a strange, awkward position for me, but I worked on big projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "years of award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
With the introduction of characters, which celebrated the British black culture as both a mock, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circuit in the 1980s.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as the chef Gareth Black lock in the comedy series leader, among other things.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and movie roles characterized his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought: "What are you doing next, Len, because everything feels like, when you're only time rum or join a little bit on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About...?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.
I was downright allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never right in the school learned something about him and held him for a domain of the middle class, whites in tights and a cabbage at the front.
So I had great fear.
All that we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it again.
It is not a bad thing, if you don't know what you talk to.
Put a couple of words in the mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare.
Henry led 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary, he was thrilled.
I had the feeling that I could do this.
It was almost as if someone had his head finally set up correctly.
"That is what is at stake, it is a serious thing, take them seriously, your text, recherchiere wrote a bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They simply do not seem to expect a car accident, and this happened.
And soon joined in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed you." "
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A small voice told me" You must now bridge 10 minutes while the computer repair. ""
Instead, the stage director announced that the idea would continue once the problem is solved.
I went from the stage and something in me said 'Oh, thank God. "
I am not responsible for it.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in fences on je Theatre
The text for fences to learn was demanding.
Panic is very good, that strengthens tendons.
It also sold well, so it is like a large sign of the gods that I say, 'This is your destiny. ""
He says this, of course, with a thundering voice.
So I will say it.
I really love it.
I love to be in a rehearsal room.
Henry but still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is crossed by humorous outbreaks, while he repeatedly people imitated.
I have decided to make a stand-up comedy, because I think that this kind of immediate gratification of a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you are looking for the swearing, leaves it against a wall.
I am sometimes live at the Apollo, if I want it, but overall, I am not as much as before.
I ask him whether he will ever make another stand-up comedy tour.
The fun that I was in a room with a director who helps to shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I do not believe that I would ever give up again.
So is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I am an actor.
It is fun.
You always tells a story, and this is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
