The tradition of the school balls in the United States will now be transferred to the universities, where Freshmen offered appearances with the private plane.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and to offer Britain's first luxury travel service for students of today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as private jets, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also announced that the service had a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise would have to dump their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new -Start options we are looking forward to this year to ensure that students achieve the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesman said that there is still no new bookings explained, because the service had just been introduced, added, however, that "students book the service in the next few weeks."
The company has also stated that, despite the tuition fees of Â£9,000 per year, we expect a market for this offer.
Students today differ greatly in their expectations and demands of the students in 10, 20, 30 or 40 years - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with -Start is just that.
The National Student Union criticized the service as aloof.
Megan Dunn, vice-president of the NUS for higher education, said: "This offer seems completely separated from the life of the majority of the students.
Many students who begin this month with the study, are facing a cost of living crisis, as the financial assistance in the form of loans and grants available does not keep pace with the rapidly rising bills for the simplest livelihoods, even before they can remember to spend thousands of pounds for something as simple as the arrival in the student residence.
