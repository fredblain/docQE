Perry of Texas says that was not authorized derogatory tweet
A tweet from the official account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday included a disparaging remark about the democratic district prosecutor, which is the focus of a criminal indictment against him for abuse of authority.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perry's account of the previous abstritt.
It has been sent out a tweet from my account, which was not authorised by me.
"I do not approve of the tweet and I deleted it," it said in a later message.
Perry staff responded immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perry's official account were, it was not clear who actually used the feed.
In the previous tweet was painted an unfavourable image of the district prosecutor of Travis County, Rosemary clay mountain, who was convicted for drink-driving in April 2013.
Perry, a veto against a financial support of their offices when they refused to resign, which led to a charge against Perry - could be the possible 2016 presidential candidate - this month before a grand jury in Austin.
The text of the tweets reads: "I shall not always drunk with the triple permissible alcohol... but when I do, I accuse Governor Perry, if he ausplaudert."
I am the betrunkenste Democrat in Texas.
Clay's office was not charged with the direction of the investigation of the grand jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the indictment a political ploy.
His high-class team of legal assistance requested by the judge tasked with the case, and reject the prosecution argued that the law that action is taken against the most senior governor in the history of the state of Texas is diffuse in every version.
Perry stopped $7.5 million in state money to the state's Public Integrity Unit, which is based in Travis County and determined in cases of corruption in Texas, as clay mountain refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint by a watchdog group on the left.
Perry's official account is updated frequently - and sometimes famous.
After he had finished fifth in the 2012 election rallies in Iowa during his presidential candidacy, Perry went on speculation that he would stop, he posted a tweet a photo of themselves while jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
