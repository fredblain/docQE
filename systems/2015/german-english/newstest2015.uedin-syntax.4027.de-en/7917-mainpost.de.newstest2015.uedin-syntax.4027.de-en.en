Under this view, there is peace and quiet
A powerful tribe showed us to our puzzle for the summer series "My piece of Rhöner happiness" last Friday.
There are still a number of these giant trees in the county, the copy is the "Geißruheiche" above under white aroma.
A bumpy one walk leads up to the 600-year-old oak tree.
It is past couple, basalt outcroppings and basalt stone seas.
A little bit below the quarry from Bauer Berg, a mile north of the road after Weisbach, this is it.
Vital is the natural monument, it stands on the other trees in the area and remembers with a circumference of about eight metres of an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But, despite intensive research, there was no mention in the name of origin.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has extra consulted the Bischofsheimer archive and questioned under white aroma of older people to learn what Bewandtnis it has with the Geißruheiche.
The result of his research was the very sober explanation for the name.
According to about 80 years ago have driven the goat shepherd of their animals under white hours on the meadows laboriously cleared and released by stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animal keeper exhausted by the rise should have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance for actually feed on the meadows and goat herds.
The area has also been declared the core area of the Biosphere Reserve, Schneider has found further.
When entering the stone collections should be cautious, however, because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular haunt for otters.
A path leads from under white aroma to the tree, but something is hidden.
Other routes are signposted, the direction high Rhön climb and to invite a long hike.
Where is the water castle?
A water castle, which is looking at our next task, however, is rather rare to find in height.
The reflection in the ditch is already a good impression from the building, but we have a number of historic buildings in the county, which could fit the building portrait.
Where is our "piece from Rhöner happiness"?
