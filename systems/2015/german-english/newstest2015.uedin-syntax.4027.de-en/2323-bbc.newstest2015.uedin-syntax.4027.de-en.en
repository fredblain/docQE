The image of a house for sale was removed from real estate brokers, as was clear that it had made a big pig showed that it is comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is situated on a private road in Ipswich and will be offered for £120,000.
A picture of the living room of the house belonged to the details, which also was a pig that had laid his head on a sofa.
Estate agents Connells said the pig on the photo was the pet of the owner.
"The photo was published by mistake, however, and has now been removed," a spokeswoman for the company said.
The exposé of the house described the Connells former Assembly House as a "unique family house with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the site, it is still on promotional material.
The sale of the house was in the interest of social media, and some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
