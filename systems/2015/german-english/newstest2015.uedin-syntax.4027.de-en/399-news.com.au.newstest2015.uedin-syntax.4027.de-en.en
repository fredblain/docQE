Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought that they would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost their entire youth in the belief that they have only a few years to live, after she had been diagnosed with the disease.
It was indeed Charcot-Marie-tooth disease (CMT) - a group ererbter disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK said that false diagnoses are a common problem for people with CMT, because so little is known about the disease.
About 23,000 people in Britain probably suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsafe speed and curved toes.
Ill also suffer from numbness or pain, and the disease is progressive and incurable, which means that by the time the symptoms get worse.
As Rodgers was 13, they believed that they suffer Fried-ataxia (FA) - a disease with a very poor survival chances.
Rodgers thought they would sit in a wheelchair, before they were 18, and die before their 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old today, said: "As a child I knew that I could not do the same as the others.
I fell steadily and it took longer for me.
I could never go with the other children skating or skateboard and was often in school because of my way to go and run geh√§nselt.
Rodgers said that they realised their medical records at the age of 13 years after several operations to the discharge of their Achilles and stretching their legs, when her doctor had left the room and read that they suffered from IAs.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I told this to anyone, but I went home and was looking for the disease in the library, and wrote to the FA-society," she said.
When I received answer, I was shocked and was dreadfully panic.
I thought that I would be in a wheelchair with 18 and die with 25, and in between there would slowly lose all my skills.
I did it all alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said that when she was 17, it was clear that their skills had not fallen as much as they had imagined and questioned their doctor.
He was simply to and hugged me and said, "my love, I do not believe that you have it, otherwise you're in a wheelchair now."
I believe that you have something far less life threatening.
After some genetic tests, was found at the CMT.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt, as if I were a winner," she said.
CMT UK charity has launched a CMT Awareness month, in order to draw attention to this disease.
