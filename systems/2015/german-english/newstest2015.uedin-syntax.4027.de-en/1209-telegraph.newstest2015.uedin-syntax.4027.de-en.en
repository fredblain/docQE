Garden centres regret falling pay homeowners
The decline, along with a greater decline in the number of homeowners under 35 years could lead to garden centres, today's young consumers lose tens of thousands of pounds per year, according to a study of the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, the "nuclear age group for garden products."
The report says that tenants are spending an average of 55 percent of the amount people spend with housing for their garden.
The rise of people who live in highly urbanised areas without gardens, the popular procedures, front gardens to park purposes of bitumen and the declining garden size, other factors that threaten the industry will be implemented in the estimated Â£5 billion a year in sales.
In the Greater London area, where the proportion of home owners over a period of six years has fallen from 61 to 43 percent, the lowest expenditure for garden products per household will be reported.
The HTA and the Royal horticultural Society indicate that housing for rent or small gardens do not mean that people can draw no plants.
Guy barter, chief horticultural adviser for the RHS said: "Container gardeners is very popular among tenants, for example, because they can take their plants in a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the garden retail trade due to rising homeowners pay and economic prosperity of the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He predicted for this year and an improved market situation because of better weather after harsh weather conditions in March and April of last year.
