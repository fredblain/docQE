With Rona fair Head, perhaps the BBC has found a great director, which it needs.
It is with a proud fame than from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And it has its own front experience.
Her career began in the global management consulting firm bain and Co., as they moved to Morgan Stanley, BOMBA canoe, ICI and the media world of pear's.
It was board chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and came back as the top post of the parent company went pear's to a younger male colleagues.
Their compensation was supposedly almost £1 million.
Their political ranking is sound.
David Cameron has been recommended by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, as it searched for more private knowledge in Whitehall: She was a consultant to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory councillor.
In May, I described the job of chairman with a poisoned chalice.
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The trust works in two directions: Inside on the first guard of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also to the outside world as the voice of public concern and anxiety, if things go wrong.
This makes for an almost unsustainable duopoly, which calls for a complete comprehensive reform.
But the incoming chairman would risk it, to stand on everything and disassemble an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he is perhaps even about his job.
It is a difficult task.
And as if that were not enough, even many are keen to see the BBC reduced - overtaken power, money and status.
While the competition is approaching old and new technologies threaten comfortable collateral is the upcoming trial of royalties for the BBC with special risks.
For the modest sum of £145,50 per year, the British public is certainly the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: She says that they reached 96 percent of all households, and each of them costs only 40 pence per day.
And apparently, the BBC on the popularity scale back up: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The vision for the BBC and usage habits have changed: I get news headlines today on my mobile phone and see missed programmes later on the iPlayer.
But it remains a very considerable and beloved institution.
It needs a considerable chairman - I hope she has found him.
