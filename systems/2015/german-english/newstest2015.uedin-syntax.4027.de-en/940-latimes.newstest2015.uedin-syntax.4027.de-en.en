Putin calls for the inclusion of "statehood talks" with eastern Ukraine from Kiev
The Russian President Vladimir Putin told Russian media reported on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begins with negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow made clear later that Putin will not have meant that the area under the control of separatists in eastern Ukraine is a part of Russia, but that his status should be redefined to Ukraine, in order to give the power to represent the rights and interests of the Russian-speaking region.
Putin's call to the Kiev government suits negotiations on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents but to the strategy pursued by him since the beginning of the riots five months apparently: Support for the separatists in the adoption of areas and put pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed Novo Rossija region de facto independence for an alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the state television station Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture areas held by the separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently adopted this area as "Novo Rossija" or "New Russia," a term that recalls the vorrevolution√§re heyday of the Russian empire.
Putin and Ukrainian politicians pointed out that all those during the campaign for the elections on 26 Oct. while government groups attacking civilian communities in the areas held by separatists hope for early peace talks "trapped in their illusions," Itar-TASS reported.
"We must immediately begin detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to protect the interests of the people who live there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to the statehood should be seen in the context of the greater autonomy, which will be discussed by the Kiev leadership for months, in order to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern areas, Peskow said.
We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskow said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, in contrast to the direct Annektion Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million residents are ethnic Russians.
Moscow could have been far more difficult to annex the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are no Russians and polls arose from the time before a broad majority for the whereabouts of the conflict in Ukraine.
The autonomy, which was raised by Russian diplomats at international forums, the regional governments in Ukraine would give authority to negotiate trade agreements and external relations of their own, and thus give the Kremlin de facto control over an area that combines the Russian territory with the Crimea.
The five months ago annexed peninsula in the Black Sea is the home port for the bulk of the Russian navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea is also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko suggested in his speech to the inauguration on June 7 that the Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should consider amendments to the Constitution, the respective areas will be given greater control over its finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, which is accused of arming and incitement of Moscow.
Putin's last call for Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing, followed by a further encroachment of the rebels in the past week, after Russian troops and tanks have penetrated through the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea in eastern Ukraine.
The Russian-supported separatists took over the coup, according to Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Nowoasowsk.
For this reason massive civilian and military preparations are under way to fix Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Nowoasowsk and narrow access to the Crimea.
Poroshenko said on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and asked an urgent need for action to prevent a further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, which is independent for 23 years.
"We are just at the point of no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit decided no concrete actions, the lead the draft demanded further sanctions against Russia, which will come into force in a unspezifizierten escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk, after two Russian armored columns and 1,000 soldiers broke last week in the Donetsk region, in order to support the besieged separatists, said Col. Andriy Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Repo on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped by the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers who were captured in a week on Ukrainian territory, said Lysenko on Sunday.
