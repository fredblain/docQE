Going back to the American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil right.
"Die, die as unions and the middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and vice-chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
So I am proud, together with the civil rights icon John Lewis, the employee Ermächtigungsgesetz before.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal options with discrimination because of the organization of trade unions and other forms of discrimination - and stops set so anti-union forces.
The addition of the national labor law, to create an opportunity for discriminating against abandoned workers to organize a union representation, to bring to justice in a civilian court - and to receive compensation or criminal money - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - certainly not by American standards.
Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of the bill suggest the link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks, which were exposed to the trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - to have encouraged Americans once countries around the world to recognise labour rights and respect.
There was a time in which millions of Americans remember, when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in the same breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution, which should ensure that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their unions took a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that are explicitly recognized that guarantees workers' rights of association and collective bargaining and action. "
When the United States occupy Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff pushed the Germans, to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize and should raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause, which explicitly testified: "The right to form associations to secure and improve labor and economic conditions will guarantee every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements that restrict this right or seek to diminish it are null and void; measures aimed to are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency of the International Commission on Human Rights, designed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as it was taken over by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form unions to protect its interests or to join them."
For generations, Americans accept the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
As other countries in this country could advised how to shape civilian and democratic societies, told Americans that the right to the establishment of a union - and that the union could then take part in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - must be protected.
After these rights in America come under attack, it is actually very wise to lead the American ideal in mind that working people must have the right to unite and to make themselves heard in a free and open society.
Fifty years ago, as Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said:
The story is a great teacher.
Now all know that the labor movement is not suppressing the strength of the nation, but they grew.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work miraculously created a market for the industry and the nation as a whole increased to unimaginable levels of production.
Forget those who attack the work these simple truths, but they kept the story.
The story recalls, and we should do this.
The formal recognition of the work rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights and protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and the promise of democracy einlösten.
