The castle clubs will soon be back in the same direction?
Finally, there were always unite dispute between the two Wolf Council Hauser castle.
Now the boards are thinking about a possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolf Council Hauser Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, a former chairman of the Council of the Wolf Hauser castle friends, having the project in France.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the club and the castle friends Wolfratshausen.
So far, the positions, as Hauser Castle and a possible reconstruction should be dealt with the history of the Wolf Council seemed very different.
Now the two sides move to each other, it will soon be held talks on a common approach.
Confirm that the club stands Torsten Invest (Castle) and Herbert Piffl (and friends) on demand of our newspaper.
"I have called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down together again," Invest reported.
In his view, all members of both clubs could pull together again in the future.
So there are visible results more quickly.
While the castle suddenly friends with the late Richard Dimbath until recently had an eye on a reconstruction of the castle in the mountain forests, the "development and Erlebbarmachung" for the club to Invest is at the forefront of the terrain.
Herbert Piffl, second president of the castle friends, has become very pleased about the call by its own account.
Since Dimbaths death, it is the castle friends.
A new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in mid-September.
The club is currently around 40 members, according to the 74-year-olds.
"We have the club activities out of respect for the death of my friend Richard Dimbath first leave." This "thinking period" would have been necessary in order "to consider how it could continue."
According to the Piffl, the new chairman will then go into the conversation with the club.
In the meantime, the castle friends could also make a current mood within their group.
A candidate for the presidency, there is not yet says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find." He himself will not stand because he has his residence in Bad Toelz.
The new chairman should be a wolf council houses.
The Toelzer wants to continue to contribute to the project "but very happy."
The different views in terms of reconstruction in the eyes Piffls would remain in the near future.
He appreciates Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream.
By a large part of the population, as well as volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was skeptical at first.
But over time, I am more and more to the conclusion that it is sensible to press ahead with the project. "We could create a" unique selling point "for the raftsmen city.
Here, there is nothing else.
Moreover, the project by EU subsidies, visitor tickets and potential sponsors would be affordable, believes Piffl.
"The idea of reconstruction will jettison I personally is not easy." He hope that the club at this point might make a difference.
Their goal, first to document the history, "is important and good."
Then we could see further.
