Andrew Lawson was a man of the species, whose character things changed, even in a gigantic organisation such as the NHS.
As an advisory anesthetist devoted his career of the task to save the health of both the agony of the disease and the ordeal of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 staff who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors and the diagnosis of diseases are important, while the Behandelten are mostly preoccupied with something else: Pain.
One day in 2007, he was the one, however, the ordeal began.
"I have not felt myself," he wrote in May of this year.
I had difficulties, raise me.
While he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he said that he had made his wife Juliet impatient accusations.
"I want everything now rather than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt a very unusual way and concerned without reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result was the X-ray examination.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer of the breast skin, which attacks the lungs of beneficial skin.
As with most cancers is often difficult to determine the exact cause.
While some smokers to lung disease, for example, are not all lung cancer in smokers.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos contamination - contact with the fiber material, once regarded as the "miracle material" but has now been recognized as fatal.
For most of us is a disease mesothelioma, which can easily ignore.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous to use was no longer used in Britain since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily committed to use them any more.
Even where he was still used, only people worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers in certain sectors, for example.
As an industrial risk material from another time, he seems to be of little concern today.
But this complacency is misplaced.
Britain, it seems, seen today is the culmination of a Mesoltheliom epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from the disease than in road accidents.
Annual figures of the Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and expected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we are seeing the deadly impact now, although asbestos is illegal for years (1999) were banned all types of asbestos, is that a mesothelioma developed only after decades.
And the scourge of the mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is, often, still present in the houses, in which we live, the offices in which we work, schools, in which we learn and the shops where we shop.
And therefore knows no class barriers mesothelioma, financial limits, jobs or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are no protection.
The parliament building, asbestos contaminated.
Also in the hospitals where we should be healthy, have already been identified as source herd of this deadly Karzinogens.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was also a plumber.
In fact, it could be difficult to imagine where he may have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out it.
"It looks as if in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years, there was a lot of asbestos," he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and guard - use the tunnel.
One wonders how many of my contemporaries are suffering from the same disease?
This question he could answer, at least in part.
"Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital, and the 2010 in the last five years of mesothelioma disease," he wrote in a letter, "I am the last, is still alive."
How many of us are still fall ill?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48 years ago.
When he died on 17 February of this year, he was 55.
It was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within eight months after the diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are still fall ill?"
Britain's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the epidemic of asbestos in Britain is expected to come to a standstill, a total of 90,000 will be a victim of the disease.
At the moment, most of them have no idea that they will die.

A quick look at the files of the courts, in which people often turn for damages, shows how far the scourge of Mesothelioms is already widespread.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, have to be exposed to asbestos, Janice Allen negligent way.
They worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department in two locations - one of the flagship store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years than when they began their work at M & S.
She now has two children in their twenties.
"In this matter," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I did not even really about asbestos.
I never thought that I would affect the time.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the concept of asbestos is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure, which makes the fabric resilient and flexible.
Three of the six have been used in the construction industry.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, today it is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.
It has been used for roof panels, floor plates, pipe insulations, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but it is still seen as a "major health risk" with the possibility of death by the EU and the WHO.
More dangerous, however, is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there are significant, but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the unique high Mesotheliomraten."

Janice Allen has perhaps not seen as a typical Mesotheliomopfer, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that their story is not unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected will be shown that "a substantial proportion of Mesotheliome without known suspension through work or at home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
In his statement, a large proportion of these contacts is based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It seems that no one could expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which has investigated the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could also be in the heart of the government, have been unwittingly exposed to the substance.
2009 reported Goddard that the service shafts and pipelines behind the committee rooms of Parliament were contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibres could be taken by something as harmless as "strong air movements.
Members of Parliament are often accused to care for their own interests, but here, it looks as to be the opposite.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace have received a "clean" health certificate, it is now clear that £1 billion amount must be paid over several years to renovate Parliament to modernize the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that the Members of Parliament after the general election in 2015 will probably make more in nearby QEII Conference Centre in Westminster than on the green benches.
The Goddard report has also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions."
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.
All we can do now is wait.
A person who could never identify the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
As Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott claimed that during his work in hospitals, he was exposed to asbestos.
"I have worked in a hospital, in which asbestos lawsuits were decided in a positive way," he says, "but I cannot prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to recall all places where you worked, and the data.
What he is still clearly remembered the day at the beginning of December 2009, where he got a fever.
He was 45, and had an operation in late in the evening.
Suddenly I had chills.
It came suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I thought the ride home to create no more.
As a doctor knew Abbott that the pain from the chest fur, the skin around his lungs herrührten.
But he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma as Janice Allen.
He went to work a month.
Verwunderte doctors, x-rays of his chest and put Pleurakathether to be fluid in the lungs and to test in the laboratory.
But his complaints were without diagnosis.
His health slowly stabilized, and he returned to his job back.
From time to time the symptoms returned back, however, often after physical activity and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient Abbott's with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott combined this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011 Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray images to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott had felt ill for the first time, one with a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the cavity between the Rippen- and the chest fur.
I am an optimist.
I am usually just move on, "he says.
To be honest, I had not done so many concerns.
But my wife, Rachel, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "It was said to me that it be mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Mesothelioma diagnosis
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
Only now, he realised the scale of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings now become ill.
And so is mesothelioma now younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were under the earth, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who changed in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens ate Graham Abbott (as it often did), most likely came in contact with the toxic substances.
It is clear that hospitals for patients over several decades after the war were potentially lifesaving, but life-threatening for the doctors.
He is still today.
Students presented their bunsenburner on asbestos mats.
And it is not just hospitals.
Asbestos was due to its fabulous isolating and flame properties often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls.
Even schools.
Indeed, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Across the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have parked their bunsenburner on asbestos mats.
Websites are now often raised the issue of asbestos in schools.
And meanwhile, items in our homes as innocent as floor plates or shingle roofs by default contain asbestos.
"It is an industrial poison that is included in large parts of our properties," said Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who has represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact, which invaded a affected woman, was the demolition of a Gartenschuppens in the 1970s.
So beware, as you stop your garden shed.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process it," Mr Abbott said.
I went back to work and tried to continue to make, but I realized that what I was doing, I could not focus on that.
I was two weeks ago in practice.
Then I knew that I had to go and look after myself.
Well, I will have no further Christmas.
The biggest difficulty was the fresh approach from the position of a doctor to a patient.
As countless patients before he reminds himself, as he overwhelmed by all the information was that he had to come around.
"It was very difficult to absorb all of this," he says.
"I asked my doctor" as long as I yet? "
And it gave me about 12 months.
I remember that I thought, 'Well, I will have no further Christmas.
That's it then. ""
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life support mechanism - the breathing itself - that caused the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is composed of tiny fibres.
If the asbestos is being raised and the fibers are inhaled, they can establish themselves in the chest fur, the skin around the lungs,.
Asbestos fibres irritate the breast skin and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem is with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom treasure, a cardio-thoracic surgeon, moved to the Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The hospital, which Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed to asbestos, is now ironically, a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to the asbestos during their training at the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, says treasure, "they are pushed to the edge of the breathing process where the skin is.
It is inherently invasive from the outset.
The usual options work for other cancers in mesothelioma not so good.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is hotly debated.
Some say that it was worth a try.
Treasure denies this.
"The breast skin cannot be cut out," he says.
You cannot beat about the bush with a knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "on chemotherapy is not very good," the "effect," but not healed.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients are living in a long time, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Mr Abbott still fighting two and a half years after his diagnosis.
After he had contacted mesothelioma, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man-of support and consultancy for Mitbetroffene.
"Hello, cancer centre," he is happy on calls.
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.
Abbott had originally been offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and expected to prolong his life just about a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed "to let things in a more positive light."
Following the advice of several doctors Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, cardio-thoracic specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage because I no longer had to be referred, I just cried and got an appointment," Graham.
A normal patient would need to receive a payment and have to wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers, to be able to play the best available therapies.
But if these treatments, inevitably fail, many patients are from a different financial concern about the future of the families they left behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher water House LLP.
"It is known that asbestos is extremely dangerous for the health since 1898," Morgan says.
But what has changed in the 1960s, we realized that even a small burden posed a health risk.
And here the negligence of companies started to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital, in their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full compensation" that Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
According to a spokesman confirmed the investigation into his death of Guy's, however, that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the 1990s in the basement area affected."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, it is a huge problem for mesothelioma sufferers who care about compensation, to trace the deadly asbestos contact a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who defend itself against claims to know that it is time for them, but certainly not with the prosecutor.
There were significant new legislation that makes it easier for mesothelioma patients in this year in response to demand compensation, even if their former employers will no longer be traceable.
The law has established a fund of £350 million for all funded by the insurance industry, which were diagnosed after July 2012, can prove a contact, but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs will receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal compensation process could have granted them - about £120,000.
About 300 successful applications for the program are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma patients, thinks that £350 million were a "very good job" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time had not gone away and mesothelioma sufferers find the company and they could sue normally.
Mike Penning, then work and pensions minister, admitted that the law is "not perfect."
But both Penning and Morgan gave that prompt action was necessary in the face of seven deaths a day.
"People are so much suffering and need help now," said Penning during the second hearing of the mesothelioma law in December of last year.
At the time, Mr Abbott was in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first debate, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that he expected a positive effect in contrast to Tom treasure.
This has been accompanied by a radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy, Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is, of course, with the most important thing," Abbott says.
This can be seen in patients again and again.
There is something you can continue.
If you place you are worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent the surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he was behind the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Follow-up scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There have been several cancer spots in my chest.
I was just 50.
This is not life-threatening.
This is lebensbeendend.
Again, Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
No trace of the tumours is now more visible.
But the process is physically and mentally very tiring.
They need to think about practical things - about the money when I am no longer, for example, or my wife, show how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 14, 16, and Tamsin, this is not always easy.
"It is difficult for parents," he says.
It is hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I said to my girls that I have a disease that I would not be old.
They reacted in different ways.
Tamsin is very sociable and unpredictable.
They told their friends and we got so many calls soon.
Ellie was restrained.
She said not much.
Such talks are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such talks are not crossed by hope, not a trace of hope for survival.
The disease is (such as a grim security ultimately for Stephen Jay Gould).
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma is not life-threatening.
