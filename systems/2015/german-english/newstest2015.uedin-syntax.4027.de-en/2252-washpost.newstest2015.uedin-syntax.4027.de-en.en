China denies Hong Kong law on government election, protesters swear vengeance
On Sunday, the Chinese parliament against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections despite the increased calls for democratic reform in Hong Kong's electorate.
This approach fired probably the long-planned protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists in the planning and mobilization within a few hours after the announcement led the way.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the communist leaders in principle to reject all the candidates are not loyal to Beijing.
"It is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing had promised.
It has lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defence of the Chinese decision said Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress that the admission of public nominations in the elections for Hong Kong's government to "chaotic."
Since 1997, when Britain returned control of the Chinese Hong Kong, Beijing has promised to let the people choose the government leaders from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, because there is a direct suffrage to the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the process by a nomination committee closely controlled by Beijing firmly in hand.
After a new clause should be allowed in only candidates "with love the country and love for Hong Kong."
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most effective public protests took place in Hong Kong for several years.
The movement is behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to insulate the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
In the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement have reached a new level of civil disobedience, and they planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
They gave no details, however, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication has told the organizers that the movement "the occupation of the central district considered only as a last resort, an action that is expected to take place only if all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted, and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today have been exhausted all dialogue opportunities and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have prepared themselves for days at the announcement of Beijing, and there were more stringent security measures, including police and barricades in front of the government building on Sunday.
The unrest will be strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong, they slowly lose control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland reinforces the competition for products and services.
There is a growing fear that Hong Kong's values such as democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement, because it threatens the business - the lifeblood of Hong Kong -.
"The protests, which they say, could cause major economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert regime Ip, who criticised the movement for a long time.
We do not want to stir up fears that Hong Kong spirals out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also reported recently on the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
Organised an unofficial referendum on voting rights activists, in which 780,000 people participated in this summer - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands attended one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
