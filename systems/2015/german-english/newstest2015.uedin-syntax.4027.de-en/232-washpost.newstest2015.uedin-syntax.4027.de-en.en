Feminists criticize racial issue and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mon at the beginning of this month.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "hands up, don't shoot," while they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown said the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez a change in online discussions of white feminists.
In her experience, white feminist commentators raise the sex before the race when it comes to reproductive rights and income inequality.
During the tensions in the Midwest, however, rose and received attention throughout the country, saw Perez, the responses of white women turned up to 100% of the breed.
Compared with the responses of black women came shortly after the shots from 9 August the personal essays with titles like "thoughts to Ferguson of a white woman" and "feminism is not only about the oppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez meant that an important change.
"I do not believe that one in feminism is many people talk about the white and privileges on so-type," she said.
People felt urged to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and ethnicized because the situation in Ferguson is that they need to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson problems to light that black Americans are exposed to every day, but they should not be seen as a "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," Mitchell said.
If I post something on how black people are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in the public space?" She asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the issues clean; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"At least 10,000 black men were lynched between 1865 and 1890 and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in the story, in order to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery came the divide between white and black women at the point at which white fighters for women's suffrage as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and said that the fight for the right to vote only for one group could be successful: Women or blacks.
"They made the decision to stand up for women's suffrage, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," said Hattery.
If you are reminded of such things, one with power will understand why coloured women don't trust white women.
We have not done our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade until white women against the Lynchen organised in the Association of Southern woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was founded nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time, in which white feminists "trapping" played with the problems facing black women is set apart for generations.
"It would be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to a child's education as seriously as they do with the right to control conception?" Asked Mitchell.
The second-generation feminists, who built her career on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what that means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem came two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pithy article by Rebecca Carroll, distribution of the Guardian, in which they demanded more protests of white Americans on the issue of racism.
"I hope that women who have a separate but parallel reason to understand the danger inherent in the body - and opinions on race, which are very different in public opinion polls - will lead the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem intersectional feminism stands for a more interactive section, in which race and gender issues are some of their comments on the racial issue in America but puzzled.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole feminism?" Said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young coloured men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinems to Ferguson's comments are in contrast to its previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But as the White House recently a small program, My Brother's keeper, celebratory, in order to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were infuriating reactions of many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police to the black community is not the only problem that is at the forefront of the mainstream feminism.
After the US border police has taken nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors in the country's southwest border this year, is also the subject of immigration reform to the surface again - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that women mobilised for immigration reform, said that for a reconsideration of the issue as a fundamental issue of women, they only had to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," Mercado said.
If the vast majority of work visas is going to male immigrants, the women who accompany them, are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories will find an echo in the women's organisations," she said.
