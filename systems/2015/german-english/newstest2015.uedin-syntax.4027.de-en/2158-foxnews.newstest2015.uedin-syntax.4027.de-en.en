4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to make photos or videos under water, there are a variety of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action-cam, such as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver edition, both of which are to be had for about $300.
I have these photos at a family party with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other subjects are densely closed.
Set your camera on the photos or videos that you want to capture.
Some cameras and camcorders feature scenes and recording sessions with which the exposure time is optimized for the d√§mmrigen underwater conditions.
And before you jump into it, check, up in the depth of your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others by 50 or 60 feet.
Search for traditional and waterproof models in our shopping guide and the ratings for digital cameras.
Take multiple shots, because many will not be achieved.
Point-and-shoot cameras usually do not have a flat, with which you can compose images, action-cams.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this under water, and the right attitude is a matter of chance.
So take many pictures.
If your camera has a terraced mode, in which a number of shots are made with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light will be dramatically worse, the further you remove themselves from the surface.
If possible, you remain so close to the surface, if you make shots in a pool, a lake or the sea.
You can also bring more color in your photos; the deeper you go, the less you will see color.
Go close to the objects.
It is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important because of the poor lighting conditions under water.
It is particularly important if you are working with an action-cam: These devices often have a wide-angle lens, which means that you have to get closer to your objects, if they are to fill the entire picture frame.
