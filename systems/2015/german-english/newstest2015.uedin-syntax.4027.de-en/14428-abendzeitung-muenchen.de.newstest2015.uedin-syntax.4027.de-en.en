After the election in Saxony CDU deputy Strobl, NPD-ban process into question
Given the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony CDU-Federal Deputy Thomas Strobl has called for an end to the ongoing NPD ban procedure in the constitutional court.
Berlin - The CDU Federal Deputy Thomas Strobl should find an end to the current ban against the NPD in the constitutional court.
"The NPD performs worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also the CDU-country chief in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, the Leipziger Volkszeitung. "
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me come to the conclusion that the NPD fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD has been very close to the five-percent hurdle in the vote on Sunday.
A first attempt was for a ban on the far-right party in 2003 had failed, because the Constitution protect whistle-blowers in the NPD leader at the time.
In December 2013, the Federal Council after a long preparation filed a new request in Karlsruhe.
Government and parliament, do not.
