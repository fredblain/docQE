HR4-700 cyclists ride in the park by bath salt (and Scots stopovers a
If cyclists on their tour in bath salt (or Scots stopping, that in itself is nothing special.
On Friday, however, the number of stopping impression: The 700 participants of the hr4 bike ride alone and accompanying entourage enjoyed a break in the lower end of bath salts, and later a party in the open air in the country of old Castle Park.
Under the motto "cycle and celebrate on newly discovered ways between Nidda and Kinzig" had the participants met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and witnessed a concert of Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it was taken seriously: The cyclist took the first stage, the 60 kilometers on FLOR city after bath salt, and continue to Scots in attack.
In bath salts, were the athletes of Mayor Hans-Peter Seum associated with the bicycle as mentioned before, and the head of the own operation bath salt in Bad Vilbel, Petra swing-Döring, welcomed.
The refreshment of body and mind had been prepared for all sorts of good things: The country had women from Ranstadt and low-mock city 85 sheets apple, Zwetschen-, streusel cake and cheese cake baked a mouth that the talented cyclists.
"These cakes can only bake country women," a participant from Aulendiebach praised, while he refused another piece.

The beautiful setting of the park was relaxing.
A man was also a head massage of his partner: "He deserves, because he has already secured abgesprungene bicycle chains."
Meanwhile, the mayor and the operational head still work: They were interviewed by reporters Rainer Janke at the fountain in front of the historical house and took the opportunity to advertise on the radio for bath salt sojourn.

Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS-CEO Markus Hoßfeld and MSC-chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as a board member of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many operating in Scotland."
DJ Tobias Hagen was subsequently cleared the dance scene.
The opportunity to kick moving under the open sky, eagerly used in spite of physical activity on the bike.
