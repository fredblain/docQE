Why was no blockbuster "Guardians of the Galaxy"
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of its budget of $90 million in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" only $12 million of its budget of $70 million album.
The film "Sex tape" tailored to Cameron Diaz played only $14.6 million on opening weekend, while children's films such as "tame dragons made easy 2" also disappoint in revenue.
An article in the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the films themselves in children's films could be the reason.
Collin described as "the worst year" in 2014 so far for children's films and described "dragon tame made easy 2" as a "functional" fantasy sequel.
In films for a slightly older audience, it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore- and Meta critic rating for every summer film start between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and was shown in the current year to at least 2000 canvases.
The results are based on the opinions of cinemagoers and film critic and suggest that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of Web-streaming services such as Netflix.
The director Jon Favreau, is currently working on Disney's upcoming jungle book movie, the Hollywood reporter on the website said: "I believe that the times are changing."
We must accept that and do not try to run in the past.
In contrast to the currently weak funds results of Hollywood productions, Netflix streaming content in recent sales of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales totaled $837 million.
Last summer, the director Steven Spielberg's film studios to ensure that they are very focused on Harry Potter of comics and predicted a "meltdown" in Hollywood.
Seen in the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that its grim prophecy could contain a real core.
Due to the potential blockbuster expected in the summer of 2015, including Aven Gers: The Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, however, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline of cash results as simply "cyclical" and said to the Hollywood reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema office at all, and no one is more concerned about the business."
