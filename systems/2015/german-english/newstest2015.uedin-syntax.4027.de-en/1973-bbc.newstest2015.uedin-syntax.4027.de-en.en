Production in the eurozone to a 13-month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed in August to its lowest point in the last 13 months, a closely watched survey with.
The final Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) fell in August to 50,7 in, according to a state of 51.8 in July.
A number above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced declines in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets are expecting a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the euro area, as well as the threat of deflation from the bank with an inflation rate of just 0.3%.
There is speculation that, in the course of this week, the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information, whether he is considering a quantitative easing for the eurozone, in line with those of the United Kingdom and the United States were made during the financial crisis.
"Although a small growth is better than no growth, are the deterrent effect of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties for the manufacturer has become clearer," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, fell in France, the bloc's second-largest economy, the PMI to 46,9.
France remains a problem child, as well as the Italian descent of a solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that incentives for growth in the key industry mechanism no longer are Germany, Spain and the Netherlands are not reassuring, "Mr Dobson said.
The decline of the industry is probably the fire of the analysts expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
Some positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI to 57.3 rose to the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the purchasing manager index of manufacturing in the eurozone in August, is that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producers in the eurozone will find life is obviously very difficult, because the current heightened geopolitical tensions, particularly in relation to Russia and the Ukraine, continue to increase uncertainty in the difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and probably leads to some orders be delayed or even cancelled, particularly large contracts.
He said that it will "increasingly likely" that the ECB should finally start a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
