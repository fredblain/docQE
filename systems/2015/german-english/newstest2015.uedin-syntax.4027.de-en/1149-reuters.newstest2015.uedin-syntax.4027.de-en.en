Judge stops temporarily law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force the closure
A US federal judge stopped on Sunday for the implementation of a law in Louisiana, the lawyers say that it probably would have led to the closure of the state's five abortion clinics.
This measure, which was raised from Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, in June to the law and to enter into force on Sep 1, would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a patient receiving right in a hospital within a radius of 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to perform legal abortions for the time being, while they apply for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work according to the law, as they seek to obtain these rights," John deGravelles federal judge wrote in his ruling.
Within a month, scheduled a hearing for the judge to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures and said that doctors gained more time to gain rights to hospital admissions.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana escape a devious law that they want to take their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which had sued on behalf of three of the state's five clinics, in order to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the ruling also extended to the doctors from two hospitals, which has not joined the lawsuit and had also applied for the rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws and courts have recently declared unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi for such measures.
Key points of a law in Texas, which would have forced the closure of most of the remaining clinics in the state, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion supporters and the American College of Ostretricians and high impact violence, as well as the American Medical Association say unanimously that the rights of doctors are demanding unnecessary restrictions.
Keep abortion opponents counter that the measures serve to protect the health of women, although some also welcomed the impact of a closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana, has Patienteineinweiserechte, told the center for reproductive rights.
If all the other doctors in the state be forced to carry out any more abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the operation out of fear for his safety, the group said.
In their arguments against the ruling, representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the implementation of abortion, while their applications on Pati duck against rights were still pending.
