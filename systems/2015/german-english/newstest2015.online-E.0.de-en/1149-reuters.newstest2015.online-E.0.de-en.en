Judge stops temporarily law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana to the closing could force
A US federal judge stopped on Sunday provisionally the conversion of a law in Louisiana of which lawyers say, that it would have led probably to the closing of all five abortion clinics of the country.
This measure, that by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, in June to the law raised became and step should on the 1st Sep effective, would become physicians, that carry out abortion, in addition force to acquire a patient reception right in a hospital within a radius of 30 miles around its practice.
The decision of the judge means however that the physicians can carry out provisionally further legal abortion, while they apply for such a right.
"The complainants can continue work on law in conformity while they strive for the acquisition of these rights," wrote federal judge John deGravelles in its judgment.
Within a month, a hearing is prepared for the judge in order to induce a more durable decision for the law.
Abortion advocate of welcomed the decision, that youngest in a row of judgments against similar measures said and, that physicians would win so more time in order to attain hospital introduction rights.
"The current decision means that the women in Louisiana escape an insidious law, that wants to take them its health and its rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairperson of the center for reproduction rights, that had complained in the name of three of the five clinics of the country, in order to delay the law.
It was not directly clearly whether the judgment extended also on the physicians out of the two clinics, that had not joined the complaint and had applied for also introduction rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 countries that similar laws released, whereby courts declared recently such measures in Alabama and Mississippi to be not constitution appropriate for.
Key places of a law in Texas, that that of the clinics remaining in the country would have forced to the closing, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocate and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association say concurring that introduction rights demand restrictions unnecessary by physicians.
Abortion opponents hold that toward that the measures serve the protection of the health of the women, although some welcomed also the effects of a closing of clinics.
Only a physician, who in Louisiana abortion carries out, controlled patient one manner rights, divided the center for reproduction rights with.
If all remaining physicians in the country are forced in addition, to carry out no more abortion, this physician would carry out the operation out of anxiety around its security no longer, said the group.
In its argumentation against the judgment, representatives of the country Louisiana said that it no physicians would punish because of the execution of abortion, while its proposals would be yet pending on Patienteneinweiserechte.
