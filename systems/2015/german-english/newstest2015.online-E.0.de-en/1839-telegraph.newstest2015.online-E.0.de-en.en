With Rona Fairhead, the BBC found perhaps the magnificent director, whom it needs.
It arrives with a proud renown train out of the bank world, the medium management and the internal circle of the Tory party.
And it has own front experience.
Your career began in the worldwide management consultation business Bain and Co. whereon it changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the medium world of Pearsons.
You chairman of the board of the Financial Times was for seven years and resigned when the uppermost post of the mother business Pearsons went at a younger masculine colleague.
Your settlement amounted to nominally almost 1 million£.
Also its political Ranking is solid.
It became sought became David Cameron of lord Browne that recommended earlier chairperson of BP, than this after more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: it the adviser of the cabinet.
Your husband is an earlier Tory councilor.
Already in May I described the task of the chairpeople with a poisoned cup.
Not only the BBC stands as a gigantic and complex unit in the heart of the public life, but rather there is also an internal paradoxically in its structure.
The confidence functions in two directions: after interior on the first corps of the own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outward as a voice of public apprehension and unrest if the things incorrectly run.
That provides for a duo pole almost untenable, that demands after a complete comprehensive reform.
But which newly arriving chairperson it would risk, to begin is so complex to hit on everything and to take apart an institution, that like a Chinese dynasty while he brings himself at the same time even perhaps around its job.
It is a difficult task.
And as that would be not already enough, are interested also yet many on that to see the BBC reduced - power, money and status overtakes.
While the competition more closely moves and new technologies threaten old, comfortable securities, the standing negotiation of the license fees is connected for the BBC with special dangers.
For the modest sum of 145.50£per year the British public shops itself into the certainly largest medium business of the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and everyone costs therefrom only 40 Pence per day.
And apparently the BBC climbs on the popularity scale again towards the top: 53 percent support it today, in comparison with 31 percent 10 years ago.
The Seh- and utilization habits for the BBC changed: I get nowadays message headline on my mobile phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and notable institution.
It needs a notable chairperson - I hope, it found it.
