4 Tips for better lower water photos and video
If you would like to make gladly photos or videos under water, there is a selection at devices.
The most low-priced option is a watertight Point-and-Shoot how the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an Action Cam such as the GoPro HERO3 + Silver edition, that both are to be had for about 300 $.
I received these photos in a family festival with several cameras, that are all to a price of less than 350 $ available.
There is independent of the equipment a couple of rules for the best results.
Control your equipment twice.
Also if you have a watertight camera, reassure yourself that the battery compartment and other specialties thickly are locked.
Adjust your camera also to the photos or videos, that you want to receive.
Some cameras and video camcorder control scene modes and reception modes, with which the exposure time is optimized for the d√§mmrigen lower water conditions.
And before you jump in, you test, into which depth your equipment is operable.
Some cameras are only for up to 5 feet allowed, other until 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our purchase leader and the estimations for digital cameras for conventional and watertight models.
If make multiple reception - because many will not work out.
Point-and-Shoot-cameras do not control a LCD, with which you can compose pictures, Action Cams normally.
Also if you have a LCD to look at is it difficult, this under water, and the correct picture attitude a matter of luck is.
Therefore you make many receptions.
If your camera controls a row mode, with which a row are made by receptions with easily changed exposure attitudes, you use it.
Remain near the surface.
The light will remove yourself dramatically worse, ever further you of the surface.
If you possible remain include in make therefore close to the surface, if you a pool, a lake or the sea.
Through it you can bring also more color into your photos; the more deeply you go, the less color you will see.
Approach close to the objects.
That is also at country a good advice, but it is under water all the more more important because of the bad lighting conditions.
It is very especially important if you work with an Action Cam: These devices control often a firm wide-angle lens, what means, that you should must poet at your objects up to, if these should fill out the entire picture frame.
