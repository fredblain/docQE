On the hop castle in the castle garden festival was happening at the Saturday a few things.
The draft of the organizers agreed.
In spite of the strong downpour on Saturday evening approximately 1200 music fans to the opus-Air-festival in the castle garden came.
Occasionally the entrance had to be stopped.
"That was annoying", said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt frond l light and joke.
Out of two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Brightness should for that opuses Air in the Salzwedeler castle garden at the day and in the evening through various shows radiate.
Well, and the joke comes anyway of alone.
That appeared already from the early Saturday when the first visitors to the opus Air opened themselves.
The organizers had promised a festival for all generations.
And that is arrive them.
All around the provision states on the castle garden meadow had itself it Salzwedeler, but also guests out of the nearer and further environment cozily made.
They pursued the first live entrances, wippten with the foot in the tact, wetted cool drinks - shortly: Relaxation pure and enjoyment were announced.
And that diagonally through the generations.
During itself the one sand white on covers on the extra angekarrten at the beach bar lümmelten, other itself at one-quarter wine in the Vinothek labten, raged the new generation on the hop castle, that was a large attraction point for the smaller guests.
But also in the child make-up, the voluntary helpers in the truest sense of the word had all hands fully to do in order to become the press gentleman and to do magic imagination full creations into the small faces.
The larger used the Kickertische or were involved in a Skateboard workshop that the Goodfoot Crew aligned out of salt frond.
Until the large rain came.
Shortly before 17.30 clock, it beat down sought on the visitors, above all families the expanse and dry.
This did yet the attractiveness of the festival no discontinuance.
"It came more people than expects", said Ron Sem, that spoke about a "success on the entire line".
Therefore would stand a repetition of the large party in the coming year toward nothing.
Although at contents and size of the Events yet worked will must, Sem in a first balance made on Sunday vis-à-vis the people voice clearly.
As annoying it designated that meanwhile the entrance had to be stopped.
Obviously the security firm had been booked with too little powers.
The consequence: Many that already had paid came no longer on the terrain.
The resonance had been very good.
In a first careful estimation, the Salzwedeler with organizer of about 1200 visitors, that romped about in the castle garden, spoke.
There was problems in the tone technology.
The Salzwedeler hiply-Hop-volumes Blocks`n`Rox interrupted unnerves its entrance therefore.
The technicians were not in a position, to create a half-way sensible Sound.
The planned Shisha Lounges could not be constructed because the tents could not be brought because of a tire breakdown after salt frond.
"In the next year become it however at the same time be", so the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-opus-Airs was of the numbers of visitors more than arrive.
And that in bad weather.
To be sure the organizers committed some mistakes, removes will must, that yet are forgiven in the first time, but in the second levy.
Also in the social network Facebook, the organizers must put away criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve Euro has one simply more expects", expresses itself Melanie Meier on the organization side.
"You have you unfortunately a little received", means Ele carpenter at same place.
Others do not see the initial problems very so closely.
I find it very good that many not only stupidly talk nonsense, but rather also really try to place something on the legs.
Hat from"!, writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.
Now a year time remains the organizers in order to turn down these points of criticism.
