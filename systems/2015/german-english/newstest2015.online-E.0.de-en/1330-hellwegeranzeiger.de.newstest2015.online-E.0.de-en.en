The district chairperson of the labor union said German Lokomotivf√ºhrer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Dusseldorf.

There are not regional focal points.
Let the head direction of the warning strike be the goods traffic.
The Germans train in NRW announced to do all, in order to hold the effects if possible slightly.
The GDL had not said however where it wanted strike, so that it would be heavy to anticipate the consequences concretely.
