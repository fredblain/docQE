In an attitude at the new press, it contradicts statements of the manager Peer Medau and attests this to pose "like a commander".
Let the style of the university be not this, is named it in the communication.
So the family Medau had been informed already "in the middle of June orally about the request of the university.
The statements that the plans became first in July well known, are definitively incorrect", so Pötzl.
Simultaneously it reprimands on that that it does not concern in the plans "before establishments or quite decisions", it to be sure "preferences" would give.
Also the extension necessary for the driveway of the narrow street up to the lock would be feared fewer dramatically than by the Medaus.
Street of wide by a nine meters was not and is the speech.
It that concerns is after present state 5.50 meters, a meter of wider than previously", explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that its free of cost and school own park areas in the future are used then only by students of the university, does not want to count let Pötzl.
Zugeparkt becomes not at all because that intelligently can be solved like in other public parking lots meanwhile.
Think of the residents
The child manger Bergwichtel, that is on the terrain and would lead the driveway before its front door to the park cover along, should become" according to the university president "not impaired.
Rather it gives to consider, "that it concerns here not only the child manger, but rather also around the residents at the confluence to the Friedrich-Streib-street and the 800 students of the neighboring secondary school.
It concerns therefore much more than around minority interests of the Mr. Medau", so Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parents adviser of the child manger, with the extension of the street Coburgs would be lost go" entitled would be one "the few nature left spots, "can the reader himself decide".
Beginning of October wants to inform Pötzl together with the national department of building and inspection Bamberg the Stadträte about the structural development of the university until 2020 "and address" the meaning of the new development in this context.
Peer Medau had informed past week the parents of the child manger about the plans of the university.
Accordingly the driveway should not lead for the new park cover like previously over the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-street, but rather over the Medau mountain.
Therewith the narrow street would have to be expanded on about a kilometer length zweispurig.
According to projections of the Medaus, the traffic in the park of lock would decuple itself high rock therewith.
Of about 2000 vehicles the speech is daily.
Of sides of the city, one wanted to express himself not yet for intention.
