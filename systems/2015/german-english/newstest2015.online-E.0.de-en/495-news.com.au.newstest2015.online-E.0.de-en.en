Amazon buys Twitch for 1.04 billions $
AMAZON confirmed just now, what had reported on Monday morning to information: The Online retailer - and video maker, and a multitude other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for 1.04 billions $ (970 million US$).
The announcement does not come surprisingly, because no one had expected an acceptance of Twitch, but rather because largely assumed became, that YouTube would acquire the business.
Three months ago it looked so, as would be the sale thing concluded by Twitch at the video service of Google for a cool billion, and the collaboration appear also naturally.
Twitch, that was established only three years ago as a Justin. tv, was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead it became fast a platform for player, who wanted its Bravourst√ºcke in games of published, a "YouTube for live games", such an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's it play", a video genre, in which know-it-all give that (usually older) games an Anstrich of secret science theater, are chosen on YouTube already very.
It is just so that YouTube often is named, if one wants to describe Twitch, therefore the message became that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy, somewhat bored received, a textbook example of an established technology business that buys up a potential competitor.
It is a riddle why the deal with YouTube did not come into being, because the business was ready according to reports to pay just as much like Amazon.
All, what we know in the moment about that, is these statements of Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "We decided us for Amazon because they believe in our Community, they divide want to help us our values and long-term visions and it at the same time to arrive" more quickly there.
A further secret is, honestly said, the incredible follow from Twitch.
For snob such as, that explain that it dear sport to watch drive as at the same time to grasp is it heavily, the attraction, that assumes to watch other in the playing instead of even the control console into the hand to take me.
It is a thing to view a friend at 3 o'clock mornings over the shoulder while it slinks through Resident Evil, and somewhat entirely other to watch, a spinner at the same time, how he is shot 20 times one after another in Call of Duty into the head.
You now just could look at all these games.
Another problem lies therein that many of the most popular games are today egos games, therefore the watching can be without own control of the view perspective a really good prescription for headache.
I admit that the fast conduits, in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronics age graduate games entire in record time, are, entertaining.
But as long as a game masterly or humor masterly is not there, its Twitch canal is probably not so very interesting.
But what do skeptic such as I know already therefrom?
Twitch is called of 55 million different visitor per month and is that source fourth largest by Internet traffic tip.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make from that money?
It is heavy to imagine that Twitch is integrated so elegantly in Amazon Instant video, how YouTube Twitch simply would have been able to swallow.
But Twitch has something what would have each business gladly: Thousands of young men, who are courted as advertise customers.
How the chairperson of Twitch, Shear said,, Amazon and Twitch both "believe in the future of the Gaming," and the medium does not show no signs of an atrophy, yet once - swallow - as a spectator sport.
