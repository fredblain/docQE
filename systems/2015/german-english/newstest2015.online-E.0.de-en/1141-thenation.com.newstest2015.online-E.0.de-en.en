Return to the very American ideally the labor laws as human rights
The congresswomen Keith Ellison and John Lewis brought in a legal proposal in order to establish the organization of labor unions as a civil right.
Die "so like labor unions, die also the middle class jobs," said Ellison, a democrat out of Minnesota and deputy chairperson of the progressive Caucus in the congress.
Therefore I introduce proudly jointly the colleague authorization law with the civil right icon John Lewis.
This pioneering law gives workers the same legal possibilities in discrimination because of the organization of labor unions such as in other forms of the discrimination - and stops so antigewerkschaftlich adjusted powers.
The supplement of the national labor law law in order to create a possibility for a discrimination exposed workers to the organization of a labor union representation, to complain around before a civil court around justice - and around compensation or fine to received - a meaningful and necessary initiative is.
But it is with security no radical initiative - in any case not after American standard.
The best type and manner to the understanding is actual its, what Ellison, Lewis and the further sponsors of its bill propose, the connection back to a very American idea.
In spite of the setbacks, which the labor unions in the past years stopped were - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries in the entire country - have American once countries in the world in addition encourages to acknowledge, to expand and to keep labor law.
There was a time, at which millions of Americans yet remember, when this country named democracy, speech freedom, press freedom and the union right in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after the second world war, encouraged general Douglas Mac Arthur and its rod the country in addition to dismiss a constitution, that should guarantee, that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full consciousness its that the workers and its labor unions took in in the creation of a new Japan a roll, used it a language that explicitly acknowledged, that "the rights of the workers are" on union and joint negotiating and actions guaranteed.
When the United States occupy after the second world war Germany, Dwight David Eisenhower pressed general and be rod the Germans to write a constitution, that would provide, that the fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves, and should raise its voice in the new nation, inserted the Germans a clause, that explicitly stated: "The right to establish unions, in order to secure and to improve the works and economic conditions is guaranteed every single and every occupation or business.
Agreements, that restrict this right or aim on that, to lessen it are are null and void; on that aiming measures illegal.
When the earlier First lady Eleanor Roosevelt possessed the chair over the international human right commission, of which the general explanation of the human rights was sketched, how she was received 1948 by the United Nations than a worldwide agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors inserted a guarantee that "every is right the to form labor unions to the protection of its interests or to join" them.
Since generations, Americans accept the reason premise that labor laws of human right are.
When this country advised other countries at the same time, how one could form civil and democratic societies, declared American that the right would have to be protected on the foundation of a labor union - and on that, that this labor union then at collective negotiations as an equivalent partner with business and government places participate might -.
After these rights in America under gunfire ridden is it actually very would show to bring to the attention of itself the American ideally again, consequently the working population the right have must to unite itself and to get in a free and open company ear.
How pastor Martin Luther King Jr. fifty years ago said:
The story is a magnificent teacher.
Now everyone knows that the worker movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but rather enlarged it.
Through the raising of the standard of living of millions people work created in wonderful manner a market for the industry and raised the entire nation on unimaginable production levels.
That that attack the work forget these simple truths, but the story preserves it.
The story remembers, and we should do that also.
The formal recognition of the labor laws as human rights - and the expansion of the protection of the civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representations - is a long time overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideal that largely made America in the past and redeemed the promise of democracy.
