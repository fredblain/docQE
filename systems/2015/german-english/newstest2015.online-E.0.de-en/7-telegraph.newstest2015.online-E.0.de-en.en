Why "Guardians became no box-office hit of the Galaxy"
"The Expendables 3" of Sylvester Stallone balanced out less than 30 million dollars of its 90 million dollar budget in the USA, during" Sin city: A lady to Kill For" solely 12 million dollars of its budget of 70 million dollars balanced out.
The film tailored on Cameron Diaz "sex Tape" balanced out easily made disappoint 14.6 million dollars at the opening weekend solely, during child film such as "Drachenzähmen 2" also in the revenue.
An article of the telegraph film critic Robbie Collin indicates that in the child film the lack of quality could be in the films themselves the reason.
Collin designated 2014 as a "the worst year" previously for child film and described easily made "Drachenzähmen 2" as pure" functional" Fantasy continuation.
Target group somewhat older in films for one seems it however so as if the quality of the films is not unconditional the problem.
In July Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore- and Metacritic estimation for every summer film start, that was shown between the American Memorial Day and the 20th of July 2013 and in the course year on at least 2000 linens.
The results rely on the opinion of the movie theater visitors and film critic and point on that there that this year's film hits which are the past year equivalent.
Some commentators my that the development is to be attributed to self-changing see habits and the growing popularity of web-streaming-services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, that works presently appearing Dschungelbuch film at Disneys soon, said Hollywood vis-à-vis the web page reporter: "I believe, the times change".
We must accept and not try that to follow the past.
In contrast to the presently weak cash register results of the Hollywood productions, Netflix obtained most recently revenues with the streamings contents in the amount of 1.2 billion dollars, almost twice as much like in the past year, in which the revenue 837 million dollars amounted to.
In the last summer, the director criticized Steven game mountain the film studios that it too very on filming of comic strips of concentrated itself and prophesied a "kernel enamel" Hollywoods.
In the light the present downswing seen argue some commentators that its gloomy prophecy could contain thoroughly a true kernel.
Based on that in the summer 2015 to expecting potential box-office hit, under that Avengers: Age of Ultron, min ion and Jurassic world are other representatives of the film industry however more optimistic:
The maker of X Men, Simon Kinberg, described the decline of the cash register results recently as simple "cyclic" and said reporter vis-à-vis Hollywood: "The next summer will be the largest summer at the movie theater cash register generally, and no one will worry" more around the business.
