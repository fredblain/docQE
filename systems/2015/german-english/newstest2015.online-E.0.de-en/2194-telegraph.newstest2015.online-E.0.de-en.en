Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organization such as the NHS.
As an advising anaesthesia physician, he dedicated suffer its career of the task, that both to save the Agonie of the illness such as the torments of the treatment.
Under its patient, remembers his wife, was a MI6-Mitarbeiter, who had to live with the devastating effects of tortures.
Lawson knew that the diagnoses and illnesses are important to the physicians, during the treated predominantly with somewhat entirely other busied are: Pain.
One day in 2007, it was however that whose life of suffering began.
"I did not feel me," wrote it in May this year.
I had difficulties to pull myself together up.
While it fought with the flu-like symptoms, it noted that it made his wife Juliet impatiently accusations.
"I wants all rather immediately than later", noted it.
When Juliet was for a week on a business trip, Lawson felt entirely unusual would prove and disturbs without reason.
Anything lay in the air.
It asked a colleague to undertake a x-ray investigation of its breast.
It had been only two weeks ago in the French Alps to the ski load.
The result of the x-ray investigation existed.
It suffered from Mesotheliom, an incurable cancer, that attacks the breast fur, therefore the skin covering the lungs.
How in most cancer diseases, the exact trigger is to be determined usually heavily.
While for example some smokers become ill with lung cancer, all lung cancer sick early smokers were not.
But Mesotheliom is differently.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, that once as a "miracle material" counted however in the meantime as deadly recognized became.
For that of us, Mesotheliom is a disease that can ignore how easily.
Asbestos is in the end a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbestos type was used in Great Britain since the '1960's no longer when the industry promised voluntarily in addition to use this no longer.
Where it yet was used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the material - plumber, construction worker, carpenters and shipyard worker for example.
As an industrial danger material out of another time it seems to be today hardly yet serious.
But this even contentment is inappropriate.
Great Britain, seems it, experiences today the highpoint of a Mesoltheliom epidemic.
There are more deaths through Mesotheliom here than in every other country of the world.
With altogether 2,500 deaths per year, many people die twice as at this illness as in traffic accidents.
Annual numbers of the Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and presumable future deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we experience the deadly effects now, although asbestos illegally has been for years (1999 became all asbestos types forbidden), is that that a Mesotheliom develops first after decades.
And the scourge of the Mesotheliom is not restricted on former worker of the building industry.
Asbestos was is, and frequently yet, in the houses available, in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the businesses in which we shop.
And therefore Mesotheliom knows no class barriers, financial boundaries, occupations or age.
The privileged bastions, of the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are no protection room.
The parliament buildings are asbestos contaminated.
Also in the hospitals, in which we should become yet healthy, were settled already as an exit herd of this deadly Karzinogens.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
It was also no plumber.
It fell it in the deed heavily to imagine where it could have come possibly with asbestos in contact.
Then it found out it.
"It looks so as if in the tunnels at the Guy's it hospital, where I graduated for six years my education, a quantity asbestos available was". wrote it.
All - students, nurse, physicians and doorman - use the tunnels.
Does one ask himself how many of my contemporaries will suffer from the same illness?
It unfortunately at least partially was able to answer this question.
"Of the four physicians, that at the Guy's it hospital instructed became, and that in the last five years at Mesotheliom of sick", wrote he 2010 in a letter, "am I the last, that yet lives".
How many will of us yet become ill?
In Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48 years.
When it died on the 17th of February of this year, it was 55.
That was an unusually long over lifetime.
Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months after the diagnosis.
The illness ends always deadly.
We can repeat therefore only Lawsons question: Will "like many of us yet become ill"?
The leading expert of Great Britain to Mesotheliom, professor Julian Peto, supposes that between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic in Great Britain will come presumably for succumbing, altogether 90,000 of the illness to the victim fallen be become.
That therefrom still have no idea in the moment that they will die so.

A short view of the acts of the courts, at which the concerned turn frequently because of compensation demands, shows how far the scourge of the Mesothelioms already is spread.
In June these years gave notice & Spencer for example to, Janice of all careless would prove stopped asbestos to have.
It worked for nine years for the chain, of 1978 to 1987 and was responsible over the clothing department at two locations - one of them of the Flagshipstore in the Oxford streets.
Mrs. All was first 18 years as when it began its activity in M&S.
Now it has two children in the Zwanzigern.
"Before this thing," says it, "I had heard never of Mesotheliom, knew I not yet once really something over asbestos.
I never would have thought that that would concern me once.
There is only a few people who know much over asbestos.
Fact is that the term asbestos a substance, but rather a group of six minerals does not relate itself.
The name stems of the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that flexibly makes the material resistant and.
Three of the six were used in the building business.
Chrysotil, also as a white asbestos well known, is the asbestos by far most frequently found today in buildings.
It was used for roof disks, foot bottom disks, pipe isolation, boiler isolation, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less deadly as other asbestos forms, is looked at however nevertheless of the EU and the WHO as a "large health risk" with possible death consequence.
The brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith) is more dangerous however.
Great Britain was once that importer world's largest of brown asbestos, and experts assume that "there are clear, however indirect references, that these was" a main reason for the uniquely high Mesotheliomraten.
A colleague of notice & Spencer was stopped in the Flagshipstore in the Oxford streets, London, asbestos Alamy
Janice all did not see itself perhaps as a typical Mesotheliomopfer, but the work of Julian Peto points on that there that its story is unusual in no case.
It produced a study of the concerned, in which represented becomes, that "an essential share of the Mesotheliome became" without well known exposure through work or in the house probable through asbestos contact in the environment caused.
A large part of these contacts is based its statements after upon the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks so, as could no one therefrom go out to be certain.
A report of Goddard Consulting, that examined the palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been also in the heart of the government, unknowing the material exposed.
2009 reported Goddard that the service shafts and pipings had contaminated behind the from shot room of the parliament with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be swirled up by air movements" "strong somewhat as harmless as.
Members of parliament frequently are accused to attend to its own interests, but here it sees so from, as would be true the opposite.
While the direction of the parliamentary community service existed on that, that the Westminsterpalast had received a "clean health testimony", it is in the meantime uncontested that 1 billion£work expense must be raised over several years in order to renovate the parliament, to modernize the electric installations and to remove the asbestos, and that after the general choices 2015 the delegates will meet probably sooner in the suggested QE2-Konferenzzentrum than on the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report referred also on that that "the existence became not" handled by asbestos corresponding to the respective determinations.
No one can know whether this Missmanagement life will cost.
All what one can do now, is wait.
A person, that the contact with asbestos never exactly determine was able to be Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
How Andrew Lawson the 50-year-old Abbott assumes that it was stopped during its work in hospitals the asbestos.
"I have in a hospital worked, in the asbestos complaint positively decided became", says it, "but I can it in my case do not prove.
It is so difficult to remember all places, at which one worked, and at the data.
On what it yet exactly remembered the day is itself beginning of December 2009 at which it got so a kind of fever.
It was 45, and an operation carried out just late evenings.
Suddenly I had violent shivering.
It came very suddenly.
I felt terribly.
I believed to create the trip home no longer.
As a physician, Abbott knew that the pains of the breast fur that stemmed skin around its lungs around.
But how Janice all it had no reason to assume a Mesotheliom.
It did not go a month to work.
Surprised physicians made x-ray of its breast and set Pleurakathether on in order to take fluid out of the lungs and to test in the laboratory.
Its troubles remained however without diagnosis.
Its health improved itself slowly, and it turned at its job back.
From time to time, the symptoms returned however, frequently after sporting activity and violent breathing.
A patient Abbotts with similar symptoms in its practice came 2011 and was diagnosed later with Mesotheliom.
But also now Abbott did not connect this with its own case.
In the end its patient was some decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011 deteriorated Abbotts condition again and its family doctor its CT Scans and x-ray to an expert group brought themselves.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott suffer had felt for the first time, was introduced a probe equipped with a camera into the cave between the rib fur and the breast fur.
I am an optimist.
I continue says usually simply," it.
Honestly said, had made me I not at all so many worries.
But Rachel, my wife, was provided.
The result of the biopsy existed in the week between Christmas and New Year: "One said to me that it was" Mesotheliom.
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly had Abbott appointments with Macmillan nurse of which one recommended it to take itself a lawyer.
First now concept it the size of the epidemic.
"It turned out very far spread was, that asbestos, especially in large public buildings, in which pipes were isolated often with asbestos," it says.
The people, who were stopped the asbestos in these buildings, become ill now.
And so Mesotheliom encounters now younger people who did not work in the typical occupations.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos isolation in hospitals lay under the earth, therefore patients were not stopped probably sooner the material.
But many colleagues, who changed in pedestrian tunnels of a building in the other, (like Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens ate (like it Graham Abbott often did), came with largest probability in contact with the poisonous substances.
It appears that over several decades after the war of hospitals for the patients possibly life rescuing were, but life-threatening for the treating physicians.
It yet is removed also today.
Students turned down its Bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats.
And it concerns not only hospitals.
Asbestos was used based on its fabulous isolating and flame impeding characteristics frequent in offices, businesses, libraries and city halls.
Also schools.
Actually many people had probably the first asbestos contact in the class room.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, turned down student its Bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats.
On web pages, the subject of asbestos in schools now frequently is addressed.
And meanwhile so innocent objects in our houses such as foot bottom disks or barn roofs contained standard moderate asbestos.
"It is an industry poison that in large parts of our real estate contained is," notes Andrew Morgan, that lawyer, who represented Andrew Lawson in its process against Guy's it hospital.
In a case, the single contact that occurred to a concerned woman was, the abstract of a garden barn in the 1970ern.
Therefore you pay attention how you dismantle your garden barn.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the illness is incurable, is immense.
A while lasts "to process that," says Graham Abbott.
I went again to the work and tried to make further, but I noticed that I was not able to concentrate on that, what I did.
I was two weeks in the practice.
Then I knew that I had to go and had to attend to me even.
Well yes, I no further christmas will experience.
With the largest difficulty, the telescope change of the position of a physician to that of a patient was.
He remembers patients countless how before it on that how overwhelmed he was by all the information, with which he had to come right.
"It was very heavily, to receive that everything," says it.
Did "I ask still have my physician" how long I"?
And one gave me yet about 12 months.
I remember that I thought, "well yes, I will experience no further christmas.
It was that then"."
Mesotheliom is especially insidious because it is our life maintenance mechanism - the breathing itself -, that the deadly cancer causes.
Most cases of Mesotheliom are caused through asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibers.
If the asbestos is swirled up and the fibers are inhaled, they can itself in the breast fur, that skin fix around the lungs around.
Asbestos fiber irritate the breast fur and can release cell mutations.
"The problem emerges with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," so professor Tom Treasure, a heart-Thorax-physician who changed 2001 at the Guy's it hospital.
Exactly the hospital of which Andrew Lawson assumes that it stopped it the asbestos, is ironic would prove now, a leading center in the treatment of Mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some other that were stopped probably also during its education in the hospital the asbestos.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, says Treasure, "become it of the breath process at the edge pressed where the skin is.
Inherently it is from the beginning invasive.
The usual options in other cancer diseases do not function in Mesotheliom so good.
The effectiveness of an operation is for example be named disputed.
Some my that it would be valued an attempt.
Treasure denies that.
"One cannot excise the breast fur," says it.
They get around with the knife not therefore.
Meanwhile the cancer does not address "on chemotherapy very well," that "effect shows", but does not heal.
"Sometimes there is long-term survival," says Treasure.
But at the end, they die everyone.
Fortunately some patients live actually long, much more long than expects.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Graham Abbott fights two and a half years after its own diagnosis still.
After it had contacted Mesotheliom, came Abbott in contact with Andrew Lawson, that four years had become after its diagnosis an a-man-supports and consultation office for Mitbetroffene.
"Hello, cancer headquarters," imagined he in calls cheerfully.
"It was very positive," says Abbott.
It had received its diagnosis 4 years before and was still very active.
Originally Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, that would last four months and would extend its life presumably only by a month.
"I was doubted," say it.
I wanted to abandon.
Lawson created appear it however "the things light of somewhat more positive in one to let".
After the consultation of several physicians, Abbott, its treatment with prof. Loic long Lazdunski, heart-Thorax-specialist concluded to continue it at the Guy's.
"We had an advantage through it that I must not further reprimanded become, I called simply on and got an appointment," gives Graham to.
A normal patient would be received must a transfer and wait must for the permission of the treatment.
Money is decisively for Mesotheliom become ill in order to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments fail in the end inevitable, stand many concerned of another financial worry - over the future of the families, that leave behind it.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been since 1898 well known that asbestos is extremely dangerous for the health," says Morgan.
But what in the 1960ern changed is itself, that one recognized, that also a very slight load represented a health risk.
And here the negligence of the businesses began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's it hospital enclosed its case in the end, but it was not that, what names Morgan a "full compensation", because Lawson was not able to prove with absolute security, that be Mesotheliom on an asbestos contact at the Guy's it to lead back was.
After the investigation to its death, a speaker of the Guy's confirmed it however that "the asbestos fiber in the concerned cellar area in the 1990ern became" removed.
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
It is actual for Mesotheliom become ill, that strive for compensation, an enormous problem to assign the deadly asbestos contact of a firm or a job - normally decade after the occurrences.
Many of its earlier employers were sold or closed.
Insurance documents can lost go.
And that that defend themselves against claims do not know that the time is for it, but very certainly with the complainants.
As a reaction on that there were this year clear new legislations, that it makes for Mesotheliom concerned simpler, to sue for a compensation, also if its earlier employers are to be discovered no longer.
The law arranged a fund promoted by the insurance industry of 350 million£for everyone, prove can accuse can that were diagnosed after July 2012, a contact, but no one.
In these cases, the complainants 80 received communicate can would have percent its, what a court in a normal compensation process them - about 120,000£.
About 300 successful proposing in the program are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mesotheliom concerned that 350 million represented£a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"That is a deal of insurers for insurer," says it, and points on that it concerns in this sum one-quarter its, what insurers should have paid, if the time were not passed over about that and Mesotheliom become ill could find the businesses and normally could accuse it.
Also Mike Penning, at that time work minister and pension minister, admitted that the law would not be "perfect".
But both Penning such as Morgan admitted that in view of of seven dead daily some fast actions would be necessary.
"The people suffer so very and need today aid," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom law in December the past year.
At this time Graham Abbott has been for 19 months in the hands of prof. Loic long Lazdunski.
After its first consultations, long Lazdunski recommended an operation of which it expects in contrast a positive effect to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied of a radiation therapy and a chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which long Lazdunski can present a survival rate over five years of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"That is natural with the most important," says Abbott.
One sees that again and again with patients.
There is there something what lets continue you.
If you abandon, it goes you very quickly more badly.
Graham Abbott subjected itself in March 2012 of the operation.
It had the end of August the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind itself.
Nachsorgescans showed no sign at all of the illness.
Then I had in March 2014 a Scan.
There were several cancer spots around my breast.
I became just 50.
That is not life-threatening.
That is life concluding.
Again Abbott subjected itself six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the Tumore is more visible.
But the process is physical and psychically very strenuous.
They must think of practical things - over the money if I am no longer, for example, or my wives show how the boiler time attitude functions.
If you receive bad news, you become negative.
They must look forwards.
As a father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, is that not always easy.
"For parents, that is heavy," says it.
It is to be known heavy, what one should say and like much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I said to my girls that I would have an illness, with which I would not become old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.
It told got it its friends and we soon very many calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
It did not say much.
Such conversations are endure must somewhat, that all cancer patients.
But for Mesotheliomerkrankte, such conversations are not gotten through of hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The illness brings (so like in conclusion also for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.
How Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.
