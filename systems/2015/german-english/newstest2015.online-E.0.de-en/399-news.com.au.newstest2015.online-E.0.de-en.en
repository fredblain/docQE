Genetic interference often incorrectly diagnoses
A Briton says, she thought as a consequence of a false diagnosis over many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost its entire youth in the belief that it has to live only few years, after it had been diagnosed with another illness.
It suffered actually from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth-illness (CMT) - a group ererbter interferences that damage the nerves outside of the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK announced that false diagnoses are a frequent problem with people with CMT, because so few is well known over this illness.
About 23,000 people in Great Britain suffer probably from CMT, that can lead to motor interferences such as muscle weakness, an unsteady gear and crooked toes.
Sick suffer also from deafness feelings or pains. The illness is incurable and progressively, what means, that the symptoms become gradually worse.
When Rodgers 13 was, it believed that it would suffer from Friedreich Ataxie (FA) - an illness with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought, it would sit in the wheelchair before it would become 18, and die before its 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who is today 51 years old said: "As a child I knew that I was not able to do the same like the other.
I fell down permanently and everything lasted with me more long.
I never was able to go roller-skate or Skateboard with the other children and became to go and to run in the school often because of my type geh√§nselt.
Rodgers said that it realized at the age of 13 years its sick document after several operations to the relief of its Achillessehnen and stretching of its feet, when its physician had and read leave the room, that it suffered from FA.
"I felt me indebted because I had been curious, therefore I told that no one, but I went home, searched for the illness in the library and wrote to the FA company," said it.
When I received answer, I was shocked and panicked terrible.
I thought that I would be with 18 in the wheelchair and with 25 die, and in between slowly all my capacities lose would become.
I settled that all alone with me and planned my own burial.
It said when she became 17, became its clearly that its capacities had not decreased so strongly, how she had imagined it and questioned its physician.
It rose me simply, and embraced and said, "my love, I believe not, that you that have, otherwise would be you now already in the wheelchair".
I believe, you have somewhat by far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests was assessed in its CMT.
"As it explained, what CMT was to me, I felt, as would be I a winner," said it.
Charity CMT UK started a CMT-Awareness-month in order to make aware of this illness.
