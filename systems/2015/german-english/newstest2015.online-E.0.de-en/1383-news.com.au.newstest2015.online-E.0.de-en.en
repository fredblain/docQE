The spring day first with wet and stormy weather conditions impairs flights of the airport Adelaide
The SPRING gave south Australia a wintry surprise, with violent shower and strong wind, that impaired flights of the airport Adelaide out of.
In the evening until 21 o'clock, further 5mm rains fell on the city, after 6,6mm, that had descended already in the early hours of Sunday.
The last precipitation was the result of a row of shorter, stormy shower, including a shower, that began shortly before 20 o'clock and provided for almost 4mm precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the winter had provided last week spring for an early dose, the temperatures in the city fell on Monday again on a maximum value of only 15,8° C.
The böigen weather conditions led probably airline from Melbourne to Adelaide to the belated landing of a flight of Virgin.
The airplane should have landed shortly after 19.30 clock, was encountered however of some scissors wind - a sudden variation of the wind speed or -direction over a short distance - and had to start through.
Gusts reached at this time about 50 km/h on the ground on the airport Adelaide.
The flight data showed that the airplane had to start through also in a second country approach and mounted in the end by approximately 20.40 clock.
The flight delay led in the consequence to the delay of some of other flights, including an emirate flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a high temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible shower.
