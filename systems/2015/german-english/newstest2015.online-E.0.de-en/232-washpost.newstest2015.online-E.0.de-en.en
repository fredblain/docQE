Feminists criticize race question and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed beginning of this month of a police officer in Ferguson, Mo..
The participants lifted its hands into the air and sang, waited "hands highly, do not shoot," during it before the burial.
After two-week protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the Erschießung of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noted a change in the Online discussions of white feminists.
After its experience, white feminist commentators set the sex before the race if it goes therefore to address reproduction right and income inequality.
While the tensions in the mediator increased west however and received notice in the entire country, saw Perez that the answers of white women revolved to 100% around the race.
In that came the answers black women compare to shortly after the shots of the 9th of August the personal essays with title such as "thought to Ferguson of a white woman" and "feminism revolves not only around the suppression of women" comparatively late.
But for Perez, the one important variation meant.
"I do not believe that one finds in the feminism many people, who, over the white are and speak privileges on so hochklassige type," said it.
The people felt pressed in addition to express something to the occurrences.
It is characteristic of the crisis, in which we find us and because the situation is in Ferguson so ethnisiert, that they must express that.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of the Ohios State University brought Ferguson problems at the light, which black Americans are stopped every day, that however as a "woman subjects" in the cultural room are not observed.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook over me and my partner and get 150 Likes of everywhere here," said Mitchell.
If I post somewhat about, how colored in its own country stand under siege, the being quiet is deafening.
"How can it not be certain for women to speak publicly over a relation, but over security in the public room"? asked it.
For black women such as Mitchell, the race, sex and sexuality in the story of the USA studied have, gives it no Dichotomie between race problems and sex problems.
For it, black women had not the luxury to separate the subjects cleanly; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women connect now the subjects of races and sex in the feminist Mainstreamkreisen, says Angela Hattery, professor for women and sex investigation at the George Mason University that its predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and was the establishment almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in the story in order to justify the lynch murder.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came at the point, at which white fighters assessed for the woman right to vote such as Susan B. Anthony the country in the late years of the 19th century of analyzed and, that the battle was able to be successful for the right to vote only for respectively a group: Women or black.
"You made the decision to support the woman right to vote, and the right to vote for black later should come," said Hattery.
If one remembers such things, becomes one with power aware why colored women do not trust white women.
We made our job not well.
We never helped black women at the same time to protect its husbands and sons.
Also after women 1920 received the right to vote, it lasted another decade until white women against the lynching in the Association organized themselves of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group emerged ask for according to almost 40 years the original aid of sides of black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions is on the questions turned-up by Ferguson - police behavior, race discrimination - a mirror of the time, in which white feminists played "catching" with the problems, with which black women sat down since generations apart.
Would it "not be control so seriously would take do" crazy, if the activists, that such traditional feminist platforms the right on upbringing of a child like it that with the right on conception inspection? asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation, that constructed its career on the fight for reproduction rights and the access to contraceptive means, try to understand now, what means that.
The well known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks to the Erschießung of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pithy article of Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian in which she demands more protests of white Americans to the subject of racism.
"I hope that women, the one other, but parallel reasons for that have to understand a danger characterizing the body - and opinions to the race, that in public surveys clearly differently are - the variations cite become," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem stands for one sooner intersektionalen feminism, in which race subjects just as as sex subjects are addressed, some of its commentaries are astonished to the race subject in America yet.
Did Christina in the summer, researcher on the American Enterprise institute and author of "Who stoles Feminism"? say vis-à-vis She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "far vulnerableer are than its sisters," to its earlier criticism stand however Steinems comments to Ferguson in contrast.
There is now hunderte of special programs for girl and young women, but almost nothing for boy.
But as the white house recently a small program, My Brother's it Keeper, put on in order to help vulnerable young black and hispanischen men, gave it annoying reactions of many feminists, under that Gloria Steinem.
The ratio of the police to that of the black Community is not the single problem that into the foreground of the Mainstreamfeminismus presses itself.
After the US boundary police took up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minor at the south west boundary of the country this year, also the subject of the immigration reform steps again at the surface - this time as a woman subject.
Andrea Mercado, Co chairperson of We Belong Together, an organization, who mobilizes women for the immigration reform, said that for a new view of the subject as an essential woman subject she had to publish solely the stories of the immigrant women.
"These speak for itself," said Mercado.
If the large majority of the work visas goes at masculine immigrants, are the women, who accompany it, in a position, in which they are susceptible for domestic force and exploitation.
"These stories find a reverberation in the woman organizations," said it.
