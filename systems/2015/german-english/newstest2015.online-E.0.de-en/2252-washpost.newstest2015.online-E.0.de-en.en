On Sunday the Chinese parliament decided in spite of the increased calls after democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the choices 2017 through the Hongkonger constituency.
This action fuels probably the long announced protests in Hong Kong business district while activists led the planning and mobilization in addition within less hours after the announcement into the ways.
The decision of the Chinese people congress permits it the communist leaders basically not to reject everyone of Beijing faithful candidate.
"That does not come unexpectedly, but it makes us yet furiously," said legal expert Emily tepidly, chairperson of the democratic party.
That is not that what had promised Beijing.
One designed the inhabitants of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we have to do it with an authoritarian regime.
In its defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, vice secretary-general of the permanent committee of the national people congress said that the allowance of public nominations would be in the choices for the Hongkonger government to "chaotic".
Since 1997 when Great Britain returned the control of Hong Kong the Chinese, promised Beijing let select the inhabitants from 2017 the government chair.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of the Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because there are the citizens of Hong Kong a direct right to vote, but the decision makes also clearly that the Chinese leadership retains the flow through a nomination committee controlled closely by Beijing firmly in the hand.
After a new clause, only candidates "with love are supposed to be allowed moreover to the country and love to Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and audience most effective protests have taken place in Hong Kong for some years.
Behind the per democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the movement Occupy Central With Love and Peace whose organizers threatened therewith stands to seal off the finance district if Beijing allows no real general right to vote.

In an Online communication, the organizers announced that the movement took "the occupation of the headquarters district only as a last means into consideration, an action that should take place only then, if all dialogue chances are emptied and no other choice exists.
It harms us to have to say that today all dialogue chances were emptied and the occupation of the headquarters district definitively will take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong prepared themselves for days for the announcement of Beijing, and intensified security measures counted on Sunday before the government building including police powers and barricade.
The unrest becomes through the feeling of many in hung Kong reinforced that they lose slowly the control of its city.
The train of people of the mainland reinforces the competition around products and services.
Moreover the fear are awake that the values of Hong Kong such as democracy and speech freedom begin to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central-movement because it would endanger the business - the lifeline of Hong Kong -.
"The protests of which they speak could cause large economic damage, depending how many are involved on that and like long they last," said legal expert Regine ip that criticizes the movement for some time.
We want to stir up no fears that Hong Kong runs except inspection.
This impression is bad for investments.
