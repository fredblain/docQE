Lenny Henry: My father never took me into the arm.
Said never "I dear you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrant in Dudley in the Midlands in the year 1958.
Its father who died when Henry 19 was, worked was limits in a factory and its ratio.
Henry rehearses it for a comedy, Rudy's scarce Records that is based partially upon an imaginary conversation with its father and developed from the series on radios 4.
The Soundtrack is a mixture out of Reggae and Rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work itself through some difficult childhood moments.
It visited "many" therapies after death of its mother, and Henry is reflective over its relation to its father.
It was heavy to know it.
One never saw its face, heard only its voice: "Stop with the noise.
Let your sister in quiet.
Move you!
I want cracked view.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - that were already adult, when I a child was - went with it into the tavern and spoke over things, like the form of the beer glass or the beauty of a Cricketschlags.
I never had such a conversation with it.
It was a large part of my life this serious type in the corner that read the newspaper.
Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than an at times its father, he won yet an insight therein how life might have been for it.
It is now somewhat brighter, but they are dark, waft away, deep stygische mazes with flame pushes and smoke and much soot.
My father put himself earlier simply into the tub and then one slowly was able to hear it how he began to sing, because he was able to wash the foundry of itself.
When I ran around there, became clearly that it had done that for years in order to bring the meal on the table, and my attention before it became larger to me.
Nevertheless Henry grew up as a child without Liebesbezeugungen of its parents.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I dear you".
First as it of my mother toward the end of its life badly went to say caught we on, "I dear you, I dear you, I dear you".
Through its own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, was able to divide it the love, that it had missed as a child.
Could you stop once "I with that dear yourself"?
Stop yet embracing me!
Papa, I am 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
It is a magnificent mother.
It is married was still with French friendly, with that it 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why should we not be friends?
It is a magnificent mother.
Mother own Henrys was diabetic.
That contributed to its death.
As I therefore very, very overweight became and showed symptoms of diabetes, said must be radical my physician "you.
Therefore I got through this fitness thing and had to make also a drastic diet in order to reverse the symptoms.
It is very heavy.
And it is strenuous.
No one eats gladly carrot.
Henrys career change appears perhaps in its elegant, shingled beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for its Othello, he is collects of the theater.
It followed the comedy of the errors, and then Fences of August Wilson.
That is be filled out have another experience as the Sitcoms and comedies, that busy work life.
It began with only 16 years when it worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered it on the stage when it wrote people imitated and to New Faces over it.
Its TV career began middle of the seventies. "I was for a rather long time the single black imitator/Comedian on television".
It learned in the occupation.
I had to become not only before the eyes of the public large, but rather also of 1975 to 1985, that learn how I was able to become an efficient joke-Erz√§hl-machine, while I was through television a star, and was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 in New Faces
And White Minstrel show looked possessed there its manager the stage rights at that, an easy support program, in that itself the people "blackly painted", led Henry its Comedy there over five years up.
That was my family very unpleasant.
I wished somehow that it never would have happened, but I do not regret that I did it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I cooperated on giant projects and learned how one handles a large audience.
But this "years-long prize-winning easy column of the British distance marriage" was also a "grotesque parody of black people".
Through the introduction of figures, that the British black culture both mocked celebrated how, worked Henry in the eighties at an alternative Comedykreis.
The first row of the Lenny Henry show went 1984 on shipment, and in the ninetieses, it was among other things as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedyserie boss! well known.
Advertising, documentary, series of TV and film rolls stamped its next decade, but after its series of BBC LennyHenry. tv 2008, he thought himself: "What you make next, Len because it feels all so, as bring you only the time around or trittst a few on the place".
After that a Dokumentarserie came for radios 4 with the title What's it so Great About...?
The first consequence revolved around Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was regular allergic.
I never had learned something in the school correctly over it and considered it predominantly to be a domain of the middle class, white in stocking pairs of pants and a cabbage head ahead inside.
Therefore I had large anxiety before that.
Everyone that we interviewed for the show Peter hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, judos Dench said should try "you it once.
Do not make it badly if you do not know, whereby you speak.
Nimm a couple of the words into the mouth, and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare so.
Henry itemized 20 lines out of Othellos of last speech for the documentary and it was enthused.
I had the feeling that I was able to create that.
It was almost, as would have someone the head finally correctly mounted me.
"Therefore goes it, it is a serious thing, nimm it seriously, learn your text, would research a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that did not happen simply.
And soon it appeared in the comedy of the errors.
Suddenly I was was hardly able to believe in the national theater and I it.
There there was a moment when I thought, "oh, you have you changes"."
There were felt a technical mistake and Henry instinctively that it had to maintain the audience.
"A small voice said must bridge you now 10 minutes to me", repair while it the computer"."
Instead the stage leader announced that the presentation would go on, as soon as the problem would be solved.
I went said of the stage and anything in me "oh, God would be thanks to".
I am not for that responsible.
I can leave that someone to other.
"You play in a theater piece, therefore shelter in your role".
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
To learn the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the tendons.
Also that arrived well, it is say is therefore like a large sign of the Gods, that "that here your determination"." to me.
It says this, naturally, with a THUNDERING voice.
Therefore I remain at the same time.
I love that really.
I love it to be in a sample room.
Henry has however still the head of a Comedian - our conversation is gotten through of humorous outbreaks while it imitates again and again people.
I concluded to make no state-up-Comedy because I find, that this type of the immediate satisfaction of a hall is dangerous more fully more strangely somehow.
If one seeks that continually, one goes therewith before a wall.
I appear sometimes live in the Apollo if I am in the mood in addition, but altogether it does not give me so much like earlier.
I ask it whether it will make ever again a state-up-Comedytour.
The joke, that I have in a room with a director, that helps at the same time, a beginning to form a means part and the end of a trip - I do not believe that I would like to abandon that ever again.
Is that here therefore its new incarnation?
I think already.
I am gladly an actor.
It is fun.
One tells always a story, and that is magnificent.
Stories love I.
The people love stories.
