The devastating Ebola epidemic transfers the economy of west Africa a heavy blow.
The harvest decays on the fields, that left are mines and the markets is orphaned - the virus heavily added the region.
Also some international businesses go already on distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but rather also an economic", judges the boss of the African development bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is concerned hardest
"It is a total catastrophe, we lose very much money", says Alhaji Bamogo, that on the second largest market in Liberias capital Monrovia clothing sells.
On the market comes only, who wants to buy groceries or something to the disinfection against Ebola.
Liberia is hit hard fell of the virus, however here the fever more than 600 people to the victim.
Recently the health authorities, that advanced would be illness into every angle of the country, explained.
Also in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, the virus spread out.
Altogether already more died than 1500 people, cable would send stuck itself further on.
Foreign firms draw-off colleague
Everywhere in the resource rich countries, firms stop its business.
Foreign businesses such as the Stahlkonzern Arcelor with valleys draw-off its employees, several international airlines approach the concerned regions no longer.
Also the domestic dealers and farmers react: Only a few sales people yet its homeland places leave in order to provide supply.
In some zones in Sierra Leone and Liberia, that stand under quarantine, the cocoa beans and coffee beans important for the export decay among other things on the fields.
The farmers do not venture it to leave its home for the harvest.
Groceries become tight
"The people become always fewer travel", says Phillipe de Vreyer, Parisian expert for the economy of west Africa.
The man for example, who goes normally on the market and sells its vegetable, remains rather home.
The population gets to sense therefore the consequences of the epidemic directly and pressing: Groceries become tight.
On the markets, the supply fades at reason foods such as rice.

Let the largest danger be that international firms avoid the area basically over long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French Think tank iris.
Decisively would be how far and like long the virus yet would spread out.
In investors, the impression could emerge, "that it is dangerous, in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia to live and therefore also to invest", warns Hugon.
The illness burdened also the strained country households of the countries
The illness burdened also the anyway strained country households of the concerned countries.
The Ratingagentur Moody's it fears that its budgets are strained strongly by the high editions for the health system and in addition by the self-deteriorating economy.
The African development bank promised already to assist the health systems of the concerned countries with 60 million dollars (45 million Euro).
The effects are noticeable also already in Nigeria where until now only A FEW Ebola cases were diagnosed.
To be sure the oil rich region in the southern Niger delta is concerned not yet.
Yet elsewhere already many people remain out of fear of a contagion home.
Also reservations in hotels return clearly.
