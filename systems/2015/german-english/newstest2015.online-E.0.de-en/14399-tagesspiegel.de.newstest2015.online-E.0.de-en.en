Matthies means: Highest time for large networking
In view of the galloping technical progress, that threatens to change our comfortable home in High-Tech-control centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies with some extremely trusted electronic accessories comforts himself.
While I write that here, my view falls of the self-coiling cable, that connects the listener with the telephone, and I think: Is Boah, like retro that then?
But behind it a consideration sticks: If the cable were not, all listeners would fly around here in shortest time abandoned in the house, and that would be yet significantly more retro.
Does anyway count yes on the ekeltronischen (ekeltronischen?
No, typing error: electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today the electro scrap of tomorrow is, bought - becomes obsolete.
And who for example today another tube television in the living room has, says that therewith solely that it basically rejects television.
Why these considerations?
Because the crowding of the Ifa brings to the attention of us at the radio tower in this week again our absolute incompetence in questions of the electronics.
The layman, that blindly controlled early washing machine and CD player, grasps today not once the purpose of the devices, that are spread with inconceivable vain expert language before it: "Connected home, Wearables, Health Care and urbanly technologies" promises us the press place.
Is yes, it going yet?
About what should one speak with people, who spread evidently voluntarily such curds?
In the reason, it has gone yes for about 20 years above all therefore that we should network please our house.
So that the yogurt itself reorders itself, so that the Brandmelder in the vacation announces us on the Malediven, that it burns degree in the work room.
It and were not wonderful if we of the office out of the air-conditioning on our early arrival...?
Yes, that prefaces to be sure an air-conditioning.
But a dream becomes very certainly soon true: We lift our watch, say its loud "sucking!" - And at home the dust aug robot departs.
Crazy.
Everything runs out on nothing slighter than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown good blur", whispers an industry connoisseur, one the washing machine can connect with some headphones, sends shows that steam cooked the weather report and the data glasses on how long yet needs the pizza in the oven, what utilizes however nothing, because we stand in the obstruction.
Out of the daily practice, we know moreover: If a new-fangled device is needed once really urgently, the rechargeable battery is guaranteed empty.
What a further reason is that the self-coiling cable will survive at the telephone also the next radio shows.
