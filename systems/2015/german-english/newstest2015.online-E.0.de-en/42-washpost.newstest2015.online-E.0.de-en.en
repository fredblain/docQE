Tax load of businessmen in the room Washington climbs with the economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more Verkäufe and new jobs.
It means also higher taxes.
National and local tax replies for business in the country increased in the past year easily while the economic recovery sped up, such a newly published study in the past week, and the firms in the room Washington formed no exception.
Jointly 27.6 billions paid business in the room District, Maryland and Virginia $ at national and local places in the fiscal year 2013, a climb around 3.8 percent vis-à-vis the revenue of 2012 in the amount of 26.6 billions $.
The national and local tax burden of the businesses climbed in the past year around 4.3 percent on 671 billions $ on, in comparison with 3.9 percent per year before, and it was the third growth year in consequence after the replies 2009 sinking several years and 2010.
National taxes climbed more strongly at than the local duties, around 4.3 percent, so the study, that was carried out by the service agency seriously & Young with the center for national taxation, a tax politics group.
More than the half of the tax collections of the District, 56 percent, comes from business tax while 36 percent of the revenue Marylands come from business.
Virginia obtains the slightest tax collections with 28 percent out of business.
A large part of the climb in the tax collections is established in a recovery of the real estate values of the businesses, say the researchers, what led to an increase of the real estate tax around 3.7 percent per year after the three successive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
During a large part of these profits out of large countries such as California, New York and Texas came, seems to be true the flow also for the room Washington.
Business in the District, Maryland and Virginia 2012 - paid jointly a climb in the course of a year over 10 billions $ at national and local real estate taxes in the past year, in comparison with 9.6 billions $ around 4.2 percent.
But the apparent recovery in the real estate value is not in Maryland so effective in the increase of national and local tax collections because here the real estate tax amount to itself on tightly more than one-fifth of the tax replies of business.
Business in Virginia and D.C. pay almost the half of its national and local taxes in the form of real estate tax.
"In Maryland, following happens: a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax zone around D.C., is either in the possession of the government or of Non-profit-organizations, that pay no real estate tax," said Douglas Lindholm, manager of the center on State Taxation.
Maryland is forced therefore to depended for example much more on the income tax, around which to be able to offer same services, that other countries offer.
The youngest recovery in the tax collections through business cannot be assigned alone the recovery of the real-estate market
Business revenue seem to recover also, so the data.
Business in the region reported over income tax in country organizations of 2.3 billions $ in comparison with 2.1 billions per year 2012.
Maryland took 1 billion $ in business income tax on, the highest sum of the region.
During the trend into the same direction goes, climbs the local tax load for business not at all three places uniformly on.
The Anstiegsrate in the District corresponded with 4.3 percent while the climb in Maryland was clearly higher, 4.9 percent to the national average.
Only Virginia reported a below average tax recovery of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the clearly slightest business income taxes (in all three gives it firm business tax rates) with 6 percent in all three jurisdictions.
The business tax rate in Maryland is about 8.25 percent and in the District in comparatively high 9,975 percent.
A comparable study of the US chamber at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia slighter national and local business tax are demanded and altogether a better tax climate rules than in Maryland.
In the study, the District was not examined.
In spite of the advantages, Virginia is under pressure through its southern neighbor.
North Carolina dismissed laws to the decline of its business tax rates this year of 6.9 percent to 6 percent, that same sentence such as Virginia, and the sentence sink becomes in the coming year to 5 percent.
If the country reaches further its income goals in the coming year, this law could reduce the business income tax rate of the country until 2017 until to 3 percent.
In the meantime, it seems to go Washington better to the small businesses in the room, and they pay therefore more taxes national and local, so the youngest study.
Business tax, that as a personal income tax by small businessmen paid become climbed - a transition structure, after that most small businesses organized are - in the District, Maryland and Virginia in the past year around 20 percent on 2.4 billions $ on, a clear faster growth rate than the business tax altogether.
The researchers say that the trend and the climb will stop in the business taxes in the entire country probably this year, with an increase of the general more defense tax collections for the country and the local governments around 6.2 percent in the first three quarters 2014 in comparison with the same period of the preceding year.
Nevertheless the room could Washington afterwards lame if the edition abridgment of the Federal Government affects the labor market in the region.
