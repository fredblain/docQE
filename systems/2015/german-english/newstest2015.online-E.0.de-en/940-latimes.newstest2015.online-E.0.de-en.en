Putin demands the reception of "Staatlichkeitsgesprächen" with the east Ukraine of Kiev
The Russian Präsident Wladimir Putin according to demanded Russian published reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government adjusts the battles against the separatists in the East of the country and directly with negotiations to that-ness" receives "national the disloyal region.
Its speaker Dimitri Peskow placed later clearly that Putin not therewith had meant, that the zone standing under the inspection the separatist of the east Ukraine would become a part of Russia, but rather that status newly are defined become would must vis-à-vis the Ukraine in order to give the russischsprachigen region the power to the representation of its rights and interests.
Putins proclamation at the Kiewer government to negotiations at eye level with the per Russian rebellious fits however to the strategy five months ago apparently pursued by it since the beginning the riot: Aid for the separatists in the taking in of zones and pressure on the Ukrainian government in order to enable the newly proclaimed region Novorossija factual independence for an alliance with Russia instead of with the west.
Putin convicted in an interview with the national television station canal one the Ukrainian military campaign to the back conquest of the zone held by separatist in the eastern regions Donezk and Luhansk, that were taken in in March and April, after Moscow had rummaged annexed the Ukrainian peninsula on the 18th of March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently the taken in zone as a "Novorossija" or "new Russia" designated, a concept that reminds one of the before revolutionary heyday of the Russian empire.
Putin referred on that, that all that, that are attack hope caught" in the course of the campaign of Ukrainian politician for the choices on the 26th Oct and during government groups civil communities in the zones held by separatist for early peace conversations "in its illusions, Itar Tass reported.
"We must receive immediately detailed conversations, not only to technical questions, but rather also to the political organization of the company and the country status of the south east Ukraine in order to preserve the interests of the person living there," said he.
Peskow said, refer to seen become would must that Putins the national-ness in the context with the larger autonomy, that is discussed for months by the Kiewer leadership, in order to disperse fears in russischsprachigen zones that its cultural and linguistic rights would be endangerd.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern zones the necessary autonomy, said Peskow.
It concerns here not negotiations between the Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, "because it not around a conflict between Russia and the Ukraine concerns, but rather an internal conflict in the Ukraine".
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker to the correction of that "false interpretation" of Putins comments unterstrich the claim to leadership of Russia in the contact with the separatist rebellion in the East in contrast to the direct Annektion of that rummaged, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far larger difficulties to annex the regions Donezk and Luhansk in the east Ukraine because that of the 6.5 million inhabitants are no Russians and surveys yielded out of the time before the conflict a wide majority for the whereabouts in the Ukraine.
The autonomy, that was addressed by Russian diplomat on international forums, would give give the regional governments in the Ukraine authority own trade agreement and outside relations to negotiate, and so the Kremlin de facto the control of a zone, that connects rummaged the Russian country zone with that.
The five months ago annexed peninsula in the black sea is the homeland harbor for the large part of the Russian navy as well as an important trade harbor and historic coast region.
The regions between the Rostowgebiet in Russia and that rummaged is in addition rich at mines, factories and foundry, that produce important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian Präsident Petro Poroshenko proposed in its speech to the inauguration on the 7th of June that the Ukrainian legislation - after reelection - additions should consider to the constitution, with which the respective zones a larger control is cleared of its finances and the status of the languages.
But its presentation of autonomy seems in sharp contrast, to which the Kremlin and the separatist rebels to stand, whose armament is reproached and for Aufstachelung Moscow.
Request last Putins at Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye level, followed after a further advancing of the rebels in the past week after Russian troops and tank are penetrated over that peaceful region along the Asowschen sea into the east Ukraine previously.
The separatists supported by Russia the first step of a campaign to the acceptance of the strategic coast region received rummaged is in the hand stroke, that of security officials Ukrainian according to fears to that, the inspection by Nowoasowsk.
For this reason massive civil and military preparations started in order to secure Mariupol, a steel industry harbor with 500,000 inhabitants, that lies rummaged between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday in a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and asked urgently for deeds in order to prevent a further Russian aggression against the Ukraine, an earlier Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We stand shortly before a point, at which it gives no back more," Poroshenko warned.
Troops strange thousand and hunderte of strange tanks are now on the territory of the Ukraine.
The EU summit concluded no concrete actions, that leadership demanded the design of further sanction against Russia that should step in an unspezifizierten escalation of the Ukraine crisis effective.
Ukrainian soldiers must themselves of its positions in Ilowajsk retract after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers penetrated last week into the Donezkregion in order to support the belagerten separatists, said colonel Andrij Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian national security advice and defense advice reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were included by the Russian idea in Ilowajsk, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers, who had been taken a week ago on Ukrainian zone caught, Lysenko divided on Sunday with.
