The scandal surrounding the art adviser Helge Achenbach is being negotiated for the first time in court on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi-founder Theo Albrecht, in a civil suit by the DÃ¼sseldorf Regional Court of 19.4 million euros in compensation from Thun and two of his companies that are in bankruptcy proceedings.
A court spokeswoman said on Monday.
The complaint states that Achenbach had cheated with the purchase of works of art and vintage cars and calculated Berthold Albrecht higher than actually paid purchase price.
As a result, the commission would have been higher.
Achenbach for 121 million euros of valuables for Albrecht have bought.
