The Socialists in France should "keep their mouths shut and put France in order," the most important ally of Fran√ßois Hollande said.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left, "to show their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reshuffle has met with disapproval in the vast majority of the French.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to remain by their side," he said to loud applause.
As reassuring, the prime minister insisted that his government's controversial 35-hour week in France, despite fierce demands for an easing of regulation of Emmanuel Macrons, the new economy minister, not question.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande had called his Mitsozialisten to stand "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the justice minister, shared a spanner in the works in which she performed at a meeting of rebel Socialist member of parliament and the Socialist party criticised the fact that they take the French "faith in their future."
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front derided the constant infighting of the Socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last more than a few months?
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls does not either, they are forced to form a new government, if not the old has survived a summer.
"And also the new autumn or winter is not" survive, Miss Le Pen told supporters.
She repeated her party's call for a dissolution of parliament and said that she is confident to emerge as the winner in the early elections and is ready for government.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was in the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche showed that 76 percent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is exposed to the risk of falling apart before the end of the term, Hollande's 2017 into several rival factions.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience when the new Socialist government get any improvement in the economy and record unemployment figures.
"There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion quickly needs to feel that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
