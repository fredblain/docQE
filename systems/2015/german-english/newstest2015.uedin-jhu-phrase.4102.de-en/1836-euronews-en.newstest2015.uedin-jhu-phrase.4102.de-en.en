There, he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations.
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not all over Ukraine peacefully.
We need to fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge joint Ukrainian People's Front to fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, headmaster of the school in Slawjansk, visited Jazenjuks daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace is finally here again and that the children receive an education that will help them in the future.
