Judge temporarily blocks legislation that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A US federal judge on Sunday temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, lawyers say it is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, which was made by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, into law in June and come into force on 1st Sept. to were doctors that perform abortions, forced to buy a patients right to a hospital within a radius of 30 miles of their practice.
The judge's decision means that the doctors can continue to carry out preliminary legal abortions, while they apply for such a right.
"The plaintiffs will be able to continue to work in accordance with the law, while trying to obtain these rights," Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling.
Within a month, a hearing will be scheduled for the judge to make a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures and said that doctors gained more time to obtain hospital admissions.
"Today's decision means that the women" in Louisiana some underhand escape law which wants to deprive them of their health and their rights, Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued on behalf of three of the five clinics in the state to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the ruling on the doctors stretched from the two hospitals that had not joined the lawsuit, and also asked for instruction.
Louisiana is one of 11 states have enacted similar laws, but courts have recently such measures in Alabama and Mississippi to be declared constitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas, most of the remaining clinics in the state have been forced to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion supporters and the American College of Ostretricians crushing, as well as the American Medical Association have agreed to say that the rights of doctors demand unnecessary restrictions.
Abortion opponents counter that the measures are designed to protect the health of women, although some also welcomed the impact of a closure of hospitals.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has Patienteineinweiserechte, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all the other doctors in the state will be forced to perform abortions, this doctor no longer would run out of fear for his safety, the operation, the group said.
In their arguments against the judgment of the Louisiana state officials said that they would not punish doctors for performing abortions, while their requests for patient rights, no way were still pending.
