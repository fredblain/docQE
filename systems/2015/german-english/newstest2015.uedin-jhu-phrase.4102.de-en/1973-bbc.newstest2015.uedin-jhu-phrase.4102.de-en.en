Manufacturing in the eurozone at a 13-month-low
The increase in production in the euro zone slowed in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months, a closely watched survey.
The final Markit purchasing managers index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector fell to 50,7 in August, after a stand of 51.8 in July.
A number above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders fell and factory experienced declines in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The numbers arrive before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets expect the bank a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the eurozone and the threat of deflation with an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could make further information during the course of this week, if he pulls a quantitative easing in the eurozone, according to those who were from Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although a small growth is better than no growth, the deterrent effect of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for the manufacturers," Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said.
The factory-PMI for Germany, the largest trading partner of Russia within the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, the bloc and France, the PMI fell to the second-largest economy on 46,9.
France remains a concern, as well as the descent of Italy by a solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in key industrial mechanism, Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer are not reassuring, "said Mr Dobson.
The decline of the industry probably feeds the fire of the analysts, who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
The positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that can be said for the purchasing managers index of manufacturing in the euro zone in August, is that the sector will continue to grow after that."
He added: "In the euro area producers will find life very difficult at the moment, obviously, since the current heightened geopolitical tensions increase - particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine - uncertainty over the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and will probably mean that some jobs will be delayed or even cancelled, particularly large-scale orders.
He said that it was "increasingly likely" that the ECB will eventually have to take a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
