The tax burden of businessmen in Washington is rising with the economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax issues for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while accelerating the economic recovery, according to a new study published last week, and the company in the Washington area was no exception.
Businesses in the District, Maryland and Virginia together paid $27.6 billion to state and local agencies in fiscal year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to revenue of $26.6 billion in 2012.
State and local tax burden of enterprises rose by 4.3 percent last year to $671 million, compared to 3.9 percent in the previous year, and it was the third year in a row of growth after several years of declining orders in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than the local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for Business Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the revenue of the district, 56 percent, came from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of revenues come from Maryland companies.
Virginia has the lowest tax revenue with 28 percent of company.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery of the real estate value of companies, researchers, leading to an increase in property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large proportion of these profits from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the process also seems to be true for the Washington area.
Businesses in the District, Maryland and Virginia together paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - a rise in the course of a year by 4.2 percent.
But the apparent recovery in the real estate values in Maryland is not as effective in improving state and local tax revenue, because the real estate taxes amount to barely more than one-fifth of the tax issues of companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. are paying almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"In Maryland, the following happens: A large proportion of real estate, particularly in the fiscal area around D.C., is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that pay no property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on, for example, the income tax to be able to offer the same services that offer other states.
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies can not only be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market
Company revenues appear to recover, so the data.
Businesses in the region reported on income taxes for state organizations of $2.3 billion compared with $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took a $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is heading in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses is not rising uniformly in all three places.
The growth rate in the District met with 4.3 percent of the national average, while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has 6 percent in all three areas, the significantly lower corporate income taxes (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and the District at relatively high 9,975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia lower state and local business taxes are required and, overall, a better tax climate than Maryland.
In the study, the District was not investigated.
Despite the advantages of Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour.
North Carolina passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the coming year.
If the state continues to reach its revenue targets for the coming year, this law could reduce the corporate income tax rate of up to 3 per cent by 2017.
In the meantime, it seems to be small businesses in the Washington area, and it therefore pay more state and local taxes, according to the most recent study.
Corporate taxes and personal income taxes are paid by small businessmen - a transitional structure in which most small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia increased last year by 20 percent to $2.4 billion, a faster rate of growth than the corporate taxes altogether.
The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes across the country are likely to continue this year, with an increase of the general VAT revenues for 2014, the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters compared to the same period of the previous year.
However, the region could lag behind Washington, if the federal government's spending cuts affects the labour market in the region.
