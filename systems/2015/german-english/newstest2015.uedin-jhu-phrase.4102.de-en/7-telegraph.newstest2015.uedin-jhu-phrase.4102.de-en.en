Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" was a blockbuster
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played a less than 30 million dollars of his $90 million budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded only 12 million dollars in its budget of 70 million dollars.
Cameron Diaz in the movie "Sex Tape" tailored, played on an opening weekend just 14.6 million dollars, children's films such as "Dragon 2" made slightly tame while also disappointed on revenue.
An article by the Telegraph's film critic Robbie Collin indicates that the children's films, the lack of quality in the films themselves may be the reason.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films so far and described "Dragon 2" tame easily made as purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
In movies there for a slightly older audience, however, it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore- and Meta Critic rating for every summer movie release, between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013, and in the current year to at least 2,000 screens.
The results are based on the opinions of film-goers and film critics and indicate that this year's movie hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators argue that the trend to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of Web-streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently appearing in Disney's Jungle Book film soon, works on the website Hollywood Reporter, said: "I think the times are changing."
We have to accept that and not try to chase after the past.
In contrast to the currently weak box-office results of the Hollywood productions recently reached Netflix Streaming content with sales of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, in which the turnover stood at 837 million dollars.
Last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticized the movie studios that they concentrated too much on series of comics and predicted a "meltdown" of Hollywood.
Seen in the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his grim prophecy could well contain a true core.
In the summer of 2015, due to the expected potential blockbuster, including disorder: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry, however, are more optimistic.
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the decline in box office results recently simply as "cyclical" and told the Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer ever at the cinema box office, and no one will worry more about the business."
