Matthies says: Time for large networking
Given the galloping technological progress which our cosy homes in high-tech threatens to transform switching centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies console themselves with a very familiar electronic accessories.
As I write this, my eye falls on the spiral cable that connects the listener on the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a thought behind it: If the cable is not all listeners, would fly around in a short time, unlike in the House, and that would still be significantly more retro.
In any case applies to the disgust ("disgust"?
No, typo: Electronic) sector bought the rule that the world today is the electrical waste of tomorrow - out of date.
And who, for example, still has a CRT television sets in the living room, simply saying that he basically rejects television.
Why is this?
Because it reminds us of the Ifa Andr√§ngen on radio tower this week our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics.
The layman, before washing machines and CD players dominated blindly, not even now understands the purpose of the devices with incredible eitlem Expertensprech are spread before him: "Connected home, Build IT, Healthcare and New Technologies" promises the press office.
Yes, it's?
What is there to talk with people who seem to spread such Quark voluntarily?
In fact, it is for about 20 years, above all, that we should always connect our house.
To make the yogurt even after being ordered to fire alarm tells us on holiday to the Maldives that it burns grad in the work room.
And it would be wonderful if the air conditioning from the office to our early arrival...?
Yes, but this requires an air-conditioning.
But certainly a dream will soon come true: We raise our watch, telling her "sucking!" - and home of the vacuum cleaning robot drives off.
Misleading.
It all amounts to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods blurring" raunt an industry expert, you can connect the washing machine with a pair of headphones, the steam sends nao the weather forecast and the glasses will show how long the pizza in the oven needs, what is not, however, because we are in a traffic jam.
From the day-to-day practice, we also know that if a cutting-edge device is really urgently needed once the battery is guaranteed.
But another reason is that the spiral cable will survive on the phone the next radio shows.
