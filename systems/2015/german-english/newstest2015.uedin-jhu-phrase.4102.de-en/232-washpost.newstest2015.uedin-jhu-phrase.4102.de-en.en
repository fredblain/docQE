Feminists criticise race and police behavior in Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mon.
The participants raised their hands high in the air and chanting "hands up, don't shoot" while they waited for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo., over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown the Bloggerin Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
After her experience, white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to reproductive rights and income inequality.
While the tensions, however, rose in the Midwest and throughout the country have received attention, Perez saw the responses of white women focused 100% on the race.
Compared with the responses of black women shortly after the shots on 9 August, the personal essays with titles like "thoughts on Ferguson came from a white woman" and "feminism is not just about the oppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez that meant an important change.
"I do not think that you will find many people in feminism," the white and speak about his privileges in such a high-class type, she said.
People felt forced to say something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves, and because the situation in Ferguson is ethnisiert so that they have to express that.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from the Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black Americans are exposed to every day, but which are not considered "women's issues" in the cultural space.
"I can make something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and I get" 150 Likes from anywhere, "Mitchell said.
If I post something about how people of color are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk openly about a relationship, but not about safety in the public space?" She asked.
For black women, like Mitchell, race, gender and sexuality studies in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the issues of clean; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in the mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender studies at the George Mason University says that its predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the explanatory statement was almost always" the rape of a white woman, Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the murder of Lynch.
For Hattery was the split between white and black women to the point where white fighters for women's suffrage, such as Susan B. Anthony for the country in the late years of the 19th century, analyzed and stated that the battle could be the right to vote only for one group: Women or blacks.
"They made the decision to fight for women's suffrage and the right to vote" for blacks should come later, Hattery said.
When one remembers such things, one with power, why not trust white women, colored women.
We have not done our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade until white women against Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching organized themselves.
The group was established almost 40 years after the initial request for assistance from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - a mirror of the age in which white feminists "trapping" played with the problems facing black women is set apart for generations.
"Would it not be great if the activists, who include such traditional feminist platforms do a child's right to education as seriously as they do with the right of conception control Mitchell asked?."
The second generation feminists, who built their career on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what this means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem came two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pithy article by Rebecca Carroll, distribution of the Guardian, in which she calls for more protests by white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand the danger inherent in the body - and opinions on race that are significantly different in public opinion polls - will make the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem represents a more intersectional feminism, in which race and gender issues, are some of their comments on the racial issue in America, amazed.
Christina Summers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who stole Feminism?" To She The People said that young men are in the United States, especially young colored men, "far more vulnerable than their sisters" but Steinems comments about Ferguson are contrary to their earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of specialized programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House is a small program, My Brother's Keeper, worked to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men recently, there were irritating reactions from many feminists including Gloria Steinem.
The ratio of police to the black community is not the only problem that is at the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the south-western border of the country has taken up this year, the issue of immigration reform to the surface again - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairwoman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilized women for immigration reform, said that for a reconsideration of the issue as an important women's issue, they only publish the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," Mercado said.
If the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, women who accompany them, are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories will find a reverberation in the women's organisations," she said.
