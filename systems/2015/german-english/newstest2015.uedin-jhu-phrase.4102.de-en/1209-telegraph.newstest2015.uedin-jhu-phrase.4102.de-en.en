Garden centres are falling house owner figures
The decline, coupled with a greater decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35 could mean that garden centres are losing tens of thousands of pounds a year, if today's young consumers, according to a study by the HTA reports, as set out in the Financial Times, "core age group for garden products."
The report says that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount, the people with home for their garden.
The increase in the number of people who live in areas of high urbanisierten without gardens, the popular procedure to asphalt more front gardens to park purposes and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the sector, where almost Â£5 billion a year in sales will be implemented.
In Greater London, where the percentage of home owners from 61 to 43 percent over a period of 6 years, the lowest spending on garden products are reported per household.
The HTA and the Royal horticultural Society indicate that housing for rent or small gardens do not mean that people can draw any plants.
Guy barter, chief horticultural adviser to the RHS said: "Container gardeners, for example, is very popular with tenants because their plants in a move can take."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the garden retailers due to rising numbers of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s until the mid-1990s.
He also predicted for this year, an improved market situation because of the better weather after harsh weather in March and April of last year.
