Genetic disorder often diagnosed wrong
A British woman says she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost their entire youth in the belief that they have to live only a few years after she had been diagnosed with a different disease.
You actually suffered by the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group ererbter disturbances that the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord damage.
UK Charity CMT announced that diagnostic errors are a frequent problem in humans with CMT, because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in Britain probably suffering from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an uncertain course and curved toes.
Erkrankte also suffer from loss or pain, the disease is incurable and progressive, meaning that the symptoms become worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that her peaceful kingdom-ataxia (FA) suffer - a disease with a very poor chance of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair, before they were 18, and die before their 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who is now 51 years old, said: "As a child, I knew that I could not do the same as the others.
I constantly fell and took everything from me.
I could never ride with other children skating or skateboard and was made fun of and often to go to school because of my kind.
Rodgers said that they saw at the age of 13 years after several operations to relieve their Achilles se and stretching their legs, their medical records, when her doctor had left the room and read that she suffered from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I've told anyone this, but I went home, looked after the illness in the library and wrote to the FA's company," she said.
When I received a reply, I was shocked and terribly ran in panic.
I thought that I would be in a wheelchair, with 18 and 25, and in the meantime would slowly lose all my skills.
I did it all alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said when she was 17, it was clear that their skills had not been as strong as they had imagined and consulted her doctor.
He got up and hugged me and said, "my love, I do not think that you have it, otherwise you're now in a wheelchair."
I think you've something far less life-threatening.
After a number of genetic tests on her CMT has been identified.
"When he told me what it was CMT I felt like when I was a winner," she said.
UK Charity CMT has a CMT Awareness month started to draw attention to this disease.
