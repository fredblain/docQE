The hellish year tenth of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the horrific siege of the school as the children caught up in it today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan in southern Russia as hostages.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world.
We have returned to Beslan to identify some of the victims who had escaped death in the bestiality in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the school in Beslan in which 334 people were killed, including 186 children, warned the heroic survivors last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As a fanatical Islamist terrorists, children and parents on 1 September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, captured and killed, that seemed like the evil means.
The tragedy united West and East in disgust, and then turned in surprisingly action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we have returned to Beslan to identify some of the victims who had escaped death in the bestiality in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome the odds, though the memory of these terrorist hell will follow them forever.
Their best hope?
The fact that the war ravaging Ukraine now - and where children die like them - now an end.
The girl who was photographed with the singer in the age of school sports hall
It was designed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakow photographed and famous when she was only in her underwear, singer in the age of school sports hall after a mine had exploded.
Completely confused Aida after her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were thought to be dead, but she survived.
"One woman told me that I should run for my life, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My legs were blood flows.
I stood up and climbed again to look for my mother.
A soldier brought them in safety.
After a series of operations, they considered themselves to be completely cured, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I am afraid that I have to be operated on again.
Some shrapnel shards are still in my knee.
Their aim is now to be a dentist to help people as she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it has not broken to me," she says fighting fun.
"This happened to me, and this cannot be changed.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remind me of those who have stayed there.
My friends and I try to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small, and dreamed of going to school together.
"I do not want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think to a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, although the memory is weak, something every year.
I am pleased that many people in the world still recall with horror, and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the pictures of me online, I zurückklettere in school, I think that a lot of people see it for the first time, to understand our disaster and help to ensure that this does not happen again.
The boy, who fled through the bullets, in the view that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school with 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother, Tamara.
After seven years, he said: "Mom told me that I should come to me if there was an explosion, and hold their hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him: "Run."
Full of fear, they could be dead, he fled, and saw on the way a wine of infant, took it by the hand and fled with bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who concluded his son outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother has died.
He said: "I could not save them."
In fact, according to Tamara had stumbled outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, on the assumption that their son had died.
After its reunification, she said: "I wept with joy.
I could not believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (now dissolved) from the newspaper News of the World to obtain by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie, the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion.
"This horror is watching you every day, but I wish I could stop with the reminder," he said yesterday.
But I can say that in my memory it will be fainter.
I know that I immediately after man ever threw away all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that is not a problem for me.
"I am not afraid to go back to the gym, but I do not think me about.
I remember these kids with whom I played in the yard, and who did not.
We never say that they have been killed or dead.
We say that they are in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, particularly in the toy shop, where I could choose what I wanted, and the ride in an open top car.
But now he has caused anxiety around places like Ukraine, where wars, the kind of accident that he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop to remember.
"I am so sorry for all those who are suffering under the atrocities," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer last week in a monastery.
So I want to help.
One day, I want to go to the police and hope that they take me next year at the training academy.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said: "Thirty-seven children were killed from our neighbourhood, you can imagine it?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there was simply no children who were able to set up and run around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She remembers vividly of her trip to London with Damir.
The people of London cried when I told our story.
At the time, I understood how people can understand on the other side of the world, our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could talk to Cherie and tell her just that 10 years have passed, but I still like to meet her and her husband to me in London, and how that Damir and has helped me.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat borscht and phoning them all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shot with his water pistol at them and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British are so readily shared our pain and support us.
She said: "I always think that this world is not in these 10 years, become better.
In Ukraine, the war continues, and people are dying every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and killed.
These are just such children as ours.
I think that for many, the war is a part of the messages they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop to feel that.
Nothing has changed, the people still want to kill themselves and that is so sad.
Damir was and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.
He is not looking for revenge, for example, he is not overwhelmed by the past atrocities.
I know he doesn't like it, but he has six close friends from the class, and they sometimes go into the gym and light candles there.
When he was small he suffered, including - I remember how he was sometimes on the sofa, the face turned from us for hours on end.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I remember how he threw all of his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, handsome, bigger than me, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that several hours I was so sure that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered myself after the explosion and saw the legs I came to me, and the hell looked around me, with body parts lying around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could have survived in this hell.
"I remember that I called him," Damir, according to go on, "but I was so sure that he had not heard me.
But he has heard it, and he ran away.
And so life goes on, unlike that of many others, for us.
Mr Ilyin, 17
The boy, whose terrible picture after the siege became a symbol of the horrors of Beslan
Comfort: The Beslan-survivors (Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, an image of Georgy today
His face was scarred by blutüberströmtes fear when he ran for his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking images of the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him for his first day of school, before she rushed off to get their older son, Vladimir.
"I left the court for about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it and my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she remembers.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives from us, but all of them were killed.
Only my Georgy managed to survive.
The closer the date comes, the more difficult it is to remember and to talk about it.
There is not a single day that we do not remember this tragedy.
We do not think that it was a long time ago, I think it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from those days have me constantly.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Eindringlich: The image of Georgy (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized in a statue (right).
I remember that on that day (so wanted to go to school, and he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew that he was alive when I saw him on television.
And now there is even a statue of a weeping born in San Marino.
Georgy sees the image, and it's hidden at home on the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also think that the people around the world feel our pain, thanks to this image.
Georgy says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People always look at such tragedies and never know the truth.
And now they are examining the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is becoming something awful.
"I cannot understand how this is possible, because if you ask the people, nobody wants a war, so how is this happening?
Ten years of nothing in such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
About three or four years I have had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it was better.
Later, I went back to school in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed.
That is why I always go to the gym when the moves closer to 1 September.
I would like to pay my tribute to my old childhood friends.
It is hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I am not a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I am not bemitleide.
My life goes on.
I have concluded this year, the school and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I am going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was an education in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health has not allowed it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but this will not happen.
Georgi Fanijew,
The boy, who survived, though he was imprisoned at the feet of a murderous terrorists
A miracle: Georgy Fanijew was during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was caught in the gym and sat next to the bomb, which was mounted at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It really is a miracle that he was not killed.
"We feel it, as if it were yesterday," Georgy, who wanted to go to the FSB, the intelligence officer says, but this could do for his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, there is nothing that I have left behind me.
I am now older and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences - I have to say that this is not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I actually felt a little better after that, but I can not forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - a year later - was the first and only time that I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there again and ask me not to show you where I have sat in this famous image.
Survivor: Georgy Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in a hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry him with me every day.
My friends know that I do not think like them or talk about it and they never asked me after school.
Physically, I feel good.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but now I can run well.
But because of my health, I was unable to study at the FSB secret service academy in St Petersburg, as I wanted to.
I have my documents, including those submitted medical and she responded that it was not possible.
My second passion were the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have been there two years behind me.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows."
He said: "I knew that I would never tell my children from my experiences.
Children should know nothing about it and they should not suffer it too, of course.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: "The pain never leaves me.
He is in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the celebrations for the memory.
I know that Georgy will not go.
There needs to be much more violent for him, because he was there, and I do not.
I waited for him at home and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he has been returned to me, here in Beslan are all drawn from it.
It remains in us.
Georgy is now an adult, but the horror is still in him.
It is difficult to accept that, if something happens to one so Unfaires.
He is a boy, he loves sports, but he could not attend because of his knee.
He was operated on several times, he can run, but no sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will haunt us forever.
Many friends and neighbours were killed during the siege, and that only reinforces my pain.
I have lost a lot of people who I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift that God could use me, but my heart cries for the killing.
I know of families where the children were born, but also by widows who have never married.
It is hard to accept that there is life, even if you do not want that.
I shall never forget how my heart jumped on me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I, what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine already, and many are killed.
If we just take all these rebels and could throw - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa,
The baby, which was taken so simply by a Special Operations Command in security
Gerettet: Aljona Tskajewa is brought by a Russian special operation command in security (left).
She is now ten (right) and remembers nothing about the atrocities
In 2004, the world held its breath when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but kept in their cruelty, their 30-year-old mother, a 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.
Her father, Ruslan has since married again and with his new wife, Svetlana has a little girl that he had named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, remembers the siege and has grown to be an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
"They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and want to spare them all the memories that go with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
