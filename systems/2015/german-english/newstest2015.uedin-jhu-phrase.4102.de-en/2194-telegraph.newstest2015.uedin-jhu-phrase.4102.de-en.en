Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort, change the nature of things, even in such a huge organisation like the NHS.
As a consulting physician anesthesia, he devoted his career to save the hospital, both the agony of the disease and the ordeal of treatment.
Among his patients, remembers his wife, was an MI6 staff, with the devastating effects of torture had to live.
Lawson knew that the diagnoses and disease are important to doctors, while the cases are mostly preoccupied with something quite different: Pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose ordeal began.
"I have felt" not me, "he wrote in May of this year.
I had difficulties to raise me.
While he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he noted that he made his wife Juliet impatient accusations.
"I want it all now rather than later," he noted.
When Juliet for a week on a business trip, Lawson felt quite unusually, and worried for no reason.
Was something in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his chest.
Just two weeks ago, he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination before.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer of the breast skin, the lungs via the skin.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is often difficult to determine.
While some smokers suffering from lung cancer, for example, have not been all lung cancer before smoking.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the underlying cause is an asbestos exposure - contact with the fibrous material, which was once seen as a "wonder material" but now recognized as lethal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can ignore as easy.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous Asbesttyp has been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the industry committed voluntarily to use them.
Even where he was employed, only people in certain sectors were working directly with the fabric - plumbers, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous material from a different time, he now seems to be little concern.
But this complacency is misplaced.
Britain, it seems, is the culmination of a Mesoltheliom-epidemic.
There are more deaths from be mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, so many people to this disease than die in road accidents.
The annual numbers of Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and estimated future deaths in Britain
The reason why we are now witnessing the deadly effects, although asbestos is illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999), is that an be mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the scourge of be mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and still is, in the houses in which we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we learn and the shops where we shop.
And therefore be mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limitations, profession or age.
The privileged bastions of the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a protected space.
The Parliament buildings are asbestos contaminated.
Even in the hospitals, in which we are supposed to be healthy, have already been identified as a result of this deadly Karzinogens herd.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a plumber.
It was difficult for him to imagine where he could possibly have come in contact with asbestos.
Then he found it.
"It looks as if it was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed six years of my education," he wrote.
All of them - students, nurses, doctors and doorman - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my contemporaries will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was unable to answer that question, at least in part.
"Of the four doctors who have been trained at Guy's Hospital" and that "in the last five years suffering from mesothelioma, in 2010, he wrote in a letter," I am the last one who still lives. "
How many of us are still ill?
Andrew Lawson be mesothelioma at the age of 48 years has been diagnosed.
When he died on 17 February of this year, he was 55.
It was an unusually long time for survival.
Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months after diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will fall ill?"
The UK's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050 if the asbestos epidemic is expected to arrive in the UK to a standstill, a total of 90,000 of the disease have fallen victim.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they are going to die.

A quick look at the files of the courts to which the victims are often due to damages, shows how far the scourge of Mesothelioms is already widespread.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, admitted to have exposed asbestos Janice Allen negligent way.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagship store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old than when she began her work in M & S.
Now she has two children in their twenties.
They "Before this thing," says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I really didn't do anything about asbestos.
I never thought that this would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the notion of asbestos is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name stems from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fibre structure, which makes the polymer tough and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotile asbestos, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.
It has been used for roof tiles, floor tiles, pipe insulations, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but nonetheless by the EU and the WHO considered "high health risk" with possible fatal outcome.
The more dangerous brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that there is a "clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high Mesotheliomraten."

Janice Allen has perhaps not seen as a typical Mesotheliomopfer, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is not unusual.
He has presented a study of those concerned, given that a significant proportion of Mesotheliome without known suspension through work or in the home "was probably caused by asbestos exposure in the environment."
A large proportion of these contacts, according to his statement is based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks as though no one could expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which studied the palace of Westminster, shows how people could be at the heart of the government, unknowingly have been exposed to the substance.
Goddard in 2009 reported that the service shafts and pipes behind the committee rooms of the House were contaminated with asbestos, the lethal fibers could be created by something as harmless as "strong air movements."
MPs are often accused of having to look after their own interests, but in this case it looks as if the opposite is true.
While the management of the Parliamentary Work Service insisted that the Westminster Palace, a "clean health certificate" have received, it is now undisputed that cost £1 billion to be spent over several years, to renovate the Parliament, to modernize the electrical installations and to remove the asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, the MEPs are more likely in the nearby QE2-conference meetings will be on the green benches at Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos is not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions."
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.
All we can do now is wait. "
A person who could never determine the contact with asbestos exactly Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
As Andrew Lawson suggested the 50-year-old Abbott, who during his work in hospitals was exposed to the asbestos.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos lawsuits were decided positively," he says, "but I can not prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places where they have worked, and to the data.
What he remembers of the day is still just at the beginning of December 2009, when he received a kind of Fieber.
He was 45, and conducted an operation just late in the evening.
Suddenly, I had chills.
It came suddenly.
I felt horrible.
I thought the ride home not to create more.
As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain come from the breast skin, the skin around his lungs.
But, like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He was not a month to work.
Doctors made verwunderte x-rays of his chest and anchor Pleurakathether, in order to remove fluid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
His complaints, however, remained without a diagnosis.
His health stabilized slowly, and he returned to his job.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after physical activity and heavy breathing.
In 2011, Abbott's a patient with similar symptoms in his practice, and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott combined this with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection was clear in this case.
In September 2011, Abbotts condition again deteriorated and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray pictures to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott had felt ill for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the decor of ribs and chest fur.
I am an optimist.
I am mostly just go, "he says.
To be honest, I had not even made me so many worries.
But Rachel, my wife was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "They told me that it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Mesothelioma diagnosis
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to get a lawyer.
Only now, he realised the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread," particularly in large public buildings, where pipes were insulated with asbestos, he said.
The people who were exposed to the asbestos in these buildings are now.
And so now be mesothelioma strikes younger people who have not worked in the traditional professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation layer beneath the earth in hospitals, so patients were more likely to not exposed to the substance.
But many people who ate in pedestrian tunnels changed from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground restaurants (such as Graham Abbott often did), most likely to come in contact with toxic substances.
It turns out that the patients for several decades after the war hospitals were potentially lifesaving, but life-threatening for the doctors.
He is still.
Students from their Bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats.
And it is not only hospitals.
Asbestos was due to its fabulous insulating and flame properties often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls.
Even schools.
In fact, many people have probably had the first contact with asbestos in the classroom.
Across the country, thousands of chemistry lessons, pupils have parked their Bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats.
On the issue of asbestos sites is now often mentioned in schools.
And while innocent objects in our houses, such as floor plates or shingle roofs are included by default as asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison that is contained in large parts of our properties," Andrew Morgan, said the lawyer, who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial of Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact, who imagined an affected woman, was the demolition of a Gartenschuppens in the 1970s.
So you, as you continue your garden shed.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process it, Mr Abbott says.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I could not concentrate on what I was doing.
Two weeks ago I was in practice.
Then I knew that I go and had to concern myself with myself.
Well, I will not see another Christmas.
The biggest difficulty with the perspective of the position of a doctor to a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how he was overwhelmed by all the information with which he had to come.
"It was very difficult to absorb all this," he says.
"I asked my doctor how long I have?"
And it gave me about 12 months.
I remember that I thought, "Oh well, I will not see another Christmas.
That's "then."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-support mechanism - breathing itself that caused the deadly cancer is.
Most cases of mesothelioma caused by asbestos exposure.
Asbestos is composed of tiny fibres.
If the asbestos is infamous and resound to the fibers, they can look at the breast skin, the skin around the lungs set around.
Asbestos fibres irritate the breast skin and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is with the inhalierten needle-shaped asbestos fibers," says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart/thorax doctor who in 2001 to Guy's Hospital.
The hospital, by Andrew Lawson claimed that it has exposed him to asbestos, ironically, is now a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated several others who were also likely to face during their training at the hospital of the asbestos.
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed by the breathing process, where the skin is.
By nature, it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers don't work so well for mesothelioma.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is hotly contested.
Some say that it is worth a try.
Treasure denies.
"It is not the breast skin" cut out, he says.
They do not come around with a knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer is "not very well to chemotherapy," which shows the "impact," but not cure.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live a long time, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still struggling.
After he had contacted mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, a one-man support and consulting office for Mitbetroffene.
"Hello, cancer center," he imagined happily on calls.
"He was" very positive, "Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would last four months and is expected to extend its life by only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to make things in a slightly more positive light. "
Following the advice of several doctors decided Abbott, his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, cardiac-thoracic specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage by the fact that I had to be referred, I called and got an appointment," admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial to-be mesothelioma sufferers, the best available therapies to exercise.
But if those treatments fail, eventually, inevitably, many people are of a different financial concern - the future of the families that they left behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher water House LLP.
"It's been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for the health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s, it was realized that even a very low burden posed a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally put their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full compensation" because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his contact was a mesothelioma asbestos on the guy's back.
After the investigation into his death, a spokesman for the guy's, however, confirmed that the asbestos fibres were removed from the basement area in the 1990s. "
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How can be removed asbestos
In fact, it is to-be mesothelioma sufferers who are seeking compensation, a huge problem, the deadly asbestos exposure to a company or a job, usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who oppose claims to know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the prosecutor.
In response, there have been significant new legislation earlier this year that it makes for easier Mesotheliom-victims to claim compensation, even though their former employers are no longer detectable.
The law has established a fund sponsored by the insurance industry by £350 million for those diagnosed after July 2012, show a contact, but will be able to sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs will receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal compensation process would appeal to them - about £120,000.
About 300 successful applications to the program are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mesotheliom-affected that £350 million a "very good job" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal from insurers for insurers," he says, and indicates that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time had not gone away and mesothelioma patients-businesses find and normally they could sue.
Even Mike Penning, former work and pensions minister, admitted that the bill was "not perfect."
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that rapid action was given seven deaths a day.
"The people are suffering so much and need help now," said Penning during the second hearing of the mesothelioma Act in December of last year.
At that point, Graham Abbott for 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski.
After their first meeting Lazdunski Lang-recommended an operation from which he, unlike Tom Treasure expects a positive effect.
This was from a radiation therapy and chemotherapy followed - a triple therapy, with Lang-Lazdunski a survival rate over five years by up to 40 percent can present.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is, of course, the most important thing, Abbott says.
We see that time and time again in patients.
There is something that you can go on.
If you place, you very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent the surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he was the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
After scans showed no sign of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several spots around my breast cancer.
I was 50.
This is not life-threatening.
This is lebensbeendend.
Again Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now, no trace of the tumours is more visible.
But the process is physically and mentally very tiring.
You need to think about practical things - about money, when I am no longer, for example, or my wife, show how the boiler time setting.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that is not always easy.
"It is difficult for parents," he says.
It is hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I said to my girls that I had a disease with which I would not be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and candies.
They told their friends, and it soon, we got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restrained.
She said not much.
Such talks are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such talks are not of hope, not a trace of hope of survival.
The disease causes (such as for Stephen Jay Gould), a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma is not life-threatening.
