4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take photos or videos under water, there is a range of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action-Cam as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both for about $300.
I took these photos in a family party with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery compartment and other subjects are tightly closed.
Put your camera on the photos or videos that you want to include.
Some cameras and camcorders feature scenes and recording modes by which the exposure time is optimized for d√§mmrigen underwater conditions.
And before you jump into it, you check your equipment is operational in the depth.
Some cameras are permitted only for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our shopping guides and reviews of digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple shots - because many of them will not work.
Point-and-shoot cameras are equipped with an LCD, with which you can compose images, not usually action-cams.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see under water, and the right image is a matter of luck.
So you are making a lot of shots.
If your camera has a series mode, with a series of shots with different exposure settings are made, you use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is dramatically worse, the further you move away from the surface.
If possible, you remain close to the surface, if you make shots in a pool, a lake or the sea.
As a result, you can also get more colour into your photos; the deeper you go, the less you'll see color.
Go to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but underwater, it is even more important because of the poor lighting conditions.
It is particularly important when you work with an action-cam: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means that you have to get closer to their homes, if they are to complete the whole picture frame.
