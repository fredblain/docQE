NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
At the weekend, there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the centre of Newport on an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people in Cardiff before the local town hall came together to hold a so-called counter-summit.
For us, Stephen Fairclough has followed the developments over the weekend and talked to protesters who have travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
