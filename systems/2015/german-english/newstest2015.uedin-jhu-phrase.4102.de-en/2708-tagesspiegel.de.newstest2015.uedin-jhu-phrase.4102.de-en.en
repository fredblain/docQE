Ebola: The West Africa epidemic affected economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned, and international companies are based on distance.
The devastating Ebola outbreak in West Africa puts the economy a heavy blow.
The harvest verrottet in the fields, the mines are left abandoned and orphaned markets - the virus has afflicted the region difficult.
Even some international companies are already at bay.
"The Ebola epidemic is not just a medical crisis but also an economic", the head of the African Development Bank, Donald state situations.
Liberia is hit hardest
"It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," Alhaji Bamogo who sells at the second-largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, says clothing.
In the market who want to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola is only.
Liberia has been hardest hit by the virus, alone here, more than 600 people fell victim to the fever.
Recently, the health authorities declared that the disease has spread to every corner of the country.
In Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, the virus has spread.
Overall, more than 1,500 people have died, thousands more stuck to themselves.
Foreign companies are pulling employees
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries put their operating companies.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are repatriating their employees, several international airlines fly to the affected regions.
Even the local traders and farmers respond: Few merchants still leave their homes to buy supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, including the important for the export of cocoa and coffee beans are rotting in the fields.
Farmers dare not to leave the harvest for their homes.
Food are scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert on the economy of West Africa.
For example, the man who normally goes to the market and sells its vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
The population sees the consequences of the epidemic and to feel urgent: Foods are scarce.
On the markets, the stock is dwindling in staple foods such as rice.
At the same time, the region depends heavily on international companies face a reputational damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies across the region generally avoid for a long time, says Philippe Hugon, from the French think tank Iris.
What matters is how far and how long the virus would spread.
If investors could create the impression that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and thus to invest," warns Hugon.
The disease also affects the strained state budgets of the states
The disease also affects the already strained state budgets of the countries concerned.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets are severely strained by the high costs for the health system and by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems in the affected countries, with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are being already in Nigeria, where so far only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta is not affected so far.
But elsewhere, many people already stay at home for fear of infection.
Reservations at hotels, too, are clearly.
