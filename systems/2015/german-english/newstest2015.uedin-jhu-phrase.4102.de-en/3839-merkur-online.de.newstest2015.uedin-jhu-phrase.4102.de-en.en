Persistent concerns from the CDU against the car toll have increasingly forth the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel after sustained resistance from her CDU makes a word for the introduction of a car toll.
"In order to say it very clearly: It is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU's top bodies in Berlin.
In a detailed model Merkel established but not for the moment.
In the black-red government program were "certain parameters."
German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) "have made a proposal, and will now continue to work on that."
The North Rhine-Westphalia CDU, however, insists on saying 'no' to a toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch채uble (CDU) rise to constructively in the deliberations on a bill.

"With the toll of the Minister fails." Dobrindt wants to introduce a toll sticker on all German roads, which is due to launch in 2016.
