Putin demands from Kiev, the inclusion of "state-talks" with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media reports, demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begins with negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow clarified later that Putin had not meant that they are under the control of the separatist regions of eastern Ukraine will be a part of Russia, but that his status needs to be redefined to Ukraine to give the Russian-speaking region, the power to represent their rights and interests.
Putin's call for the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits into his since the beginning of the riots five months ago, apparently persecuted strategy: Aid for the separatists during the adoption of areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to the newly proclaimed region Novo Rossija de facto independence for an alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the state-owned TV station Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the areas held by separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently described the area as "Novo-Rossija collected" or "New Russia," a term that recalls the revolutionary heyday of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those Ukrainian politicians during the campaigns for the elections on 26 Okt. and government groups of civilian communities in the areas held by separatists hope to attack early peace talks "are caught" in their illusions, told Itar-Tass.
"We need to immediately begin detailed discussions," not only technical issues but also on the political organization of society and the state status of the south-eastern Ukraine to protect the interests of the people who live there, he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to the statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas, that their cultural and linguistic rights have been compromised.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions, Peskow said.
We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskow said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but" an internal conflict in Ukraine.
The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman for correcting the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, in contrast to the direct Annektion Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties to annex the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from before the conflict showed a large majority of the remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy, which was raised by Russian diplomats at international forums, would give the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate your own trade agreements and foreign relations, and about the Kremlin's de facto control over an area that connects the Russian territory of Crimea.
The absorbed five months ago in the Black Sea peninsula is also the home port for the bulk of the Russian navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea is also rich in mines, factories and foundries, who make key components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his speech at the inauguration on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislation - after fresh elections - should consider amendments to the constitution that allow greater control will be given to the respective areas of their finances and the status of the languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, which Moscow is accused of arming and incitement.
Putin's recent call on Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing, followed by another invasion by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks across the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov has invaded the eastern Ukraine.
The Russian-backed separatists took over in the coup, according to Ukrainian security official fears is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Nowoasowsk.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations are under way to fortify Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimea.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and asked for urgent action to create a further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that is independent for 23 years.
"We are nearing the point of no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit agreed no concrete action, the leaders called for the drafting of further sanctions against Russia, which Ukraine unspezifizierten escalation in a crisis is to enter into force.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk, after two Russian armored columns and 1,000 soldiers broke into the Donetsk region last week to support the beleaguered separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council report said in Kiev on Saturday.
Probably the first 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped by the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers who had been taken a week ago on Ukrainian territory, Lysenko said on Sunday.
