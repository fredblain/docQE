China refuses to allow Hong Kong the right to elect government, protesters swear vengeance
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 election of Hong Kong's electorate.
This approach probably fired the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while militants initiated the planning and mobilization on this within a few hours after the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress basically allows the Communist leaders did not reject all candidates loyal to Beijing.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," legal expert Emily Lau, leader of the Democratic Party said.
That is not what Beijing had promised.
They have lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the approval of public nominations for the election of Hong Kong's government "would be chaotic."
Since Cuba's control over Hong Kong in 1997, when Britain, the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the people elect their government, in 2017.
The Chinese government on Sunday presented the decision as a democratic breakthrough, because it gives the people of Hong Kong a direct electoral law, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese government maintains the flow through a nomination committee tightly controlled by Beijing.
After a new clause only candidate "with a love for country and love for Hong Kong" should also be permitted.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most effective public protests in Hong Kong have taken place for many years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong, the movement, Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to seal off the financial district unless Beijing allows no genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, were within a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy-Central-supporters in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement has reached a new phase of civil disobedience, and they mounted waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they made no details on this, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement shared with the organisers that the movement "the occupation of the central district, only as a last resort to, an action that is to be held only when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted, and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that all dialogue possibilities have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for days for the announcement of Beijing, and it was on the Sunday before the government building tighter security measures, including police and barricades.
The unrest is aggravated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases the competition for products and services.
In addition, the fear is that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticised the demonstrations by the Occupy Central movement because they are a business - the lifeblood of Hong Kong - is eroding.
"The protests, which they say could cause serious economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long it continues said," legal expert regime Ip, who has long criticized the move.
We don't want to stoke fears that Hong Kong gets out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also reported recently on democracy activists in Hong Kong as a subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral rights on which discussion was attended by people - more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands of people in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations took part in the history of the region.
