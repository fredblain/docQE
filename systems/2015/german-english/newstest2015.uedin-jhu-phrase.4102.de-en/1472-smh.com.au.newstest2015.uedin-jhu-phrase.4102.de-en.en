The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices increased by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, which has been hit by cuts in government spending, where prices rose over the year by only 1.4 percent.
But Lord said that an increase in properties for sale in the spring at the beginning would now be for the next few months, which would subject the market "a real test."
"If you look at the continuing high rate of auction prices, a rapid rate of sales in general and the persistently low interest-rate environment, it is likely that home prices" in the next three months will continue to rise, he said.
