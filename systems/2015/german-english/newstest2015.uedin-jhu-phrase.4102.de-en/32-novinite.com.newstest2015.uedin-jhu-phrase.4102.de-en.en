Bulgarian prison warden protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison employees from across Bulgaria have organised in the capital before the Justiziministerium Sofia a nationwide protest.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands to restore their old working conditions that have been recently changed.
Even higher salaries are on a list of demands that the Interim Justice Minister Hristo Spasov Ivanov should be discussed.
The officials are protesting for a month symbolically against the new working hours and call for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
In spite of the meetings between the union of prison employees and representatives of the Justiziministeriums no agreement has been reached, the Bulgarian national ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations are continuing, the Director-General informed for the implementation of penalties, the BNR Rosen Zhelyazkov.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the trade union of the employees of the Interior Ministry.
