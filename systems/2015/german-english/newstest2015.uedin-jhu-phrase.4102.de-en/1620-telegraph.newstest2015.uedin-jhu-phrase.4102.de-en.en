Lenny Henry: My father never took me by the arm.
Has never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family jamaikanischer immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry, 19, worked in a factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing for a comedy that's Rudy's Rare Records, which is based partly on an imaginary conversation with his father, and from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
We never saw his face, hear his voice: "Hearing on the crash.
Keep your sister in peace.
Beweg you!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up when I was a child, went to the pub with him and talked about things such as the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of cricket.
I never had such a conversation with him.
A large part of my life, he was a serious guy in the corner, reading the newspaper.
Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and even though the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he won, but an insight into how life may have been for him.
It is a little brighter now, but they are dark, quite smoky, deep stygische maze with flames and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father was always in the tub and then you could hear him slowly, as he began to sing, because he was able to wash the foundry.
When I went there, it was clear to me that he had done this for many years to get the food on the table, and my respect for him has been greater.
However, Henry grew up as a child without his parents "love.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
Only when it came to my mother at the end of her life, we started badly, "I love you, I love you, I love you" to say.
By his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love that he had missed as a child.
But with the "I love you" stop?
But on hearing to embrace me!
Papa, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
It is still a French friend, with whom he had been married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to be radical.
So I got this fitness thing and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is tiring.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change is reflected in his elegant, short-trimmed beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he is captured by the theatre.
It's the comedy of errors, and then fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy work life.
He started with only 16 years ago, when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he wrote to imitierte and New Faces on him.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was for a very long time, the only black impersonator/comedian on TV."
He learned in the profession.
I was not only in the eyes of the public at large, but also learn from 1975 to 1985, as I tell jokes and an efficient machine, while I was a television star, and that was really difficult.
Lenny New Faces in 1975,
As his manager, the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show, had a light entertainment program in which people "" anmalten Black, Henry on his comedy about five years.
In my family it was very unpleasant.
Somehow, I wish that it had never happened, but I do not regret that I did it.
It was a strange, awkward position for me, but I worked on big projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "years of award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
The introduction of characters that the British black culture both celebrated and scorned,, Henry worked in the 1980s for an alternative comedy circuit.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984, and in the 1990s, he was known among other things as the chef Gareth Black Lock in the comedy series boss!.
Commercials, documentaries, TV series and film roles were his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought: "What are you doing next, Len because everything feels when you're just about the time or play a little on the spot."
Then, a documentary series for Radio 4, entitled What's So Great About...?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was allergic.
I had never really learned in school about it, and it kept him mostly for the domain of the middle class, whites in tights and a cabbage.
So I had a great fear.
All those we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "you should try it.
It was not a bad thing, if you do not know what are you talking about.
Nimm a few of the words in his mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare.
Henry led 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary, and he was thrilled.
I had the feeling that I could do it.
It was almost as if someone had my head finally right.
"That is the issue, it is a serious thing, take it seriously, learning your text recherchiere a bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and this simply not happened.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly, I was at the National Theatre, and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed you." "
There was a technical error, and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice said to me" you must now bridge 10 minutes while they repair the computer. ""
Instead, the stage director, announced that the show would go on, once the problem is resolved.
I went from the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I am not responsible for this.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, i.e. blowing in your role."
Henry in fences at the Duchess Theatre
To learn the text for fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the tendons.
That was good, so it's like a big sign of the gods who tell me "This is your purpose here." "
He says that, of course, with a thundering voice.
So I stay here.
I really love it.
I love to be in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation of humorous outbursts, while he imitates people again.
I have decided to stand-up comedy, because I think that this kind of instant gratification in a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you are looking for that constantly, so you go in front of a wall.
I am sometimes live at the Apollo when I have fun, but overall, there is not as much as before.
I ask him if he ever returned to a stand-up comedy tour.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps a beginning to form a middle section and the end of a journey - I do not believe that I would ever lose again.
So this is his new incarnation here?
I think.
I am quite an actor.
It's fun.
It always tells a story, and that is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
