Back to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
The congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a bill to establish the organization of trade unions and civil rights.
"Unions are dying just as the middle class jobs," Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, and vice-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said.
That is why I proudly present together with the civil rights icon John Lewis, the employee empowerment law.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination due to the organisation of trade unions, as with other forms of discrimination - and thus stop anti-union-minded forces.
The completion of the national labour law in order to create an opportunity for a discrimination abandoned workers to organize a union representation, in order to sue in a civil court for justice - and in order to receive compensation or penalty payments - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way is to suggest to the understanding of what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill, the link to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks, which the unions were suspended in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country, Americans were encouraged in countries around the world to recognise work rights to extend and respect.
There was a time in which millions of Americans remember, when this country democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association mentioned in the same breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarised autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their trade unions participated in the creation of a new Japan, using a language that explicitly recognized that the rights of workers are guaranteed of association and collective bargaining and action. "
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff pressed the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers must organize and raise its voice in the new government added a clause explicitly testified: "The right to form and to safeguard the health and economic conditions and to improve each and every profession or trade.
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to reduce it is null and void; targeted measures are illegal.
As the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other drafters added a guarantee that everyone has "the right to form trade unions for the protection of his interests or" to join them.
For generations, Americans accept the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advising others how to civilian and democratic societies could form, Americans said that the law must be protected on the establishment of a trade union - and that these unions could then participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies.
After these rights were under attack in America, is it really wise, to lead the American ideal, according to which the working population must have the right to unite and to have a free and open society.
As pastor, Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher. "
Now everyone knows that the labour movement did not restrict the strength of the nation but enlarged it.
By raising the living standards of millions, labour miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack labour forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and that is something we should do.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights and protection against discrimination in the establishment of employee representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that made America great in the past and simply delivering on the promise of democracy.
