The tradition of the school balls in the US is now transferred to the universities, where remaining performances are offered by private plane.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and to offer the UK's first luxury travel service for students today.
In a particularly impressive performance to achieve at the university, the company also provides transportation options such as private jets, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart stated that the service had a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car kutschieren across the country.
Together with our new VIF options we look forward this year to ensure that the students of the university, with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesman said that there were no new bookings, as the service has only just been introduced, but added that "students would book the service over the next few weeks."
The company also announced that despite the tuition fees of Â£9,000 per year, expect a market offer.
Students often differ in their expectations and demands from the students in 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF can be just that.
The National Students Union, however, criticised the service as aloof.
Megan Dunn, vice-presidents of the nus for higher education, said: "This offer seems to be completely separated from the lives of the majority of students.
Many of the students who begin this month with the study, are facing a crisis in the cost of living, because the available funds can be in the form of loans and grants by the soaring bills are the simplest life step before they even think about spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as the arrival at the residence.
