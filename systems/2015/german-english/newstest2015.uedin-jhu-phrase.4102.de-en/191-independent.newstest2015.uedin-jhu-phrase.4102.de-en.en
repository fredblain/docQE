Exclusive extract from Howard Jacob's new novel about love and the letter "J" hochgelobtem.
You zerflossen, one could best describe it, she slowly dissolved like a cardboard box that you have to stand in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, demanding, intense, aloof and perhaps slightly kratzbürstig.
And then the hand shook him.
Kratzbürstig he knew.
He was stachelig, like hedgehogs, yes.
The last victim of this barbed approach was a very nascent affair for which was promising a relief of boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him a certain amount of satisfaction.
Ailinn Solo Mons was a trembling, delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more isolated and hostile than Port Reuben.
It came with an older companion to the south, Kevern held for her aunt, who had inherited a plot in a damp but heavenly valley with the aptly named Paradise Valley.
For several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leck, the bathrooms were spiders, slugs have left their mark on all the windows, and believed that they belong to all of this, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbage heads.
It was like the house out of a children's story, both menacing and seductive, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" on the long list for the Man Booker Prize is 2014.
The shortlist will be announced in the coming week.
Kevern and Ailinn holding had sat on the broken chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon, and both had been playing a spirit absent in the console, which supplied the country with soothing music and besänftigenden news than the sight of her brown legs crossed reminded him of an old song, one long forgotten black entertainer, which his father had listened with closed blinds in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not banned - Nothing was played so well - just not banned.
It has been successful obsolesziert, like the word obsoleszieren.
The general flavour created what decrees and regulations had never managed, and how the people in the book From-dishwasher-to-millionaire-memoirs, cookery books and romantic novels, so she chose the music for the ballads.
In the euphoria of the day began to play an imaginary piano Kevern and a gross-funny serenade Ailinns big feet to eulogise, sing.
Ailinn understood that.
"This was a well-known song of a jazz pianist called Fats 1971," he told her, and automatically put two fingers to his lips.
It had always done his father to stop the letter J, before he came out of his mouth.
It began as a game between him and his father, when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, as he was told.
When you start a word with a J, without putting two fingers on your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It was not a very fun game back then, and it was not very funny.
He knew what was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz was, even though he was not directly prohibited, not played.
The improvisation was not more modern.
There was only room for one "if" in life.
The people wanted to be at the beginning of a melody, where it would end.
Similarly, the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And Jazz was musically ausgedrückter mind.
Although he was 10 years old, without having heard about Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz by the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he had to explain Ailinn, Fats Waller was black.
At their age, they probably could not remember a time when Popsänger were not black.
Again, no laws or restrictions.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of the group talent - grateful like fate spared.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were by temperament and conformation for entertainment and sports, so she sang and ran.
People who were originally from the Indian subcontinent, were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were served with the task of ensuring that no family was left without a working telephone service.
What was left of the Polish community, took care of the sewage system; what was left of the Greeks smashed plate.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levant, whose grandparents left the country quickly than WHAT GESCHEHEN ship IF IT GESCHEHEN ship geschah- for fear of being accused of Feuerschürens, fearing that the flames would consume them next - had Labneh- and shisha-pipe-restaurants opened, consider themselves and were depressed by inaction.
Each according to his abilities.
Because she had heard only ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the offensive words that she had just vorgesungen Kevern, could ever be synchronized.
Music is an expression of love.
"These are not really" offensive, Kevern said.
Except, perhaps, for people whose feet are too big.
My father has never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him a false sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the giant cabbage-like leaves.
Ailinn still not understood.
Why did your father would love such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, however, hesitated to show again in its present two fingers to their lips.
You already thought that it was a little odd.
"It was funny," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and impeded Keverns view.
There was nothing else in the whole world to see as their ungekämmtes pitch black hair.
There was nothing that he wanted to see otherwise.
"If you say" it, they believe, without conviction.
But that still does not explain why you vorsingst it myself.
She seemed genuinely concerned.
My feet are too big?
He looked again.
Your feet are not so directly.
Perhaps your ankles, a little bit...
And you say that you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
But hate?
Of course, I do not hate you.
This is just a silly song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was still too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you think" me, he tried it instead.
I am a bit perverse.
That was not right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he was often in trouble because he did not like his father about the soothing charm needed to bezähmen the inherent cruelty in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he, Kevern, wanted to be.
Despite his kind eyes.
Ailinn Solo Mons was red and rose from her deck chair, threw the console and buried the wine they were drinking.
Elder flowers, wine, drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble, like palm fronds in the storm.
"And your thick head is exactly the reason why I am drawn to office," you feel, she said.
Except that I am not even that.
She was tired of him, both because of the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words and the fear that was in their eyes when they rebelled against him.
They dachte, that he would beat them?
She had not told him about the life on the cold northern archipelago, where she was raised, but he had no doubt that it was essentially just like here.
The same vast and icy ocean broke here and there on the shore.
The same confused men with even thicker skin and verdrießlicher after THIS WAS GESCHEHEN ship as it were their ancestors as smugglers and wreckers, moved from pub to pub, always willing to raise a hand against a woman who refused them or derided.
Thick head?
It would have shown her a big fist, if not farewells.
She only kissing - kissing the most-used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the vacuous love ballads from the console - they were only kissing and then beat.
After Keverns believes this was an unnecessary refinement, because kissing was itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solo Mons gave him to go through her body.
He arose from the deck chair, like an old man.
They also felt bleiern, but the impact of his grief surprised them.
That was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him as he departed, as from a room on the upper floor of their companion was watching him - a man, complaining of what he himself had created.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him, and men in general, although some have raised their hands against it.
A man turned away from her, his back bent, embarrassed, defeated without fighting spirit - why this was a sight that she seemed to know when she could not remember a single occasion on which she had seen something in the present day?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solo Mons looked at their feet.
Several years before the events just told working ESME Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, non-legislative oversight body for the public mood, with a short talk about the continued violence at low and intermediate level in exactly the areas where the reduction, if not elimination, most likely to be expected, given the money and energy into eradicating such violence had been invested.
"A lot has been done, and a lot still needs to be done," she wrote, "in order to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that a thousand wars waged and won most of them, especially in the remote areas and valleys of the country in which the sweet breath of human kindness has been historically felt despite the towering spires of the hedges.
But, it turns out, some properties of erroneous belief.
The higher the tower, it seems, the lower the passion he arouses.
The people crying when listening to sentimentaler ballads, enthralled by stories about overcome difficulties and claims to believe strongly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only the former rudeness maintains the rural communities as well as our urban fabric in the hand, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and devious argument looks at home, in the workplace, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration, her mentor meant when he had read the entire report.
I suggest that you read more novels.
ESME Nussbaum lowered its head.
I also have to ask: You are an atheist?
"I believe that I have to say no," ESME Nussbaum replied.
Are you lesbian?
Again, ESME invoked their right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feminist?.
Again silence.
"I don't ask that," Luther Rabinowitz said finally, "because I would be against atheism, Lesbentum or feminism.
This here is a prejudice-free workplace.
We serve a prejudice-free society.
But certain types of hyper-sensitivity that are perfectly acceptable and commendable, can occasionally results, as you have presented it to distort.
You yourself seem to have prejudices against the church, and those things you describe as "sneaky" and "raw" could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of a natural strength and vitality.
If you continue to beat down on this, WHAT IS GESCHEHEN IF IT IS GESCHEHEN, as if it, if it would have happened would have happened yesterday means to deprive the country of its essential vitality.
For ESME Nussbaum felt, while Rabinowitz said.
Behind his head, repeated an LED sticker in flamingo pink, the advice, the country in the last quarter-century Ofnow or longer.
You Lächeln to their neighbours, you value your partner, you hear ballads go, musicals, you use your phone, you talk, you say that you listen, you agree that you apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the song is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand completely what you want, ESME Nussbaum replied," with a quiet voice when she was sure that her boss had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing other than that we are not yet healed as effective as we are deluding ourselves.
My concern is that we may find ourselves without warning about how we repeat the mistakes in THIS WHAT IS GESCHEHEN IF IT IS GESCHEHEN.
This time, however, it is not the other where we miss our anger and our mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with the hands.
In order to indicate a patience.
"You go too far," he said, "if you describe acts as a" mistake "that perhaps our grandparents or not.
You also go too far when you say that they had their "anger" and their "suspicion" to "other" left out.
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position, that we talk about the understanding of the past, such as in the protection of the present, not "us" and "other."
There was no "us" and there were no "other."
It was a time of disorder, which is all we know.
"From the daring, if we are honest with ourselves," ESME smash, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I accuse no one.
Whether it was done badly or well, what is done is done.
That was then.
Nothing more needs to be said - and here we agree.
And like any blame must be assigned, so no debt must be repaid if such repayment would be appropriate, and if there was a way to wipe them out.
But what about the past, if we do not learn from it -
The past is that we forget about them.
If I may say something about this
Luther Rabinowitz did not coincide his pyramid.
"I will consider their report, he said," and dismissed them.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcycle driver who described how passers-by, in a sort of "brutal rage" on the footpath.
There are coincidences.
