Under this view Ruh prevails
A powerful tribe we showed in our puzzle task of the summer series "My piece from the Rhöner happiness" last Friday.
Several of these giant trees still exist in the county, the specimen is "Geißruheiche" above under white.
A bumpy one footpath leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak tree.
It is past fields, basalt outcroppings and basalt stone seas.
A bit below the quarry from Bauer, a mile north of the road to Weisbach, as it stands.
Vital is the natural monument, it extends over the other trees in the area and remembers with a circumference of more than eight meters to an American sequoia.
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that there is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, there were only hints of the name of origin.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider asked the extra Bischofsheimer archive consulted and elderly people from among white, to learn what it did with the Geißruheiche Bewandtnis.
The result of his research was the rather sober explanation for the name.
So the goat herders are up about 80 years ago drove their animals under white straight from the laboriously cleared of stones and liberated meadows.
At the foot of the tree, the exhausted animal keepers from the rise should have rested.
In the meantime, the area has won back its significance, because goats graze in the meadows, in fact.
The area has also been declared to the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve, Schneider has found.
Upon entering the stone collections, one should be careful, however, because the sun heated basalt for Cross otters is a popular haunt.
A hiking trail leads from under white straight to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Other routes are signposted to climb the high mountains and invite to a long hike.
Where is the water castle?
A water castle, looking at our next task, however, is to be found in the amount.
The reflection in the ditch already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historic buildings in the county, which could fit the building face.
Where is our "piece from the Rhöner happiness"?
