Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
Amazon has just confirmed that information was reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a multitude of other things - buys the video streaming service for $1.04 billion Twitch (US $970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one had expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely assumed that the company would buy YouTube.
Three months ago, it looked as if the sale of Twitch on Google's video service is determined for a cool billion, and cooperation, of course, also appeared.
Twitch, which only three years ago as Justin.tv, was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it was rapidly becoming a platform for players who wanted their bravura pieces published in games, a "YouTube for live games," says an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play," a genre in which the (mainly) older-better games give a veneer of science, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is simply the case that YouTube is often referred to, if you want to describe Twitch, included the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch, a bit bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal did not materialise with YouTube, since the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
Everything we know about it at the moment, this statement by Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "We opted for Amazon, because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us to go faster."
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who declare that they would rather drive than watching sport, it is hard to understand the attraction that assumes to watch others playing rather than even the control console.
It is one thing to see a friend at 3 a.m. on the shoulder while she sneaks through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch a nutcase, he was shot 20 times in a row in Call of Duty in the head.
All of these games you could see now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, can watch without their own control over the prospect of facing a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast runs, the Roger Bannisters undergo in our electronic age whole games in record time, entertaining.
But unless a game or humour virtuoso, is his Twitch-channel probably not so very interesting.
But what sceptics like me already know about?
Twitch called from 55 million different visitors a month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.
And how exactly Amazon wants to make money from it?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is integrated so elegantly in Amazon Instant Video, YouTube Twitch can easily swallow.
But has Twitch something any company would like: Thousands of young men, who are being courted by advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming" and the media shows no signs of contraction, or even - Schluck - as a spectator sport.
