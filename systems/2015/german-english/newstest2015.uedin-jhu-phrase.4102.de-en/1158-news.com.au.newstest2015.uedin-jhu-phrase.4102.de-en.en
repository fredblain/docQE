Angelina Jolie and her brother, James made a video tribute to her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1100 Australians, when ovarian cancer was diagnosed in 2005, and found that only 25 percent of five years after diagnosis were still alive.
Research Director Susan Jordan from QIMR Mountain Hofer Medical Research Institute, said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study by 20% higher than for those in urban areas.

For older women and those whose cancer was already advanced further at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate is the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study by 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study examined why women living outside the city, more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggests a delayed diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly to be found in larger towns," she said.
Despite the improvement of medical services to counter the distances a bit, she suggested, as a possible remedy, a reinforcement of the service by doctors flown to give professionals the opportunity to provide women denser at the place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside of their region.
Dr Jordan said that the study found regardless of geographic status of a poor long-term survival rate for women with ovarian cancer and stressed the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
