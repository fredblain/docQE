Perry of Texas says that derogatory tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday included a disparaging remark about Democratic county prosecutor, which is at the heart of a criminal charge against him for misuse of authority.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced with another of Perry's account of the previous abstritt.
Just a tweet was sent from my account, which was not authorised by me.
"I do not approve of the tweet and have deleted" for him, it was said in the message.
Employees of Perry did not immediately responded to requests for comment.
Although the tweets of Perry's official account, it was not clear who actually uses the feed.
In an earlier tweet an unfavourable image of the district prosecutor of Travis County, Rosemary Clay, who was sentenced in April 2013 due to drink-driving.
Perry vetoed the funding of her office when she refused to step down, which could result in a charge against Perry - the potential 2016 presidential candidate - before a grand jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweets reads: "I'm not always drunk with the triple allowable alcohol... but when I do I accuse, Governor Perry, if he ausplaudert it."
I am the betrunkenste Democrat in Texas.
Clay's office was not entrusted with the leadership of the investigation of the grand jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, the special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty to and called the indictment a political ploy.
Its outstanding team of legal assistance requested by the judge entrusted with the case, rejecting the charges and argued that the law, which for the longest-serving governor in the history of the state of Texas, is vague in its wording.
Perry stopped $7.5 million in state funds to the state's Public Integrity Unit, which is based in Travis County and in cases of public corruption in Texas - identified as a clay hill refused to resign.
This veto of a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official account is updated frequently - and sometimes famous.
After the rallies in Iowa during his presidential candidacy had finished in fifth place in 2012, Perry referred to speculation that he will stop when he posted a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we are coming!"
