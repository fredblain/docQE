4 tips for better Unterwasserfotos and videos
If you like photos or videos to make under water, there are a range of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot position, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 Action-Cam or a GoPro Hero3 + Silver as the edition, both for about 300 $.
I have these photos at a family gathering with several cameras, all at a cost of under $350, are available.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the Batteriefach and other subjects have been closed down.
You can also put your camera on the photos or videos that you want to take.
Some cameras and HD camcorders feature Szenen- and Aufnahmemodi, with which the exposure time for the d√§mmrigen Unterwasserbedingungen www.o-atlas.de..
And before you jump in, check, in which up to a depth of your equipment is operational.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60.
Are you looking for in our accredited to digital cameras and the ratings for conventional and waterproof models.
Do you make Machines - because many do not work.
Point-and-Shoot-Kameras have a LCD, with which you can compose Action-Cams images, usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD display, it is difficult to see this under water, and the right screen size is a matter of chance.
You make so many shots.
If your camera has a Reihenmodus, with a series of shots with slightly modified exposure settings, please use it.
Will you stay close to the surface.
The light will be dramatically worse, the further you are removed from the surface.
If possible stay so close to the surface, if you are taking pictures in a swimming pool, a lake or the sea.
As a result, you can also get more colour in your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Are you close to the objects.
The country is also a good advice, but it is under water all the more important because of the bad conditions.
It's particularly important if you work with a Action-Cam: these devices often have a fixed Weitwinkellinse, which means that you have to be thick to your objects to this, if the whole of the Bildrahmen to fill.
