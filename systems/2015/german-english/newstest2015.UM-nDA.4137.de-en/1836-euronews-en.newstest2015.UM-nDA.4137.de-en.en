Not all children in the Ukraine are in the school.
Schools opened almost anywhere in the Ukraine on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk Arsenij parents brought his daughter to the school.
There, he told waiting journalists that not all the schools had reopened, but that he was determined to resolve the land for future generations to defend:
The Septemberfeiern were not held in every school.
The sky is not anywhere on the Ukraine peacefully.
We need to fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of the Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian Peoples' Front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Pastukhow Aleksan, head teacher of the school in Slawjansk, the Jazenjuks daughter attended, spoke Russian.
We hope that here at long last there is peace, and that the children receive an education, they will be useful in another life.
The first day of the new school year, is traditionally celebrated with the children wear embroidered shirts, balloons in the hands of their teachers and give flowers.
