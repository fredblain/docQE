The Höllenjahrzehnt the survivors of Beslan: ten years since the terrible siege of the school, like the verstrickten children still suffer from it.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were of Chechen militia in a school in Beslan in, taken as hostages.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were in the three-day Μαρκέλλα that we shocked the world, was killed.
We are after Beslan, returned to some of the victims to find the the death at the Greueltat escaped in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school, in the case of the 334 people were killed, including 186 children, warned the hero-ancestors survivors last night in front of a new apocalypse in the Ukraine.
As a fanatical Islamist terrorists children and parents on 1 September 2004, the start of a new year, captured and killed, this seemed like the böseste of evil.
The tragedy of West and East in disgust, and then, surprisingly, turned in action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, after Beslan, we have returned to some of the victims to find the the death at the Greueltat escaped in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome the odds, despite the fact that the memory of this terrorist hell will follow them forever.
Their best hope?
The fact that the war that haunt the Ukraine now - and in the children as they die - is now coming to an end.

It was the Russian religion by Dimitri Beliakow In-Public and famous, only in their underwear as they tried, in the school sports zerschossene zurückzuklettern, after a mine exploded.
Completely confused was looking after her mother Larissa Aida, now 40 years old.
Both were left for dead, but they survived.

My legs were blutüberströmt.
I stood up and climbed back into the pool, to look after my mother.
A soldier brought them to safety.
After a series of operations, they are completely healed, but said yesterday: "three months ago, the pain returned.
I am afraid that I will have to be operated on again.

"I think this is happening, and that is not something you can change.
Once a year I am always in the gym, to me, are still there.
My friends and I, on other days, try to not talk about it.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future Klassenkameradin Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and dreamt of it, and to go to school.
"I do not want to get married until I finish my studies, and my career will start.
A family I think later.
She says that the Belagerung always a part of her is here to stay, despite the fact that the memory of every year is a bit weak.
I am glad that there are many people in the world, to our horror, and we are so grateful for the help we are of people in the UK and all over the place.
When I see the photo of me online, as I do in the school zurückklettere,, I think that many people see it for the first time, our disaster and help to understand that this does not happen again.
The boy, who fled through the bullets, of the opinion that his mother is dead
It was his first day of school (the Russians go with 7 years in the school) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother, Tamara.
He said: "as a Siebenjähriger mum has told me that I should I lie down, if there is an explosion, and hold their hand".
After an explosion, he thought they would die.
She said to him: "run".
Full of fear, she could be dead, he fled and saw on the way a weinendes toddler, it took in the hand, and fled through a bullets.
His father, Vladimir, outside of his son in the arms, said: "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said: "I could not save them".
In fact, was Tamara outside stumbled with Beinverletzungen in hospital and, in turn, on the assumption that her son was killed.
After its reunification, she said: "I wept with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He hurried in and embraced me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now dissolved newspaper the News of the World), from the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie, the title of from's Children's Champion.
"this horror being persecuted you each day, every day, but I wish that I could be with the" stop, "he said yesterday.
But I can say that in my mind will be fainter.
I know that I am right then all my pistols wegwarf.
But now I can play computer games with Schussszenen and this is not a problem for me.
"I have no fear of it, in the gym, but I do not think about myself.
I remember these children, with whom I have played in the yard, and it is not out in the end.
We never say that they were killed or are dead.
We say that they are in the gym.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially on the Spielwarenladen everything, where I could choose what I wanted, and the ride in an open top car.
But now he has to place such as the Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of accident, which he and his friends.
This followed a horror you each day, every day, but I wish I could stop, to remind me.
"I'm so sorry to all those who suffer under the abominations", said Damir, who last week was working as a volunteer in a monastery.
I would so like to help.
One day I want to go to the police and hope that it will be me next year at the Schulungsakademie.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said: "37 children in our neighborhood have been killed, you can see all of this?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there was simply no children, and were able to call around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She remembers vividly her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London, wept when I told our story.
I understood at that time, as people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, and show their support.
It was Cherie Blair and her foundation, grateful for the price, and the possibility, in the autumn of 2004, travel to London.
I wish I could call her even Cherie and simply say that 10 years have passed, but I am still at the meeting me her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and helped me.
I still remember how Damir tortuosum borshch wanting to eat and they all local Russian restaurants anriefen.
I remember, as he played in a beautiful restaurant. Damir shot with his pistol at them and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said: "I always think that this world in these 10 years have not got better.
The war in the Ukraine is now, and people are dying every day, and I believe that many of the children were killed and are being killed.
These are the kind of children as well as our own.
I think that for many of the war a part of the news is that they listen to, if they get bored or busy with something else.
I know just what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop, to feel that.
Nothing has changed, the people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.
He is looking for, for example, not for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the last abominations.
I know that he does not like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class and they go occasionally, in the sports hall and ignite candleligh there.
When he was small, he was among them - I remember, as he sometimes put on the sofa, the face of us away for hours.
Not asleep, his eyes were open.
I remember, as he has all of his weapons and other Militärspielzeuge Kalpavriksha Bergquartett. Damir is now 17, more than I, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that, in a few hours, so I was sure that he was dead and I would never see him again.
As I am after the explosion, and on the legs, I looked around, and saw the hell around me, with herumliegenden body parts everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell impossible could have survived.
"I remember that I shouted at him", Damir, lauf, lauf away ", but I was also so I am not sure that he had heard.
But he has heard it and he ran away.
And this is the life, unlike that of many others, for us.
Georgy Ilyin, 17
The boy, whose terrible picture after the siege of the symbol of the horrors of Beslan was
Comfort: the Beslan-Überlebende Georgy Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, right, a picture of Georgy today
His blutüberströmtes face was of fear, when he ran for his life, while his classmates niederschossen Chechen terrorists.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had sacked him for his first day of school, before they rushed to their older son Vladimir to get to university.
"I left the court for about two minutes, before the terrorists stormed it, and so did my little boy for three terrible days alone", she remembers.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives from us, but they have all been killed.
Only my Georgy managed to survive.
The closer this date, the more difficult it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a single day that goes by when we do not remember this tragedy.
We do not think that it is a long time ago, I believe that it would happen yesterday, some scenes from these days I am addicted to follow.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
To: the image of Georgy (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgy on this day, so you want to go to school, and he said he wanted to hug his teachers.
I knew only that he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the weeping Georgy in San Marino.
Georgy sees the image will not be happy, and it is with us at home, hidden in the guide.
I understand that, but I also think that the people all over the world thanks to this picture, feel our pain.
Georgy said today: "it's important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
The people who investigate such tragedies, again and again and never learn the truth.
And now they investigate the crash of Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what has caused it?
This world is becoming something of.
"I cannot understand how this is possible, because if you ask the people, nobody wants a war, so how is this happening?
Ten years is nothing in such pain.
We need dozens of years to make it a little bit to forget.
It has attacked my health and I feel it still.
About three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it was better.
I went later in the year 2004, and back to school every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were slain.
Therefore I go always in the gym, when the September 1 is approaching.
I want to pay tribute to my my old Kindheitsfreunden.
It is difficult for me to go, in the gym, but I have to do it.
I feel I am not as victims, this story is now a part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I am not sorry.
My life goes on.
I have this year and visit the school completed a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I will be Herzchirurg.
My first choice was an education in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health is not allowed.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgy Fanijew, 20
The boy, who survived, although he was a murderous terrorists caught wellfitted
A miracle: Georgy Fanijew was during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was caught in the sports hall, sitting next to the bomb, which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorists.
It really is a wonder that he was not killed.
"we feel, as if it were yesterday, it would have been", says Georgy, who, as the FSB Geheimdienstoffizier wanted to go to, but this is because of his health damage due to the siege could not do.
It is still with me, it is not something that I have behind me.
I am now older and people say that children can cope easily with terrible experience - and I have to say, that is not true.
"in 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt a bit better after that, actually, but I can not forget.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - the year after that - was the first and only time that I was back in the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return, and please do not ask me to show you where I have sat in this famous image.
Survivor: Georgy Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous, and I wear it every day with me.
My friends know that I do not like to think or talk about it and they never asked me after school.
Physically, it is good for me.
I should be careful with my injured knees, but I can now well under way.
But because of my health, I could not participate in the Geheimdienstakademie of the FSB in St Petersburg, as I wanted to.
I have my documents, as well as the medical and they have said that it is not possible.
My second passion were the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have been there two years behind me.
He is learning the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said: "I knew that my children would never tell from my experience.
Children should know anything about it, of course, and they should not suffer.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: "the pain never leaves me.
He is in my soul, worse, when the anniversary is approaching.
I shall go to the commemoration ceremonies.
I know that Georgy not to go.
It must be for him to be much more violent, because he was there and I do not.
I was waiting for him at home and could not help.
God I am so grateful that it was returned to me in Beslan. here are all of them.
It is in us.
Georgy is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is hard to accept that, if a Unfaires something so bad.
He is a boy, he loves sport, but he could not attend because of his knee.
He was operated on several times, he can run, but not a sport.
I would say that he has overcome a horror to 50%, but it can be overcome and never forget.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors have been killed in the siege, and the only reinforced my pain.
I have lost many people, who I knew well and I were too expensive.
My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart cries for the killed.
I know of families where children were born, but also of widows, who have never married again.
It is difficult to accept that life goes on, even if one does not want this.
I will never forget how, in me, my heart jumped when I saw him in the hospital.
And now, I do not see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country, and I can almost do not believe.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that, in Ukraine, many children have been killed and many more will be killed.
If we just throw all these rebels and could - so far away as only possible.
