Konstantin Weckers and honest memoir
It is actually more philosophical testimony as a biography, what Konstantin alarm clock, singer politsicher, pacifist, activist, an ex-prisoner, in "monk and warriors" on 287 pages of paper.
Not in chronological order, but more for the Gedankenfetzen Gedankenfetzen on June 1, 1947, born in Munich in his memoirs, each chapter taken by a suitable lyrics.
And to be honest it is defensive: from the Onanie as a high school student to the shoplifting and drug use he is no human weakness.
Also, to show tolerance, as he himself learned in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Broad space are also abstract, but all the more important concepts: love, soul, ego, Being in the now, spirituality - all of which he is trying to get to the bottom of the issue, to go on a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how it has shaped not only the music (the Opernliebhaber was between the rock musician), but also his quitting.
The latter has the alarm clock is also fond of Constantine in the ascetic monk, the "subtraction" is, as he says, "by Unnötige weglässt everything".
Between all the hochgeistigen views but there are also short anecdotes to earth: for example, over a beer in a bar frequented by the crazy helpeld or, in the case of a tree face it head-on.
And also because he is honest.
