China denied the right to Hong Kong, demonstrators Regierungswahl swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 election of Hong Kong's electorate.
This approach probably fueled the protests in Hong Kong, announced during the planning and mobilization to activists in the space of a few hours after the announcement was made in and out of the way.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the communist leaders, do not, in principle, all pekingtreuen candidates rejected.
"It's not unexpected, but it makes us angry", said bastions of Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That is not what Beijing had promised.
It has taken advantage of the inhabitants of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that, with an authoritarian regime, we have to do.
In his defence of China's decision, said Li Fei Vizegeneralsekretär of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress that the authorisation of public nominations in elections for Hong Kong's government to "chaotic" would be.
Since 1997, when Britain control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to the people in 2017 to choose the Regierungsvorsitz.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision from the Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, because it is the citizens of Hong Kong, there is a direct vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership by the end of a closely controlled by Beijing Nominierungskomitee firmly in hand.
After a new clause should also only candidates "with love for the country and love Hong Kong" are allowed.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the biggest protests in Hong Kong and publikumswirksamsten took place for many years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the movement Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened the acupuncture, off, if Beijing allows no real universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, in the space of a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy-Central-Anhängern in the rain before the Regierungshauptquartier gathered in Hong Kong.

They were, however, not to the data, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In a Online-Mitteilung diadochs the organizers with the fact that the movement "the occupation of the Zentralbezirks only as a last resort has taken into consideration, an action which is to be held only when all Dialogchancen have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are very sorry to have to say that today, all Dialogchancen options have been exhausted and the occupation of the Zentralbezirks definitely will take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have since the days of the announcement, and we were prepared for Beijing on Sunday in front of the government buildings increased security measures, including police forces and barricades.
The riots will be provided by the feeling of many in Hong Kong, that she slowly lose control over their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increased the competition for products and services.
In addition, there is a growing fear that the values of Hong Kong as democracy and freedom of speech under the growing pressure from Beijing to begin to crumble.
Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central-Bewegung, as they have the operation - the lifeline of Hong Kong - risk.
"the protests, of which they speak, could be a lot of economic harm, depending on how many are involved and how long they last", said Regine bastions of Ip, who criticised the movement for a long time.
We do not want to stoke fears that Hong Kong spiralling out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
