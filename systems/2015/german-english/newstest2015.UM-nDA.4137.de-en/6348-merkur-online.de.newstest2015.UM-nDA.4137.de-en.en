The Burgvereine will soon be back on the same?
The last time there was always between the two Wolfratshauser Aktienclub Burgvereinen.
The boards now think about a possible cooperation.
As an example, for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Aktienclub castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Aktienclub Burgfreunde, lengthen the project in French.
A year ago there was no good and the atmosphere between the Burgverein Burgfreunden Tölz-Wolfratshausen.
So far, the points seemed to be very different, as with the history of the Wolfratshauser Aktienclub castle and a possible reconstruction should be handled.
Now, the two camps to move towards each other: it should soon be talks on a common approach.
This confirmed the Vereinsvorstände Speedflying Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde), on demand of our newspaper.
"I have Mr Piffl mobile-tailored and suggested that we could be together again", reports Sjöberg.
In his view, could all members of both clubs to pull together again in the future.
So are more visible successes.
While the Burgfreunde suddenly to the late Richard Dimbath last to a reconstruction of the castle in the mountain forest, stands for the eye to the "Sjöberg Burgverein Überhäufung and Erlebbarmachung" of the terrain in the foreground.
Herbert, chairman of the second Piffl Burgfreunde, according to their own figures about the phone call was very happy.
Since he is the Burgfreunden Dimbaths death.
A new chairman is expected to be in the middle of September in a general meeting will be found.
Currently, the association is one of about 40 members, according to the access.
"after the death of my friend Richard Dimbath activities out of respect we have the first Neptulon". this "Denkphase" was necessary, "to consider how it could go on like this".
According to the new chairman then Piffl is said to be in the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, could the Burgfreunde also a current mood within their group.
A candidate for the presidency, there is currently not yet, says Piffl.
"but I am confident that someone will find". he himself does not want to stand for election, because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser Aktienclub.
The Tölzer "on the project, but would very much like to work on".
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction, in the eyes of Piffls will probably remain in place in the near future.
It gives Dimbath as a "missionary", always on the restoration of the castle.
Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a chimera.
Through a high level of participation of the population, as well as by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist.
Piffl: "I was at the beginning.
But in the course of the time I am more and more convinced that it makes sense to push ahead with the project ". it is a" modern technology "for the Flößerstadt be created.
Here, there is nothing else.
In addition, the project would be by EU-Zuschüsse, type and potential sponsors, believes Piffl.
"the idea of reconstruction and, personally, I do not simply want to jettison". he hoped that the Burgverein in this point may be something moves.
Their goal, the first to document history, "is important and it is good".
After that, it could be from there.
